Kicked off with a big fight against the walkers and a shocking death of a new face, the latest installment is going to present yet another intense episode when it returns next week. A preview for the new outing sees Carol, Maggie, Carl and more on guard with their weapons as some walkers apparently breach the wall that protects the Alexandrians. Another person is hurt and a girl is desperately looking out of a car's window that is covered with blood. A clip for the same episode, meanwhile, features Gabriel talking to Carl. He says he wants to help and he asks Carl to teach him something which he refused to do before, when he was still at his church. In \"JSS\", when it appears that things are starting to normalize in the settlement, a new problem arises for the Alexandrians. It will air Sunday, October 18 at 9 P.M. on AMC. Comic creator and show exec producer Robert Kirkman teases what to expect from the second episode, \"I'll just say that seeing that size of herd, knowing that horn is drawing their attention definitely sets the stage for what is to come. As intense as you would expect our second episode to be, it is that much more intense and we don't stop there,\" he says. He adds, \"So I would expect a similarly cliffhanger-y moment at the end of episode 2, which will take us into episode 3. Everything you've heard about this being a fast-paced season is definitely going to hold true. People just need to hold on and get ready for a pretty wild ride.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:41:44.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
