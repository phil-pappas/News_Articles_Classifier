First, let's consider the possible vacation of wins or titles earned. According to the IBJ story linked above, the 4-year span during which these alleged activities took place include the 2012 and 2013 seasons, in which the Cardinals reached the Final Four both years and won the national championship in 2013. Thus, if the NCAA can prove that student-athletes who played on those teams received \"improper benefits\", this could be grounds for vacating wins...which in the extreme, could include Louisville's 2013 title. Second, let's consider the possible impact on the relative affluence of the program. Generally speaking, the University of Louisville has been one of the true climbers financially among Division I athletic programs over the last decade. As the school has bounced over the last few decades from the Metro to Conference USA to the Big East and now the ACC, the athletics department has seen its national prominence and athletic wherewithal rise substantially. For the 2013-14 year, their total revenues was $89.4 million...and this will easily eclipse $100 million as a member of a Big 5 conference with larger media deals. Consider the ACC's annual take from ESPN is $280 million, whereas the Big East only receives $42 million annual from FOX.But this scandal, if the allegations are true, reveals a sordid underbelly to college recruiting which is not altogether shocking yet may nevertheless be altogether damning for the university IF (a) parents become leery of sending their kids to Louisville, (b) boosters decide to reduce or stop their gift-giving, and (c) the program's success falters.Naturally, much will depend on the veracity of those involved and eventual truth of what's being initially reported. My sense is that the most die-hard boosters may actually give more support to the program...as we've seen before in past cases where defiant alumni beat their alma mater's drum even louder in the face of scandal (e.g. Penn State saw donations rise shortly after the Sandusky scandal which cost legendary coach Joe Paterno his job).However, and again, only if these allegations are true, is winning the trust back of parents whose kids are considering Louisville basketball.Additionally, if sanctions are forthcoming under a worst-case scenario, one must wonder how this will impact recruiting...and tangentially, Rick Pitino's desire to remain the head coach amidst potential sanctions, which could ultimately impact the team's competitiveness...and in turn, alumni desire to continue to support the program at the same clips they have during the height of Pitino's tenure.Part of the reason the Cardinals program has been among the most profitable is its relatively new basketball arena in downtown Louisville, the KFC Yum! Center which opened in 2010. However, depending upon how the cookie crumbles, corporate demand for luxury suites and sponsorship signage could be negatively impacted.And then there is the perceived culpability of Coach Pitino. Personally, and after watching Pitino's Friday afternoon press conference, I believe - if these allegations are true - that he was truly in the dark and unaware. Yes, I realize Pitino has his own past sex scandal ...which for some might make his credibility herein suspect. But I truly believe he has been blind-sided by this matter.But pleading ignorance or lack of awareness didn't help Jim Boeheim at Syracuse or Larry Brown at SMU in recent academic fraud cases which have/will cost those coaches either wins, games coaches, salary, reputation, or all of the above.Even if Pitino was unaware of wrongdoing, how do you think the university's administration feels today? Especially after bestowing Pitino with a contract extension in June. The 4-year extension is through 2025-26, and it includes $7.5 million in retention bonuses that kick in every three years beginning in 2017. Pitino's salary will increase from $4.448 million for the 2015-16 fiscal year to $5.093 million in 2016-17, and then stay at that new figure through 2026. In all, the 10-year extension is worth $50.93 million in salary.If the worst transpires in the aftermath of these initial reports, this extension might make a potential parting of the ways more legally complicated to say the least.If you're a Louisville Cardinal fan today, you're hoping beyond all hope that sex scandal allegations involving sex parties with recruits are untrue.For if they are true, it is not a stretch to foresee a worst-case scenario which could fleece the program of its last title, numerous wins, portions of their current financial inflows, and reputation.", "external_links": ["http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=4392828", "http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/12432471/ncaa-suspends-jim-boeheim-nine-games-cuts-syracuse-orange-scholarships", "http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13769364/college-sports-bans-smu-mustangs-2016-postseason-suspends-larry-brown-30-percent-team-games", "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/06/09/louisville-extends-rick-pitinos-contract-through-2025-26/28740761/", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8144317/penn-state-nittany-lions-say-donations-second-highest-school-history", "http://www.ibj.com/articles/55155-book-louisville-hired-prostitutes-to-woo-basketball-recruits", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/f9a0ce7232f643dbb92f31bf6ac4c69d/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://uoflcardgame.com/conference-affiliations-come-and-go-but-louisville-always-emerges/27661/"], "published": "2015-10-04T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:49:23.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
