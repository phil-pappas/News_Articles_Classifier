Apparently Simbu came to the sets late and was questioned about his dedication to the project, to which the actor replied that he’s been in the industry since he was a kid, and finds it boring now! Pandiraj then promptly asked Simbu if he has achieved more than someone like Kamal Haasan, since the latter has been acting since the age of five. Simbu then asked the director not to compare him with Kamal because the Ulaganayagan’s much more than an ordinary human being. Ultimately, this incident is believed to have created a rift between Pandiraj and STR, to which the director wrote on Twitter, “Don’t believe in out of context headlines. Simbu ji appreciated Kamal sir in context of comparison. See full video before any conclusion. Today morning only I had discussion with Simbu for audio launch regarding Idhu Namma Aalu. Please don’t spread hatred between us INA audiosoon (sic).” It is a known fact Simbu’s movie INA hasn’t been released for more than two years and there has been a cold war of sorts between the producers and director. The director blames the music composer and vice versa! Similarly, T Rajendar, Simbu’s dad, lashed out at Pandiraj for leaving the movie at stake and has said that the actor was not even paid so far. Naturally, STR is in the middle of yet another controversy again! entertainment Kollywood Pandiraj Pasanga Simbu Also Read Nikhil Advani’s got a lucky couch Nita Ambani and Neha Dhupia spotted at the airport Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi Sinha’s friendly ties Bad guys in a good light?
