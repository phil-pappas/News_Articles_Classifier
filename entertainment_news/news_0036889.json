Marty McFly and Doc Brown came to 21 October, 2015 in the second film in the series - and today is now known among fans as \"Future Day\".\nBob Gale said when he and fellow screenwriter Robert Zemeckis were writing Back To The Future Part II in the late 1980s they did do some research, but accuracy wasn't their main goal.\n\"We wanted to present a future that was fun,\" he explained. \"It's a comedy. We didn't want to do the Blade Runner future. I love Blade Runner but ... that's not the way it works.\n\"It would not be as big of a disorientation as so many movies depict. Some of the things were based on actual trends.\nPepsi Perfect has not gone on sale widely\n\"Flatscreen televisions - that was something we knew was being worked on. The idea that you would do video conferencing from your television, that was something that was sort of being talked about.\n\"Paying for things using your thumbprint. Again, that was something that was very much in its infancy. And we said 'Hey, that makes sense - that is something that people would do'.\nPlay video \"Future Day: Jaws 19 In Cinemas\" Video: Future Day: Jaws 19 In Cinemas \"We didn't really think that we would have flying cars, but it was too great of a fantasy to not show that.\"\nGale was asked how he feels when he sees inventions in real life that were depicted as fantasy in Back To The Future Part II.\n\"We were geniuses!\" he laughed. \"We were visionaries!\"\nWhat about our future? What does Gale think we can expect?\n\"If there was one piece of technology in the film that we could have today ... that would be Mr Fusion,\" he said.\nPlay video \"Doc Brown To Save The Day\" Video: Doc Brown To Save The Day \"If you could just drop your trash into this device and it would power your car, power your house, that would be really neat.\n\"We may have real working hoverboards by 2045. I think there'll be some major breakthroughs in medical technology.\n\"I think the way that we access medical services will be through computers and through touchscreens that will be able to monitor our pulse and vital signs and diagnose us.\"\n:: You can watch Swipe on Sky News on Friday at 9.30pm, Saturday at 2.30pm and Sunday at 8.30pm, or any time on Catch Up or Swipe's YouTube channel .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:22:03.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
