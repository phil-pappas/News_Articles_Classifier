The Springboks narrowly defeated Wales 23-19 in their quarter-final last week, with Fourie du Preez's 75th-minute try proving to be the decisive moment in a hard-fought contest. Meanwhile, The All Blacks were at their imperious best as they swept past the French in Cardiff, winning 62-13 in a dominant display that will see them enter this fixture as favourites to progress to the showpiece match. But as we all know, nothings guaranteed, and New Zealand have a history of under-performing on the biggest stage, so we won't write South Africa off just yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:07:11.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
