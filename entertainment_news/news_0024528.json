So, everything is different from filmmaking to the way they approach humour. Their technical skills are much more advanced than ours,\" says Pearle.\nHowever, when it comes to language, the Double Barrel actress naturally finds it easier working in Mollywood.\n\"But the team in Telugu made sure that I was comfortable by giving me the script in advance and supporting me in every way,\" she gushes. Pearle, who is also known for her biking and dancing skills, is excited to appear as an adventure freak in the movie as the role is similar to her real-life character.\nThe romcom will see her along with Naga Shourya and Malavika Nair. Her next Malayalam movie will be director Rojin Thomas' Jo and the Boy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:33:46.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
