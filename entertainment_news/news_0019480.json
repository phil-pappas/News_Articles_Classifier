In the wake of Aerosmith's recent request that Trump stop playing \"Dream On,\" we look at nine other times in which musicians were not willing to let politicians use their songs.\n1. Scott Walker and Dropkick Murphy's \"Shipping Off to Boston\" \nThe Massachusetts-based band asked Republican presidential hopeful Walker in January to stop using their music after the Wisconsin governor played the track as his entrance music at the Iowa Freedom Summit. \"We literally hate you,\" the band tweeted .\n2. Marco Rubio , and Axwell and Ingrosso's \"Something New\" \nThe Florida Senator was called out by the Swedish musical duo after he used their song without their permission at a kickoff rally.\n3. Mitt Romney and K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\" \nThe rapper complained in 2012 that the then-presidential hopeful did not ask his permission to use the track on the campaign trail. \"If I had been asked, I would certainly not have granted it,\" he added.\n4. Newt Gingrich and Suvivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\" \nIn 2012 the former presidential hopeful settled a lawsuit with Survivor member Frankie Sullivan for the Republican's unauthorized use of the Rocky III song, \"Eye of the Tiger.\"\n5. John McCain and Jackson Browne 's \"Running on Empty\" \nSen. McCain, R-Ariz., was sued by Jackson Browne for the use of his song \"Running on Empty\" in a 2008 television commercial. The parties settled the suit in 2009.\n6. Sarah Palin and Heart's \"Barracuda\" \nHeart members and sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson complained to Palin's camp after the Alaska governor used \"Barracuda\" as the theme for her vice-presidential campaign. \"We have asked the Republican campaign publicly not to use our music. We hope our wishes will be honored,\" the sisters said.\n7. Michelle Bachmann and Tom Petty 's \"American Girl\" \nPetty issued a cease and desist letter in 2011 after Bachmann used \"American Girl\" in her presidential campaign's kickoff event\n8. Ronald Reagan and Bruce Springsteen 's \"Born in the USA\" \nIn 1984 Springsteen responded to a shout out from President Reagan by stating that even though Regan had mentioned his name in a recent speech, he wondered \"what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one.\"\n9. Donald Trump and Neil Young 's \"Rockin' In The Free World\" \nBefore getting in trouble with Aerosmith, Young asked Trump to stop using \"Rockin' In The Free World\" on the campaign trail. The media mogul responded to the request by calling Young a hypocrite. Similarly, American rock band R.E.M. and the songwriter for Karate Kid have complained about Trump's use of their music during the campaign.\n  Band to Romney: Quit using our song, and it doesn't mean what you think it means.
