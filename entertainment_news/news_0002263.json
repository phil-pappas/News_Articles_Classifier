ABC is now giving new life to the classic movie with a half-hour television show. The network announced yesterday that Ron Bass, the movie's original writer, will pen the show's script with Jessica Amento. He's joined by other original makers of the movie including executive producers Jerry Zucker and Janet Zucker, and Mike Menchel.\n According to ​ The Hollywood Reporter​ , the show will act as a sequel, focusing on Julianne Potter (Roberts's role) and her life in New York City with her friend George (played by Rupert Everett). As a quick refresher, the movie's plot revolved around Julianne, a restaurant critic, whose best friend Michael (played by Dermot Mulroney) is getting married weeks before her 28th birthday, the age the two promised in college they'd marry each other if either weren't already taken. Her logical next step is to try to sabotage the wedding and confess her love.\nMore From Cosmopolitan There's no word yet on when the show will air, but one can only hope \"I Say a Little Prayer for You\" will be making a comeback too.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTSBUUpoqRQ", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/my-best-friends-wedding-tv-831998"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:36:31.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
