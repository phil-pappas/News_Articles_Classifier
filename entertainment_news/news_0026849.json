But in Tinney's game, reaching those targets has another purpose: to evade pursuing zombies. Teams that fall behind risk becoming zombies.\nKeith Kantor, owner of Service Foods in Norcross, Ga., has tried the zombies games with his 100 employees, who prepare and deliver flash-frozen meals and other foods to people's homes. A nutritionist, Kantor had long offered wellness programs: access to a dietitian, discounts on healthful food products, free gym memberships and more. About three-quarters of his staff participated.\n\"But when the gaming came in, that other 25 percent all got engaged,\" he said. \"They were more excited about doing exercises and running away from zombies than they were in hearing that over 40 percent of them would likely develop diabetes.\"\nThe website, www.astepaheadchallenge.com/a-step-ahead-zombies/ , explains how the program works: \"With a story that unravels over the course of each of the challenge's six-week episodes, teams will race from safe house to safe house, building up to a climactic rescue attempt. Will everyone make it out together?\"\nTeams have to work together and there are new bonuses each week, which means that every team can be competitive throughout the entire challenge. the website explains.\n Life & Entertainment Health Digital Entertainment Health & Fitness Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://www.astepaheadchallenge.com/a-step-ahead-zombies/"], "published": "2015-10-11T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:31:23.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
