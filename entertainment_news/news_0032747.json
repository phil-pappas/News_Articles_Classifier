Tania Willis reports.   \nThe likes of Meryl Streep and Queen Rania of Jordan were just some of the big names who gathered at the Women in the World summit in London on Thursday. Inspiring females from 17 different countries around the globe took to the stage to share their stories. American actress Meryl Streep voiced her opinion about which issues mattered to her most: (Soundbite) Actress, Meryl Streep, saying (English): \"We have a sex trafficking business that is $90 billion, second only to arms dealing, and it deals mostly in little girls than women. But half of the women in America who are in - half of the people in law school in America are women, more than half in medical school. We're making incursions in business, we're coming up from the bottom, it's just that upper echelon we haven't broken through. And women's issues are men's problems.\" The German defence minister also attended the event - and she acknowledged just how inspiring the summit was: (Soundbite) German Defence Minister Ursula Von Der Leyen, saying (English): \"Well an event like this, we have a chance as women to see how other women made their way. And for me, for example, I see a lot of role models and I take strength with me home just to go on in my work. So you get inspired, you get good examples and it gives you strength to proceed in the way you want to go.\" The event is in its sixth year with the London summit coming to a close on Friday.  //reut.rs/1ZlijhC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:28:39.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
