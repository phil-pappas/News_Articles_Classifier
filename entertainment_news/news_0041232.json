S. Wheelchair Foundation. \n\nThe three clubs decided a year ago to participate in this joint project in order to raise enough funds for a container of wheelchairs to be delivered to the Bahamas, where local Rotary clubs there will coordinate the delivery of the wheelchairs to those who need them, but cannot afford them. This project marked the third time in the past several years that these three clubs have combined their efforts to purchase a container of wheelchairs. \n\nA single wheelchair, through the Wheelchair Foundation, costs $150.00. The three clubs’ donations combined to exceed the goal of one container which will be delivered in the next few months, with additional funds raised going towards a second container scheduled for delivery early next year. \nJack Drury spoke to the crowd and expressed his thanks to the three clubs for their continued support to those in need. He also remarked that Rotary District 6960, which includes all of the Rotary clubs in Southwest Florida, is the “largest Rotary contributor to the Wheelchair Foundation in the Southeastern United States.” Drury also made note that the Wheelchair Foundation, which was organized in the year 2000, recently delivered its one millionth wheelchair. \nSteve Agius, Chairman of the Wheelchair Foundation committee for Rotary District 6960, also addressed the Rotarians at the presentation and congratulated them for this container of wheelchairs which will “dramatically change the lives of not only the 110 recipients of the chairs, but the lives of their families and care givers as well.” He thanked the Rotarians for being such a positive force in the local communities they serve and for their significant global impact through projects like The Wheelchair Foundation as well.
