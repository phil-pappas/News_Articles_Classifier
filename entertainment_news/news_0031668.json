But there's a dramatic, die-cut square carved through its front. This wormhole opens onto a floor plan of Slade House itself — a series of sharp, Escher-like turns leading to a central square, where the words \"A Novel\" invite us inside. In red. \nAll good novels lure us into what Henry James once called the house of fiction, where we surrender ourselves and lose track of time while wending through its narrative passages. Reading is all about desire, and fiction's rooms give us ample space to fantasize selves and worlds entirely unlike our own. \nAll of which can make us vulnerable. When we read, we let down our guard and let ourselves go. And because the house we've entered is haunted, the dreams drawing us in can quickly morph into nightmares. Sometimes, we get so lost we even have a hard time finding our way back out. \nThat's what happens to the characters — think of them as readers — who enter the Slade House located within \"Slade House.\" It's situated in Slough, a burg 20 miles west of London that endured particularly heavy Blitz bombing in October 1940. \nAll of \"Slade House\" unfolds during October — or, to be precise, the last Saturday in successive Octobers at intervals of nine years, beginning in 1979 and culminating in 2015. \nThe first-person narrators entering Slade House during that span suggest or actually are characters from other Mitchell novels. Thirteen-year-old Nathan, for example, is a dead ringer for the similarly aged Jason who narrates \"Black Swan Green\" (2006). Versions of psychiatrist Iris Marinus-Fenby made appearances in both \"The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet\" (2010) and \"The Bone Clocks\" (2014). \nThey enter through a hobbit-size door in the brick wall bordering a narrow, easily missed alley. Once inside, they encounter what a Slade House host refers to as \"set designs for a theater\" of well-played scenes, creating what the visitors want to see. In each of this novel's five acts, those enactments involve some version of our hunger for what the world needs now: love, sweet love. \nThat could mean a Halloween party, in which a lonely and overweight first-year college student is suddenly desired and popular. Or a chance encounter through which a divorced and embittered man finds a sexy companion. Or a cozy breakfast, in which a boy bonds with the father who moved away. \nAre these theatricals make-believe? When did you last attend a dinner party that wasn't? \nBut why are these elaborate spectacles getting staged? And why are the creepy but talented actors mounting them so insistent that the show must go on — even when their initially charmed but increasingly restive audience members get up to leave? \nI won't answer such questions; in any haunted house story, one must discover the special effects and encounter the ghosts oneself. \nI will say that what's often true of this subgenre is again true here with Mitchell: For some readers, it will be too far out. As with prior Mitchell novels, \"Slade House\" includes lacunae in time, transmigration of souls, mind control, wormholes, poltergeists and the equivalent of vampires and zombies. \nBut don't run away quite yet. \nFor here as always, Mitchell combines such genre fiction staples with compelling, fully realized characters. Propulsive narrative drive. An impassioned moral conviction that even his wildest rides are simultaneously stories of the way we live now. And — most important — an accompanying belief that despite the seemingly closed and cruel system we inhabit, there's still always room to make game-changing choices. \nWe read fiction because we believe such choices actually matter. If you haven't yet read Mitchell, choosing this novel just might make a believer of you. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
