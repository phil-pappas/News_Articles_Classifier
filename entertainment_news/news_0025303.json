Amidala often went for a Shakespearean look - a conical-shaped ballgown, or perhaps something with a green velvet hood - but her closet also contained a midriff-baring military uniform, a rather seductive diplomat's dress and a gauzy golden number that wouldn't have been out of place at Woodstock. Her most memorable outfit, though, remains her regal-gown-and-headpiece combo, a wild mix of Japanese geisha, Thai princess and Hindu goddess. Credit goes to hard-working costume designer Trisha Biggar, who worked on all three films in the second \"Star Wars\" trilogy. \nMovies Movies with the most sequels \nIn a universe teeming with aliens, outlaws, robots and wizards, Luke is \"us\" - an avatar of sorts whose shoes we can fill. Played by Mark Hamill, Luke fits the bill perfectly. He's good-looking but not gorgeous, nice but not a pushover, heroic but vulnerable. Age-wise, he hovers somewhere between boy and man, allowing moviegoing children and parents alike to identify with him. The only glitch is that most of us didn't make out with our sister. \n\nWORST HYGIENE: Jabba the Hutt \nOne of Lucas' most enduring creations is this organized-crime figure who rules the planet Tattooine. In another era he might have been played by Sydney Greenstreet (the corpulent Kasper Gutman in \"The Maltese Falcon\") or Peter Ustinov (the unctuous Batiatus in \"Spartacus\"), but here he's a massive alien who resembles a bloated sea cucumber. One of his more grotesque qualities is his slobbery tongue, as Princess Leia found out when she became his unwilling harem girl. \nMovies 10 best superhero movies of all time \nBEST OUTLAW: Han Solo \nThe swaggering space smuggler Han Solo was the role of a lifetime for Harrison Ford, and the actor has spent that lifetime grousing about it. That's too bad, because Han Solo is essentially the secret hero in \"Star Wars\" (he's arguably the character who goes through the biggest personal transformation). Like many characters in the Lucas universe, Han Solo is a throwback to all those classic cinematic loners - from Humphrey Bogart in \"Casablanca\" to William Holden in \"Stalag 17\" - who finally realize that some things are worth sacrificing for. \n\nBEST PARTNER IN CRIME: Lando Calrissian \nWe all have a friend like this one. He's the guy who calls you up, takes you out, gets you in trouble and skips out on the bill - but you love him all the same. That's Lando Calrissian, played with velvety charm by Billy Dee Williams in \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" He welcomes his old friend Han Solo to Cloud City, promptly makes a pass at Leia (she isn't having it), then turns around and sells them out to Darth Vader. Nevertheless, by the end of \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" Han and Lando are a team once more. They don't call Lando \"old smoothie\" for nothing. \n\nCOOLEST TEACHER: Yoda \nThere's a reason kids like this puppet creation from Frank Oz, who provided both the voice and the movements, and designer Stuart Freeborn. Small, cranky and given to eccentric turns of phrase (\"What know you of ready?\"), Yoda is a combination of martial-arts sensei, Army drill sergeant and cafeteria lunch lady. As pupil Luke Skywalker discovered, Yoda has no time for triflers and doesn't want to hear any whining. The reward for putting up with all the harsh criticism, though, is a set of nearly superhuman powers. As the master says: \"Do or do not. There is no try.\" \n\nDUMBEST BIT PART: Dexter Jettster \nFew characters epitomize the creative abyss of the second \"Star Wars\" trilogy better than this reptilian-looking Besalik from \"Episode II: Attack of the Clones.\" The plot called for Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) to glean new information from an old friend, so he visits Dex's Diner, an interplanetary greasy spoon that looks like something you'd see on Sunrise Highway, complete with red-leather banquettes and art-deco chrome. With his stained t-shirt and quasi-Brooklyn accent (by Ron Falk), Dexter Jettster shatters the movie's pretense of being science fiction and reduces it to a '70s sitcom like \"Happy Days\" or \"Alice.\" \n\nBEST LITTLE PEOPLE: Jawas \nNo, not the Ewoks. As most \"Star Wars\" fans would agree, the Ewoks (first seen in 1983's \"Return of the Jedi\") were fuzzy-wuzzy, cutesy-wutesy creations whose sole purpose was to sell millions of plushies at Toys R Us. The Jawas, on the other hand, were scrappy, scroungy, ferocious little dudes - and probably ugly, too, though we never quite see what's under their hoodies. They're resourceful survivors who should never be underestimated - the Pizza Rats of the planet Tattooine. \n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER: Princess Leia \nThis is one damsel who rarely needs rescuing. She's a leader, a soldier, a military strategist and usually the smartest person in any room. Carrie Fisher played Leia with modern-day intelligence and wry humor, which may be why she looked so humiliated by that gold slave-bikini in \"Return of the Jedi.\" Jabba the Hutt forced Leia to wear it, and look what happened to him: She strangled him to death in one of the more physically brutal scenes in the entire franchise. \n\nWORST OVERALL: Jar-Jar Binks \nYou wouldn't think an alien creature could be a racist stereotype, but George Lucas managed to invent one in \"Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\" Though nominally a Gungan, the character of Jar-Jar Binks - entirely computer generated and voiced by Ahmed Best - struck many viewers as an egregious caricature of an African-American. Bug-eyed, bumbling and speaking in a pidgin English that sounded awfully close to \"yes-massa-no-massa,\" Jar-Jar has gone down as a cringe-worthy addition to an otherwise family-friendly franchise. It's worth mentioning that Lucas' animated film \"Strange Magic\" (2015) features a clearly African-American gnome named Sunny (Elijah Kelley) who sings Bob Marley tunes. \n\nBEST OVERALL: Darth Vader \nHe's not the \"best\" in a moral sense, obviously, but Darth Vader is easily George Lucas' most memorable creation. He's the clearest, simplest personification of evil, dressed entirely in black with a swirling cape for added effect. A brilliant strategist, athletic swordsman and down-and-dirty TIE fighter pilot, Darth Vader has no obvious weaknesses, only powers (including the ability to strangle people from a few yards away). The coup de grace is the helmet, a hissing gas-mask hiding what must be a disfigured visage (James Earl Jones provided the sinister, stentorian voice). If Alfred Hitchcock was right that a film is only as good as its villain, then Darth Vader is the reason \"Star Wars\" has earned its place in history. \nComing soon: Newsday's Entertainment newsletter, for the latest on celebs, TV, more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:42.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
