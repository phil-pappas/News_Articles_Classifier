He abhors the federal health law, has offered advice to Republican presidential candidates and has personally supported the GOP's candidates and political action committees in the past. \nSo how did Wynn become host to the first Democratic presidential debate? CNN made the call, reaching out to the resort-casino company's government relations chief. \nWynn says hosting the debate is a point of pride for the company. He expects 250 employees to be in the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:05:18.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
