I think it's not been very different on the film really.\"\nBennett, who has a cameo role in the movie, said he could now only visualize Smith when thinking of the real Shepherd.\n\"... Because it's so long ago now, Miss Shepherd died in 1989, I can only see Maggie's face,\" he said.\n\"I can't see Miss Shepherd anymore.\"\n\"The Queen\" actor Alex Jennings plays Bennett in the film.\n\"The nation loves Alan Bennett. It's a responsibility,\" the British actor said.\n\"The Lady in the Van\" hits UK cinemas on Nov. 13 and is released in the United States in January.\n(Reporting By Helena Williams; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian ; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:20:38.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
