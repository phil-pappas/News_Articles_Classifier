(WASHINGTON) -- When the Twitterverse recently discovered Ballers star John David Washington is, in fact, Denzel Washington's son, it freaked out. It's fair to say a lot of people were surprised to learn that he was the son of the two-time Oscar-winner. Turns out John David wants to do things on his own. \n\"He doesn't ask for anything from me,\" Denzel Washington explained to ABC News . \"He's had a brilliant career as a high school, college and pro football player, now he's well on his way as a young actor.\" \nJohn David, who plays Ricky Jerret on the HBO sports-themed series opposite Dwayne Johnson, is forging his own path. \n\"John David has always been a very talented, young actor, as is his sister Olivia,\" said Denzel Washington. \"Needless to say, my wife and I are proud of all our children. Two of them are in front of the camera, two of them are behind the camera. We are proud of all their success. The world is getting a chance to witness what we've witnessed for a long time [with John David].\" \nDenzel and his wife of 32 years, Pauletta, have four adult children: John David, Olivia, Malcolm and Katia. \nBallers just wrapped up its first season on HBO earlier this year. It was renewed for a second season in July. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
