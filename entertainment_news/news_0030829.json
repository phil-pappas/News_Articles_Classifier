Well, you’re not alone.\nThese celebrities may be fashion icons today but they weren’t always so stylish. While Anne Hathaway couldn’t help but laugh at her painful early 2000s style. Gwyneth Paltrow defends her unforgettable Oscars gown, admitting she probably should have worn a bra.\nHere’s what that stars have to say on their haunting fashion moments, it’s unlikely we will ever seen the Beckhams couple-dressing again.\nDavid Beckham\n“I look back on some stuff and think I can’t believe I actually wore that... I have no regrets, though - I knew at the time it was good! Me and Victoria wore matching black leather outfits once. They were Versace. But that’s one when I look back and am like, ‘What were we thinking?’ We laugh about that one. I remember that it’s really good until you do it as a couple.” - H&M\n1999 ... The Beckhams — back when Victoria cracked a smile — opted for the matching biker look. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nTaylor Swift\n“I started walking red carpets when I was 16. I think since I missed prom so many times, I would wear prom-like dresses. Princessy, pastels… I can’t remember a specific one, I just see them all as a blur.” - twiftdaily\n2007 ... Taylor Swift chose the bridal look at the 41st Annual CMA Awards in Nashville. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nGwyneth Paltrow\n“There were a few issues; I still love the dress itself but I should have worn a bra and I should have just had simple beachy hair and less makeup. Then, it would have worked as I wanted it to – a little bit of punk at the Oscars.” - Goop\n2002 ... Gwyneth Paltrow was out to shock at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nKim Kardashian\n“Back in the day, I thought I had the best style ... I look back at outfits and I’m mortified. I remember one day, [West] brought me Carine Roitfeld’s book and was like, ‘You should be studying this book, this is the fashion bible.’ I was like, ‘Who’s Carine?’ I knew nothing, and he said, ‘Watch, one day she’s going to style you.” - CNN Style\n2007 ... Hang on, is that really Kim Kardashian? Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nJennifer Aniston\nI don’t even know what [I’m wearing], except that it’s like a doily around my chest. I just love how young and whimsical it is. Couldn’t really do that today. Well, I mean, I could. I just don’t know if I would.” - Allure Magazine\n2002 ... Jennifer Aniston, with Liv Tyler, flashes the flesh. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nJessica Alba\n“I used to listen to stylists and make-up artists and hairdressers that I didn’t know that well, and they would just doll me up how they wanted to and I would look crazy. Basically anything before I was 24, I looked crazy, just wrong. There are lots of photos of me out there looking like a hot mess!” - HELLO! Fashion Monthly\n2004 ... it took a while for Jessica Alba to get her own style groove. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nJustin Timberlake\n“God, I feel I’ve gone to therapy just to erase some of them. The cornrows I wore with ’N Sync. That was pretty bad.”\n2000 ... Justin Timberlake just couldn’t resist rocking the cornrows. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\n“Britney and I wore matching denim outfits [to the 2001 American Music Awards]. Yeah, another bad choice. I’d probably pay good money to get some of those pictures off the internet.” Justin Timberlake - Playboy\n2001 ... Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake in their infamous triple denim do-ups. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nAnne Hathaway\n“#tbt [throwback] to the #EllaEnchanted premiere when I got it so, so right (and yes, a stylist who shall not be named helped me with this look #truth).” - Instagram\n2004 ... My, how Anne Hathaway’s style has evolved over the years. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nJesinta Campbell\n“I think I regret every hair choice, make up choice and fashion choice I made in 2010 as Miss Universe Australia. You just may as well block that part out of my life and just pretend it never happened.”\n2010 ... Jesinta Campbell has admitted to cringing when she looks back on her Miss Universe days. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\n“The whole thing was just so tacky, and the hair extensions, that’s why my hair’s short now because it’s still recovering from how many extensions I had in during my reign.” - The Daily Telegraph\nSelena Gomez\n“I wore a shirt that said ‘Hotter than’ something, and a belt with these weird net-y tights and boots, and like, a sock—it looked horrendous and then I put a blue streak in my hair. And I remember, I looked in the mirror and I was like—’I feel so cool.’ And I mean, that’s awesome that I felt so good. But I cringe looking at it now.” Selena Gomez\n2007 ... Selena Gomez knows those net tights were a bad idea. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\nNicole Richie\n“I don’t know how old I was, but I was definitely going through a pop star phase. This must’ve been during my ‘I love Britney and Christina’ days. I think I was just really into being like sassy. There’s never a moment where you’re gonna look back at yourself and not, at some point, say, ‘What was I thinking?’ As much as I would never wear this outfit now, fashion and how you express yourself is just in the moment.”\n2003 ... Nicole Richie — in her Britney phase — is virtually unrecognisable. Picture: Getty Source: Supplied\n“At that time, I was really feeling Britney and Christina, and that was who I was. However you wanna do it right then, that’s how you have to do it — not worry about in 10 years if you’re gonna look back and be totally embarrassed, because you’re always gonna be embarrassed. I’m mortified when I see pictures of my dad in the ‘70s with rhinestone bell-bottoms and an Afro. Horrible. But, it is what it is.” - Refinery 29\n Stars cringe over fashion blunders", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082428-25a739d8-68a4-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082298-3fba295a-68a1-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/081231-a7f26d50-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082200-a389d88e-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082046-a59ab2ec-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/081449-9ccc59c6-689f-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/celebrities-dish-on-regrettable-fashionable-moments-that-will-haunt-them-forever/story-fnet01u7-1227554085484", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/084045-3a7e4a98-68a1-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/084140-a6dbd258-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082455-9ded420c-689f-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/081341-a25a930e-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/084223-a46e2a16-6899-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227554/082338-3cfeb726-68a1-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:12:53.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
