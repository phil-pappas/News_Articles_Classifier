There's Elvis on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1956. There's the Beatles arriving at Kennedy Airport in 1964. And there's the amazing day, Oct. 27, 1975 — 40 years ago Tuesday – when Bruce Springsteen appeared simultaneously on the cover of both of the nation's top news magazines, Time and Newsweek. \nAmazing, not least, for the members of Springsteen's E Street Band — who found themselves overnight in the world's hottest rock franchise. \n\"There aren't superlatives you can utilize to tell you what kind of feeling,\" recalls drummer Max Weinberg, who had joined the E Street Band only a year earlier. \"We were young kids, we were in our 20s, it was no secret that [Springsteen's] first two records hadn't really sold. To see that coverage was very exciting.\" \nIt may also be the last time in rock history that a single performer galvanized an entire culture. \nThere would continue to be rock and pop superstars – Prince, Kurt Cobain, Lady Gaga – but their star shine would be diffused, broken up over an increasingly niche-oriented music landscape. \nLots of Americans didn't know who Kurt Cobain was until the day his death was announced: April 5, 1994. But after Oct. 27, 1975, everybody knew who Bruce Springsteen was. \n\"The Bruce covers were unique,\" says Robert Santelli, executive director of the Grammy Museum and the author of \"Greetings From E Street: The Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\" (2006). \n\"There had been other pop acts on the cover of Time and Newsweek, but simultaneously?\" Santelli says. \nThere is an inside story here, he says — harking back to the days when journalism, like the music industry, was a more robust institution. \nCultural impact \nTime and Newsweek were in neck-and-neck competition for readers, and neither one wanted to miss the Bruce bandwagon – moving at breakneck pace ever since \"Born to Run,\" released Aug. 25, 1975, and hugely hyped by Columbia Records, began climbing the Billboard charts, reaching No. 3 by the weeks of Oct. 11 and 18. \nBut rock aficionados are one thing, middle America another. \n\"Neither news magazine wanted to be out-scooped by the other,\" Santelli says. \"The buzz on 'Born to Run' was so powerful, the record had such cultural impact, that both news magazines went out on a limb, putting this relatively unknown pop person on the cover. It was risky. Who knew Bruce Springsteen at that time?\" \nSome people did, of course. For several years Springsteen had been the darling of a coterie of critics, especially in New York and Boston (\"I saw rock-and-roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen\" – Jon Landau), despite the lackluster sales of his first two albums, \"Greetings From Asbury Park\" and \"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle,\" both released in 1973. \nAnd there had long been a fraternity of diehard Springsteen fans – in New Jersey especially – who had been seeing Bruce in small clubs since the late 1960s and insisting to anyone who would listen that Bruce was the second coming of Dylan, Elvis and Mahatma Gandhi. \nFor many true believers, the week when the rest of America suddenly learned of their hero was a sublime told-you-so moment. Added to which was a huge dollop of Jersey pride. \n\"There was a tremendous sense of ownership,\" recalls Eileen Chapman, who lived in Asbury Park at the time (she's now the manager of the Bruce Springsteen Special Collection for Monmouth University). \n\"All of Bruce's fans and friends were running around showing each other the magazine covers,\" Chapman remembers. \"Everybody was very proud of what Bruce had accomplished.\" \nSo who was this Bruce Springsteen that the folks in the dentist's office in Dubuque, and the magazine-browsers in the supermarket lines in Topeka, read about in 1975? © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:27:05.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
