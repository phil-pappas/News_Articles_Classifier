The music is full of homesickness and longing, with a revised final coda written as a lament.\nYo-Yo Ma made the concerto his own emotional journey, playing at times with a deceptive sense of abandon that, in reality, was disciplined, openhearted expression.\nHe poured everything he had into the piece, as if determined to give San Antonio his best Dvorák concerto ever. His supreme confidence spread throughout the orchestra, which met him with equal eloquence, such as French horn player Jeff Garza in the first movement’s key solo passage, and flutist Martha Long in her second-movement duet with Yo-Yo Ma.\nTime seemed to stand still in the moving adagio, Dvorák’s tribute to a lost love.\nYo-Yo Ma’s encore was an example of his humbleness. He sat among the orchestra’s seven cello players for a lovely performance of Heitor Villa-Lobos’ Bachianas brasileiras No. 5. The cellists mainly provided a pizzicato backdrop to the famous melody played by Yo-Yo Ma.\nThe concert’s highlight before the Dvorák was a sharp performance of Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, a trove of soaring melodies that alternate between muscular, testosterone-driven themes and tender, wistful passages. The smooth transitions helped create a kind of male-female interplay, or dance. The piece begs for high degrees of orchestral talent. The symphony delivered with insightful phrasing and coloration under the baton of Music Director Sebastian Lang-Lessing. Harvey Pittel delivered the famous saxophone solo.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/04/8794398/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/44/7473436/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/44/7473436/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/70/8789555/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/43/35/6436727/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/23/42/6895787/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/70/8789555/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/47/35/7763822/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/23/42/6895787/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/30/43/35/6436727/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/47/35/7763822/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/43/04/8794398/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:08:49.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
