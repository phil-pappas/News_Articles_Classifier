If he wins, it sounds like he isn't ready to stop there. Arum told ESPN that if Pacquiao \"is serious about wanting to be president, these six years in the senate would be like an audition and for him to show his people that he really is a serious politician.\"\nAccording to Arum, Manny Pacquiao's last opponent isn't set, but the final fight is likely to take place in Vegas on April 9 at the newly-built Las Vegas Arena.\nThe list of those under consideration for Pac-Man's final opponent may be topped by junior-lightweight titlist Terence Crawford, a Nebraska native and contender for boxing's current pound-for-pound best fighter, who delivered an impressive 10th round knockout of Dierry Jean on Saturday night .\nArum told ESPN that Crawford is a leading candidate to face Pacquiao, adding that the two other possibilities are British welterweight star Amir Khan, and, in the least interesting match-up, a third fight against welterweight titleholder Timothy Bradley Jr., who has split two bouts with Pacquiao. (Although Pacquiao's laughable decision loss to Bradley was such a robbery by the judges that almost no one credits Bradley with the win.)\nIt would be fascinating to see a boxing legend like Pacquiao ascend to leading a nation of over 100 million. We'd be up for a Putin-Pacquiao sparring matchâ€”if it comes to that, and Vladimir is willing.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/13964233/manny-pacquiao-retire-april-fight-bob-arum-says", "http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/13965220/terence-crawford-defeats-dierry-jean-tko-10th-round", "http://www.toprank.com/"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:40:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
