But crucially how did TFI 2.0, the return of the iconic 90s show, go down with those watching on Twitter? \nWell… \n1. People were wondering what enjoying the show said about their age. I'm not sure if this is a sign of age or not, but I'm absolutely loving TFI Friday \n— Joanna Wake (@jomusiclife) October 16, 2015 \nY’what? In case you’ve been living under a rock you’ll probably know that TFI Friday is not a new show. Au contraire, it was first aired with Chris Evans as the host in the 1990s and became well known for running over time and swearing before the watershed. You can’t be behaving like that these days. \n2. People were contemplating how their life had changed between then and now. Watching TFI Friday is weirding me out. I feel like I'm stuck in a crazy time loop; instead of getting ready to go out I'm sat at home & old \n— Ted (@GravitySmacked) October 16, 2015 \n3. And wondering if there was some sort of Marty McFly action going on. I appear to be watching TFI Friday. Take That are on it. It's like I've traveled back in time. \n— John Mulley (@JohnMulley) October 16, 2015 \n4. People were agreeing that having the show on at 8pm made it a bit, well, tame? I literally think #TFIFriday is too early. It has to be on at 10pm. It doesn't work in this slot. \n— Scott Bryan (@scottygb) October 16, 2015 \n5. There was a huge shout out to Chris Evans for featuring an unsigned act. #TFIFriday #tfi I love Sound of the Sirens … they need signing. \nAnd this is the unsigned act, thanking people for the support. Ahh thanks. The song is called Together Alone and is available form our website http://t.co/72Aim1UWXR https://t.co/dAw4lJEChh \n— Sound of The Sirens (@soundothesirens) October 16, 2015 \n6. Take That were tasked with breaking the internet. Or rather starting a craze for trios to try an exercise in balancing. \n— ciara (@ciaaraa___) October 16, 2015 \nIf you can’t quite work out what’s going on here, Mark, Gary and Howard sat down on three chairs arranged so that when they laid backwards they rested on each other. Then the chairs were taken away and they remained balanced. Only surpassed by… \n7.
