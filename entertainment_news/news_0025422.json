Less than a month later, Stamos checked himself into rehab . \nAs a first-time offender, Stamos, 51, will likely get probation in the case; however, the charge carries a maximum jail sentence of six months. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:25:24.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
