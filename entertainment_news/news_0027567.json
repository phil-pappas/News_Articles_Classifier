Justin Kurzel takes a blood and guts soaked approach to the tale, slicing and dicing the dialogue - some of which is hard to make out at times - as he goes, and adding elements to the story. Purists might be offended, but Cotillard is haunting as Lady M, Fassbender was born to play the Thane of Cawdor, and the film makes magnificent use of the Skye landscape.\nSeven Songs for a Long Life (N/C 12+) Four stars\nDir: Amy Hardie Runtime: 82 minutes\nAMY Hardie’s film about the Strathcarron Hospice in Denny, Stirlingshire, is a remarkable, and hugely dignified, piece in keeping with the place and the patients who spend the last of their time there. Through clever use of song, day care patients and staff are encouraged to open up about their lives, from struggling to get by on benefits to planning for death. There is a lot that is heartbreaking here, but there is much love and more than a few laughs besides.\nWorld premiere, Macrobert Arts Centre, Stirling, October 2; Bo’ness Hippodrome, October 3-8 (not 7); Dominion, Edinburgh, October 6; Glasgow Film Theatre, October 7; Eden Court, Inverness, October 10\nThe Who: Live in Hyde Park (15) Four stars\nShare article Dirs: Chris Rule, Brett Turnball Runtime: 119 minutes\nIN June this year The Who got together in Hyde Park, London, for a gig celebrating the band’s 50th birthday. It was an intimate little bash involving some 65,000 people. Heaven knows how those at the back saw anything. But now you can have the best seat in the house to hear Daltrey and Townshend stand and deliver their hits. Between the songs there is wit and wisdom from the likes of Iggy Pop and Johnny Marr.
