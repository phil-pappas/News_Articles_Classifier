The Twitter account links to a fictitious Fortune magazine profile of LexCorp, which reveals Eisenberg's character as the son of Lex Luthor Sr.Fortune describes Lex as a \"31-year-old wunderkind\" hailed with pulling off the \"superhuman feat\" of modernising his father's company LexCorp.\"Dad named the company after himself ten years before I made my unexpected entrance into his life,\" the fictional article quotes Lex Jr as saying.\"But investors seemed to respond to the idea of an adoring father building a legacy for his precious son. He used that to his advantage. It was a good shtick and, whatever else he was, he was a good businessman.\"If that origin isn't curious enough, a tweet from the Lex Luthor Twitter account reads: \"@FortuneMagazine Looking forward to reading about #LexCorp.
