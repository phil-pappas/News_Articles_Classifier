We put the call out on the radio and ended up with thousands, even more than we needed to get across the entire span of the bridge,\" morning show co-host Blake Hayes said. \"When Eva and I met in the middle -- what a feeling. We had so many survivors helping us, and people touched by cancer -- including a woman who literally came from her last chemo treatment at the hospital to bring her family to the bridge.\" \n\"Their strength is inspiring, and the reason we decided to do this crazy thing,\" Hayes said. \nWarner Brothers and Epic Records are donating a dollar per bra to the Cancer Community Center in Scarborough. \nThe bras will be donated to Goodwill. \nOctober is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:56:46.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
