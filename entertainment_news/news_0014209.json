And that's the whole reason I started this company, not just to fluff myself, like, 'I'm a celebrity! People will care what I have to say!'\" \nBlake believes she will be branded a failure, but hopes to prove people wrong by reworking and relaunching the site in the future. \nShe told Vogue.com: \"I know what it'll look like, what I'm facing publicly, that people are just going to have a heyday with this ... The only way I can prove all the negative reactions wrong is to come back with a plan that will rock people. And I have that plan. \n\"It's very exciting and it's also incredibly scary. I never thought I would have the bravery to actually do that, to take the site dark and to say, 'You know what? I haven't created something that is as true and impactful as I know it can and will be. And I'm not going to continue to chase my tail and continue to put a product out there that we, as a team, are not proud of.'\" \nPreserve will officially close on October 9, and the blonde beauty admits she might even change the name before she relaunches it. \nThe former 'Gossip Girl' star said: \"I love the name Preserve. But then, I never thought people would think Preserve had something to do with jam! ... These are all of the things you don't think of when you're too intimate with something.\" blake lively", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:35:08.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
