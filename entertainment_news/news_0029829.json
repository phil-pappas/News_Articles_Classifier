Comments \nRapper T.I. won't be voting for Hillary Clinton — or any other woman in 2016 — he said during a radio interview released on Tuesday. \n\"Not to be sexist, I can't vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" he says on the \"The Whoolywood Shuffle\" radio show. \"Just because every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But the president, it's kind of like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally — they make very permanent, cemented decisions — and then later, it's kind of like it didn't happen or they didn't mean for it to happen.\" \nCNN says T.I. suggests that women are not consistent enough in their decision-making to lead the United States. \nThe rapper adds that having a female president would have an impact on other world leaders, who \"will not be able to negotiate the right kinds of foreign policy; the world ain't ready yet.\" \nThe Guardian reports that T.I. ends the interview by saying, \"I think you might be able to get the Loch Ness monster elected before you could [get a woman].\" \nAfter the interview aired, the rapper took to Twitter and apologized for what he said. My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong. I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended. — T.I. (@Tip) October 13, 2015 \nT.I. also mentioned in the interview that Donald Trump would be the best candidate to improve the economy. \n\"I feel he is the best showman of them all,\" he says. \"And I do feel that if he is sincerely concerned about the economy of America and the working public, he would be the best person to flip the money that we have, take it and flip it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:59:38.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
