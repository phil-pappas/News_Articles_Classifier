Pic/Sayed Sameer Abedi \n\"The part I played was so different from what I am in real life that I was quite out of my comfort zone,\" said Konkona at the release of the film by Royal Stag Barrel Select Large Short Films on Thursday.\nIn the film, directed by Jaydeep Sarkar, Konkona and \"Children of War\" actress Tillotama Shome are opposite kind of characters but share an interesting kind of friendship which keeps growing.\n\"Actually I wanted to do the other role because I identify with that role more, and I thought I'll suit more with it, but the director Jaydeep Sarkar said you have to do this particular part. She's a wannabe kind of character, she dresses in a very particular way and talks in a particular way, and says 'Chill babes' and all which is not at all me. So they only put together the whole look and I just\nwent along like an obedient actress,\" said Konkona who plays a westernized character while Tillotama plays a salwar kurta-clad mother.\nAbout her experience of working with her co-star, Konkona said: \"Tilotama and I are already great friends, neighbours and we meet a lot. To play friends was interesting because we are not friends like how you saw in the film. The nature of our friendship is different than the friendship depicted in our film. Tilotama's character wants to be like my character and my character is not\ncomfortable in her own skin, she wants to be something else. So it had some very interesting layers to it.\"\nDirector Jaydeep Sarkar is an ad filmmaker and shot for this film in 2014. About him, she said: \"We've done plays together in the past and we've known each other since 1998. I was excited and wanted to work with him. I think he's got a lot of talent and he's going to make great films. I'm waiting for him to make a feature-length film.\"\nThe trend of short films seems to be catching up with Sujoy Ghosh's \"Ahalya\" starring Radhika Apte also receiving great appreciation recently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:26:02.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
