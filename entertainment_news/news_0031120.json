Calgary's Winsport belongs to this exclusive club. Formerly known as the Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA), Winsport was founded in 1956 to bid on behalf of Calgary to host Olympic Winter Games. CODA successfully won the bid from the International Olympic Committee on Sept. 30, 1981, for Calgary to become the host city for the XV Olympic Winter Games in 1988. Following the Olympics in 1988 and benefiting from endowment funds left for the Games' legacy, CODA has evolved into a new vision for Canadian winter sport, with the transition to Winsport. Through Winsport, the legacy of the 1988 Games is not only thriving, but leading edge. The organization built new facilities and operated, maintained and rejuvenated the facilities from the Games and is committed to supporting Canadian athletes for generations to come with the creation of the world's leading Winter Sports Institute. \n60 years after CODA was founded, SMByyc has invited Winsport to share information about current programming, talk about how Winsport will continue to stay leading edge, and how they continue to support both high-performance athletes and recreational programming. \nWinsport is an organization that gives people the opportunity to fall in love with winter sports. They are more than the physical structure at COP. Thru various sites in areas surrounding Calgary, they promote athletic development from recreational participation to high performance sport development. A panel, which includes representatives from Calgary area resorts Lake Louise Ski Resort and Resorts of the Canadian Rockies , will reflect on their marketing strategies and how they get people excited about winter sports. \nSeating is limited. \nPlease RSVP at SMByyc69 \nIf you are not able to attend, follow and join in on the discussion @SMByyc via #SMByyc69 . \nOr check out #SMByyc69 Tagboard : SMByyc69_TB \nCollection of posts from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, Google+ and Vine \nAbout the Event \nWhen: Friday, October 30 th , 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. Where: 110 - 9 th Avenue S.E.
