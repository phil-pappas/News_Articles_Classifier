As a member of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Sakato lost his best friend in France and, in his anger, charged an enemy position solo. For that and other actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor — 56 years later, in belated recognition of the bravery of Japanese Americans.\nMore Information Choosing Courage: Inspiring Stories of What It Means to Be a Hero\nBy Peter Collier\nArtisan, $18.95\nTibor Rubin was a Hungarian Jew who survived a Nazi concentration camp. Inspired by his GI liberators, he enlisted when he got to America. In Korea, he single-handedly covered his unit’s retreat and was later captured by the Chinese. He used the skills learned in one death camp to keep himself and others alive in a communist one.\nDuring a firefight in Vietnam, medic Alfred Rascon instinctively started toward the wounded, but was ordered to stay put. “I said OK, and then took off and went forward anyway,” he said. He was soon wounded, but kept tending to others. One grenade exploded near his head, and when a second one landed by another soldier, Alfred dived on top and absorbed the impact. He didn’t receive his Medal of Honor until 2000. The next year, he rejoined the Army Reserve after 9/11.\nJencie Fagan was in the gym at Edward L. Pine Middle School when she heard three sharp sounds. She ran toward the noise. Students had been wounded; teachers were yelling, “Code red!” A 14-year-old boy was holding a gun. Instead of fleeing, Fagan approached him, talking softly, putting herself between the weapon and others. She kept asking him to put the gun down. When he did, she reached out, hugging him tight.\nThis is all familiar, yet clearly sacred, ground for Collier, whose best-selling “Medal of Honor,” a moving homage to all the living medal recipients, was first published in 2006.\nIn his afterward, Collier reminds readers these are stories of valor but not bravado. He writes of one GI after a 12-hour battle: “The first thing he did when fighting ended was go to a nearby chapel and pray for the buddies he had lost and the enemy soldiers he had been forced to kill.” Tibor Rubin recounts, “I killed the enemy, but I’ve killed somebody’s father, brother, uncle.”\nStill, they inspire, sacrificing for others, overcoming fear and the horrors of war. “Set the example. Keep going,” says WWII infantryman Vernon Baker , who fought segregation and fascism. “Never give up,” exhorts Vietnam POW Leo Thorsness.
