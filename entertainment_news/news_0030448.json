She headed to her kitchen and cooked her way through the shock, the grief, the worry. The dishes she made, the insights gained, are the focus of her latest book, \"My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes that Saved My Life\" (Random House, $35).\nReichl writes that she learned anew over her kitchen year that \"when you pay attention, cooking becomes a kind of meditation.\" What readers will learn from this cookbook-memoir depends, she says in a telephone interview, on the kind of reader they are.\n\"For some people, I'm really hoping that it will change the way they cook and that they will cook in a way that feels less like a test,\" says Reichl of the book. \"I'm really hoping it will make people relax about cooking and slow down and pay attention to the sensory pleasure of cooking and that it will be more about the journey than it will be about the result.\n\"For other people ... I know this because I've heard from some of these people who are not particularly cooks but who are people who have lost their jobs or are afraid they are going to lose their jobs,\" she adds. \"I hope that it will make them feel that it's not the end of the world and that we should not be defined by our jobs. And that there's a way through that if you latch on to your real passion. … It occurred to me halfway through this year that my experience might be useful to other people, which is not how I've written any of my other books.\"\nReichl initially saw \"My Kitchen Year\" as a little book she could write without having to \"follow any prescriptions.\" Random House, she says, saw it as a bigger book, particularly in terms of the atmospheric photography, but Reichl says she was able to produce the book she wanted — right down to recipes written in what she calls \"this unusual style.\"\nThe recipes do seem unusual — at first glance. They are written in the same personal tone as the story. That's intentional — Reichl wanted the work to have a \"narrative flow,\" she says, something not expected in a cookbook. Also surprising for a cookbook, at least in this era, is that not every recipe has every measurement precisely rendered. The directions are not the usual formulas either; instruction may veer into a recollection, an aside or even an inspiration.\nReichl writes in the book she had never been \"completely comfortable\" with the style of recipe writing popularized by Fannie Farmer and Julia Child. To Reichl, \"recipes are conversations, not lectures. They are a beginning not an end.\" Elizabeth David, the British cookbook author, is more her inspiration.\n\"She (David) expected her readers to be smart and intuitive and to use their best sense. And you know, you trust them or you don't,'' says Reichl, who notes she used her \"best sense\" in deciding how explicit to be in a recipe.\n\"There are people who always need Julia Child to walk them in little tiny baby steps through every recipe,\" she says. \"Those people are not going to have a good time with my book. They're going to wonder when I say 'worry the anchovies.' They are really going to wonder what that means but I think most people will get it.\" (Worry? She means to work them with a wooden spoon until they break up.)\n\"My Kitchen Year\" is also notable for the tweets sprinkled across the pages like peppercorns. It's an appropriate if unusual touch. For Reichl's tweets (famously the target of Twitter parody by \"Ruth Bourdain,\" the creation of writer Josh Friedland) are more than just bits of poetry on the page. They reflect with a still-sharp immediacy the varying moods of that time. Twitter itself gave Reichl a sense of camaraderie she had once enjoyed in the Gourmet test kitchen.\n\"I, alone in my kitchen, always felt very alone and suddenly I wasn't,\" she says. Twitter \"is a great way to feel connected in the world when you are in a very low place, when you feel like you are all alone and suddenly you understand that you aren't.\"\nReichl made it a point to thank her Twitter followers in the book's acknowledgments.\n\"You helped me survive a very difficult year,\" she writes. \"I'm not sure I could have done it without you.\"\nwdaley@tribpub.com\nTwitter @billdaley\nApple crisp\nPrep: 20 minutes\nCook: 45 to 60 minutes\nMakes: 6-8 servings\nThis recipe from \"My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes that Saved My Life\" highlights the conversational style used by author Ruth Reichl throughout the book. If you prefer a little more direction: In the Tribune test kitchen, we used an 8-inch square baking pan with good results, 1/2 teaspoon each salt and cinnamon and a mix of McIntosh, Granny Smith, Jonagold, Aurora and Gala apples.\nShopping list:\n5 heirloom apples\nStaples:\n1 lemon\n2/3 cup flour\n2/3 cup brown sugar\nSalt\nCinnamon\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\nPeel a few different kinds of apples, enjoying the way they shrug reluctantly out of their skins. Core, slice, and layer the apples in a buttered pie plate or baking dish and toss them with the juice of the lemon.\nMix the flour with the brown sugar, and add a dash of salt and a grating of fresh cinnamon. Using two knives — or just your fingers — cut in the butter, then pat the mixture over the top of the fruit. The cooking time is forgiving; you can put your crisp into a 375-degree oven and pretty much forget it for 45 minutes to an hour. The juices should be bubbling a bit at the edges; the top should be crisp, golden, and fragrant. Served warm, with a pitcher of cream, it makes you grateful for fall.\nPrivacy Policy Julia Child Entertainment Dining and Drinking", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562987ef/turbine/ct-ruth-reichl-cookbook-food-1028-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:27:11.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
