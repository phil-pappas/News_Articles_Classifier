One involves gun control. The other concerns mental health, since we widely assume that to walk into a room of unarmed people and shoot them is to be ill. Demonstrably, there is significant opposition to gun control. But few Americans — on ether side of that fight — think that the nation does a good job when it comes to treating the nation's ailments of the mind. On this — sometimes only this, it seems — we can all agree.\nWhat better moment, than, for \"Good for Otto,\" the remarkable, new three-hour opus by the great American writer David Rabe — the veteran chronicler of the pain of Vietnam veterans in the early 1970s, justly one of the most revered American dramatic writers of the 20th century, and a writer who has, at the age of 75, now penned as comprehensive, heartfelt and even-handed a theatrical look at the issues surrounding mental illness in America as you ever are likely to see.\n\"Good for Otto\" had its world premiere Friday not at some high-profile national theater, where it really belongs, but in a little room in the Chicago neighborhood of Jefferson Park, where an audience sat for three hours watching 15 Chicago actors under the direction of Michael Patrick Thornton throw their hearts and souls into this messy, difficult, in-need-of-cutting, thoroughly wonderful play.\nIts conclusion is simple: the brave ones are \"the ones who try.\"\nThe ones who try what, you might be wondering?\nThe ones who go to therapy. Sit in the chair. Probe their youth. Dig deep into the why and the wherefore. Fight with their insurance company. Overcome their pride. Get past their embarrassment at just walking through the door of a mental-health facility like the Northwest Center for Family Services and Mental Health in Torrington, Conn., where the psychotherapist Richard O'Connor worked and whose work, \"Undoing Depression,\" is the main source of Rabe's play, which is set in a fictional town of Harrington in the Berkshires.\nDavid Rabe at Gift Theatre: A debut from the bard of Vietnam era Chris Jones In the American theater, the Iowa-born playwright David Rabe has turned out to be the great dramatic poet of the Vietnam War era.\nBeginning in 1971, when Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival first produced Rabe's \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,\" Rabe became associated with the chronicling...\nIn the American theater, the Iowa-born playwright David Rabe has turned out to be the great dramatic poet of the Vietnam War era.\nBeginning in 1971, when Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival first produced Rabe's \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,\" Rabe became associated with the chronicling...\n(Chris Jones) This is not a howl of complaint at the system; it is a veneration of the human courage of Americans from all walks of live who take responsibility for themselves.\nSome of the ones who try are teenage girls. Some are men in their 70s who feel the weight of the life that has gone before. Rabe's thesis here is that it does not much matter — it's just as difficult to get help, and to be willing to allow help, at any age.\nIn essence, \"Good for Otto\" is a mosaic of the stories of the psychologically troubled — all patients in the same facility, where they encounter the therapists Robert Michaels (John Gawlik) and Evangeline Ryder (Lynda Newton), or, when things really get tricky, both. They're all outpatients, so they have to work on themselves during the rest of their lives.\nIt doesn't matter whether you're Frannie (Caroline Heffernan), a 12-year-old girl who cuts herself, or Barnard (Rob Riley, in a blisteringly honest performance), a seemingly upstanding New England gentleman (Riley looks not unlike the former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd). Barnard's childhood seems to be so remote that the notion that it could still be extracting its price on his happiness feels intellectually absurd. Who wants to work on oneself in retirement?\nBut you might have reached adulthood unable to say hello without looking away, like Timothy (the very moving John Kelly Connolly), or your son might have died and you can't get past that, or you might be unable to actually throw away one of those scores of boxes that clutter up your basement. Rabe seems to be saying that it doesn't much matter. It's all hard. It all means walking through the door.\nNonetheless, it's all essential, being as we all have only one life and, as the great lyricist Jerry Herman once observed, there's no return and no deposit.\nAnd — see paragraph No. 1, above — if you do not get help, you might well harm your fellow humans, be it dramatically and violently or merely though the drip, drip, drip of the daily agony of the caregiver — as depicted, beautifully in this play by Darci Nalepa, playing the foster mother of a 12-year-old whose birth mother causes her offspring such travails of the heart.\nIt's no easier to be a doctor, of course. \"Good for Otto\" is an unsentimental piece (one story, involving the superb Jay Worthington's Alex, explores the issue of medicating away complexity and freedom). It is penned with the tone of an analyst-observer. To some extent, the Dr. Michaels character is a foil; at other moments he has some of the qualities of Dr. Martin Dysart, the main character in Peter Shaffer's 1973 play, \"Equus.\" He is, for sure, haunted by his own demons, which is not unusual among the more empathetic members of the mental-health profession. At times, he tells us he wants to take his patients home with him, not for pernicious reasons but to save them, especially the young ones, from the system. He is haunted by the past treatments of the mentally ill — represented in this play by the image of a person unknown, locked in some New England attic, pacing in circles for so long that he or she wears grooves in the floor. Grooves that last.\nThere's an especially wrenching scene in Thornton's production with young Frannie, following a conversation that Michaels has with a representative of her insurance company (played without stereotyping by Cyd Blakewell) that is in the business of limiting costs and hospitalization. He thus has no alternative but to subject her to the vagaries of the emergency room, this being the only away to game the system — and this being one of the many absurdities of American healthcare that extracts a palpable human cost.\nThornton and his designer, Courtney O'Neill, stuff these striving American souls into every corner of the Gift space — suggesting a whole series of lives lived mostly alone in remote boxes, and emphasizing just how long the long the walk to the door of the therapist can be. It is the most effective use of this prosaic but resonant space I've seen to date.\nAt Friday night's show, I would not say that the cast had wrestled this text entirely to the ground. There were some stutters and complexities, a few garbled lines, awkwardness. Gawlik struggles in places. Overall, this is very much a Chicago crew, and you don't see quite enough of that famously flinty New England reserve. But who cares with such a play? Especially when every last performance feels heartfelt? Not I.\nThe reason to see this work — aside from its obvious applicability to our moment — is that Rabe is a humanist poet and there are, trust me, some astoundingly beautiful gushes of prose in this work. But it's not an oblique or pretentious work. One of the patients decides to finally come for a session after watching the TV show \"Duck Dynasty\" and realizing that the figures in that show were crazier than he thought himself.\n\"Good for Otto\" is a title that unlocks some meaning — I will not give that one away. But if you know Rabe's past Vietnam-themed work (\"Streamers,\" \"Sticks and Stones,\" \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel\"), you'll not be surprised that he has come out with this one as this long-quiet writer hits his mid-70s. If you do not know his work and are inclined to follow this recommendation, understand this is no 90-minute farce.\nBut Rabe is a giant of the American theater with plenty more to contribute. You can imagine him wandering into this hospital near his Connecticut home, watching, researching, and maybe talking himself. He knows grief. He lost his wife, Jill Clayburgh, in 2010.\nI suspect there are echoes of Rabe's own condition in Riley's Barnard. There are echoes of every older adult. It's just that only the brave decide to deal — helping themselves, protecting us all.\nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.\ncjones5@tribpub.com\nTwitter@ChrisJonesTrib\nREVIEW: \"Good for Otto\"\n4 STARS\nWhen: Through Nov. 22\nWhere: Gift Theatre, 4802 N.
