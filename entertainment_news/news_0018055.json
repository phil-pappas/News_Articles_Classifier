(AP) â€” In time for \"Back to the Future\" day, the widow of the automaker whose famous car was used in the movie has settled a lawsuit over the use of his name. \nJohn DeLorean's widow sued in federal court last year claiming a Texas company has been using the DeLorean name illegally for years. \nThe DMC-12, known simply as \"the DeLorean,\" was driven by Michael J. Fox in the 1985 movie. In the movie's sequel, he travels to Oct. 21, 2015. \nLast month, an agreement was reached in which the Texas-based DeLorean Motor Company will pay Sally DeLorean an undisclosed amount of money and retain rights to use its name, logo and trademarks. \nJohn DeLorean died in New Jersey in 2005 at 80.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:04:37.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
