He could collect up to $3.75 million as a retention bonus and up to $3.75 million as a severance payment in the event of a change of control. Both payments were previously $3 million, under an August agreement.\nRizk made $20.6 million last year, his first year as CEO, most of it from stock and options awards, according to a July proxy statement. His base salary was $338,835.\nIn July, the company said it would explore strategic alternatives after turning down a $260 million offer from Ascension Health, its largest customer and one of the nation's largest Catholic health systems.\nAccretive Health did not immediately respond to questions Tuesday about other offers it may have received, or strategic alternatives it is pursuing. Still, giving its CEO a sweeter package to stay suggests that the company is investigating such options.\nAccretive Health reported a $79.6 million loss last year, its fourth unprofitable year in the last five years as its struggles to bounce back from legal and accounting troubles.\nThe company is still recovering from a massive financial restatement connected to accounting errors over when it recorded revenues from certain contracts. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because it missed a deadline for restating results. The company's shares are traded over the counter.\njrussell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @johnrussell99\n Jobs and Workplace Compensation and Benefits U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56267c00/turbine/ct-accretive-executive-compensation-1021-biz-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:48:24.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
