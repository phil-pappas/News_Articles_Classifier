Celtic in June of 1904 was to leave an indelible mark on the American dream , a story told in the movie ' Boys Town ' in 1938,” says Stevens. “But the story is richer and more astonishing than a movie could dramatize.”\nWhen Stevens walked into a hotel to meet Father Flanagan of Boys Town, he never thought that the meeting would have such an impact on his life. Now, he sheds light on his meeting with the father and how he chose to live in Boys Town and all the ramifications that choice has had on his life.\nAn excerpt from “I Remember Father Flanagan”:\n“When the abbot of the monastery called me in and told me about Father Flanagan’s death, I went out and walked under the trees and wondered what Boys Town would be like without him. A light had gone out of my sky. Father Flanagan was dead.”\n“I Remember Father Flanagan”\nBy Clifford Stevens\nSoftcover | 6 x 9 in | 48 pages | ISBN 9781475990836\nE-Book | 48 pages | ISBN 9781475990843\nAvailable at Amazon and Barnes & Noble\nAbout the Author\nClifford Stevens a priest of the Archdiocese of Omaha, and the founder of Tintern Monastery.
