The woman was assaulted after her home was broken into.\nReynaldo Pineda, 35, was arrested by Cook County sheriff's police Sunday for a traffic offense. After his fingerprints were collected in the traffic incident, police entered them into the national fingerprint database for comparison. They matched unidentified fingerprints from the September 2014 investigation, police said.\nPineda has been charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault and home invasion in connection with the September 2014 incident in the 2400 block of south Embers Lane in Arlington Heights, police said.\nFingerprint evidence collected at the time of the sexual assault did not come up with a match in the national database, police said. But the fingerprints then were stored in the system for future comparison.\nArlington Heights police detectives were notified of the fingerprint match Wednesday and located Pineda at his residence in Mount Prospect. He was taken into custody and interviewed before the charges were approved by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, police said.\nPineda is scheduled for a bond hearing at 1:30 p.m. Friday in the Cook County Third Municipal District Courthouse in Rolling Meadows, police said.\nkcullotta@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @kcullotta\nSuburban Chicago arrest photos Open link Sexual Assault Crime Arlington Heights Mount Prospect", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627edf9/turbine/chi-suburban-chicago-arrest-photos", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56295b19/turbine/ct-arh-arlington-sex-assault-arrest-tl-1029-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:12:05.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
