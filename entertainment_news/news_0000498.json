Many people believe these power is being lost due to the number of background operations Facebook runs, such as tracking your location.\nFacebook have denied these claims, but have said \"We’re looking into this and hope to have a fix in place soon.\"\nAn iOS developer, Jonathan Zdziarski, has been looking through the app and noticed some unusual activity.\nIt *looks* like if you have location sharing enabled for Facebook, that's part of what it is doing in the background to kill your battery.\n— Jonathan Zdziarski (@JZdziarski) October 15, 2015 The ridiculous amount of analytics alone in Facebook should be enough to drain your battery, never mind location sharing.\n— Jonathan Zdziarski (@JZdziarski) October 16, 2015 If Facebook is killing your battery, try turning off location sharing in Facebook, and that may very well improve things.\n— Jonathan Zdziarski (@JZdziarski) October 16, 2015 So there you go, if you notice your battery dying quicker than usual then try turning off your location sharing. It might help, it might not.
