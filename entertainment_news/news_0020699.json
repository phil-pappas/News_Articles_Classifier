The incarcerated Real Housewives of New Jersey star is penning a memoir, People reports. Entitled Turning the Tables: From Housewife to Inmate and Back Again , the tell-all book will chronicle Giudice's life from childhood through her lavish reality star lifestyle and, ultimately, to how she wound up behind bars. No word yet on whether Turning the Tables will also address Giudice's penchant for flipping tables or why she changed the pronunciation of her last name. Giudice is currently serving time for fraud after she and her husband Joe pleaded guilty to a 39-count indictment. Once Giudice's sentence ends, Joe will begin his 41-month prison stint. Turning the Tables will be released on Feb. 9, 2016. Giudice will be released from prison on Dec. 23.
