Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 10:00 pm Ellwood City teachers threaten to strike Tuesday By Eric Poole epoole@ellwoodcityledger.com EllwoodCityLedger.com | 0 comments \nELLWOOD CITY -- Representatives from Ellwood City Area School District administration and the union that represents district teachers expressed optimism Thursday that the two sides could reach an agreement and prevent the district's first labor-related school cancellation. \n\"We're optimistic that we can make some progress tonight,\" school board President Mike Neupauer said during the board meeting Thursday. \nNearly 100 of the 130 teachers represented by the Ellwood Area Education Association attended the school board meeting. The teachers, who have been working under the terms of a contract that expired June 30, announced their intention to strike beginning Tuesday if no agreement is reached. \nFriday would be the last scheduled day of classes before the strike, with students off Monday for Columbus Day. \nThe two sides failed to reach an agreement after a three-hour round of negotiations Wednesday and met again late Thursday after the school board meeting. No agreement was reached at the time of Thursday night. \nSuperintendent Joe Mancini and union co-President Kim DeLoia declined to comment on specifics of negotiations. \nIf the two sides fail to reach an agreement, classes would be cancelled starting Tuesday. Under Act 88 of 1992, the state law that governs teacher contract negotiations, teacher strikes are prohibited from lasting long enough to prevent the district from having 180 instructional days before June 15. \nTo determine that figure, the district will file a strike notification with the state Department of Education, which will calculate the result and notify the district on when teachers must return to work. \nIn the event of a strike, classes would be canceled on Tuesday. But students attending private or special-education schools outside the Ellwood City Area School District and at the Lawrence County Career and Technical Center would still have classes. The district will continue to bus students to the career and technical center and in accordance with state requirements. \nA work stoppage Tuesday would be the first in district history. Teachers did picket on one occasion more than 30 years ago, but no class time was lost. The teachers threatened a strike in 2006, but the union and administration reached an agreement in time to prevent a stoppage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:43:32.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
