Other Bollywood films on the programme here include two productions tapping into the industry’s traditions – and star-crossed lovers – in \"Masaan\", an award winner at this year’s Cannes festival, and \"O Kadhal Kanmani\".\nThe festival is also showcasing the rising stars from India's film industry beyond Bollywood and Hindi-language movies.\nIndependent filmmaker’s Hari Viswanath’s debut \"Radio Set\" – about an old man alienated from his children - is in the running for Busan’s main New Currents award for first and second-time Asian filmmakers while the Assamese-language \"Kothanodi\", looks at the trial and tribulations of four mothers, also makes its world premiere.\nButala believes the success of his film – directed by Kabir Khan and starring current Indian box office king Salman Khan – has been down to its positive message, and that Indian filmmakers as a whole are now exploring a wider reach of topics, removed from the romances normally associated with Bollywood.\n“\"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\" is an incredibly positive film,” said Butala. “It's rare for a film to take such a balanced view of both India and Pakistan, without taking any sides. This touched an emotional chord.”\nWhile there are more than 1,000 films produced across Indian every year, making it by far the world’s most active film-making nation, outside the country these films have only previously been watched by the Indian diaspora, according to Butala. But he believes times are rapidly changing.\n“Film-makers in India like everywhere in the world want their films to travel, to reach out to even larger audiences,” said Butala. “A mainstream Hindi language film is yet to successfully make that giant leap. But I think the opportunity to do this is ripe.”\nThere are 16 Indian films among the 304 productions screening at this year’s BIFF, which will run until October 10.\nArts & Entertainment Media Bajrangi Bhaijaan Bollywood film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:42:01.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
