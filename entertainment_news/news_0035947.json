Photo: Pat Scala \nVallejo Gantner​ was in Brussels for the Kunsten Festival des Arts when he heard the news – George Brandis was cutting $104 million from the Australia Council to create a new \"excellence\" program to be administered by the arts ministry.\nThe fear rippling through the local arts sector, that small to medium-sized companies would be hardest hit by the then-Arts Minister's funding changes, also reached Gantner and his peers in Europe.\n\"I was really shocked,\" the Melbourne-born artistic director said. \"The Kunsten Festival is one of these critical platforms, it's full of curators, full of festival directors, full of presenters and everybody was despairing. The interest is not in bringing the Australian opera or the ballet or the symphony orchestra – they've got them. The interest is in bringing stuff that's distinct and unique and that's the independent work.\"\nOkwui Okpokwasili appears in Bronx Gothic, part of PS122 and Arts House's New York Narratives program for the Melbourne Festival. Photo: Sarah Walker \nGantner left Australia 13 years ago, first for Ireland where he ran the Dublin Fringe and then for the United States where since 2005 he has been artistic director of the experimental Performance Space 122 in the East Village. His roots in Melbourne's arts ecology run deep: the great-grandson of Sidney Myer, he's the son of philanthropist and Playhouse Theatre founder Carrillo Gantner and actor Nancy Black. But his heart is in the independent scene and he's remained loyal to it as he's crossed the world.\nAdvertisement So when, in Brussels, the news of the Australia Council cuts came, Gantner says it was not just the Australian arts diaspora who reacted strongly.\n\"People were horrified and it did the global brand of 'Australia' unbelievable damage. And that's what drove me crazy about it. Cut the money, don't cut the money – but don't do it so stupidly.\"\nThe cuts had a professional significance for Gantner, too. He was on the cusp of inking a multi-year deal with the Australia Council guaranteeing $60,000 a year to bring Australian artists to PS122's COIL festival in January. The changes put years of negotiating at risk although in the end, Gantner says, the agreement was signed with \"hours to spare\".\nHe is thrilled with the outcome: in 2016 he'll bring Helen Herbertson​'s immersive dance piece  Morphia Series , the award-winning play  Intimacy  from Melbourne's Ranters Theatre and a playful party of a work from Polytoxic in Brisbane. They'll all be staged during the few frigid weeks in January when COIL runs, a time when multiple independent arts events are also on in New York creating an \"unparalleled opportunity\" for showcasing the Australian works.\nMorphia Series , a long-time collaboration between the acclaimed choreographer and dancer Herbertson and lighting designer Ben Cobham, is particularly exciting to Gantner who first brought the minimalist, 18-minute long piece to a Dublin basement in 2003.\nHerbertson herself has been surprised by  Morphia 's longevity although the last time she performed it in Melbourne was in 2009. By her own admission, it is a piece in which everything must be strictly controlled, from the pitch-black darkness the audience sits in to the purpose-built set and \"morsel\" of food it incorporates.\n\"It's one of those shows that just when I think I've put it to bed, out it pops again,\" she said. \"I think it's gotten deeper, I know more about it each time I do it. I've changed, probably. My physicality has changed. And the way we work, it's sort of impossible to rehearse before we set everything up.\"\nMorphia  is an example of how Gantner hopes PS122 and COIL can cut through the huge array of cultural offerings New York serves up on any given night and present a version of Australia not known to many in America.\n\"Part of that is about choosing work that does things that is not available. No one does this, what Helen does. People are doing immersive theatre and immersive dance, but this has a kind of generosity and a rigour and a simplicity about it that I haven't seen anywhere else.\"\nLikewise, the two works he has brought from PS122 to this year's Melbourne Festival in collaboration with North Melbourne's Arts House are an attempt to introduce Australian audiences to alternative versions of the American story. Framed within a \"New York Narratives\" program, Okwui Okpokwasili​'s virtuosic  Bronx Gothic  and the sensory assault of Andrew Schneider​'s  Youarenowhere  have been critical standouts of the festival and seem to confirm Gantner's approach.\n\"For me this is about PS122 representing an alternative American narrative and refracting that back in to the US – that Australia is a genuinely dynamic, creative, contemporary culture which in the traditional touristic imagery we just don't hear about.\"\nIt is obviously a vision the Australia Council shares, and a recent report on international arts activity identified the United States as a key destination for future works for artists and arts organisations surveyed by the Council. With a total operating budget at PS122 of US$1.5 million, the Australia Council's $60,000 a year commitment was an important kickstart. Gantner has since raised nearly twice that from private sources to ensure COIL will continue to present, and hopefully tour, Australian works into the future. \n\"The return on investment is ridiculous,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be big bucks and the impact on it is huge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:46:06.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
