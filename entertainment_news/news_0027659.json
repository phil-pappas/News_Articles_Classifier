However, the actress completely denies wanting to be a full-fledged designer at any point of time. Dressed in bootleg denims and a printed top, the Piku' star said that the collection is a gift for everyone who really admires her style statement. The collection embraces special fabrics such as hammered satin, viscose and jacquards, lurex knits, blended knits, woollens and premium denims and focused on themes like romance, summer and comfort. Well, apart from giving hits at the box-office and having so many brand endorsements on her plate, Deepika added one more feather to her cap. Let's see if she hits success even in this zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:55:15.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
