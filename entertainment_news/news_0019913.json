As artists we wanted something that took us out of our comfort zones. Just being raw actors. It's not the safest idea. But life is short.\" \nThe brunette beauty can't wait to turn 50 in 2025 after undergoing a \"brutal\" preventative double mastectomy as well removing her ovaries and fallopian tubes to reduce her cancer risk in recent years. \nShe told the November issue of Vogue magazine: \"Both of the women in my family, my mother and my grandmother [who passed due to ovarian cancer], started dying in their 40s. I'm 40. I can't wait to hit 50 and know I made it.\" \nThe Oscar winner says going public with her health issues \"really connected\" her to other women, but the surgeries were a \"hard\" process. \nShe explained: \"They are not easy surgeries. The ovaries are an easy surgery, but the hormone changes - interesting. We did joke that I had my Monday edit. Tuesday surgery. Wednesday go into menopause. Thursday come back to edit, a little funky with my steps.\" angeline jolie", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:45:39.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
