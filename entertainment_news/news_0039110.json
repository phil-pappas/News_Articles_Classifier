Why did One Direction break the... The pioneering series, known for its over-the-top experiments proving and, well, busting myths, will wrap up following 248 episodes. The upside, as co-hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman told EW, is they knew the end was coming ahead of time and were able to craft the final season of \"Mythbusters\" as an explosive final goodbye to fans. \"It was my greatest fear that 'Mythbusters' would just stop and we wouldn't be able to do proper final episodes,\" Savage told EW in the exclusive interview.
