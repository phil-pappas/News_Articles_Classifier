Pakistan has repeatedly called for a referendum so residents can choose which country to join, a move India opposes because it could lead to a loss of territory.\n\"Three generations of Kashmiris have only seen broken promises and brutal oppression,\" Sharif said at the U.N. on Sept. 30. \"This is the most persistent failure of the United Nations.\"\nSharif's proposal consisted of four points:\n-- Enforce a 2003 cease-fire along the line of control in Kashmir\n-- Withdraw troops and weapons from Kashmir\n-- An unconditional, mutual withdrawal from the Siachen Glacier, where troops have faced off for more than three decades at heights of up to 6,700 meters and temperatures reaching minus 60 degrees Celsius\n-- Pledge not to use or threaten force under any circumstances\nIt took less than 24 hours for India to reject the proposal. \"We do not need four points, we need just one -- give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk,\" Sushma Swaraj, India's foreign minister, said in her own speech.\nThe tone is sharply different from last year, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Sharif to attend his inauguration. Both sides are now violating the 2003 cease-fire in Kashmir nearly three times more frequently than they were in 2011, and they've twice scrapped high-level talks at the last minute.\nTies are still burdened by a 2008 terrorist attack in India's financial capital of Mumbai that killed 164 people. India blames Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba and says that Sharif's government hasn't done enough to crack down on the group. In April, an Islamabad court released Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind behind the attack.\n\"India has a very stringent position -- it's not even willing to talk about Kashmir until Pakistan does more about terrorism,\" Kugelman said. \"That's the position that's going to remain constant, and a reason why we shouldn't invest so much significance in Sharif's proposal.\"\nHere's a look at India-Pakistan peace efforts:\n1972: The Simla Agreement pledges to end conflict in Kashmir and settle disputes by peaceful means. The countries designate a new boundary, known as the Line of Control, which they vow not to unilaterally alter.\n1998: The \"Composite Dialogue\" calls for peace talks between top officials to address eight areas, including Kashmir, withdrawal from the Siachen Glacier, terrorism, and economic cooperation.\n1999: Lahore Declaration reaffirms the Simla Agreement. The countries vowed to take immediate steps to avoid the accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons.\n2003: Agree to a cease-fire along the Line of Control\n2004: Then-Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in comments to Pakistani journalists, calls for demilitarizing Kashmir and suggests Pakistan should consider options besides a plebiscite in Kashmir.\n2005: Musharraf and former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tell reporters that the peace process between the two countries is \"irreversible\" and they are working toward a \"final settlement\" on Kashmir.\n2008: Peace talks suspended by the Mumbai terrorist attacks.\n(c)2015 Bloomberg News\nVisit Bloomberg News at www.bloomberg.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1740274&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1740274&h=Pakistan%27s+Sharif+to+meet+Obama+as+India+rejects+peace+plan", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1740274"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:13:03.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
