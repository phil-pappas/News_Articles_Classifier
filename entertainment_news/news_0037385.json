NY Post Email a friend \nLAMAR Odom, who was found unconscious in a Las Vegas brothel on Tuesday, has lived a life punctuated by tragedy. \nWhile he married Khloé Kardashian in 2009 and things appeared to be going well, in 2011 a sudden shift occurred. Since then, the 35-year-old has been arrested for driving under the influence, gone on drug-induced benders, has been sued by a paparazzo and suffered the loss of two dear friends. \nJuly 2011 \n• A car service hired by Odom struck a motorcyclist in downtown New York City, reports Yahoo. The motorcyclist struck a 15-year-old boy on foot, who later died as a result of his injuries. Odom, who in was the back seat, was in town to attend the funeral of his 24-year-old cousin, who was murdered. \nApril 2012 \n• The NBA star’s illustrious 14-year NBA career came to a close after an awkward ending with the Dallas Mavericks. As ESPN put it, Odom struggled to adapt to his new team and surroundings. Mavericks president Donnie Nelson said, “He’s dealt with a lot of personal issues. At this point, we need to be able to count on some things. It’s never easy to do these things. We just need to move on.” Los Angeles Clippers' Lamar Odom brings the ball up in an NBA basketball game in 2012.

Many feared he was on a drug binge, but a rep for Odom said his client was “fine.” \n• Under the influence of alcohol and driving under the speed limit in the San Fernando Valley, the father of two was pulled over by authorities. He also failed a sobriety test, according to TMZ. Odom eventually struck a deal by pleading no contest in exchange for three years of probation. He was mandated to complete an alcohol education class, as well. \n• After four years of marriage, Odom and Kardashian separated. The news came after she allegedly threw him out of their shared home after he refused an intervention for his consistent drug problem. \nSeptember 2013 \n• Odom’s estranged father, Joe, spoke out against the Kardashian family, saying the women are controlling, reports the Huffington Post. Joe also blamed his son’s problems on the family. Odom took to Twitter to discredit the comments. “He wasn’t there 2 raise me,” the New York native tweeted. “He was absent ALL my life due to his own demons. My mother and grandmother raised me. Queens raised me.” He also said the Kardashians were the “only ones that have been here consistently 4 me during this dark time.” Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Lamar Odom, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian at the Teen Choice Awards in 2010.

Odom was filmed smashing a paparazzo’s camera and vandalising another’s car before fleeing the scene. He was sued by one of the photographers for damaged equipment, lost work, lost wages and other punitive damages. \nNovember 2013 \n• Seemingly under the influence of drugs, Odom starred in a rap video freestyling nonsensical lyrics. The shocking three-minute clip, which went viral and was originally obtained by TMZ, shows Odom rapping about using drugs to make “all the pain go away” and cheating on his wife. \nJune 2015 \n• Two of Odom’s friends suddenly passed away. Bobby Hayward died of a drug overdose, and soon after, Odom’s best friend, Jamie Sangouthai, who was featured on “Khloé & Lamar,” died of a flesh-eating infection.

This divorce nearly came undone after a lengthy period of inactivity led to a judge threatening to dismiss the case. \nAugust 2015 \n• Odom reportedly ambushed his ex-wife over her new boyfriend, James Harden, at SoulCycle in Beverly Hills. Odom demanded the reality TV star stop and talk to him. “Get off of me, get off of me. Stop. Stop,” she screamed after he allegedly touched her arm. Odom claims the meeting was a misunderstanding. \nOctober 2015 \n• Odom is fighting for his life after “overdosing” on crack cocaine at a Nevada brothel, according to sources. As Khloe Kardashian rushed to her ex-husband’s bedside, insiders said Odom may have suffered a stroke after bingeing on hard drugs at Love Ranch South, where he had been partying since Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:18:03.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
