Now through Monday, February 1, 2016, U.S. youth, ages 4-15, can submit hand-drawn artworks featuring unique concepts of their \"Dream Car.\" Applicants are sorted into three age categories (4-7 years; 8-11 years; 12-15 years). Judging is based on three criteria: execution of concept; uniqueness; and artistry. For official rules and required entry forms, visit www.TFSintheCommunity.com/DreamCar . \"Every year, it's exciting to see how youth around the world envision the future of transportation,\" said Mike Groff, President & CEO of Toyota Financial Services . \"I find it inspiring to see young people incorporate social responsibility into their designs, dreaming of cars that help clean the ocean, end homelessness, and provide mobility to those who are physically challenged.\" In the spring of 2016, nine U.S. winners will be selected. Once accepted and awarded, their artwork will be submitted, along with entries from over 80 countries, for consideration in the World Contest. Thirty World Winners, plus their parents or guardians, receive a trip to Japan to participate in an awards ceremony in August 2016, during which four additional awards are announced per age category: Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Best Finalist. This past year, 11-year-old Michael Zhou of Ann Arbor, Michigan, whose artwork \"Handicap-Friendly Cleaning Car\" won the U.S. Gold Award, was selected as one of 30 World Winners to go to Japan. He ultimately placed as \"Best Finalist\" in his age category for the ninth World Contest. As in years past, Toyota divisions and affiliates are encouraging young people across the country to participate. In addition, this year, multiple exhibitions featuring artwork by past U.S. Dream Car finalists are touring California, Arizona, and Texas. Confirmed venues are John Elway's Crown Toyota Scion in Ontario, California (Thu 8/20/15 through Mon 2/1/16); Downtown Artwalk 's Edison Gallery at MALDEF presented by Katalyst Foundation for the Arts (Thu 9/10/15 through Sun 9/20/15); Phantom Galleries LA in Hawthorne, California (9/23/15 through Sat 10/24/15); Redondo Beach Public Library presented by Redondo Beach Art Group (Thu 10/1/15 through Sun 11/22/15); Plaza de la Raza 's Margo Albert Theatre Lobby (Tue 10/22 through Sat 12/19/15); Mesa Contemporary Arts Museum in Arizona (Tue 10/27/15 through Mon 2/1/16); and ArtCentre of Plano in Texas (Fri 12/18/15 through Fri 1/29/16).
