Brothers Val Chmerkovskiy and Maksim Chmerkovskiy are set to appear on the new Netflix series as Stephanie and D.J. Tanner's love interests. According to Us Weekly, Val will be paired with Jodi Sweetin's character Stephanie while Maks is set to woo Candance Cameron Bure's D.J. The \" Dancing with the Stars \" dancers are scheduled for only one episode and a source told the site that the four of them had an \"amazing time\" filming on set. \"It's really cute,\" the source told Us. \"Maks and Val play dancers and dance with sisters DJ and Stephanie in a club.\" This would be Val's first time acting on small screen. Bure was a contestant on \"Dancing with the Stars\" season 18, finishing in third place with Mark Ballas as her partner. In August this year, she posted a video of her dancing with Val on Instagram, leading people to speculate that there would be an all-star episode. \"Fuller House\" will premiere next year for 13 episodes. The reboot follows D.J. Tanner, a recent widow who is raising her children with the help of sister Stephanie and best friend and fellow mother Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber). \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:50:40.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
