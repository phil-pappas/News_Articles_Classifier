His articles and videos are all over the internet, he even offers music career advice to people looking to get into the music business (something that I hope to do someday for myself). But does he get results? As a guitarist looking to hone my skills and build a little speed, I decided to investigate - and here's some interesting information I came across: \nReviews About Tom Hess Guitar Lessons: \nImmediately I noticed a review of Tom Hess's guitar lessons by Mike Philippov. I've seen his guitar playing in several videos on YouTube, and he can really play. In his review, Philippov talks very highly of Hess and makes a very convincing case - Hell, with those kind of chops, he must be doing something right. \nAfter Google, I tried YouTube. I got many results, but the one at the top was a video with tons of reviews by actual Tom Hess guitar students. A lot of people seem to have really benefited from his lessons, and many of the can really play. \nIn the end, I felt pretty intrigued by all the positive results people were receiving. I found other results with negative things to say about Hess, but they all came in the form of \"I can't stand Hess\", \"I hate Tom Hess\" and so on. Not much for me to go on there, but then again, I tend to steer clear of blind, vitriolic internet hate. \nQuick Review: Tom Hess's Music Career Mentoring Program \nThe first Tom Hess music careers mentoring program review I came across was by someone named Lee Gattenby, a guitar teacher in Alaska. Seems he has built a pretty nice teaching business for himself and released his own music. Not bad... I continued searching... \nNext, I found what seems to be an interview with Tom Hess about music career advice. Not so much a music careers mentoring program review as it is Tom debunking various music career myths. Very insightful though - worth a look. \nIn the end, I seem to find a lot of positive reviews for Tom Hess and his programs. I can't help but be intrigued by this guy. He talks a big game, and a lot of people vouch for him. I say he is worth a look if you are a guitarist/musician, but it's up to you to do your own research. Regardless, Hess really comes off as genuinely serious about helping his students... a rarity for guitar teachers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:12:29.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
