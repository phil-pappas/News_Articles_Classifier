Many are displayed in federal buildings and courthouses across the country. \nThe new website allows users to find works by specific artists or discover pieces in a state or specific area. \nIn addition to the GSA-owned pieces at public buildings, thousands of New Deal-era works are on long-term loan to museums, universities and nonprofits, including more than 350 at the Detroit Institute of Arts. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:16:09.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
