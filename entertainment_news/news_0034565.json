For surprisingly easy and flavorful dishes, we asked celebrity chefs to share advice and recipes to help you make delicious use of seasonal produce. So grab a bottle of wine (or apple cider), pack a few accessories and enjoy Mother Nature in all her glory.\nJacques Pépin sees autumn as a time to celebrate the simple vegetables. (Photo: Tom Hopkins)\nJacques Pépin\nWorld-renowned French chef Jacques Pépin, who is preparing to air his final cooking series on PBS this fall, loves the harvest season — Thanksgiving in particular. “It is a holiday,” says Pépin, “purely about the pleasure of being around the table eating.”\nFor Pépin, autumn is a time to celebrate the simple vegetables, especially any member of the versatile cabbage family, such as Brussels sprouts. His one caveat: “Be sure to cook cabbages properly and go easy on the water. If you leave them in the cooking water, the final taste will be too strong. I cook briefly in water, quickly remove and then toss in a skillet or the oven to finish.”\nHe prefers to serve red cabbage raw, shredding it on a mandoline for ideal texture. Toss with dressing, let it soften for an hour, then top with pistachios and cranberries, which add sweetness and more texture.\nEven the lowly turnip becomes something special in Pépin’s hands. “I love the white turnips prepared with garlic and mashed like a potato.”\nHe uses traditional pickling to preserve the essential flavors of fall. His pickled onion dish is one of his personal faves — it “keeps for up to three months in the fridge and can dress up so many things, from burgers to sandwiches.”\nPépin is a decorated chef and cookbook author who has hosted a number of public television shows on cooking and food. His final series, Jacques Pépin: Heart & Soul , airs on KQED ( kqed.org ). Check local PBS listings for airtimes in your area. His new book, Jacques Pépin: Heart & Soul in the Kitchen , goes on sale in October.\nNancy Fuller says it’s easy to incorporate squash into your menus. (Photo: Andrew Ciccarelli)\nNancy Fuller\nNo two apple varieties are created equal, so if you’re planning an apple dish, follow the advice of Nancy Fuller, host of Food Network’s Farmhouse Rules .\n“Before you start cooking, taste for texture first,” Fuller says. “Is this apple soft or hard, sweet or sour? Use the taste profile to decide how you best want to use the fruit.”\nFor a quick treat using either apples or pears, “slice and cook them down and put them in a Foley Food Mill,” she says. “They will create the most naturally delicious applesauce. You don’t need to add anything to it, no added sugar, nothing. I make big batches and then just freeze it all.”\nFuller, also the author of the new Farmhouse Rules: Simple, Seasonal Meals for the Whole Family , is a fan of squash and says autumn is the ideal time to expand your squash repertoire. Instead of breezing past those unwieldy looking acorn and butternut squash in the produce section, Fuller encourages home cooks to get in the habit of preparing squash weekly.\n“It’s really much easier than anyone thinks,” she notes. “Root vegetables and squashes such as acorn and butternut are as smooth as silk and packed with wonderful flavor.”\nFuller admits her favorite dish, roasted acorn squash, is shamefully easy. “I just roast them whole in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour or so. They are already portioned out and so very pretty.” Be sure to poke some holes in the squash with a knife to let steam out. When done, just cut in half, remove seeds and top with your favorites, such as butter and salt, brown sugar or maple syrup.\nBrent Ridge, left, and Josh Kilmer-Purcell, of Beekman 1802, adapt their recipes to what they’re harvesting. (Photo: Rett Peek)\nJosh Kilmer-Purcell and Brent Ridge\nFormer city-boys-turned-farmers who starred on the Cooking Channel’s The Fabulous Beekman Boys , Josh Kilmer-Purcell and Brent Ridge relish the slower pace of autumn. Managing their Beekman 1802 Farm in Sharon Springs, N.Y., keeps them running all summer long.\nRidge savors the chance to finally “start turning inside the home and spend more time cooking because so much of spring and summer is focused on the outdoors.”\nWhen Ridge and Kilmer-Purcell begin harvesting, “we start with recipes we know and work on how the current harvest can fold into that traditional dish,” Ridge says. “During autumn, fall chili always comes to mind. Naturally, we look for a way to incorporate pumpkin. We just roast and cook the pumpkin down to add texture and some sweet complexity to the chili.”\nAnd don’t ignore the versatility of turnips, Ridge says. “You can puree and add it to creamed potatoes to give extra bite. They are also great roasted and in stews.”\nFor an easy side dish, roast parsnips and drizzle with balsamic vinegar, he says.\nThe pear might be the season’s true workhorse — it easily gets double billing as a savory and a sweet ingredient. “The one thing we love to do with pears is to toss them on the grill — on medium heat a minute or two a side,” Ridge says, noting they’ll pair nicely with meat dishes. Or, “put some bourbon on them and serve with ice cream for an easy dessert.”\nRidge and Kilmer-Purcell, who won CBS’ The Amazing Race in 2012, are the authors of several Beekman 1802 cookbooks, run an online mercantile and blog about it all on their website, beekman1802.com .\nFind more great articles like this in Best Years magazine, on newsstands now through Dec. 12.
