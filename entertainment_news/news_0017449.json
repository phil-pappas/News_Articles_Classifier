What are you, a peasant? Pfft. \nLuckily, the kind of #Follow4Follow craze that took off on Twitter during its early days never really reached Instagram – it was always a sham anyway, the people would unfollow you as soon as you followed them back. Gotta keep that ratio healthy. \nBut if you’re famous, there are no expectations on you to follow your fans back on social media. Sure, it looks good if you do, but these people look up to you as a God anyway. You may as well thrive on the power, right? Here are a few people who are just too good to follow people back. Their feeds may be incredibly dull, but their follower to following ratio is 100 emoji. 1. Beyonce \nThey don’t call her Queen B for nothing. Beyonce is followed by over 47 million people at the time of writing – about 13 million more people than there are in Canada. How many does she follow? Zero. Zilch. Not even Jay-Z (who, to be fair, doesn’t follow her either). 2. Justin Timberlake \nIs JT even relevant enough right now to be pulling these kinds of stunts? BRING. OUT. SOME. MUSIC. At least 15.7 million people want to hear it – or watch the video – make them happy! Justin is another who doesn’t follow anyone. Promoted stories 3. Scott Disick \nTimberlake, we’re so sorry we ever questioned your relevance. At least you actually have a talent. What even is a TV personality? Do you have a personality away from TV? \nClearly, though, 11 million people care enough to follow Scott on Instagram, and he cares about no one in return. 4. Nails videos \nWe saw this and thought, “really?”, nails videos has over seven million Instagram followers? But then we looked on their page. They’re magic. They need not follow anyone. Magic. 5. Chanel \nAlmost seven million followers for Chanel – so not quite as popular as magic nails up there – but still pretty impressive. They’re also too prestige to follow anyone, but the fact that they don’t probably helps their image. \nAlso, glow-up sandals? Need. 6. Nailsartvidss \nAlmost eight million followers for these nail art people but, finally, we have someone who follows someone back! Also, wow. Nails are popular. 7. Iggy Azalea \nIggy Azalea has almost eight million followers too, and also follows one person. Has anyone heard from Iggy lately? She appears to have lost anything even closely resembling relevance, not that we’re particularly bothered by this. 8. Liam Payne \nWho’d have thought Liam Payne would be the most popular member of One Direction on Instagram? Almost seven million followers, and following one person. \nAnnoyed Animated GIF 9. Zlatan Ibrahimovic \nOmg, we’ve done it. We’ve found a list on which Zlatan is not the most self-involved person. The Sweden captain and all-round great guy has over eight million followers, and follows three in return! What a man. 10. Louis Vuitton \nWe’re sure LV aren’t used to coming at the bottom of any list, but at least here it’s because they’re nice (sort of). Seven million followers and they’re following four. Go Louis.
