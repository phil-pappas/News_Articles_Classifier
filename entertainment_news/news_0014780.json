Roselle Chen reports.   \nA boxy monument to Italy's Fascist era is filling with workers for the first time in its 70-year history as fashion brand Fendi opens its new headquarters at the restored \"Square Colosseum.\" The structure was built by dictator Benito Mussolini for a planned world's fair in 1942 that was canceled due to the outbreak of World War Two. Abandoned and little used since then, it now houses 500 Fendi employees and a free art exhibition on the ground floor. Pietro Beccari is Fendi's chairman and chief executive officer. SOUNDBITE: Pietro Beccari, Fendi chief, saying (Italian): \"We are opening the doors of a building that for 72 years has been closed to the world and hiding its beauty.\" In a hushed, white-walled workshop, Fendi's employees measure and trim pieces of fur. The company has agreed a 15-year lease, after speculation that it could buy the building outright from the cash-strapped state-controlled owner of the district. Fendi has not said how much it cost to convert the fascist-era building into office space, or the price of leasing it, but Italian media have reported the annual rent to be around 3 million euros ($3.36 million).  //reut.rs/201PpU8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:59:52.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
