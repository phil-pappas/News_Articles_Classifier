There's also a cameo appearance by Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nAt the center of it all, of course, is Caitlin Strong, a quick-on-the-draw fifth-generation Texas Ranger who once again comes off as a cross between Wyatt Earp and Wonder Woman. Other characters returning from earlier books include Cort Wesley Masters, Caitlin's menacing ex-felon boyfriend; Guillermo Paz, a former South American death squad commander who's become Caitlin's guardian angel; and D.W. Tepper, her often exasperated commanding officer who complains that her cases \"are filed under either the impossible or the apocalypse.\" \nWhich is exactly so. \nThe result this time is a suspenseful, fast-paced tale apparently constructed by a writer so obsessed with James Bond movies, Stephen King novels, Clint Eastwood Westerns, Marvel Comics and \"The Matrix\" that he tried to combine all of them into a single book. Logic suggests there's no way this should work, but somehow it does, making \"Strong Light of Day\" at once preposterous and wildly entertaining. \nBruce DeSilva, winner of the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Award, is the author of four crime novels including \"A Scourge of Vipers.\" \nOnline:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:57:23.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
