He parked it outside a grocery store where he worked, and it was gone 20 minutes later.\nReolfi says he thought he'd never see it again.\nHe says someone in Maryland sold the car to a person in Delaware. Authorities were then alerted that it had been stolen.\nReolfi's dad, whose name was on the title, received an email last year with a photo of the vehicle.\nReolfi says recovering the car was \"really emotional\" for him.\n___\nInformation from: The Repository, http://www.cantonrep.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1NTFTPa"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:39:44.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
