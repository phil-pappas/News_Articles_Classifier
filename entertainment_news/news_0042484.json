Because he loves redecorating. \n\"And I was like, 'You are going to have to redo the whole White House, and we aren't going to be able to enjoy it, so we are just going to have to go with the flow.'\" \nThe 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star went on to state her husband, with whom she has two-year-old daughter North and is expecting a baby son in December, never told her he was going to announce his plans to run for President at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 30. \nWhen asked if she knew about is prepared speech, Kim said: \"I did not. That was news to me.\" \nEllen hit back with surprise: \"So he never discussed with you he wanted to run for president one day?\" \nKim replied: \"That was not a discussion in our household. He is serious and I believe he is serious and I know that if he puts his mind to something he will do his best. \n\"I don't know if that was planned and I just didn't know about it or if he came up with that idea right then and there.\" kanye west", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:35:21.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
