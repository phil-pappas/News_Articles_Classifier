(Photo: Robert Voets, CBS)\n17 CONNECT 87 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Summer drama Extant won't be back for a third season.\nThe Halle Berry sci-fi thriller, which arrived to much fanfare in 2014, rebooted its story this season, but still was unable to attract a sizable audience. It averaged 6 million viewers per episode in its second summer, which concluded with what is now the series finale in early September.\nHowever, Berry will stay in business with CBS behind the camera as executive producer of a legal drama, Legalease , that is now in development. That series will focus on a biracial lawyer from Chicago whose work takes her to New Orleans, where she partners with \"a good ol’ boy white attorney while working in a very particular justice system that will ultimately expose the biases we all harbor,\" according to a show description.\n“CBS, Halle Berry and the producers have decided to conclude the Extant story after last season’s exciting and fitting conclusion,” CBS Entertainment president Glenn Geller said in a statement. “ Extant played an important role in expanding CBS’s lineup of original scripted programming in the summer. We are proud of the show’s success on the network, as well as its popularity on Amazon Prime Video. We also want to thank the incomparable Halle Berry for her commitment and support for the series, and look forward to working with her on our next project together.”\nUSA TODAY\nWith 'Dome' lifted, CBS drama ends its run\nUSA TODAY\nCBS orders Season 2 of 'Zoo' for next summer\nBerry issued a statement, too.\n“I am so proud of what we accomplished on Extant ,” she said. “This season seemed such a natural place to end Molly’s journey that I, along with CBS, felt it best served the story to leave it there. I’ve loved this experience working with such a talented cast and creative team. ‎It was my first foray into episodic television, and I’m excited to continue my relationship with CBS, producing more compelling stories through my 606 Films production banner.”\nWith the departures of Extant and Under the Dome , which was canceled after three seasons, CBS' only returning summer drama is Zoo , which will be back for a second season in 2016. BrainDead , a comic thriller from The Good Wife executive producers Robert and Michelle King, will join the CBS lineup next summer.\n,\n17 CONNECT 87 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT //usat.ly/1LmeF19 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c23594e5e2bdb9b820e8a9667c942804009f7aa7/r=264x400/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800006411179632-Extant-Halle-Berry.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ea3d1ba1341141fb518181ea27d36be23c97f95/c=0-225-2723-2958/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/18/1397853402005-104591-D1758b.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LmeF19&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2da28f80048f7ac959a5f74a5899d235bf34c028/c=0-0-1320-1761&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800006411179632-Extant-Halle-Berry.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/534de11ff66aa84b6aa11030207091d24d792110/c=0-0-1331-1331/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793892166489001-Zoo-CBS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800006411179632-Extant-Halle-Berry.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LmeF19&text=CBS%20cancels%20summer%20drama%20%27Extant%27%20after%20two%20seasons&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1LmeF19"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:54:08.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
