TBS has canceled the comedy series after only one season on air, most likely due to ratings which have not grown significantly since its June premiere. The series follows a group of misfits from high school who work together at a Charlestown, Mass. barbershop called Buzzy's. A formerly unpopular kid, played by Ryan Pinkston, becomes his old classmates' boss. The series was created by \"Will & Grace\" duo David Kohan and Max Mutchnick. The pilot attracted 1.4 million viewers despite a lead-in from \" The Big Bang Theory \" re-runs. The ratings went up and down throughout the season, averaging 1.2 million. It ended its 10-episode first season in August with a high school reunion. TBS has been struggling to find a successful original comedy. The cable network recently scrapped \"Ground Floor\" and \"Sullivan & Son\" and is done doing multi-camera shows. It will now rely on \"Wrecked\" and \" The Detour \". \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:05:07.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
