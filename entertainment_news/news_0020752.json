With the cold weather on it's way, it should become a weekly essential. “Sometimes a relaxing bubble bath is all it takes to seize the day,\" explains lifestyle expert Jasmine Stringer .\nAdding a few drops of lavender oil or sea salt can enhance your bath experience. Want to step it up a notch? Stringer shares her all-natural recipe for shea butter flower bath bombs. She adds, \"To make these bath bombs successfully, it is important to have your ingredients measured out and ready to mix.\"\nYou Need:\n1 cup baking soda ½ cup citric acid ¼ cup cornstarch ¼ cup powdered milk 4 teaspoons Out of Africa Pure Unrefined Shea Butter 2 tablespoons warm honey 2 tablespoons jojoba oil or olive oil 1 teaspoon essential oil Plastic candy sheet mold Recipe:\nStep 1: Combine and stir the baking soda, citric acid, cornstarch and powdered milk in a bowl.\nStep 3: Melt the Out of Africa Pure Unrefined Shea Butter along with the honey and oil over a low heat in a small pot on the stove. The Out of Africa Shea Butter is loaded with antioxidants and vitamins A, E, & F along with healthy fatty acids and valuable phytonutrients.\nStep 4: Add the melted ingredients to the dry mixture, using a whisk to thoroughly combine everything. For an enhanced spa feel and fragrance, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil. Mix well.\nStep 5: The ingredients should begin to hold together. Working quickly, use your hands to press the mix firmly into the trays. Leave the mixture in the mold for a couple of minutes and then pop out. While one tray is drying, work on the next.\n*Tip: “I put a cookie sheet over the trays, flipped them over and then lifted the mold off. If you have anything leftover, just dry the product out, leave it loose and turn it into a bath powder. Simply leave the mixture in the bowl for 24 hours, periodically mixing the ingredients to break up the clumps. Once all of the moisture is gone, place in a mason jar with a colorful ribbon.”\nStep 6: Let the bath bombs dry overnight. The next day, place them in a decorative bag or drop 1 to 2 bombs into your tub and relax.
