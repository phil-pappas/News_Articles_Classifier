On Oct. 9, there was a reception for a new photography exhibit by Art Expressions of San Joaquin photographers Sydney Spurgeon, Angela Bardot, Em Mclaren, Arturo Vera and Charlene Martin to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Gospel Center Rescue Mission. The exhibit is a heartwarming representation of the people who have been helped by the Rescue Mission. It is available for viewing through the end of October at the County Administration Building, 44 N. San Joaquin St.. Every year, community members create altars for loved ones as part of Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) remembrances. Day of the Dead has become a celebration for all ages and cultures, a way to honor those who have died by keeping them alive in our hearts. Currently, altars are on display at the Mexican Heritage Center, 111 S. Sutter St., through Nov. 13. This year, I decided to make a community altar at the MHC in honor of artists and art supporters who have made a difference to me and to Stockton over the past 20 years. Many of these artists were members of the Stockton Art League. Researching photos and stories of their lives in the pages of Stockton Art League photo albums and online brought back memories of my early years in this city and the contributions of numerous gifted individuals who have lived and worked here. Honorees include Vince Perrin, Carl Miller, Maxine DalBen, George Ladd, Ann Anderson, Lois Hulsey, Iona Hepper, Claire Oak, James Bell, Elsie May Goodwin, Tronnie Commons, John Nagle, Vic Harris, Greg Custodio, Julia Holzer, David Humphreys, Marie Ross and Rowland Cheney. You are welcome to share photos (copies only) or stories on the Stockton artist community altar for artists you would like to remember. Bring them to the MHC and place them on the altar. Be sure to mark your calendar for the Dia de los Muertos Street Fiesta on Market Street between San Joaquin and Sutter on Nov. 1 from 2 to 6 p.m. There will be vendors, live music and entertainment, food, children’s activities and a Catrina pageant with first-, second- and third-place prizes. I would like to thank the Children’s Museum for leading a Dia de los Muertos make-and-take-skull fan activity at the San Joaquin Regional Transit District board room during the Oct. 9 ArtSplash and for the Downtown Transit Center offering their board room as an ArtSplash venue this year. Be sure to visit the Transit Center venue when the ArtSplash returns May 13 for its fifth anniversary. My greatest moment of the ArtSplash was seeing the public preview displays in the Filipino American National Historical Society National Museum on Weber throughout the evening. The room was filled with photos and stories about muralist Greg Custodio and comics artist Tony DeZuniga. There was an article about bunkhouse life and a bunkhouse recreation, WWII history, including a 1st Filipino infantry uniform from Nono Navarro, and a “Fighting Filipino” poster and other display boards and a photo showing a Stockton doorway with the sign “Positively No Filipinos Allowed.” In researching Custodio for the display, I learned he was Stockton’s first and only salaried muralist from 1974–94 painting many murals throughout the city. How about a salaried muralist in 2016 to join Poet Laureate Tama Brisbane? Some of Greg’s murals still exist, but many have disappeared. Keeping records of our history and sharing them is crucial to developing an appreciation of the past. Stockton owes a debt of gratitude to historians such as Ron Chapman for documenting the city’s history with photos, some of which were added to the FANHS display. If you have photos or information about murals painted by Custodio, contact me. Newspaper accounts, magazine articles, scrapbooks and photos help bring our history to life for future generations. — Joy Neas is an arts advocate and coordinator for ArtSplash.
