Jones claims Weezy, as the hip-hop star is also known, threatened to kill him after a concert at the Darien Lake Performing Arts Center when he stopped to get gas in Buffalo en route to the next day's show in Indiana.\nAccording to TMZ , the lawsuit accuses Lil Wayne of cursing on the bus, threatening to pistol-whip Jones, and encouraging him to fight several times. The Grammy winner allegedly cocked a gun and pointed it at Jones from close range, telling everyone else on the bus to back up and demanding to be taken to his hotel \"now.\"\nJones, who's been driving for the Young Money and Cash Money record labels (also known as YMCMB) since 1999, tells syracuse.com the rapper may have been high on drugs at the time.\n\"Sometimes the asshole in him comes out,\" Jones said.\nHe wants to act like a thug, Jones added.\nLil Wayne performs onstage at the Tidal X: 1020 Amplified by HTC concert at the Barclays Center on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015 in Brooklyn, New York. Mark Von Holden | Invision | AP Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., served a year in prison in 2010 after being caught with a semiautomatic weapon on his tour bus in 2007. Jones says he was driving that bus and was arrested, but didn't know about the weapon at the time.\nJones, who grew up in New York and lives in Maryland, says he's been arrested seven times while driving tour buses.\nJones, seeking unspecified damages for false imprisonment, assault and emotional distress, said he waited until after the tour was over to file his lawsuit. TMZ reported earlier this week that the pair had reached a settlement -- though Jones disagrees with the celebrity gossip site's figure of $75,000 -- but the \"Lollipop\" hitmaker hadn't paid yet and a second lawsuit was filed.\nJones said he hasn't driven for Carter since last summer's alleged death threat, but still drives tour buses for YMCMB artists like Birdman, Lil Wayne's mentor. He says he might've gone back to work for Weezy if he apologized, as they've known each other a long time.\n\"I was there before his first album,\" Jones said. \"I was there when his daughter came home from the hospital.\"\nCarter has released 12 studio albums as Lil Wayne, beginning with \"Tha Block Is Hot\" in 1999, as well as collaborative projects with Young Money and the Rich Gang. His biggest hits include 2008's \"A Milli\" and \"Got Money,\" 2010's \"6 Foot 7 Foot,\" 2013's \"Love Me,\" and the No. 1 smash \"Lollipop.\"\nJones' website for How We Roll tour buses still lists Lil Wayne among his \"repeat-customer roster of recording artists,\" and touts his 35-plus years of \"dependability, experience, and discretion\" as owner and operator.\nYoung Money Entertainment was not immediately available for comment, and its parent company Universal Music Group did not respond to requests for comment.\nNote: Video contains explicit lyrics.", "external_links": ["http://howweroll.biz/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/skN5U4dlmrE?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:40:40.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
