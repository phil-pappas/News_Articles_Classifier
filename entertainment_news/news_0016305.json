In an interview with Playboy , Danielle said the two of them got together after filming a sex scene.\nDanielle and Erin met on the set of the movie Kill Your Darlings , in which he played Allen Ginsberg while the poet was a student at Columbia University. And while the movie generated a lot of buzz for his gay sex scene in the film, it was another one with Erin that would change his life.\n In one sexy/mostly awkward scene, Erin's character, Gwendolyn, comes on to Ginsberg in the stacks at the library. \"That's a wonderful record of us flirting for the first time,\" Daniel said. \"There's no acting going on — not from my end, anyway.\" He said that the rapport between the two of them was genuine from the start. \"There's a moment when she makes me laugh, and I'm laughing as me and not as my character,\" he said. \"She was incredibly funny and smart. I knew I was in trouble.\"\nMore From Cosmopolitan He also told Playboy that when he visited her family in Michigan, it was a media circus — so much so that the Detroit Free Press called her father to ask if they were getting married that week. \"I suddenly had that moment of, 'Oh, my weird life is now impacting your life,'\" he said. \"I felt really bad. Wonderfully, they found it funny.\"\nHere's the (NSFW) scene that started it all, but fair warning: You will never be able to think of Harry Potter the same way again.\nFollow Marie Claire on Instagram for the latest celeb news, pretty pics, funny stuff, and an insider POV. ​ ​", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/marieclairemag", "http://www.eonline.com/news/465042/bye-bye-harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-talks-gay-love-scene-in-kill-your-darlings-watch?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-celebritynews&utm_source=eonline&utm_medium=rssfeeds&utm_campaign=rss_celebritynews%20", "http://www.playboy.com/articles/20q-daniel-radcliffe"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:44:24.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
