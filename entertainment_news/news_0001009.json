In a new interview with Andy Cohen on \"Watch What Happens Live!\" on Thursday, October 15, she admitted that she counts her and Barton's memorable kiss as her favorite girl-on-girl smooch she's ever done. \"I will say that when we were doing 'The O.C.', I really thought we were doing a responsible thing by showing two, young, sweet girls, in a real relationship -- not just having, like, a sorority girl splash happy makeout,\" Wilde explained of her character Alex Kelly, a lesbian who gets into a relationship with Barton's character, Marissa Cooper, on the FOX hit series. \"It was a real, loving, sweet relationship, and it was two young women.\" Wilde continued telling Cohen, \"I joke about inspiring a generation of young lesbians, but I do think it represented an alternative lifestyle for young women that I don't think had been fairly represented enough in young, soapy drama.\" She then added, \"So I'll say, 'Mischa, two thumbs up.'\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:47:57.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
