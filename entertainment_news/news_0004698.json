However, it's the smaller planets that are more likely to host life. Life trumps largeness during this trine of Jupiter and Pluto. It's the small things filled with meaning and vitality that send our hearts orbiting anew.\nARIES (March 21-April 19). Your senses are dialed up, and so are your sensitivities. When it's wonderful, you wish they could feel it like you do, and when it's bad, you wouldn't wish it on anyone.\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). Studying is but one tenet of learning. Generally, it also takes eyes-on and hands-on experience -- and an element of suffering, too -- to really understand and totally absorb the information.\nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). In the future, you'll be honored for the contributions you make today, none of which will seem too remarkable as single acts, but they'll add up to a beautiful collection of kindnesses.\nCANCER (June 22-July 22). You'll get to know what a person is really like. The filter of your wishes and expectations of what you want the person to be like will fall away, and you'll see the person for who he or she is.\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). Think about it: The thing that started out as a unique experiment is now part of your daily life. What do you think the future will bring out of today's experiments?\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). There's enough wishy-washy energy out there in the world. What everyone needs now is your decisiveness. Be specific, direct and brief. You'll make everything easier.\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). Too much information jams the communication lines. That's why the people who can be succinct have an advantage. It takes more thought to say fewer words, but it will be worth it on this intense day.\nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). Even though it's a fun escape, the fact is that dreaming about who you want to be is in some ways a rejection of who you are. Make short-term plans to advance and yet still honor your current position.\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). You've come a long way and achieved many aims, and yet in many ways it still feels like you're paying your dues. Your humility and modesty let you learn more than the ones who come in assuming they already know.\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). The cynics hailed from ancient Greece and were not the most popular sect around -- they despised society, and society despised them right back. Avoid cynicism today, and you'll come out unscathed.\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Extreme situations bring out the extremes in people. What if you didn't count the best and the worst you saw in someone? The day-to-day middle ground, that's where the basic nature rests.\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Curious people learn more; determined people let nothing stand in the way of knowledge. Smart people? Well, that depends on how much curiosity and determination they possess, as well.\nTODAY'S BIRTHDAY (Oct. 11). Your year will sparkle with novelty and strange coincidences. You'll find yourself slightly more superstitious as you follow a mystical calling. Adhering to your own rules and beliefs will carry you to a place of your dreams. December and May are your luckiest times, and you'll hit upon bonus resources. Capricorn and Virgo people adore you. Your lucky numbers are: 40, 2, 33, 38 and 15.\nFORECAST FOR THE WEEK AHEAD: The opposition of the sun and Uranus starts this week off with an interesting tension. The sun is in harmonious Libra, the sign of relationships. Uranus is in aggressive, impulsive Aries -- possibly the most intense place for this revolutionary planet. The implication is a tug-of-war between our compromising, social, \"get-along\" selves and the part of us that wants everything to suit our individual needs. The bottom line as to what you're willing to compromise and what you aren't could suddenly become clear. Final decisions will be made, but not without a fair amount of deliberation.\nThe new moon in Libra will be a fresh start. Then the moon enters Scorpio to throw doubt, mystery and fog over our choices. If you didn't have trepidation, it would bode ill for your intelligence. In other words, you're afraid because you're smart. Also, you'll work through that fear because you're bold.\nDo you ever feel like you're growing and shrinking at the same time? That may very well be the sensation that rules the weekend, considering the funny little situation between Mars and Jupiter. Just know that bigger isn't always better.\nCELEBRITY PROFILES: \"Shameless\" star Joan Cusack rose to fame alongside her brother, John, in such movies as \"Sixteen Candles\" and \"High Fidelity.\" Libra is the sign of relationships, and with the sun and Mercury in the communicative sign, Joan Cusack takes pride in strong family bonds. Look for her in the upcoming comedy horror flick \"Kitchen Sink.\"\nTo write to Holiday Mathis, visit www.creators.com and click \"Write the Author\" on her page.
