A jury in August awarded Jordan $8.9 million from the defunct Dominick's supermarket chain for using his name in a similar 2009 ad. Dominick's has asked that the verdict be overturned. \nBoth sides in the Jewel case said they are ready to go to trial in December. But U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman told them that given the Dominick's judgment they both may have an interest in a quick resolution. \nJordan said he would give the award money to charity. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:35:48.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
