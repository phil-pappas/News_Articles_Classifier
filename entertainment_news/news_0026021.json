The free event is now in its 29th year locally and will include a resource fair, refreshments, music by Storywood, candlelight vigil and march. \nLSU Director of Women’s Center Summer Steib said the event originally started “to raise awareness about violence against women and to get community members talking about these issues.” \nNo specific people will be recognized, but campus and community leaders will be on hand to provide remarks. There will also be an opportunity for survivors of violence to speak. An active bystander intervention will be encouraged for people who may witness violence or potential violence to step in and provide assistance.” \n“We encourage community members to participate and show their support by coming out to the event and becoming more informed about these forms of violence and the services that are available in our community,” Steib said.
