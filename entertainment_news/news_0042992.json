Patnaik launched the party’s 12-days padyatra programme at Ganganagarpalli in the city here.

During the padyatra, BJD leaders would go to nook and corner of the state and highlight state government’s achievements and alleged negligence towards Odisha by the NDA government at the Centre. During the padyatra, BJD leaders would apprise the people how the state government had been implementing promises being made during the elections, Patnaik said. Stating that state government has taken steps for overall development of the backward districts, Patnaik said, the Centre has stopped providing assistance to several ongoing central sponsored schemes. “BJD is committed to protect the interest of Odisha,” he said. Coinciding with BJD’s Padyatra, opposition BJP also staged ‘Satyagrah’ across 147 assembly constituencies spread across the State. BJP’s State unit President K V Singhdeo, who participated in the satyagraha at the party headquarters here, said, “The party is highlighting the success of the central government and the failure of the BJD government in Odisha.” \n 26 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:32:58.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
