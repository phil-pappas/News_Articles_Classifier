Comment   Writer Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 10:01 AM Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 10:01 AM YREKA Brookdale Senior Living is a national sponsor of the Alzheimer’s Association Walk to End Alzheimer’s. This walk is the world’s largest event to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer’s care, support and research. Held annually in more than 600 communities nationwide, this inspiring event calls on participants of all ages and abilities to reclaim the future for millions. Together, we can end Alzheimer’s disease, the nation’s sixth leading cause of death, stated a press release from Brookdale Senior Living. Brookdale Yreka will host a drive-through barbecue on Saturday, Oct. 24 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to raise funds in support of the Alzheimer’s Foundation. There will be a donation box available and checks can be made payable to the Alzheimer’s Association. Brookdale staff will be cooking hamburgers and hot dogs on the front lawn at 351 Bruce St., Yreka. There will be live music to listen to while enjoying lunch. Their goal is to raise $500 to contribute to the Alzheimer’s Foundation, so come by and support Alzheimer’s awareness, and enjoy lunch and the music. Executive Director Monique Dixon reports that, “Here in Yreka we have a wing of apartments dedicated to care for individuals with Alzheimer’s or dementia.” She added that “While we are grateful for the opportunity to provide this service in Siskiyou County, there is always a waiting list for available apartments.” Anyone interested is welcome to tour the Brookdale facility at any time.
