Photo: Pat Scala \nMelbourne may have won the title of world's most liveable city yet again, but its CBD skyline does not impress leading British architect Amanda Levete.\n\"I think that Melbourne has a long way to go, particularly in its commercial buildings,\" Levete said. \"I look at the skyscape here and it needs buildings of more significance, more quality, more consideration and that are of Melbourne.\n\"I think that Melbourne needs to work to develop its own language of place.\"\nShe also suggested taxing developers who put up poor quality buildings.\nAdvertisement \"If there wasn't that quality, you have to pay a certain tax if it's their intent to make a quick buck without the consideration of the public realm.\"\nLevete, who has been commissioned to design the Victoria and Albert Museum's London expansion, made the comments at the opening of MPavilion 2015 at the Queen Victoria Gardens, opposite the National Gallery of Victoria on St Kilda Road, on Monday.\nHer London-based AL_A firm was commissioned by the Naomi Milgrom Foundation to design the second iteration of the temporary architectural installation, which will host a public program of free talks, workshops and performance until February 7. \nIt's the third significant temporary pavilion to go up in Melbourne in as many weeks, with the Melbourne Festival hub and the NGV's architecture commission both nearby. But Milgrom, who last year commissioned award-winning local architect Sean Godsell to design the first MPavilion, insists Melbourne can support another.\n\"I think Melbourne people really love them,\" she said. \"One of the oldest pavilions in Melbourne built in, I think, 1850 is up there on the corner of Lithgow Avenue; we have many. Temporary pavilions have been part of Melbourne's history forever.\"\nAs with Godsell's 2014 MPavilion, Levete's design is open to, and even embraces, Melbourne's fickle elements.\n\"The analogy was a bandstand,\" Levete said. \"It was a place for people to congregate, to meet, for chance encounters, to have a coffee, for a program of cultural events.\"\nLevete's MPavilion consists of a canopy of three and five metre-wide, wafer-thin translucent \"petals\" that stand on slender columns.\n\"It really works with the weather, that it responds to the weather, that it sways very gently in the wind, that there's light and shade,\" she said. \"Rain coming through the edges is part of the event.\" \nBut creating a structure without walls presented a series of challenges, which Levete said required a greater degree of engineering and research.\n\"It's much harder to do something that's seemingly fragile and also that moves yet is still very strong,\" she said. \"It has to withstand very high winds and be structurally stable.\n\"It's rather like an aeroplane wing. If it doesn't move, you're in trouble,\" she said.\nLED lights will twinkle through the canopy at night, and speakers are built into the 95 carbon fibre rods that prop the structure up. \nLevete said the finished product had surpassed her expectations, which she credited to the Australian firm mouldCAM, which fabricated the canopy of 13 large and 30 small petals that are just millimetres thick.\nThe inaugural 2014 MPavilion attracted more than 60,000 visitors.\nLevete said there was a growing awareness in Britain of the importance of design in the every day as well as a \"cultural activator\".\n\"Architecture, if you like, is the most concrete of the arts and most public,\" she said. \"It's there for a very long time and, you know, you don't have to use the building, you can pass by it. We all work and love and play in buildings and it's our most ubiquitous art form.\"\nLevete said Melbourne's much-vaunted liveability could also be expressed in its built environment.\nIn comments that will grate on Melbourne ears, she also emphasised the importance of the Sydney Opera House.\n\"That was a grand building of epic proportions and so powerful it's become completely synonymous with the identity of Australia,\" she said.\n\"So when I learnt about the debate on whether to spend the money to improve the acoustics â€¦ it seems to me whatever it costs, it costs [and] you have to do it. It's so significant.\"\nmpavilion.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:53:38.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
