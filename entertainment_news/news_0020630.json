Museum director William Chiego and his wife took them through the exhibit, which features 50 works by the Spanish-born artist known for bold, colorful compositions. \nChiego said the Spurs point guard spent a lot of the 90-minute visit looking at the sculptures and enjoyed identifying the disparate objects Miró used to create them. \n“There’s one piece that looks like it has a grill attached to it for maybe cooking something, but (Parker) knew immediately it was something used in France for drying clothes,” Chiego said. “So that was very interesting, because Miró spent a lot of time in Paris.” \nThe couple had to leave because they had dinner reservations, but not before making a stop in the education area where visitors can make their own sculptures. \n“I told them they needed to come back and make something,” Chiego said. “(Parker) wanted to come back and bring his mom. We hope they will.” \n“Miró: The Experience of Seeing” is at the McNay Art Museum, 6000 N. New Braunfels, through Jan. 10. \nlsilva@express-news.net", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:59:14.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
