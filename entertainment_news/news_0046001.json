The Saints were 10-1 last year.\n\"I didn't set out to be a football coach,\" Sister Lisa told CBS News. \"I mean, I came here to be a sister -- to be a nun. I came here to answer my vocational call.\"\nShe had coached at the high school level before becoming a nun. But even after taking her vows in 2012, the call of sports was strong.\nSister Lisa Maurer is an assistant football coach at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minnesota.\nCBS News \"There was a football team practicing right out my backyard, so I would just wander out there, maybe say the rosary, walk around practice 'cause I wanted to hear the whistles,\" she said.\nHead coach Kurt Ramler got to know her.\n\"And I was like, 'Wow! Here's an incredibly intelligent, passionate person that knows her football,'\" Ramler said. \"'I wonder if she could help the team in other ways.'\"\nSo Ramler offered her a job on his staff.\n\"So when all of a sudden this gift was given to me, I didn't -- I was like, 'I want to do it but I probably shouldn't do it because I am a sister,'\" she said.\nDoes has a nun on the sidelines require some sort of adjustment by Ramler?\n\"Well, I don't swear as much as most football coaches, I guess,\" he responded.\nOn game days she hands out the prayer she's written for the team -- whose winning record suggests the prayers are effective.\nSister Lisa Maurer prays with St. Scholastica players before a game. CBS News\nShe works with the practice squad and the kickers, including freshman Donovan Blatz, who talks with Sister Lisa about more than just football.\n\"Oh yeah. All the time,\" Blatz said. \"She always asks about my girlfriend, all of my family, see how they're doing. Just we, we communicate. Just not about football all the time, which is nice.\"\nHer rapport with the young men is clear.\n\"It's not just about football. It's about teamwork,\" Sister Lisa said. \"It's about, you know, doing the best. It's about having pride in who we are, looking out for one another. I give that to them.\"\nShe added, \"Isn't that awesome that I get to do -- I get to pray and be a football coach. That's pretty cool.\"\nAnd she's pretty good at both.", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/aca6af42-d49a-4452-a73e-83671c1b2653/thumbnail/620x350/45d1347478b99842d3c3b5cbdafb21a5/nun-football.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/29/53cab690-40d3-44a1-bd87-de1910740574/thumbnail/620x350/676dcdfa2fa1b93b25f1334ef4780217/nun-football-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:26:17.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
