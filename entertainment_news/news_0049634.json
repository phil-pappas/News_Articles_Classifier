With Paul Feig's female-driven \" Ghostbusters (2016) \" less than a year away from its release, the studio has been already busy working on an untitled Ghostbusters animated film. According to The Tracking Board , the studio is developing the animated movie with Ivan Reitman tapped to produce through his Montecito Picture Company. Kristine Belson and Michael Lachance will oversee the project for Sony Pictures Animation. The site reports that the animation will follow a group of scientists fending off ghosts and ghouls in Manhattan. No director or stars have been announced and the studio is currently seeking a screenwriter for the project. This is not the first time that the ghost-hunting team has got cartoonified. Previously, there were TV series entitled \"The Real Ghostbusters\", aired from 1986 to 1991, and \"Extreme Ghostbusters\" that debuted in 1997. It's not surprising that Sony turns a live-action movie into an animated film as the studio also develops an untitled animated Spider-Man movie with Philip Lord and Christopher Miller. While fans are waiting for the animated version of \"Ghostbusters\", they can anticipate the all-female reboot starring Melissa McCarthy , Kristen Wiig , Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon that will hit U.S. theaters on July 15, 2016. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com Warning : mysql_num_rows() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /home/aceshow/public_html/php/bs_nview.php on line 567 Leave a Comment Required fields are marked with *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:07.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
