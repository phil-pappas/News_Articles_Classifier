For starters, the sparkling finale to Prokofiev's First Symphony, the so-called \"Classical,\" was stunning — clean, crisp and some of the Philharmonic's best work in some time. Then there was 25-year-old violinist Benjamin Beilman, who gave such a soulful reading of the brooding Sibelius Concerto. And to cap things off, Rachleff led the orchestra in a glowing rendition of Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" Symphony, the composer's ode to the world of chirping birds and thunderstorms. Rachleff led off with the Prokofiev, which only got better as the piece unfolded. Textures were clear in the opening movement, with its Mozart-like cast, and the lilting slow movement was perfection. But the players just clicked for the blistering final movement, setting the tone for the rest of the program. Beilman, who took part in the Kingston Chamber Music Festival a couple of years ago, was all business in the quirky Sibelius. He was passionate, even dramatic but never showy, tossing off blazing scale passages without breaking a sweat. And he's just got an intuitive sense of how a phrase should go. The opening bars of the first movement, set against shimmering stings, were haunting. I suppose Rachleff could have wrapped things up with more of a bang had he ended with Beethoven's Seventh or his ever-popular Fifth. But this performance of the laid-back Sixth did the trick. And that's because it had heart. There was something almost religious about the rolling finale. This was an unhurried, spacious performance that let some of Beethoven's most tuneful melodies soar. But there were moments of rawness in the rollicking \"gathering of country folk\" section, and Rachleff pulled out all the stops for the fourth-movement thunderstorm. All in all, this was one of the more satisfying programs the Philharmonic has given of late, both in terms of repertoire and talent. cgray@providencejournal.com (401) 277-7492 On Twitter: @Channing_Gray", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/channing_gray"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:45:51.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
