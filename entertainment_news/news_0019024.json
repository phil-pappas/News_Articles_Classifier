A further statement will be made in the morning. \n\"The band apologise to the fans and wish Liam better.\" \nLiam's bandmates tweeted to fans disappointed at missing out on the show. \nHarry Styles wrote last night: \"Deepest apologies to everyone at the show tonight in Belfast. Very disappointed, but unfortunately these things happen. We're very sorry.\" \nLouis Tomlinson added: \"We're so so sorry for what happened, it was out of our control Lots of love to Liam and thank you for being so understanding.\" \nTV presenter Eamonn Holmes aired his dissatisfaction with the situation on Twitter, writing: ``I don't care who was sick in #OneDirection Direction. Rest of them should have had the decency & maturity to appear on stage and explain.'' \nAfter One Direction fans reacted to his tweets, he added: \"For all of you who can't read , I didn't ask for £OneDirection to Sing , I asked for them to Apologise in person to fans who turned up.\" \nHe then replied to another tweet saying: \"It's just a question of taking responsibility and being respectful. That's all.\" \nFan reactions on social media ranged from anger to get well wishes. \nOne fan questioned it all, asking: \"Remember when Howard from Take That broke his ribs and the rest of them went on without him?! Take note £onedirectionbelfast\". \nAnother wrote: \"Not to be selfish but I flew home from uni for this, so kinda hoping for the best tomorrow.. £onedirectionbelfast £GetWellSoonLiam\". \nReferring to the scores of heartbroken teens, one fan commented: \"I've never heard so many hearts break at one time £onedirectionBelfast.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:15:23.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
