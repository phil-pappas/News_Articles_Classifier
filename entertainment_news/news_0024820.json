Hatmaker says he didn't start watching The Walking Dead series until it was late in the third season. After realizing what all the fuss was about, he binge watched the first couple of seasons and devoured the comics. Following Hatmaker's viral internet hit of the custom Batman finished Schecter guitar , he decided to create another custom graphic electric guitar using old comics. Deciding what he would create wasn't much of a challenge. Having all The Walking Dead comics laying around, he went with designing a guitar from them.\nThe idea was born, but what guitar was Hatmaker going to use? Being an employee of the pro audio company Seismic Audio Speakers, he decided to present the idea to the owner, Steve Acree. Acree informed Hatmaker that Seismic was about to be selling their own build-your-own guitar kits. Together, they decided that Hatmaker would use one of the kits for the guitar and Seismic Audio would give it away to one lucky person when it was finished.\n\"It is pretty cool to create something from things you enjoy and have other people appreciate it as well,\" commented Hatmaker.\nAccording to Hatmaker, he is excited that Seismic Audio will be giving away the guitar to someone who is a fan of The Walking Dead. The giveaway, which ends October 31, 2015, can be signed up for at http://www.SeismicGuitars.com .\nIn addition to Seismic Audio, Hatmaker is also grateful for Seymour Duncan who has always provided quality pickups, which are featured in this guitar.\nSeismic Audio Speakers is a leading manufacturer of Pro Audio Speakers and Accessories. They recently launched guitar kits in which you can use to build your own custom guitar and finish it however you want. These kits, plus everything Seismic Audio has to offer for the musician on a budget, can be be found at http://www.SeismicAudioSpeakers.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZWlzbWljYXVkaW9zcGVha2Vycy5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS8wNC9zY2hlY3Rlci1ndWl0YXItY3VzdG9taXplZC13aXRoLWJhdG1hbi1jb21pY3Mv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zZWlzbWljZ3VpdGFycy5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:49:52.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
