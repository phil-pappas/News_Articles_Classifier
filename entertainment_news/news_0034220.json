Although there wouldn't actually be blood as he is planning on cutting Robert's oxygen tube in the hospital... but sure you get the idea. However Adam is shocked by Cain's plans naturally enough and warns Zak about what's going on, but can he get to his son on time to stop him? Meanwhile, Harriet suggests that Ashley should ask Sandy to move in with them, but he is nervous about trying to convince his father that it would be the best place for him. Elsewhere, Paddy spends the day drinking in the Woolpack... not like him. Is he trying to drink away a guilty conscience perhaps?? We'll soon find out as tomorrow is the much anticipated flashback episode where we go back to the night Robert was shot and finally see who pulled the trigger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:50:29.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
