And considering none of the cast had acted before, there are some impressive performances, especially by Marie Wawa and Mungau Dain​ as the couple whose love is threatened by tribal conflict.\nTanna is the latest example of a promising new stream in Australian film – filmmakers reaching out into the region to tell collaborative stories in foreign languages, joining The Rocket in Laos, Ruin in Cambodia and Arrows of the Thunder Dragon in Bhutan. \nBold vision: Nicholas Hope in Bad Boy Bubby. \nThere was a full spectrum of experiences in the first four days of director Amanda Duthie's second Adelaide festival. And they were not all as warm in every sense as Tanna. \nBad Boy Bubby , Rolf de Heer's​ bold 1993 drama about a loner who breaks out of the dingy room he shares with his sexually abusive mother and discovers a disturbing world, had an immersive first-ever screening with binaural sound. \nDe Heer's experimental approach to the film included using 32 cinematographers during the shoot and having star Nicholas Hope wear binaural microphones sewn into his wig so the soundtrack resembles what Bubby hears as he emerges into a dark modern world. \nThe audience wore headsets for the screening in an old Waterside Workers hall in Port Adelaide, near where the film was shot.\nWhile the film held up well, the experimental sound was most effective as Bubby discovered the modern world, recoiling at the sound of bagpipes, touching lives in a home for the severely disabled and performing like a demented Nick Cave with a punk band. \nThe shock value might have receded but the dark comedy behind the film's best-remembered scene – Bubby clingwrapping his cat – still works. \nThe Indigenous dance film Spear , which had its world premiere in Toronto last month, was another festival highlight.\nAs the Tanna cast left the cinema on Sunday, they were greeted by four Aboriginal dancers who were part of the festivities before Stephen Page's feature film directing debut, which led the director to joke that the red carpet felt like a United Nations world Indigenous conference. \nBeautifully shot by Bonnie Elliott,  Spear is an abstract film made up of dance pieces in a warehouse, tunnels, a prison, a rock platform by the ocean and other less specific locations.\nWhile it has no direct narrative, it gradually emerges as a story about an Aboriginal youth, Djali (Hunter Page-Lochard), observing troubling visions of contemporary Aboriginal life before seeming to find his own place in the world.\nThe ABC is one of its backers but the cinema is the natural home for a haunting experience that features dancers from Page's Bangarra Dance Theatre. The most potent segments feature a ranting, broken figure, Suicide Man (Aaron Pedersen), who describes himself as living between two worlds with a heart that's in neither.\nThere is also a jokey vaudeville-style scene, watched in apparent horror by Djali, as Indigenous dancers perform to that old song My Boomerang Won't Come Back .\nA film that will be compelling for some viewers but a challenge for others was backed by the festival's Hive Fund, which commissions ambitious projects that explore art on screen. It will have special event cinema screenings over summer. \nThe festival continues until Sunday, with highlights expected to include the world premiere of Remembering the Man , a documentary about the real couple behind Holding the Man;  a restored version of Storm Boy; and another Australian film telling a story from the region, Tom and Sam McKeith's​ Philippines boxing drama Beast .\nThe writer was a guest of the festival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:52:29.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
