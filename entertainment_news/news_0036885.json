In one recent scene, for example, KGB agent Elizabeth goes off on a standard 80s liberal spiel about the Nicaragua war, complete with hypocritical sympathy for Catholic nuns and dissident journalists. Oliver North, of all people, was even given a writing credit on an episode this season.\nBut let’s also appreciate the subtle conservatism of a number of other high-profile shows on TV right now. I’ve already argued that Netflix’s otherwise mediocre “House of Cards” appeals to a conservative impulse by making the Washington elite — and Democrats in particular — look so thoroughly criminal. Likewise, HBO’s delightful “Veep” focuses on a morally bankrupt Democratic vice president and her hapless, unethical aides. The lefty writer Jonathan Chait has argued that the latter’s skewering of too-powerful oil lobbyists makes it an example of small-screen liberal propaganda. This ignores how today’s conservatives truly despise the K street crowd, and have their own critiques of Washington influence peddling that fit nicely with Veep’s.\nBeyond overtly political shows, there’s also the send-up of limousine liberal tech billionaires on HBO’s “Silicon Valley.” The heavy on that show is an obnoxious, Eric Schmidt-esque progressive who keeps new-age gurus on retainer. One of the sometime heroes is an eccentric genius who’s clearly based on libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel. And the show’s creator is Mike Judge, a social satirist who has never done much to hide his libertarian leanings. (In Judge’s most recent film, the protagonist is a factory owner who must contend with his employees’ attempts to unionize and bankrupt the company with personal injury suits.)\nAnd Judge isn’t the only celebrated righty filmmaker who recently signed a TV deal, either. Whit Stillman, a one-time writer for the American Spectator whose films have defended upper bourgeois values and mocked the violent ignorance of European leftists , has been tapped to make a pilot for Amazon.\nThere’s also the measured celebration of pre-socialist Britain on “Downton Abbey”, which has earned knocks from progressive pundits who see the show as too conservative. My colleague Matt Lewis argues that the fantasy show “Game Of Thrones,” despite all its hyperviolence and casual nudity, has a somewhat conservative message as well. Ross Douthat, meanwhile, has made the case that HBO’s “Girls” works as a social conservative commentary on liberal sexual mores.\nNow, are any of these shows intentionally conservative? With the possible exception of Judge’s “Silicon Valley” and whatever Whit Stillman is cooking up, I’d say no. Much like Tina Fey’s “30 Rock,” “Veep” and “House Of Cards” feel conservative, in large part, because they’re so relentlessly cynical about what conservatives would consider the liberal ruling class. But conservatives would do well to see how some of their ideas still have traction in the culture at large, if only because it’s making for some fine TV.\nFollow Will on Twitter\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100142", "http://spectator.org/blog/29411/whit-stillman-says-he-was-blacklisted-directing-tv", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyCaller", "https://twitter.com/willrahn", "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/daughters-of-the-revolution/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109219", "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/downton_abbeys_right_wing_worldview_benevolent_rich_people_caring_for_servants/"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:58:46.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
