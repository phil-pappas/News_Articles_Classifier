We are talking about Jack Bauer here.\nThere is no way, for a multitude of reasons, the man with a never-ending cellphone charge and the bladder of a blue whale will perish tonight.\nHe’s already saved a president’s life this season. Somehow, Jack has also kept Chloe alive and well for nearly seven seasons.\nHe can’t die. Right?\nWith the Russians in pursuit and the Chinese in his sights, Jack has quite the conundrum on his hands with London being the site of this latest bloodbath.\nEither Jack will live, or he won’t. But he’ll probably live because that is what Jack Bauer does, incredibly.\nJack is known to have eight lives. But does he have nine?\nThat will be answered at, give or take, 9:57 p.m. EST tonight.\nStay tuned.\nTags: Jack Bauer Share TOP Hide Comments Show comments Loading, please wait...
