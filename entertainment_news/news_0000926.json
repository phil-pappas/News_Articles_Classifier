Head to Caffe Rom, a local coffee shop chain with three downtown locations, for the Maple Freeze, a decadent blended coffee drink that's the color of a Halloween pumpkin.\nThe rich drink ($6 for a medium; $6.50 for a large) blends Caffe Rom's Italian coffee, made from Arabica beans, with maple spice syrup, whole milk and ice to achieve a smooth, creamy texture and amply caffeinated finish. Topped with a pillow of whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon, the Maple Freeze is the liquid version of a perfect autumn day. No puffy coat required. 71 S. Franklin St., 312-379-0291; 180 N.
