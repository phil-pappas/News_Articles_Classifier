I think everyone will find someone who reflects their opinions and it’s going to be up to me, I’m going to have my hands full trying to balance everyone but there will be opinions there for everyone. \n“One of my jobs is going to be to try and extract the most coherent, pointed opinion from each of them to try and drill down on what they really think.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:16:13.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
