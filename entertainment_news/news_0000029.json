Danbury native Kelly Gleason part of national tour of ‘42nd Street,’ on stage at Waterbury Palace 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nWhen Danbury native Kelly Gleason , 20, saw that auditions were being held for a national tour of “42nd Street,” she knew she had to try out for it. The quintessential backstage musical was the first Broadway show she ever saw, and it’s her favorite. \n“I remember showing my dance teacher the playbill ... and said, ‘This is what I want to do,’ ” she said. \nA classic, “42nd Street” comes to the Palace Theater in Waterbury this weekend. Gleason, a triple threat, nailed her audition — which attracted hundreds of girls — and looks forward to seeing friends and family when the show runs Friday and Saturday, Oct. 9 and 10. More Information \nPalace Theater, 100 E. Main St., Waterbury. Friday, Oct. 9, 8 p.m.; Saturday, Oct. 10, 2 and 8 p.m. $64, $57, $52. 203-346-2000, palacetheaterct.org \nThe song-and-dance fable features tunes such as “We’re In the Money,” “Dames” and “I Only Have Eyes For You.” Based on a novel by Bradford Ropes and Busby Berkeley’s 1933 movie, it tells the story of a starry-eyed young dancer named Peggy Sawyer who leaves home and comes to New York City to audition for the new Broadway musical “Pretty Lady.” \nGleason, who auditioned in February and started rehearsals in August, spoke about the production in a recent phone interview, just before its opening in Salt Lake City. She’s in the ensemble, and said this is the first time she has ever been part of a national tour. \n“I get to be in all the big dance numbers, which is the best part,” she said. “In the opening number everyone is auditioning. It’s 1933 during the Great Depression, and we all want to get a paycheck. It’s a huge tap number and it’s lively and exciting — one of my absolute favorite parts of the show.” \nJoining the production meant taking a leave of absence from her studies at Pace University , where she had been pursuing a degree in commercial dance. \n“It was a big decision to leave school, but I couldn’t pass up this opportunity because the director (Mark Bramble) and choreographer ( Randy Skinner ) of the tour won a Tony for Best Musical Revival when they did ‘42nd Street’ on Broadway in 2001.” \nGleason said that because Bramble also co-wrote the original script in the early 1980s, he knows the show down to the last letter. \n“He really has a special idea of what the show is supposed to be because he has been with it since the beginning,” she said. \nBramble instructed cast members to research the Great Depression and share stories about what they had learned at the start of their rehearsals, Gleason said. Bramble shared interesting stories, too. He told the cast how he got the idea to make “42nd Street” into a musical after seeing the movie, which starred Ginger Rogers . \nAlways in love with with musical theater, Gleason has been in many shows over the years, including “Crazy for You” and “Chicago.” She started with ballet lessons as a young girl and quickly moved on to tap and other dance styles, at schools such as FineLine Theatre Arts in New Milford. She also studied voice and acting. \nAn only child, Gleason recalls listening to soundtracks from shows and choreographing them in her family’s kitchen. She even drew admission tickets to give to her parents. “I was that kid who’s always saying, ‘Mom, dad, you have to come watch this!’” \nAs for her favorite number in this weekend’s show, she said it’s “42nd Street.” \n“I love how iconic it is,” Gleason said. “Everyone knows 42nd Street.” \nltucciokoonz@newstimes.com; Twitter: @LindaTKoonz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:34:50.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
