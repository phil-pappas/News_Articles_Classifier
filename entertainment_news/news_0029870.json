Their backs were turned while waiting for drinks, but she heard the bullets rip and immediately dropped to the ground.\n\"We just were standing there and then we heard the shots, and then we all got down,\" 26-year-old Gaure told the Fort Myers News-Press . “When we all picked our heads up to check on each other, we saw him lying there on the sidewalk.\"\nThe sound of gunfire at 11:45 p.m. sent hundreds of panicked dancers and concertgoers at the evening’s packed zombie-themed event — some masked and even costumed like the living the dead — fleeing for their lives .\nSome attendees hid on the ground inside businesses, refusing to come out until they knew for certain it was safe, the Naples Daily News reported .", "external_links": ["http://www.naplesnews.com/news/crime/zombicon-shooting-raises-security-concerns_30852252", "http://www.news-press.com/story/news/2015/10/18/what-you-need-know-zombicon-shooting-victim-expavious-tyrell-taylor-zombiecon/74175940/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:46:06.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
