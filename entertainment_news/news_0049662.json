While no baby's arrival date is guaranteed, sources say that Kim K. is planning on a scheduled C-section for safety reasons, so friends can break out the holiday wrapping paper for those baby shower gifts. (Might we suggest a \"Do Not Open Until X-Mas\" maternity t-shirt?) \nDuring an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday, Kim added that she and Kanye West \"haven't decided on a name,\" for the baby boy yet, but didn't totally discount Ellen's suggestion of \"East Meets West.\" \n\"I do like the name Easton,\" she said. \"I don't think my husband likes that name, but I do like it. I don't think we'll go another direction.\" (So they will go in another direction, then. See what we did there?) \nMight we expect a seasonally inspired name? Jesus? (Yeezus?) Or if the reality star wants to start her own tradition of keeping the same first initial for her kids: Nicholas or Noel (it is her middle name, after all)? \nWeigh in with your yuletide Kardashian-West baby name suggestions!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:41:40.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
