(AP Photo/Dan Steinberg, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â€” \nFormer teen idol David Cassidy has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with an expired tag after a crash in Florida last month. \nThe Sun Sentinel (http://tinyurl.com/oyqlj59 ) quotes police as saying that the 65-year-old Cassidy sideswiped a truck and then tried to cover his license plate before driving away with a flat tire. The charges were filed Wednesday. Authorities said witnesses identified Cassidy as the driver in a photo lineup. \nCassidy's lawyer, Jason Forman, says the police report is riddled with inconsistencies. He says Cassidy gave police his driver's license and registration before leaving the scene. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 27. \nCassidy, who starred in \"The Partridge Family\" television show, lives in Fort Lauderdale. He filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. \n___ \nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com \n___ \nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/ Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:34:51.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
