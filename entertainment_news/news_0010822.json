He will bring a street studio to Camden for PopTech. \nCamden — As part of its annual conference Thursday through Saturday, Oct. 22 through 24, PopTech has planned a number of free-of-charge opportunities for the greater Midcoast Maine community to participate in. Included is a pop-up mobile street studio Thursday and Friday from noon to 2 p.m. on the Camden village green. \nPopTech is a 19-year-old global nonprofit organization that creates gatherings to foster collaborative initiatives and provide unique learning experiences for participants. Over the past 10 years, the organization has hosted a number of programs in the United States and abroad that have exposed various communities to the diverse expertise that surrounds the organization in areas such as global health, emerging technologies, humanitarian aid and social entrepreneurship. \nThe PopTech street studio is a participatory experience featuring Found Sound Nation, a collective of musicians and artists who leverage the power of creative sound-making to help build strong, just, healthy communities around the world. The studio will be manned by Christopher Marianetti, who was a recipient of the 2011 PopTech Social Innovations Fellowship and is returning to curate the music for this year’s PopTech. \nNo sign up is required. Those who stop by will have an opportunity to interact musically with global styles by fellows of the new OneBeat project including a Balkan vocalist, a Serbian/Romanian accordionist, a Russian beatboxer and a Kenyan hip-hop artist. OneBeat, an initiative of the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, employs collaborative original music as a potent new form of cultural diplomacy.
