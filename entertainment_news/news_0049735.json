Innuendo, anyone?” \nThe 37-year-old continued: “I’m pretty sure if one of the male dancers had brought out a calendar pouring milk over himself, he wouldn’t have reacted in the same way.” \nJames also claimed the pay discrepancy between the judges and the dancers is unfair.

They are training for up to 14 hours a day. Meanwhile, the judges are reportedly getting £110,000 for one day a week,” he said. \nOla was paired with Olympian Iwan Thomas, until they were voted out in the first week of eliminations. \nCraig previously said dancers should not be allowed to feature in glamorous calendars. \nHe told Woman: “There has been talk about banning dancers from doing sexy calendars and I think it’s a good idea.

Fitness shoots are fair enough but sexy calendars aren’t what the show is about.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:53:23.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
