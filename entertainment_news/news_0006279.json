I'm still discovering myself and in the competition, there are some amazing singers and I feel like I need more time to get better myself, as I don't feel like I'm strong enough.\"\nBleasby continued: \"Moving forward, without being 100%, would have been selfish on my part because I would have stopped someone else who was at 100% vocally from going further in the competition. Hopefully given time, I could get there with more time to grow artistically and vocally.\"\nThe young singer praised BBC Radio One's Grimshaw as a \"fantastic\" mentor, and thanked those who had backed him since his first audition back in August.\n\"Nick was incredible, he was so supportive and for him to give me a chair was a huge boost of faith,\" Bleasby said.\nShare article \"It was just an amazing feeling, but I was still having the doubts about myself and I didn't want to be in the competition when I was having those doubts because I would have just sunk. Nick is a fantastic mentor and I really want to thank him for all his support.\"\nThe X Factor will confirm what will happen now with the boys category and Judges' Houses soon.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-13T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:21:23.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
