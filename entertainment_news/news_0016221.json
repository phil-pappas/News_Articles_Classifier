The craft beer taproom and bottle shop has a rotating selection of beers from across the nation and world, along with a small selection of bar bites.(Dan Rosenstrauch/Bay Area News Group) ( DAN ROSENSTRAUCH ) It's a Friday evening, sun sinking in a pink-orange sky, cool weather on the patio, children playing across the street at Concord's Todos Santos Plaza, and I'm sipping a Toaster Pastry (the Pop Tart-inspired India Red ale from San Leandro's 21st Amendment Brewery). This is living. \nOh, and boar jerky. Can't forget the boar jerky. \nConcord's Hop Grenade, open for a little more than a year in a prime location downtown, has quickly become a popular gathering spot for beer lovers, and with good reason. A constantly rotating selection of craft beer, with an emphasis on California's best among the 21 taps, attracts drinkers hoping to try the best brews. A generous bottle selection adds to the bounty, and a small kitchen offers snacks such as the jerky ($6/7/8 for beef, buffalo or wild boar), a small cheese board ($10), handmade Bavarian pretzels ($3.50) and more. Advertisement \nFor a heartier appetite -- or to soak up some of that booze -- try one of several flatbreads with pizza-type topping lineups; the signature ($9) has marinara infused with beer, smoked pancetta, red onion, garlic and mozzarella. A partnership with Pleasant Hill's delicious Slow Hand BBQ means you also can chow down on a rich smoked brisket or corned beef sandwich ($9.50). \nThe Hop Grenade also partners with brewers near and far to host special tasting and pour events -- and yes, that's a radio station in back. Tune in -- or watch live -- radio shows on The Brewing Network, which is run by Hop Grenade owners Justin Crossley and Scott Moskowitz. -- Daniel Jimenez, Staff Address: 3136 Sacramento St., Berkeley \nContact: 510-547-6699 \nHours: 5-10 p.m. Monday-Thursday, noon-10 p.m. Friday-Sunday Picnic tables line the front terrace at this appealing Berkeley beer garden, owned by Mike and Amy Voisenat, who also run the Hobnob in Alameda. There's a parking lot right out front, but the asphalt view is mostly hidden by fencing and hanging plants. From here, you can watch the game on a flat-screen TV that hangs next to the chalkboard beer menu, as you sip a Heretic Evil Twin ($4), perhaps, or a Ghost Town Final Rites Rye ($4), or another brew from the rotating selection. \nMoxy's fare gives a nod to the genre with sausages and, during Oktoberfest season, specials such as schnitzel and sauerbraten, a German-style pot roast. But Moxy is best known for its tasty takes on burgers and fries. \nDon't miss the Moroccan lamb burger ($10), a tender, delicious thing topped with pickled onions and a feta-spiked aioli, and served with fries or a nicely dressed arugula salad. Bratwurst ($8) arrives tucked in a roll, topped with sauerkraut and pickled peppers, with a side of parsley-flecked truffle fries. Craving more fried awesomeness? Crisp onion rings ($5) shatter at first bite. Yum. -- Jackie Burrell, Staff Address: 252 Main St., Pleasanton \nContact: 925-425-0217 \nHours: 4-10 p.m. Monday, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday, until 11 p.m. Thursday and midnight Friday-Saturday All the action's out back at Pleasanton's new suds joint, where the backyard buzzes with action. With its rows of long picnic tables and party lights, McKay's summons up your favorite Munich biergarten. You won't find liter-size beer steins, but there are plenty of big German pretzels and tall glasses of beer, drawn from 24 taps of local craft brew and beer from further afield. We enjoyed a tart, refreshing Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin IPA ($8) and a crisp, hoppy Lagunitas Pils ($6). \nLike any good beer garden, McKay's is family friendly, with bags of building blocks and other fun games on the tables and a children's menu with grilled cheese, burgers and hot dogs. \nThe tasty food arrived quickly -- and the Bavarian pretzel ($5), served with a creamy beer-cheese fondue for dipping, disappeared almost as quickly. We loved the slightly charred texture of McKay's grilled romaine ($7), highlighted with olive oil and lemon juice. One of the most popular items here -- and justifiably so -- is the Jack Daniels smoked tri-tip sandwich ($12). Its smoky sweetness went well with the tangy horseradish-goat cheese spread. And the bratwurst sausage platter ($13), served with crunchy sauerkraut and kettle chips, will keep us coming back for our Bavarian fix, sans plane ride. -- Mary Orlin, Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:09:00.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
