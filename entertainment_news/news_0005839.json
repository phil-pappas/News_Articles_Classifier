When they’re sold at auction next June, four Matt Groening colorized drawings, which hark back to the origins of his now-iconic animated TV family, “The Simpsons,” will net thousands of dollars each. According to Dana Hawkes of the international auction house Bonham’s, that estimate could be pretty low-ball. \n“This was hard to estimate, because they were never printed or produced,” Hawkes said of the drawings, which her research showed to be the result of a class project at the Evergreen State College, where Groening was a student from 1974-77. “I had to come up with an estimate I thought was right, but because of the nature of them, coming so early in his career, they could really take off.” \nRegardless of the winning bid, it’s going to be a windfall for Atwood, a well-known and established Bremerton artist. She bought the pieces on a shopping safari with a visiting friend at the Bremerton St. Vincent de Paul. The price tag was 25 cents each. \n“I go to Vinnie’s once a week — that’s my store,” said Atwood, who, on the week in question, had her friend, Irene Gordon Dobbyn of Hollywood, Fla., in tow. “We were just digging around, and Irene found them. She knew I’m a real ‘Simpsons’ fan and showed them to me, and of course I bought them.” \nIt wasn’t until the next day that Atwood starting really thinking about what she’d brought home, a dollar lighter in the pocketbook. \n“I started looking at them and thinking, ‘What if they’re originals?’,” she said. \nThe four panels feature various Simpsons looking fully evolved — a skateboarding Bart already has achieved the age of 10 (which he has, through the magic of television, maintained ever since). But the characters are depicted in locations found around the Evergreen campus, well-known venues in and around Olympia. \n“I thought, ‘Man, these are real,’” Atwood said. “‘What do I do now?’” \nAtwood’s daughter, Chelsea Sebastian saw the actual drawings on a visit to Bremerton last July, and immediately knew her mom was into something historic, and potentially lucrative. \n“I was kind of flabberghasted when she showed them to me,” said Sebastian — also an artist, who lives with her husband and two children in Wellesley, Mass. “I was excited about them. I didn’t know if she wanted to sell them; I thought they should be in a museum, showing where this creative genius got his start.” \nAfter she returned to the East Coast, Sebastian worked on contacting the leading auction houses, and last September found an attentive ear in Hawkes, who specializes in animation art and entertainment memorabilia for Bonham’s from her base in nearby Gloucester. \n“Because she was so nearby, I could drive down to see them,” Hawkes said of the drawings. “I see a lot of ‘Simpsons’ cells and drawings, but this was something different. This was something he did very early in his career, so there’s a historical context about them. The fact that (the characters) stylistically hadn’t changed is what struck me.” \nGroening might’ve produced the drawings during his Evergreen days, but “The Simpsons” didn’t emerge until nearly a decade later, when he was approached by James L. Brooks, the producer of “The Tracey Ullman Show,” about working up a series of short films to incorporate into the sketch-comedy format. That was in 1987, and “The Simpsons” made the jump to their own half-hour Fox Network show two years later. “The Simpsons” began their 27th season on September 27, easily the longest-running series in American scripted primetime television history (it passed “Gunsmoke” way back in 2009). \nAtwood said she still has trouble wrapping her head around what’s happening with the four drawings, which were originally intended only as the latest addition to the collection of “Simpsons” memorabilia liberally scattered around her West Bremerton home. \n“It’s so incredible to me that I could find something like this just doing what I do normally,” she said. “I love what the stores like Vinnie’s do, how they’re so much a part of the community. I love shopping local.” \nThe drawings are destined for an auction of animation and comic art in June in New York. Hawkes said she’s still filling the roster of auction items, which could include anything from studio animation cells to props or wardrobe items used in movies. \nHow much of a stir the neo-”Simpsons” drawings cause among collectors is anybody’s guess, according to Hawkes. A ballpark figure for opening bids is in the neighborhood of $2,000-$3,000 for each one. \nAt auction, she said, the most unlikely items can suddenly be worth a fortune. \n“I had a client who had four ‘Peanuts’ dailies from 1962,” Hawkes said. “They had written to (“Peanuts” writer-illustrator) Charles M. Schulz, because they were big fans, and he sent them the dailies, for free. Schulz was notoriously generous. They ended up being lost for years, but a son found them in an old envelope, and they ended up valued at $10,000-$15,000 each.” \nAtwood’s find might not net that kind of cash, but the return — whatever that $1 investment yields — will be considerable. And the ride, Atwood said, has been priceless. \n“What an experience,” she said. “I always have fun shopping, but this whole process has really been a joy.” \nSebastian summed it up just as succinctly: “I love watching ‘Antiques Road Show,’ but to find yourself right in the middle of a thing like this is really something. It’s kind of an incredible story.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
