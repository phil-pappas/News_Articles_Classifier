The orchestra initially left open when he would start.\nOn Tuesday, it said Petrenko will take over at the beginning of the 2019-2020 season but will give a reduced number of concerts in his first year because of his duties at the Bavarian State Opera.\nPetrenko will remain the Munich opera house's musical director until August 2020, and will be a guest conductor there in the 2020-21 season.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
