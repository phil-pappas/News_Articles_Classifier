Being on a high-deductible plan and being responsible for the first $1,500 of care, if I can pay less for the same service, I’m going to stretch my money. A recent excursion into insurance land showed me that even when I think a provider or payer is being forthcoming on price, they don’t give me the information I’m asking for.\nCase in point: I wanted to know how much I would pay for the pathology on a skin sample.\nI asked the nurse where they sent samples, and she gave me the three options: An independent lab and labs run by the local Big and Large health systems.\nI called the independent lab, asking if it is part of my insurer’s network. It is.\nSo I asked for the contracted rate. Basically, that’s the amount providers agree to take from the insurer. Providers can charge any amount that pops into their head. If they want to be in network with an insurer, particularly a Big Huge Insurer that sends them lots of business, they’ll take what BHI offers. This often is referred to as the plan discount. (Regardless of what they charge, even people without health insurance could still negotiate their own discount.)\nWhen independent lab told me the contracted rate was $120, I didn’t flinch too much. I figured it would be cheaper than labs that were part of the two local health care systems, one of which has to support a medical school.\nImagine my surprise when I received the explanation of benefits from my insurer. This bit of accounting includes the amount billed by the provider (the charge), what the insurer pays (which reflects the discount, or contracted rate), and the consumer’s responsibility.\nRemember, I asked for the amount I would pay with insurance (emphasis added). I was told $120.\nI was told wrong. That was the rate without insurance – in other words, what the provider charges before the discount. With insurance, I am paying $42.37. Sometimes the difference between the charge and the price to the consumer isn’t that big.\nIt’s beyond me why they didn’t tell me the contracted rate when I asked. I was using the words they know, and since I speak the language, I figured there’d be no misunderstanding.\nBut I think the answer I received goes to the secrecy inherent in health-care pricing , something that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act address. Under health care reform, patients would be better protected and health care would be much more affordable if we could find out what we’ll pay for our care.\nThe current price of ignorance is too high.\nPatti Singer is the Clean Living reporter for the Democrat and Chronicle.
