The global linear low density polyethylene market to grow at a CAGR of 4.54% during 2014-2019.\nThe global linear low density polyethylene market can be segmented into five divisions based on type: Films and sheets, injection molding, rotomolding, pipe and extrusion, and others. Linear low density polyethylene acts as a gas barrier and prevents substances from spoiling. Hence, its wide acceptance in the packaging sector.\nGlobal Linear Low Density Polyethylene Market 2015-2019, is based on an in-depth market analysis, with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, APAC, and EMEA markets and presents the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also discusses the key vendors operating in the market.\nMany manufacturers and producers use swing technology for the production of polyethylene. By using swing technology, high density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene can be produced using the same production line. This increases the productivity of the plant, resulting in increased supply of high density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene in the market.\nAccording to the report, the global linear low density polyethylene market is witnessing a change in packaging options; manufacturers are replacing aluminum foils and metalized films with high-barrier thin films. Consumers are also looking for cost-effective methods of food preservation and polyethylene proves to be an economical one.\nFurther, the report states that the major challenge faced by the global linear low density polyethylene market is regulating carbon dioxide emissions. The carbon dioxide emitted during the process of production of polyethylene poses a threat to the environment.\nKey Vendors\n- The Dow Chemicals Company\n- Exxon Mobil Chemical\n- LyondellBasell Industries\n- Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC)\n- Sinopec\nOther Prominent Vendors\n- BASF\n- Borealis\n- Braskem\n- Chevron Phillips Chemical\n- DuPont de Nemours\n- Eastman Chemical\n- Equistar Chemicals\n- Formosa Plastics\n- Global Polymer Industries\n- Haldia Petrochemicals\n- Huntsman\n- Ineos\n- LG Chem\n- Lone Star Chemical\n- Mitusi Chemicals\n- Nova Chemical\n- NPC\n- Pemex Petroquimica\n- Petkim\n- Reliance Industries\n- Repsol\n- Sasol\n- Shanghai Secco Petrochemical\n- Tosoh\n- Total Petrochemicals\n- Westlake Polymers\nFor more information visit\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4m3p4b/global_linear_low\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\nSOURCE Research and Markets\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com", "external_links": ["http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4m3p4b/global_linear_low"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:20:33.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
