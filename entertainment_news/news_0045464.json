Brian Friel, the preeminent Irish playwright with a passion for language and hard-hitting themes, died Friday at age 86 after a long illness.\nHe leaves a rich legacy on Broadway, where he made his debut in 1966 with \"Philadelphia, Here I Come!\" It follows a young man from small-town Ireland to America.\nFriel's works charted the same path.\n\"Translations,\" among his most enduring dramas, ran on Broadway in 1995 and 2007. It was about power, imperialism and love.\n\"Faith Healer,\" seen in 1979 as well in 2006 in a revival starring Ralph Fiennes, followed a man who questions his gifts.\nThe bittersweet family drama \"Dancing at Lughnasa,\" a Best Play Tony winner in 1992, speaks with Friel's typical plainspoken eloquence. The play became a movie starring Meryl Streep.\njdziemianowicz@nydailynews.com\nTags: brian friel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:19:56.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
