Duffy looks to add to his consecutive finishing streak against the American who has recently returned to the Lightweight division following his Featherweight loss to Conor McGregor last year.\nPaddy \"The Hooligan\" Holohan is now co-headlining the event with Louis Smolka in this Flyweight clash. With both fighters tipped for potential surges up the rankings, it's not quite make or break, but it's a fantastic launching pad for two fighters coming in with identical 3-1 UFC records. The Hooligan has never had a boring fight with his one loss a back and forth bonus winner for Fight of the Night.\nNorman Parke looks to end a two fight losing streak as he squares off against Reza Madadi. A chance to impress for the Antrim man as the fight has been moved up to the main card, after the Stipe Miocic vs Ben Rothwell fight got scrapped following an injury to Heavyweight contender Miocic.\nWelterweight Nicholas Darby faces off against Darren Till, in the only main card fight that doesn't feature an Irish fighter. Then it's down to the undercard which sees Cathal Pendred, Neil Seery, and Ashling Daly face up to Tom Breese, Jon Delos Reyes, and Ericka Almeida respectively.\nThat's brings us onto the next important point.\nWhere can you watch it?\nThe entire under card is available on UFC Fight Pass and should start at roughly 5.30pm, although times may have changed due to the Miocic vs Rothwell bout being pulled.\nThe main card will be shown live on 3e and Setanta Ireland from 9.00pm.\nIf you haven't got a membership to Fight Pass already, they offer a free 30-day trial, but if that doesn't suit, you can catch 3e's build up which starts at 8.00pm.\nWhen are the weigh-ins?\nThe official weigh-ins are set for 2.15pm on Friday, and will take place in the 3Arena. We're always tentative about confirming these times as delays often happen, so don't blame us if you're sat around an extra half hour waiting.\nWho are the guest fighters?\nExpect to see a lot of Conor McGregor. He's one of the guest fighters, and he'll be getting as much coverage from ring side as the men in the Octagon that night, but he's not the only one. Former Heavyweight champ Andrei Arlovski and recent Welterweight title contender Rory MacDonald will be in Dublin all week doing media work. MacDonald currently trains at Tristar Gym, Montreal, with Joe Duffy and Tom Breese, so he's not exactly going to be a neutral. Although he has said he'd like to train with John Kavanagh in SBG.\nIs there anything else?\nWhen it comes to the actual fights? No, not really, but keep an eye out for all the media coverage that you won't be able to get access to, namely the open workouts. The guest fighters will be doing a tonne of media work during the week, as well as seeing some sights, so keep and eye out for a 6'4 Belarusian bear and a Canadian guy with half a nose who kind of looks like Patrick Bateman, they'll both make for good selfie opportunities.\nMORE: UFC Fight Night Dublin to be broadcast live on 3e\nMORE: Podcast: MMA journalist Petesy Carroll of Fightland/Severe MMA joins Mike for The Manual\nMORE: Podcast: SBG and The Ultimate Fighter: McGregor vs Faber coach Owen Roddy joins The Manual", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:09:28.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
