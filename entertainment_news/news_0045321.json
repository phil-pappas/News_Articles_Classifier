BEST OF BOTH WORLDS: Combining music and football fever for the Truman family, from Elimbah, are from left Joe, 7, Nic, 3, Kath, Dave and Ben, 5, with friend Stevo Oâ€™Neill, from North Lakes. Greg Miller \nThe Baby Animals took to the main stage around the same time the Broncos met the Cowboys at Sydney's ANZ Stadium and Brisbane man Stevo O'Neill was torn between the two. \nThe Broncos supporter returned to the music festival for his fifth year because he loved \"the atmosphere, the hype, the bands, the culture\". \nBut he said he would be making a few sneaky dashes to the bar after the kick-off. \n\"I'd like to do both,\" he said. \"We need a big screen at the main stage.\" \nWE SAY: Aura, festival, TV puts spotlight on Caloundra \nOrganisers were not of the same opinion, opting to screen the game in one of the festival bars. \n\"It's a music festival, the people who are here want to listen to the music,\" spokeswoman Allison Stockel said. \n\"The diehards are going to be at home.\" Photos \nOne such diehard was Elimbah man Dave Truman. \nMr Truman was at the festival with his wife and three young sons earlier in the day. \n\"They'll probably be out here watching Baby Animals but I'm definitely going home to watch the game,\" he said. \n\"I might not see another Queensland grand final in my lifetime.\" \nTickets are still available for the final day of the festival today, featuring Kate Ceberano. caloundra", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:03:27.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
