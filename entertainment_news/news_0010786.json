His opponent is Republican Bruce Castor, the former prosecutor who is trying to win back his old job.\nSteele's new ad attacks Castor for not charging Cosby in 2005 when a woman said the comedian had drugged and molested her at Cosby's gated house in Cheltenham. Dozens of women have since made similar claims.\n\"Bruce Castor had an opportunity to bring charges and he failed to do so,\" Steele said in the 30-second spot that debuted Tuesday, two weeks before the election.\nThe two men are locked in a close race. Castor called the ad the work of a \"desperate candidate.\"\nHe had announced at the time that he didn't have enough evidence to bring charges against Cosby and this year said the woman has changed her story over the years.\n\"If the allegations in the civil complaint were contained with that detail in her statement to the police, we might have been able to make a case out of it,\" Castor said last month. In a tweet the same week, he called her alleged discrepancies \"troublesome for the good guys.\"\nSteele on Wednesday called Castor's comments about accuser Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee, \"a shining example of his attitude about victims and his judgment in an important case.\nEthics rules, Steele said, prevent him from commenting on whether he would prosecute Cosby before the 12-year deadline for filing felony sex-assault charges expires in January, or if he would pursue the case if he inherits it from District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman.\nFerman, who is stepping down to run for judge, has vouched for Constand's consistency without confirming that an investigation is underway. She recently said of the case that \"prosecutors have a responsibility to review past conclusions ... when current information might lead to a different decision.\"\nCosby, in a deposition released this year, confirmed that he had sexual contact with Constand but called it consensual.\nCosby has denied wrongdoing and reached a confidential settlement with Constand after a judge compelled him to answer deposition questions about his sexual encounters, prescription drug use and other topics. He acknowledged that he had obtained quaaludes in the 1970s to give to women with whom he hoped to have sex.\nCosby enjoyed a 50-year entertainment career capped by his role as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the top-rated \"Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His accusers now say they were assaulted as far back as 1965.\nSeveral are suing him for defamation over his denials of their claims. Those lawsuits are pending in Boston, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
