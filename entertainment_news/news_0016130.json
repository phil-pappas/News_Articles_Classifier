The show is its 35th production since 1984.\n“We’re a big company, but we’re not about the big budget, the big lights, the big this, the big that,” says Laprise, “Kurios” writer and director. “We are that emotional and collective experience.”\nSet in the second half of the 19th century, “Kurios” centers on an inventor who is convinced that in his larger-than-life curio cabinet an invisible world of crazy ideas awaits. The audience meets the Seeker while he’s cranking up a machine he’s invented in the hopes of traveling into that hidden realm.\nBut the machine malfunctions.\nInstead, the inhabitants of that invisible world appear, turning his weird and wonderful world of mechanical contraptions and gizmos upside down much like “Kurios” has done for Cirque.\nSince it premiered last year, the show has garnered rave reviews. The Toronto Star called it “Cirque du Soleil’s strongest act in years.” But perhaps it’s best summed up by the Denver Post, which said “Ooh. Ahh. Whoa. Zowee.”\n“It’s not a show, it’s ‘the’ show for me,” says Laprise, who was in Los Angeles recently to accept a Proto Award for “Inside the Box of Kurios,” a mobile virtual reality experience — available at show concessions starting next year — that takes users inside the cabinet of curiosities.\nThe big tent\nLaprise wants “Kurios” to rub off on people in the same way his first encounter with Cirque rubbed off on him, chasing a “mysterious, world beat” sound through the streets of Quebec City that ended at a tent.\nIn those days, there were no fences or security guards to prevent him from sneaking a peek. Lifting the canvas, Laprise caught a glimpse of the performers during a dress rehearsal.\n“I cried,” he says. “It was like I had discovered there was a richer world and something more meaningful, more mysterious.”\nAdvertisement\nIn good weather, Laprise often gives passersby a taste of “Kurios” by stationing a musician and two characters on the Big Top.\n“Even if they don’t buy a ticket, I want people on the street and from a distance to see it,” he says. “I want them to think anything is possible, because now everything seems possible. And I want people to feel that, not in a cheesy way but in a profound way.”\nIn his homage to the traditional three-ring circus, a little ring rolls out with a master of ceremonies who introduces invisible circus performers. The invisible acrobats swing on the trapezes. The audience hears an invisible high-diver climb the ladder and onto a diving board, which quivers (he’s too scared).\nThe master of ceremonies turns to the audience and they chant the diver’s name: Giu-sep-pe!\n“When you have 2,700 people clapping their hands and screaming the name of an invisible character to give him courage, it gives me shivers,” he says. “And when he jumps in the water and everybody claps, there’s nothing that compares to it because they believe. This show is about that.”\nWhere to watch\nWhen: Opens at 8 p.m. Thursday and continues through Nov. 29.\nWhere: Orange County Fair and Event Center, 88 Fair Drive, Lot G, Costa Mesa.\nWhen: Dec. 10-Feb. 7.\nWhere: Dodger Stadium, Parking Lot 1, Los Angeles.\nTickets: $50-$290\nInformation: 877-924-7783, www.cirquedusoleil.com/kurios\nAbout the Author Reach the author at sandra.barrera@dailynews.com or follow Sandra on Twitter: @sandrabarrera18 .\nFull bio and more articles by Sandra Barrera Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151012/FEATURES/151019848/EP/1/1/EP-151019848.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=8", "https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/kurios", "http://twitter.com/sandrabarrera18"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:41:36.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
