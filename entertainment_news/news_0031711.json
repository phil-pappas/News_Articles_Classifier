They've been boring, bland, and lacking any kind of individuality that we previously saw fighters showcase on their walk to ringside.\nNow Reebok have released some more UFC clothing, and the backlash has been even worse, but for different reasons. Their plan to release a t-shirt for Irish fans which would allow them to \"show your UFC territorial allegiance\" backfired, as they left Northern Ireland off the map placed centrally on the shirt.\nI don't like to swear on social media but what the FUCK are Reebok doing. \"Show your UFC territorial allegiance\" pic.twitter.com/mfiEk1bGrH\n— Andrew McGahon (@andrewmcgahon_) October 21, 2015 As you can imagine, it's caused a bit of a stir on social media, but we won't go into the back and forth of it all, you can search for that yourself if you really feel the need. We think Severe MMA's Andrew McGahon summed the whole thing up perfectly, so we'll just leave it at that. Well said.\nEverybody can have their own beliefs regarding Ireland as a nation. But a company like Reebok should never release a shirt like that. Idiots\n— Andrew McGahon (@andrewmcgahon_) October 21, 2015 *Update*\nReebok have since pulled the shirt from the online store, probably due to widescale criticism from the public, but these tweets from Conor McGregor's coach and SBG owner, John Kavanagh, wouldn't have helped either. At least that's over, for now.\nonly seeing this now. its about the dumbest idea i've ever seen. working on it. pic.twitter.com/3FiCA1gj8y\n— Coach Kavanagh (@John_Kavanagh) October 21, 2015 An incredibly insensitive stupid divisive idea. Its removed by the end of the day or SBG is gone. I expect a sincere apology to Irish fans.\n— Coach Kavanagh (@John_Kavanagh) October 21, 2015 MORE: UFC Fight Night Dublin to be broadcast live on 3e\nMORE: Here's everything you need to know about the UFC's Fight Night Dublin on Saturday\nMORE: UFC announce a return to Dublin with a show this October", "external_links": ["https://t.co/3FiCA1gj8y", "https://twitter.com/John_Kavanagh/status/656830585214750720", "https://t.co/mfiEk1bGrH", "http://www.reebok.ie/ufc-ireland-map-tee/AZ3909.html", "https://twitter.com/andrewmcgahon_/status/656775810133696512", "https://twitter.com/John_Kavanagh/status/656826009950535680", "https://twitter.com/andrewmcgahon_/status/656778987725832192"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:02:19.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
