There are several people that work during the day, they will send or bring lunch for the day workers. Some of the day workers take turns making lunches for everyone. It’s real camaraderie here,” said Firth, who has helped out at the festival for 35-40 years. \nJust to give a sense of the volume of food made, here are numbers Firth has been tracking along with Sally Hallis, also a member of the core committee. \nAs of last week, the volunteers had made 3,500 tiropitakia (the phyllo cheese turnovers) and as many dolmades, the rice-and-beef stuffed grape leaves served with lemon sauce. They baked more than 7,200 melomakarona, the honey-dipped cookies coated in crushed walnuts, and almost 10,000 koulourakia, the crisp cookie formed into a twist and coated in sesame seeds. Those paximathia, the Greek version of a biscotti? About 4,600. \nThere are several ways to dine at the event: \nSEATED DINNER : Salad, string beans, rice pilaf, bread, and coffee or tea come with each dinner served at tables in the dining hall. Baked chicken ($12) will be served Friday-Sunday. Baked white fish ($12) will be served Friday-Saturday. Roasted lamb ($14) is served Sunday only. Cash or credit for dinner. \nDINING TENT: This is the way grazers like to dine. Exchange cash or credit for tokens that can be used at the a la carte booths in the huge dining tent outfitted with long communal tables (unused tokens can be turned in for cash). Find gyro sandwiches ($6); calamari with skordalia sauce ($6); Greek fries ($4), Greek salad ($4); pork souvlaki ($5); loukaniko sausage ($4) and fresh-fried loukoumathes ($3). The pastry case at the rear of the dining tent holds more than a dozen kinds of pastries priced $1-$3. \nKITCHEN WINDOW: Exchange tokens for rice-stuffed dolmades and cheese turnovers (2 for $3), served Friday-Sunday. Spanakopita (spinach and cheese turnovers) will be served Sunday only, $3 each. \nUPSTAIRS BAKERY : Packaged pastries in small or larger boxes, including trays of baklava and assorted pastries by the dozen, and sweet bread. \nSue Kidd: 253-597-8270", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:52:37.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
