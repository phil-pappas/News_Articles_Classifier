TAVISTOCK GOOSE FAIR, DEVON, October 14 \nTavistock Goose Fair in West Devon dates back to the early 12th century, and has been a fixture in the calendar since then. \nMore recently the emphasis had moved away from livestock, with the Goose Fair focus falling firmly on the fun fair and the phalanx of traders from across the country who descend on the town selling a wide range of goods. \nNow that is changing, with livestock and local produce making a comeback thanks to the annual open day at Tavistock Livestock Centre on Goose Fair day, which this year is on October 14. \n2. SENSATIONAL 60'S EXPERIENCE, HALL FOR CORNWALL, TRURO, October 14 \nStep back in time and relive the original classics such as, I'm into Something Good, Out Of Time, Everlasting Love, Bend Me, Shape Me, Young Girl plus many more, performed by five of the most influential artists of the 60's. \nStarring Chris Farlowe, Herman's Hermits, Steve Ellis (voice of Love Affair) New Amen Corner, Union Gap UK and hosted by Alan Mosca from Freddie & The Dreamers. \nVisit www.hallforcornwall.co.uk \n3. TWO MOORS FESTIVAL, DARTMOOR AND EXMOOR, October 15 to October 25 \nTwo Moors Festival celebrates its 15th anniversary with a star studded line up of musicians and singers, many of whom have played with the world's best orchestras and at major concert halls all over the world. \nA real coup for the festival this year is a 70th birthday recital by Russian pianist Elisabeth Leonskaja, one of the last of the great Russian School.

CIDER AND APPLE FESTIVAL, KILLERTON HOUSE, DEVON, October 17 and 18 \nMonths of apple picking across all 500 acres of orchards on the Killerton estate culminates in a two day family festival to mark National Apple Day. \nSparrow Park orchard is festooned with bunting, stalls are scattered between the apple trees, and live music drifts in and out of the shade. The amazing smell of a traditional hog roast will greet you at the gate, tempting you to try all sorts of tasty local food produced right here on the Killerton estate. \nLive music will conjure up a magical atmosphere and will have you dancing round the apple trees. A juggler and magician will entertain the crowds on his unicycle and Killerton cider bar will be serving up the estate's award-winning cider, cider cocktails and mulled cider. \nTradition is at the heart of the weekend, with traditional orchard management, cider production and conservation all being celebrated. You can even bring a small bag of your own garden apples to press into a bottle of juice to take home or follow the orchard trail to witness a 200 year old farm press and a piece of history in action. \nA local tree nursery will be selling fruit trees and offering specialist advice for home growing. \n5. PLYMOUTH INTERNATIONAL BOOK FESTIVAL, DEVON, October 15 to 21 \nThe Plymouth International Book Festival is back once again, bringing words and books to life across Plymouth.
