Comment   7:13 PM Updated at 10:41 PM   7:13 PM Updated at 10:41 PM On Thursday's Vampire Diaries , Bonnie goes on a road trip with Damon ( Ian Somerhalder ) and Alaric ( Matt Davis ) to track down Oscar ( Tim Kang ), the missing member of Lily's family. But according to star Kat Graham , Oscar won't be like the other Heretics. And, in a lucky turn of fate, Oscar also knows a few things about the Phoenix Stone, knowledge which could come in handy if Bonnie can stop Damon from killing him in time to hear what he has to say. Check out everything Graham revealed about Oscar, what's next for Bonnie and Damon and more below: How do you think Bonnie has been changed by everything that happened last season? Kat Graham: I think she's definitely more weighted, but I also think she's somebody who feels that she has to protect herself and that she's kind of lost everything that she could have possibly lost. So I think that she now has, not necessarily a Wild West perspective, but she's a force to be reckoned with at this point. She's not scared of anyone. She'll do what she needs to do to get what she wants. Do you think she has any regrets about killing Malcolm after the chain of events that it set off? Graham: No. Personally, I think Bonnie always wishes that the non-violent approach always wins. But Bonnie's also fought really, really hard to get back to Mystic Falls and get back alive, and she's not going to let some hybrids take over the town. I think that if killing a character means protecting the town and protecting innocent people, she'll do it. Which is a very different Bonnie. It's a more Damon-philosophized Bonnie. Damon won't think twice about it, and they've spent so much time together she also starts to have similar perspectives as Damon. \"Let's just do it. Let's just get it down. Whatever it takes.\" How The Vampire Diaries will be stronger than ever in a post-Elena world What's next for Bonnie and Damon's relationship? Graham: In the episode airing Thursday, Bonnie, Damon and Alaric head to Myrtle Beach and they go down to get more information. Damon has his reasons for going to Myrtle Beach. Alaric has his in terms of the Phoenix Stone. So you'll get to see their journey together and we have a lot of scenes together. It gets a little violent. Page 2 of 3 - Damon is out for blood now that Lily ( Annie Wersching ) has Elena's body. Will Bonnie try and rein him in a little or join him in the quest to kill Oscar? Graham: I can't reveal what Bonnie will do, but I will say that she's all about protecting that coffin as well and she doesn't want to let anything happen to it. So that's coming up in the next episode. We'll see how she deals with Lily and the history of that, which is really cool. What can we expect from Oscar? Is he different from the other Heretics? Graham: He is different from the other Heretics. I actually really like the character a lot. The actor that plays him has been doing a phenomenal job and he's very, very cool. Not what you expect at all, which is very cool when you open the door and you first see this Oscar character you're taken aback. And what Oscar says is even more surprising because there's a whole twist with this Oscar character as well that people are going to be a little thrown by. The Vampire Diaries: Don't expect a Bonnie-Damon hookup soon The Phoenix Stone seems key to everything that's happening this season. What can you reveal about what the visions Bonnie's been having might mean? Graham: Obviously there's a link between the visions and the Phoenix Stone. I can't say what happens with the Phoenix Stone, but it's definitely going to be very relevant in the upcoming episodes. So this is the initial introduction to what this stone is and learning about it and what it's going to do and the effect it's going to have on all the characters moving forward. How will Bonnie react once she finds out Alaric didn't destroy the Phoenix Stone? Graham: I think that because they're so close if he's anything outside of honest, it's really going to affect their relationship. She's not very happy and Bonnie doesn't take that sh--. But we'll see if he mans up. Matt ( Zach Roerig ) got rightfully upset at Bonnie when she nearly killed him last week. Will their friendship become at all strained going forward? Graham: I don't know if their relationship is going to be strained because everyone's almost killed Matt a few times. This is probably my first time almost killing him. Usually, I'm the one saving him. So I think I get a pass. But I will say that they do team up to uncover something else that is happening at the school later on. Page 3 of 3 - We still haven't seen Bonnie's flash-forward yet. What can we expect from that? Graham: It's really exciting, and you'll get to see a new love interest. It's in Episode 5. I'm really proud of that episode. It was directed by Kellie Cyrus. I can't give away too much. It's really cool. It's one of my favorite episodes of this season.
