The actress teamed up with Sandra Pelletier, CEO of WomanCare Global , on a digital series that launched today on Funny or Die: \" If You Don't Tell Them, Then Who Will ?\"\nShe stars in the comedy videos alongside Whitney Cummings and Joy Bryant, and the three tackle misconceptions about women's health by chatting freely about things like birth control pills, IUDs, and condoms. Some highlights include Jessica talking about her \"super vagina,\" admitting she would guzzle birth control pills if baby noises came out every time you opened a pack, and sharing an anecdote about her period while using a hormone-free IUD.\n \"I would have to set a timer and change the tampon every two hours because I would bleed through everything. It was like shark week.\" Jessica promised \"unfiltered\" when she announced the partnership earlier in September — ​ and that's exactly what we got. Check out the three hilarious videos below.\nMore From Cosmopolitan", "external_links": ["http://www.funnyordie.com/embed/53109473f3?_cc=__d___&_ccid=qw5i9z.nvg27i", "http://www.funnyordie.com/WomanCareGlobal?_cc=__d___&_ccid=qw5i9z.nvg27i", "http://www.womancareglobal.org/who-will/resources/", "http://www.funnyordie.com/embed/99f67ff11c?_cc=__d___&_ccid=qw5i9z.nvg27i", "http://www.funnyordie.com/embed/b8152a221a?_cc=__d___&_ccid=qw5i9z.nvg27i", "http://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/news/a30489/jessica-biel-womancare-global-partnership/"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:52:42.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
