Keep reading to find out who ...\nAs Jo ( Camilla Luddington ) and Alex ( Justin Chambers ) share a tender moment in bed, Jackson ( Jesse Williams ) and April's ( Sarah Drew ) morning is getting off to a much less romantic start. Sick of sleeping on the couch, Jackson tells April it's time for her to move out. This turns out to be easier said than done. \"For better or worse,\" she calls after him, reminding him of the vows they took and refusing to give up on their marriage.\n路 TV Listings\n路 TV Recaps\n路 Video Guide\n路 Photos TV Guide Photo Galleries The Wildest Game of Thrones Fan Theories Out There Right Now The Most Badass Women of Tarantino Movies, Ranked Celebrity Halloween Costumes That Might Even Be a Little Too Sexy More\nMeanwhile, Meredith ( Ellen Pompeo ) is getting frustrated with the other two members of her carpool trio, Maggie ( Kelly McCreary ) and Amelia ( Caterina Scorsone ), who are perpetually late to the car - and/or naked, in Amelia's case. On the way to work, Maggie goes through her mail and finds out that her ex from radiology, Ethan (remember him?!), is getting married - because she gets an invitation to his wedding. Rude. (Also, apparently they dated for six months (?!?!) last season, which got lost in the show's huge post-Derek's death time jump.)\nGrey's Anatomy : Here's everything you need to know about Season 12\nHandsome Intern is paired with Alex on peds, and makes it known that that wasn't his first choice. Their first case is of newborn twins, both of whom have massive cancerous tumors on their livers and need transplants. Unfortunately, while the babies' father is a donor, the mother isn't, and two donors are needed in order to save both babies. It falls on Alex to decide which one will get the transplant.\nSpeaking of Alex and babies, remember that tease from last week? Turns out Jo is, in fact, pregnant - but Stephanie ( Jerrika Hinton ), not Alex, is the first person she tells. Rather than coming straight out with the news, Jo asks Alex in the elevator whether or not he wants to have kids (is anyone else surprised they haven't had this conversation already?) and he says he isn't sure. Wrong answer, Alex! \"I just don't know if we're there yet,\" he later tells Arizona ( Jessica Capshaw ), who posits the obvious theory that Jo's asking him because she's already pregnant.\nNoticing that Maggie and Callie ( Sara Ramirez ) both made stink-faces when looking at her new contract, Meredith discovers that she's being low-balled, salary-wise, for the chief position. At the wine-fueled dinner party that ensues, Maggie and Callie tell her she deserves more and Maggie realizes that she may have blown things with Ethan - and goes on a Chardonnay-fueled rant involving her move to Seattle and aliens. \"I have nothing and no one wants me,\" she concludes, before heading to bed with what's left of her bottle of wine. (\"I really do like her,\" Amelia notes. \"She makes me not the crazy sister.\")\nVIDEO: Grey's Anatomy plot or Florida news story? We quiz the cast!\nWhile Ben ( Jason Winston George ), Alex, Arizona and Handsome Intern are working around the clock to find a solution to their twins case, Jo finds a receipt from the fertility clinic that Alex and Izzie went to when Izzie wanted to freeze her eggs. She gets upset upon realizing that Alex wanted to have babies with Izzie, but apparently is more on the fence about having babies with her, and spearheads the \"what are we doing here\" conversation with Alex - who fortunately has a perfect excuse to walk out mid-discussion: the \"real babies\" that are waiting for him back at the hospital.\nThere, Alex has a heart-to-heart with Meredith about the decision he has to make between the twins, whose test results indicate that neither is more viable than the other at this point. \"What if one of them becomes a serial killer and one's going to cure Alzheimer's?\" he ponders. He wants to pass the decision off to Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ), but after a heartfelt pep talk from Arizona, he decides to perform surgery on both babies to inspect the tumors up close and make a call. The parents name the babies Emma and Daniel. Before the surgery, Handsome Intern tells Alex that his peds aversion is not because he hates kids, but because he can't handle the inevitable responsibility of having to break parents' hearts with bad news. This does not bode well.\nAlex decides that the liver is going to Emma, but he's going to try to save Daniel's liver as well. As Bailey looks on from the observation deck, Webber ( James Pickens Jr. ) confronts her about Meredith's low salary offer (and gives us all a lesson in wage inequality in the process). Bailey's response? As chief, she's not prepared to give away money unless the employee asks for it - and furthermore, she tells Webber he's been \"coddling\" Meredith since Derek died. \"She needs to fight for herself,\" Bailey tells Webber, adding: \"This is what a feminist looks like,\" in order to hammer home the point.\nFall TV Popularity Contest: Which new shows won you over? Vote now!\nAlex's surgery on Daniel initially looks like it will be a success, but is ultimately unsuccessful. He ends up cradling the baby as his heart finally gives out, and then breaking the news to the mother as Handsome Intern looks on, probably more convinced than ever that peds are not for him.\nFinally, Meredith goes in to Bailey and tells her that the salary she's been offered isn't enough. Bailey tells Meredith to name a number and immediately agrees to it, offering a sly, \"Well done,\" as Meredith waltzes out of the room.\nApril comes home, relieved to see that the locks haven't been changed, but gets an even ruder awakening when she realizes that Jackson has moved out. He's crashing with Bailey and Ben for the time being. (Clearly sleeping on a couch wasn't his main gripe.)\nAt the bar, Maggie and Handsome Intern trade shots, and we all know where this will lead. Yep, within a minute, they're making out. I guess it's time to learn his name ... which is apparently Andrew. (Thanks IMDB!) And they're not the only ones about to get it on: Alex comes home and tells Jo he's ready to have a baby with her, and suggests they start trying right now. Jo points out all the reasons they shouldn't have kids - she's in the middle of her residency, they don't even have a dog yet - but this doesn't seem to deter Alex, who enthusiastically hops into bed.\nWhat do you think? Are Jo and Alex ready to take the baby plunge? Do you think Maggie and Andrew would make a good couple? And will April and Jackson find a way to reconcile?
