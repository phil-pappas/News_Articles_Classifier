You've angered me and I will mark you harshly\" in Len Goodman terms this means a 6. #strictly— Mzebonga (@Mzebonga) October 10, 2015 That was so awkward Len having a right go #Strictly— Marie Woodward (@marie_woodward) October 10, 2015 Len was a bit out of order there....just basically gave a work colleague a bollocking on national tv. Bit uncalled for #Strictly x— Gemma (@Gxmma_Paulette) October 10, 2015 i'm watching strictly and len's being such an idiot, you're supposed to be giving constructive criticism not being rude.— Em (@queenndobrev) October 10, 2015 Absolutely no time for Len's disrespectful, cranky outbursts. He never fails to show his true colours each year. It's not on. #SCD #strictly— Emma Hynes (@ELHynes) October 10, 2015 Giovanni getting told off like a naughty schoolboy by Len, still not too sure why? They were great. Next time tell Len to bog off #strictly— speckii (@speckyx) October 10, 2015 The other judges each awarded the pair a score of 7 but Len only gave them a 6.Other judges didn't have any issues with the dance, with Darcey Bussell saying it was \"amazing\" and Bruno Tonioli adding it was a \"vamped up\" rumba.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:50:11.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
