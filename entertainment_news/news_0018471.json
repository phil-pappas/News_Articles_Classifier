On Diaries , Damon must learn to live (well, sort of live) without Elena, now that she's in a coma and the actress who played her, Nina Dobrev, is off the show. Then on Originals , the brothers deal with new threats and old divisions.\nUSA TODAY\nCritic's Corner chat: Mon., 2 p.m. ET\nHow to Get Away With Murder\nABC, 10 ET/PT\nResetting a series, which is what Murder has to do, is never easy, and we're only two weeks into the season, so there's obviously no reason to panic. That said, though, it hasn't been a particularly enchanting two weeks. We know not to demand sense from the show's courtroom antics, but we should be able to expect better than a plot hinging on evidence attorneys blithely accept from a stranger in a bathroom. And while we'd watch the fabulous Viola Davis do anything, that doesn't mean we want to watch her weep every week.Consider that an early warning.\nBilly Eichner returns to TruTV with 'Billy on the Street.' (Photo: TruTV)\nBilly on the Street\nTruTV, 10:30 ET/PT\nBilly Eichner's series opens its TruTV stint with an endearingly amusing performance from Tina Fey, whose \"Latina Fey\" game is an ingenious highpoint. The other segments are hit and miss — Eichner is funnier when he's faking anger than when he's faking geniality — but Fey makes up for any lapses.\n6 CONNECT 56 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1Rv4Nmr CriticsCorner", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rv4Nmr&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540999292001_4540978629001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27f6664fb8ef48299f06ee96e2d6771613497b2a/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797482554085428-TVD701A-0269b.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540999294001_4540978629001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/315232f5d0d8096daaa72de4a3269820240e38d8/c=0-54-5989-4557&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797491384422636-Billy-on-the-Street-horizontal-9584-.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rv4Nmr&text=TV%20tonight%3A%20%27Vampire%20Diaries%2C%27%20%27Billy%27&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540999292001_4540978629001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540999292001_4540978629001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1LiRkx8", "http://usat.ly/1Rv4Nmr", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797482554085428-TVD701A-0269b.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797482554085428-TVD701A-0269b.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2012/10/11/critics-corner-promo-01-1_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:57:21.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
