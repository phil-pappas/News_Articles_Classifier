The hip-hop recording artist took to Twitter on Tuesday, October 13 to apologize for his discriminatory comment. \"My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong,\" T.I. wrote. After addressing his mistake, the \"Whatever You Like\" rapper apologized to people who got offended by his comment as saying, \"I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended.\" T.I. previously made it clear that he wouldn't vote for Hilary in the upcoming election because she's a woman. \"Not to be sexist but, I can't vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" he told DJ Whoo Kid. \"Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well,\" the 35-year-old rapper continued. \"But the president? It's kinda like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally - they make very permanent, cemented decisions - and then later, it's kind of like it didn't happen, or they didn't mean for it to happen.\" Later on, T.I. suggested that the world wasn't ready yet for a woman to be the president of the U.S. \"And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke. [Other leaders] will not be able to negotiate the right kinds of foreign policy; the world ain't ready yet,\" he said. \"I think you might be able to the Loch Ness Monster elected before you could get a woman.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:11:36.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
