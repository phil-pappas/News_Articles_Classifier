It reunites actress Gong Li and director Zhang Yimou in a story of family, memory, the toll of China's Cultural Revolution and love denied, delayed and delivered.\nThe story opens with news that Lu Yanshi (Chen Daoming), an enemy of the party and separated from his family for 10 years, has escaped during a prison transfer at a nearby train station. His wife, Yu (Gong Li), and ballet student-daughter (Zhang Huiwen) are strictly forbidden from meeting him.\nMiddle school teacher Yu makes a fervid, furtive and futile attempt to reunite with her husband, but when the Cultural Revolution ends and \"rehabilitated\" Lu returns home, he is not greeted with open arms for reasons he never could have imagined. Although audiences are conditioned to wait for a happy ending, \"Coming Home\" brings one bittersweet at best, cruel and heartbreaking at worst.\n\"Coming Home\" turns on three finely calibrated performances with Gong Li the standout as a woman whose face betrays the feelings warring inside or the drowning confusion. Yu is buoyed by anticipation and dashed by disappointment again and again, in what is a cruel marriage of emotions exquisitely played out.\n'COMING HOME'\n3 out of 4 stars\nIn Mandarin with English subtitles.\nRated PG-13 for some thematic material.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1739050&h=Movie+review%3A+%27Coming+Home%27+is+awash+in+tears", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1739050", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1739050&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:17:34.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
