Bruguera has since had her passport returned and left Cuba.\nBut in recent months, Amnesty International and other human rights group began calling for Maldonado's release and describing his case as a test of Cuba's openness to dissent.\nHis detention showed that \"there are some topics and themes that journalists and writers know they can't touch,\" said Elizardo Sanchez, head of Cuba's non-governmental Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation.\nMaldonado told The Associated Press that he had been held without charge since Dec. 25 \"simply because I made fun of the highest leaders of this revolution.\"\n\"I was in prison this morning and they told me to get my things and I obeyed,\" Maldonado said. \"Afterwardu they told that they were finally going to set me free.\"\nCuba has been gradually loosening central control of the economy and allowing slightly more open discourse in state-run media and an art world that requires state approval for everything from gallery and theater space to permission to import materials.\nThe country's leaders remain sacrosanct however, and attempts at political organization or questioning of the country's single-party system are met with swift and harsh condemnation.\nWhile never formally charged, Maldonado was accused of the crime of disrespect toward government officials, a violation that can bring a 1- to 3-year sentence under Cuban law.\n\"We are very happy to learn that in the end he is being freed,\" said Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner for Amnesty International. \"He's just an artist who tried to do an art show, to use his legitimate right to freedom of expression. That should never lead people to be sent to prison. That's a very cold reminder of what's the situation of freedom of expression today in Cuba.\"\nIn April, Maldonado received the Vaclav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent from the New York-based Human Rights Foundation.\n\"A government that doesn't let itself be criticized starts to lose credibility,\" said Maldonado's mother, Maria Victoria Machado.\nDressed in grey shorts, sneakers and a T-shirt, Maldonaldo munched a sandwich Tuesday afternoon as relatives, well-wishers and reporters began to fill his home.\n\"I want to now connect with the people that supported me, \" he said, telling the AP that he planned to request a visa for the United States and travel to Miami \"to be close to people who think like I do, people in exile, who had to leave.\"\nHe said he planned to recover his strength and energy and return to Cuba after six months.\n___\nMichael Weissenstein contributed to this report.\n____\nMichael Weissenstein on Twitter: https://twitter.com/mweissenstein\nAndrea Rodriguez on Twitter:\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
