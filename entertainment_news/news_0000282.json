Our relationship was always somewhat special, and I think it'll always remain special.\" \n\"The mark of a successful relationship shouldn't be whether you're there forever after,\" she continues. \"Sometimes you're not meant to be forever together. Sometimes you have to come to terms with the fact that that was it.\" \nCarter calls their relationship \"a blessing,\" noting, \"We gave each other children and a lot more else. And we might be better, and still be able to give to each other, but not necessarily living together. \n\"Which we did by the way, because everyone seemed to think we didn't, but that was a load of myth,\" she adds in response to rumors that the couple lived in two adjoining houses in London's Belsize Park. \nThe pair, who first met on the set of Burton's 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes , never married. They have two children -- son Billy, 11, and daughter Nell, 7. \nCarter will next be seen in the British drama Suffragette , which centers on early members of the British women's suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th century. It opens nationwide October 23. \nThe November edition of Red magazine will be available on Thursday. \n  Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 10:30AM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:22:44.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
