No more nudes \nPlayboy twins Kristina and Karissa Shannon have been rescued from a car wreck following a horrifying crash in Beverly Hills, California. The 26-year-old sisters, who both previously dated Playboy boss Hugh Hefner, were involved in a nasty accident on Monday. \nPolice officials in Beverly Hills have confirmed reports suggesting Kristina Shannon has been cited for misdemeanour DUI following a near-death car crash. \nBeverly Hills Police Sgt. Max Subin has now revealed Kristina was cited for driving under the influence upon arrival at the hospital. \nHe says, \"We will be submitting our case to the district attorney for possible criminal filing for driving under the influence.\" \nFirefighters attended the scene and cut open the roof of the car to rescue Kristina, while Karissa had to be pulled free through the windshield. They were taken to a local hospital for treatment, but escaped with minor injuries, according to TMZ.com . \nKristina Shannon is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 12, 2016.
