No? \nPerhaps this video will jerk your memory. \nLittle Curtis’s utter disregard for authority, opposition to vegetables and hilarious outbursts of rage made him perfect meme material. His most notable lines, of course, are “she thinks she’s the queen, and we’re the sorry people” (in reference to Wife Swap’s Joy, who threw away Curtis’s beloved cheese in a can and tried to encourage exercise). (YouTube) \nAnd of course, the unforgettable line “BACON IS GOOD FOR ME!” (YouTube) \nSix years have passed since King Curtis and his adorable little blond bowl cut and people were starting to wonder what King C was up to these days. One person looking for Curtis was Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale, who asked her 10.3 million followers if anyone knew what had happened to the pork enthusiast. \nLucy certainly isn’t alone in wondering about Curtis. Of all the reality TV characters to enjoy brief fame and fade away into oblivion, Curtis and his undying love of chicken nuggets still remains in our thoughts. So when a video of King Curtis updating us on his life in 2015 surfaced, we were pretty excited. Promoted stories \nHere’s the video in full, for your viewing pleasure: \nKing Curtis begins by addressing us from a throne (naturally), before cutting away to a shot of him eating bacon. Not just any bacon – King Curtis Bacon. (YouTube) \n“Well here’s my story. After the show, someone put a video clip on YouTube. The video got eight million hits. In 2012, a production company came, and they filmed a pilot show. As of today, no network have came to pick up the show.” \nHe then gets down to the real purpose of the video: King Curtis wants your hard-earned dollars. He says: “I’d like to restore a 1970s muscle car, but that’s just too expensive!” while shaking a huge gold piggy bank for emphasis. (YouTube) \nCurtis has started a GoFundMe page for his fans to donate towards his dream car, which he intends to build with the help of his parents. So far the page has $120 of an $80,000 target. \nAnd finally, Curtis says the words we’ve all been DYING to hear: “I still love bacon and chicken nuggets, but now it’s chicken strips. Ha. Ha.” \n(We don’t really understand what that means either, but it feels SO damned good to hear Curtis discussing his favourite meats again). (YouTube) \nHe concludes the video on a throne, next to a crown, and says triumphantly “bacon is good for me”. Finally, all is well in the world.
