Ollie Locke and Binky Felstead Ollie Locke and Binky Felstead (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nRemember Ollie’s long “Lockes”? The reality star’s long-haired days are well over, but he still showed off his unusual approach to style with this polo-neck and blazer combo. Binky went with a flowery dress and suede fringed shoes. Stephanie Pratt Stephanie Pratt (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nWow! Stephanie’s bag is great (or is it a lunchbox? Hopefully it contained some tasty snacks either way). The dress is from Comino Couture and the shoes are Miu Miu. Spencer Matthews and James Dunmore Spencer Matthews and James Dunmore (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThere was some classic knitwear from both the boys. Emily Weller Emily Weller (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nEmily may have said goodbye to her bright pink hairdo for now, but she made up for it by wearing blue lipstick. Mark Francis Vandelli and Victoria Haber-Baker Mark Francis Vandelli and Victoria Haber-Baker (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nMark Francis was, of course, in a sharp suit – and he probably dissected everyone’s outfit afterwards with Victoria. Because no one does sartorial scorn like Mark Francis. Louise Thompson \nLouise went with the monochrome look and a shiny PVC jacket. Sam Thompson Sam Thompson (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nHer brother put in zero effort – unless this grey t-shirt was the result of months of planning. Georgia “Toff” Toffolo \nToff dressed up a bit. Rosie Fortescue \nRosie’s white lacy dress is by Style Stalker. Alex Mytton \nBlack: it’s a safe colour. Alex was apparently feeling a little chilly. Lucy and Tiff Watson Lucy and Tiff Watson (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nThe Watson sisters looked stylish in black, green and silver. Millie Wilkinson \nWith a baggy dress and knee-high boots, Millie’s look was almost like classic Binky. Richard Dinan Richard Dinan (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nA very serious face from Richard. But we love his red shirt buttons – a stylish touch. Josh “JP” Patterson Josh “JP” Patterson (Anthony Devlin/PA) \nJP balanced out his smart waistcoat with some casual jeans. Nice. Jess Woodley \nDo you think Jess likes burgundy? Share article \nMade In Chelsea starts Monday October 19 on Channel 4.
