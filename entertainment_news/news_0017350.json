The series stars Jaimie Alexander as an amnesiac Jane Doe whose collection of tattoos help the FBI solve cases, though something bigger than just ink is going on. Blindspot pulled in 10.6 million total viewers with its series premiere, and a 3.1 rating in the coveted 18-49 adult demographic, the highest rating for the network in its timeslot since The Blacklist 's season premiere last year.
