I said to myself. Yes, I answered, whereupon I recalled that the stream in Le Roy is really Oatka Creek. Google Maps had renamed it.\nPoking around more on Google's online map app, I found that portions of Black Creek, Honeoye Creek and Canaseraga Creek -- like Oatka, Genesee tributaries -- had been rechristened as well. There probably are others. Something must have gone awry with Google Maps' stream-name algorithm.\nThis has the effect, though, of creating many more gems on the Genesee. Now Pavilion, Le Roy, Mumford and Scottsville can claim the title. So can Churchville, West Chili, West Rush, Industry,Honeoye Falls, Honeoye and Groveland.\nInstead of \"Gem,\" Rochester might need to call itself \"Crown Jewel.\" Or is that too immodest? What say, Jim?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:05:41.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
