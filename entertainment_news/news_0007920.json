He also was fined a little over $3,600.\nIf convicted at trial, Flav could have faced up to four years in prison. A prosecutor at Tuesday's court proceeding had recommended a six-month sentence.\nBut Murphy, after lecturing the entertainer on his status as a role model and admonishing him to set an example for young people, indicated he understood there were extenuating circumstances surrounding his arrest.\nWearing his trademark clock around his neck, the rapper thanked his attorney, Todd Greenberg, and Murphy for helping settle the case. He also singled out a state trooper who drove him to his mother's gravesite in his vehicle to make it in time for her memorial service.\n\"He was the greatest,\" Flav said of the officer.\nA state police spokesman confirmed that a trooper had provided the rapper with a ride following his arrest because of the \"extenuating circumstances.\"\nA Long Island native who now lives in Las Vegas, Flav is still facing criminal charges there for an arrest in May. He faces trial Thursday on charges of misdemeanour speeding, driving under the influence of cocaine and having an open container of alcohol in his vehicle. He has pleaded not guilty but declined to comment Tuesday on those charges.\nFlav's lawyer in Las Vegas, Kristina Wildeveld, did not immediately return a telephone call for comment.\nFlav was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 with the rap group Public Enemy.\nRelated Stories Flavor Flav fires 2nd lawyer in New York traffic case", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:25:56.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
