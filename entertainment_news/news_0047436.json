Combining elements of “Rez” and “Child of Eden,” this short game from the makers of the “Bit.Trip” series feels like a missed opportunity to be something special. \nThe game begins as you are traveling through the universe and happen upon the body of a dead astronaut floating in space. \nYour power to probe the subconscious resembles two laser-like lines through fields of space and memory. Through 12 stages, you piece together fragments of the astronaut’s life. \nEach stage is broken up into three sections. The first of which has you tap the shoulder buttons on the controller in time with the polyhedral orbs that advance towards you. Stringing long combos together, it will build your score. \nThe second part of each stage has you unlock part of the astronaut’s life. The journey through his memories feels very existential and dreamy. Backgrounds and music focus on moments in his life from youthful days to the climactic event that ended his life. \nWithout the need to press your shoulder buttons during this second part, you carefully navigate your laser beams through flat disks that remind me of cymbals on an electric drum kit. Hitting these in succession will create a great rhythm track for the music that accompanies your work. By far, this was my favorite section and I was always sad when it was over. \nThe final section of each stage is akin to a tunnel-runner game where your lasers have to dodge the oncoming walls. Luckily, there are holes in the walls were your two beams can navigate through. \nThis is by far the shortest of the three parts and does not add much to the overall experience. \nAs a fan of the “Bit.Trip” series I was excited to see another rhythm action game from them. While “Laserlife” hits a lot of the same notes, the formula feels not as fresh anymore. Once the twelve levels are over, the only reason to replay the game is to go for a higher score and climb the online ranks. \nI can see why early impressions of “Laserlife” made critics think of “Rez”: Those both tell a story through lush surroundings and pulsing electronic music. \nSadly, I feel “Laserlife” has a lot less soul and could have really went further with the story by showing more emotional parts of this astronaut’s fictitious life. \nSo after finishing the game in about two hours in one sitting, I felt like I wanted more. I did not regret the experience, but there could have been more to the astronaut’s story or something deeper than what was presented. \nPerhaps this feeling of sadness or incompleteness was part of the director’s intention. Without any other commentary or explanation, the minimalistic narrative feels incomplete. \nThis is to say I would not sway anyone away from “Laserlife” if they know what the game is about. Turning the lights down low and investing the evening into a game could be well worth your $15. However, many will find this price a bit high for the experience. \nIn the indie games landscape, “Laserlife” is worth playing if you enjoy these types of games. Unfortunately, it made me wish that Sega would port “Rez” over to current generation consoles or PC. \nGAME GUIDE \n• PLATFORMS: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One. \n• PRICE: $14.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:47:23.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
