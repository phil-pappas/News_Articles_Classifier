So please be upstanding for the new fantastic four! #thevoiceuk pic.twitter.com/Hi5fMkvnsS \n— BBC The Voice UK (@BBCTheVoiceUK) August 14, 2015 \nThe show has returned with an all-new panel featuring Paloma Faith, Will.i.am, Boy George and Ricky Wilson, with former coach Rita Ora having moved to ITV’s The X Factor. \nThe BBC’s director of television, Danny Cohen, recently spoke out following the departure of singer and coach Sir Tom Jones from The Voice. \nMr Cohen said he was “sorry” that Sir Tom was “upset” after the Welsh singer recently hit out at what he called “sub-standard behaviour” from “the executives” following his departure from the show. \nHe told fans he had only been informed 24 hours before the new coaches were announced that he would not be returning. Promoted stories Sir Tom Jones (Nick Ansell/PA) \nMr Cohen said: “I’ve got huge respect for Tom and I’m truly sorry he’s upset. I’m really sorry because I am a big fan of his. I think he’s a gentleman and an extraordinary figure in music.” \nHe said he would definitely like to see Sir Tom back on the BBC “doing something else”. \nThe BBC has previously launched a defence of popular programming like The Voice and The Great British Bake Off, saying that licence fee payers expect the BBC to “deliver entertainment”. The Voice coaches and presenters (John Giles/PA) \nIn “an evidence-based response” to Culture Secretary John Whittingdale’s green paper on its future, the corporation hit back at whether it should have a more “precisely targeted” mission in terms of its output. \nThis week, Rona Fairhead – chairman of the BBC Trust which governs the corporation – told the Lords’ Communications Committee that the BBC should provide a “universal service” that broadly serves the UK rather than striving to do “everything for everybody”. \nMs Fairhead said consultations with the public demonstrated the need for value for money, and that the licence fee model was deemed the best way to achieve this, rather than through corporate advertising and direct government funding. She said previous input from the public resulted in a focus on “distinctive drama” on BBC One, citing the television adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s historical drama Wolf Hall as an example of high-quality output.
