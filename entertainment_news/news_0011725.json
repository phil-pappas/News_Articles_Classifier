The global market for automotive belts & hoses is estimated to grow at CAGRs of 6.09% and 6.82% respectively from 2015 to 2020. The market for automotive belts & hoses is primarily propelled by increasing vehicle production, increasing adoption of turbochargers in the vehicles, stringent fuel emission norms and regulations, and the rising demand for fuel efficient technologies. However, shifting focus towards electric vehicles has been identified as a restraint for the market. Belts used in automobiles perform a critical function of synchronizing the camshafts and crankshaft to regulate valve openings. Belts also power accessories such as the water pump, steering pump and compressor among others. Modern automobiles utilize a single serpentine belt to power these accessories as compared to multiple belts for these applications, which were used in older engines. This reduces the space required for the engine and reduces multiple maintenance requirements. Some vehicles also use a timing belt to synchronize the camshaft and crankshaft. Hoses are used in automobiles for fluid transmission in various applications such as cooling, heating, power steering and braking among others. Hose suppliers have to account for the varying fuel blends, coolants and brake fluids while selecting raw materials, to improve resistance against corrosion. Material selection for these hoses also depends on the nature of application as pressure requirements differ for each component.\n\nThe Asia-Oceania region is estimated to be the largest market in terms of value for automotive belt & hose in 2015 owing to the presence of powerhouses such as China , India , and Japan . Large population, increasing infrastructure and technology development in these countries, increase in per capita income, and improving standard of living have all contributed to the growth of the automotive industry in the region during the past decade. In 2008, China surpassed the U.S. to become the largest car-producing nation across the globe, and has maintained its dominance ever since. China , Japan , South Korea , and India are the main contributors to the growth of automotive belt & hose market in the Asia-Oceania region. To cater to this huge demand in Asia-Oceania, many OEMs are expanding operations in the region. The North American market, after a brief depression in 2008, has emerged strong and is growing. Along with the European market, the North American market is estimated to spearhead the automotive industry in terms of technology and advancements. \nThis report classifies and defines the global automotive belt & hose market size, in terms of volume and value.
