Cuba-based band plays at White House - a first in 50 years Members of Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club perform at a reception in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015, for Hispanic Heritage Month and the 25th anniversary of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. Based in Cuba from the 1940s to the early 1960s, the band is on its farewell tour in the United States – and their performance tonight marks the first time a Cuban musical act has played at the White House in more than 50 years.
