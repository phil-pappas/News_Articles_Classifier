After less than three hours of talks Monday night, district negotiators and the teachers union reached a tentative agreement to avoid what would have been the first strike in district history. \nDistrict parents were informed of the agreement at 9 p.m., three hours after the negotiations session began, by automated phone call from Superintendent Joe Mancini. \nTerms of the tentative agreement were unavailable Monday night. \nStudents had classes as scheduled Monday. A strike would have begun with cancellation of classes Tuesday morning. \nMonday's session came after 12 hours of negotiations on Oct. 7 and 8 that ended without an agreement. After a three-hour session Oct. 7, the teachers association announced Oct. 8 its intention to strike Tuesday if no contract agreement was reached. \nThe union, which represents 130 teachers, will have the opportunity to ratify the agreement, as will the school board, before the contract becomes final. \nDistrict teachers have been working since the beginning of this school year without a contract, after the previous pact expired June 30. \nMonday's tentative agreement marks what might have been the closest the district has come to striking. In 2006, the two sides reached a tentative agreement about 5 a.m. on Friday, May 5, after teachers announced their intention to walk out the following Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:32:30.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
