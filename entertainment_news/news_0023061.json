From an aesthetic and a popularity perspective, I figured that much after learning bass. The reason I picked it up was because the bass guitar as an instrument handles the rhythm as well as the melody. There's a saying that bass is the mother of the band and the drum set is the father.

There are too many camps right now about the kind of music people make. I feel the music scene is too small to focus on these political matters because the country is huge and it is opening up to so many opportunities, with so many festivals coming in.\nIf we are a little more open minded, the sky is the limit. The music scene can literally accommodate everybody. We should help each other out and that's what I have tried with my collaborations.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:30:00.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
