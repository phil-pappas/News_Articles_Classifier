There are so many lessons about singing, songwriting, musicianship, recording and money management. \nFirst a little history is important here. In the beginning Buck grew up dirt poor. When he was nine or ten years old he said \"When I get big, I'm not going to have shoes with twine in 'em where the shoelaces are supposed to be. I'm not going to have to use pieces of linoleum to plug the holes in the soles of my shoes. When I get big, I'm not going to be poor like this. I'm going to be somebody.\" \nHis father taught him about character and how important it is to 'Do the right thing.' His dad told him many times, \"When you have a job, you get there ahead of starting time. If there's something that needs to be done, you be the first to volunteer. Don't wait to be asked.\" He also told Buck to have a smile on your face and - whatever your job is - do it expeditiously.\" Buck said those were some of the greatest words of advice he ever got from his dad. \nOne summer his father had gotten ill and had to be hospitalized. So the rest of the family had to work to make ends meet. At that time Buck was only ten years old but he did it because that's what good people do. \nHe has said that his dad never would go \"on relief\" to get government financial assistance. And his folks worked hard to support themselves so they could pay all their bills and feed all of the kids.\" \nThe family moved from Texas heading west to California as they, along with many families, heard there were many jobs available working in the labor camps there. Most of the jobs involved working the land by picking vegetables and fruit. \nIn the camps there was a mixture of blacks, Mexicans and white folks. During the day they would sing sad songs while working in the fields. And in the evening at the camp they would play and sing more happy and up-tempo songs. Buck has said that a lot of his musical background came from the camps \nAs a teenager Buck started going to honky-tonks and his father worried because he felt that nothing good could come from hanging out at places like that. But Buck was not going there to drink. He wanted to go there to play music and meet other musicians playing so that he could learn to play better. As he got better at playing, some of the bands would let him sit in on their sets. \nDue to Buck's insatiable appetite to learn about music he could play several instruments. His first instrument was a guitar that his father got for him. In the labor camps he hung around with other musicians and constantly asked them how to play certain songs. When he was thirteen for Christmas his parents got him a mandolin. It was to be his favorite instrument of all time. He remembered hearing people like Bill Munroe and The Bluegrass Boys playing on the radio and in person. \nI couldn't help but think how blessed Buck was to have parents that taught him about the honorable traits of character and hard work but also were always supportive of his endeavors in music. \nThe majority of his hits came during the years between 1963 and 1972. His first number one hit \"Act Naturally\" rose up with a bullet with its new Country Music sound. It was an up tempo song that so impressed the Beatles that they recorded it and had a hit with it also. \nMany artists have recorded a lot of Buck's songs. One of them is Ray Charles. Buck said that he admired Ray because he and Ray felt that a great song is a great song - it doesn't matter what style it's performed in. \nBuck had further developed his music style by searching for a fiddle player for the band and discovered a young man in his teens that was an excellent player. He also played lead guitar for the band. As the story goes it was months later that Buck discovered that man, Don Rich, could also sing perfect harmony with Buck. \nBuck's caring for Don was immeasurable. As he has said from January of 1961 till July of 1974 Don was the only person who was there and played and sung harmony for all of the hit songs. Buck said that Don then stayed on with Buck right up to the end of Don's life when he was killed in a motorcycle accident. \nIn 1969 Buck became a co-host of one of the most successful country comedy TV shows in history called \"Hee Haw. Due to syndication Buck had a seventeen year run as co-host of the show. It was based on great country music stars, their songs and comedy skits that were so simple minded that many folks said it reminded them of the hit show \"Laugh In.\" \nDuring the middle to late seventies the Nashville power brokers placed limitations on singers as to how one's music should be sung and recorded. This led to some singers to go West and record in California where they had more freedom to develop their music. \nSeveral of them such as Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, and Willie Nelson were classified as outlaws. Bakersfield, California represented the West Coast sound that was happening. As a matter of fact Dwight Yoakam and Buck Owens had a hit record with a famous song titled \"Streets of Bakersfield.\" \nBuck was also a shrewd investor. He had seen many an artist when they were riding high with big money from their record sales and touring go out and buy a big fancy car or a boat. He said rather than doing that he would go out and buy radio and television stations and invest in real estate, a recording studio and a record publishing company. \nHe knew that his career would end just like anybody else. But the others failed to think about what they would do once the money ran out when their career had ended. \nIf artists would study his life story in music they would learn more than any school of learning could teach them from this brilliant hit maker. \nI'm Paul Romaine and the host of http://SingersandMusiciansTalentSearchRadio.com .
