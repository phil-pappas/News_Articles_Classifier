If you have a favorite restaurant that has been around for a while and may have been “forgotten”, let me know. \nClark and Lewie’s \nClark and Lewie’s gets a visit from me, mostly when I crave tomato soup, fish and chips or Eggs Benedict, though they have lots more good food. The Montana Eggs Benedict has the requisite poached eggs, English muffin, perfect Hollandaise sauce, but is served with a steak instead of Canadian bacon or ham. Decadent, classic fare, kicked up Montana style. The tomato soup is thick, creamy and smooth, with no tomato pieces, just great flavor. When I can’t figure out what to eat, fish and chips are my go-to meal and I usually come here, crispy battered whitefish served with crisp battered fries, lemon and a nice “dilly” tartar sauce. The chicken fried beef patty served with gravy for dipping is good as is the prime rib with Donnie Johnson’s special rub. Try anything on the menu. Go upstairs to the Sip ‘n’ Dip Lounge. Check for the mermaids or Piano Pat’s hours in the Lounge. Find Clark and Lewie’s at 17 7th St S. or call 454-2141. \nDante’s \nOnce per month I meet with some great ladies in the far corner of Dante’s dining room. There are several things I like here, including the BLAST, which is a kicked up BLT with avocado and shrimp added for a delicious lunch. I also like the soups, especially French Onion that is on the soup menu rotation. If it is on the menu for the day, grab it because it goes fast. It has a good broth, lots of onions and the bread cubes and cheese all make a hearty dish. The other day I had the beef stew that was just like Mom used to make. The lovely odor first, then the taste with tender beef and veggies with a complex flavor making a nostalgic choice. There is a menu item that I always wondered about, but was trapped in the belief that cucumber sandwiches belonged at a ladies tea party. Just cucumber slices and butter on a piece of white bread, which is okay in its place. But when I finally tried the sandwich at Dante’s, I was totally surprised. Simple, sure, but lots of flavor. The cucumbers are thinly sliced long-wise, celery and red onion are added and all three marinate in a light vinaigrette. When this is transferred to the hoagie roll, some marinade soaks into the roll. Add lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and a kicker of Parmesan cheese and you have my new favorite sandwich. \nFind Dante’s at 1325 8th Ave. N. or call 453-9599. Hours are Monday-Thursday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. \nJaker’s Bar and Grill \nThe October specials for Jaker’s Bar and Grill are here, beginning with potatoes for Fall. The Idaho potato trio features hand cut garlic fires, Gorgonzola fries and Parmesan truffle oil potato tots, all for $10. Good for sharing. \nThe beverage specials are a pumpkin pie milk shake, and for the adults, the Chopin pink ribbon raspberry lemon drop cocktail results in a $1 donation to breast cancer research. The featured soup is the Octoberfest Beer Cheese soup made with ham and green chili peppers making a cheesy, creamy, beer spiked concoction. The Octoberfest Cheeseburger is half pound of fresh ground sirloin and chuck burger, char-broiled and topped with Swiss cheese, ham and caramelized onions with Octoberfest beer mustard on a pretzel bun, served with soup, fries or salad. The dinner entree is pork brisket, hand rubbed, fire-grilled and thin sliced, topped with a demi glace and served with mashed potatoes and soup or salad and a side. 1500 10th Ave. S. or call 727-1033. \nWyoming’s Pasta Veloce \nWe make periodic trips to visit relatives in Wyoming and have found some good food there. Since I know quite a few people who also make trips there, I have been reporting on my restaurant finds. This time it is a place called Pasta Veloce in Rock Springs, Wyo. They claim to be Italian pasta fast. Casual atmosphere and upgraded fast food make it ideal for busy people. The menu is done in three steps, first is pick your pasta, second decide on the topping, then the sauce. What I like is that along with pastas penne, spaghetti, cavatappi and fettuccine, there is shredded zucchini for a gluten free option. The toppings are shrimp, spicy sausage, chopped clams, chicken breast, ground beef, meat balls, sausage, three meats’a combo, or veggies. The sauces are Alfredo, marinara, spicy vodka, creamy pesto, white cheddar, and whiskey Alfredo. There is also manicotti and lasagna and kid’s choices. Find them at 1641 Elk St, Rock Springs, Wyo., call 307-362-6559 or look up www.pasta-veloce.com. \nLooking for buffalo dishes \nI would like to know what restaurants serve buffalo meat in one form or another. I know of burgers and a pasty. I have a reader request and plan to write a column on buffalo or maybe some exotic meats. \nSubmit information on menu changes, specials or celebrations to Sharon Hansen, freelance writer and restaurant reviewer.
