Volkswagen rigged hundreds of thousands of cars to pass U.S. emissions tests, then sold them to consumers with emissions rates up to 40 times higher than permitted. The scandal badly damaged the car company's reputation and led to the resignation of Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn.\nOn Sept. 18, President Barack Obama ordered Volkswagen to pull 482,000 of its cars off American roads. The company, which admitted that problems may exist in 11 million cars worldwide, has set aside some $7.5 billion to fix the problem. At least two U.S. congressmen have suggested fining the company up to $18 billion. According to CNN Money, Credit Suisse bank has estimated the scandal could end up costing Volkswagen a near-inconceivable $87 billion.\nNo word yet on what role, if any, Di Caprio might play in the film.\nCelebrities Leonardo DiCaprio's career ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:29:47.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
