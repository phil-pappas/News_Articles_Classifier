The Dia de los Muertos Festival is a collaboration between many local businesses and community partners, and is inspired by the “Day of the Dead” holiday where people in Mexico and throughout Latin America gather to celebrate the lives of departed friends and family. The Dia de los Muertos Festival begins on Saturday at 5 p.m. with a procession through downtown, ending at the Gesa Power House Theatre for an evening program of music and dance performances. The festival continues in and around the theater on Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission to the festival and all activities are free and open to the public. Food vendors will set up nearby. The street in front of Gesa Power House Theatre will be closed during festival hours (Sixth Avenue from Rose to Sumach). The popular “Steamroller Print Project” led by Whitman College art professor Nicole Pietrantoni, returns on Sunday. Reliefs are carved into wooden blocks depicting iconic Dia de los Muertos images (skulls, skeletons, harvest and nature), and a city of Walla Walla construction steamroller is used as a printing press to create giant prints, which will be on display at the festival and for sale afterward. Sunday will also include scheduled performances of a Shakespearean-themed “Pageant of the Dead” performed by local student groups, music and dance performances, and a variety of free, family-friendly activities, from art projects and face-painting to a photo booth. Community groups are invited to create Dia de los Muertos altars for display during the festival. Shakespeare Walla Walla produced Dia de los Muertos lesson plans and classroom activity ideas to engage local schools and teachers in advance of the festival. A small number of teaching artists led classroom art and education projects in the weeks leading up to the festival. For the second year in a row, Gesa Credit Union stepped forward as the title sponsor for the festival, and the festival is also supported through grants from the Blue Mountain Community Foundation, Washington State Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts. Additional sponsorship opportunities are available by contacting Shakespeare Walla Walla. The festival grows each year, and is expected to attract up to 3,000 attendees in 2015. In addition, on Friday, Gesa Power House Theatre will present “Deep Love: A Ghostly Rock Opera,” a musical about love’s reach from beyond the grave. Tickets are available at phtww.com.
