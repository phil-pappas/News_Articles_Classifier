Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, right? Seemingly playing both sides, Simon (Tate Ellington) flouts Clayton's (Mark Pellegrino) order to keep Alex (Priyanka Chopra) in her makeshift evidence shed and instead takes her to his lusciously bearded bomb-maker pal to look at the piece of wire that was in the bombs. Guns drawn, Shelby tells Alex that Simon is with the FBI, while Alex accuses her former bestie and roomie of framing her because \"your whole world fell to pieces when I found out the truth about your parents.\" Shelby claims it's \"insane\" and \"impossible\" that she blew up Grand Central because she was out of the country and the seven bombs were buried and could've only been detonated within a two-block radius, not remotely. When Ryan (Jake McLaughlin) joins the party to inform them that the FBI was en route, Alex makes the boys leave and proceeds to beat up Shelby. Alex shares that she was the one who shot her dad and Shelby says that her secret phone calls are with her half-sister, whom she did not know existed until her parents died. Since she lied about her parents, is she lying about this too? Ryan instead goes to Miranda (Aunjanue Ellis), and they both convince Alex to stay and refocus because even though her dad was a great agent, he was an ass in real life. - Miranda tracks down Nimah (Yasmine Al Massri) at a dingy motel and convinces her to return by revealing her master plan. Turns out her super creepy incarcerated son was roped in by extremists and they had planned to attack his high school, which counted Congress members' kids as students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:24:26.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
