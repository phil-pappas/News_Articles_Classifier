In a first for the series, players can freely switch between the two assassins at will. While it’s a neat mechanic, both assassins play very similarly and the choice to switch is going to come down to each character’s skill tree. \nOne of the best things about any AC game is the historical setting and Syndicate doesn’t disappoint, delivering a gorgeously detailed version of Victorian London, circa 1868. The game picks up near the end of the Industrial Revolution and that is on display here. Smoke stacks litter the skyline, hulking metal cranes reach into the skies and refineries radiate brilliant orange and red auras. It’s the perfect era for an AC game, and it’s a pleasure to experience. \nApart from the character switching mechanic, Syndicate is, through and through, an Assassin’s Creed game. All the usual chase and stealth missions make an appearance, and levels are wide open enough to allow for some fun assassinations. The usual missions are broken up by some fun set piece action, including an exhilarating chase and combat section on a speeding train. \nI’m happy to report that, in my time with Syndicate on the PS4, I never ran into any performance problems. Frame rates remained solid with only some occasional dips. Glitches were also non-existent, which is a welcome change after last year’s Unity. \nSyndicate is shaping up to be much more polished, cohesive experience than recent Assassin’s Creed games, and should be another quality game in the long-running franchise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:49:22.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
