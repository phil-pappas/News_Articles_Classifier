Freida Pinto, who broke up with her Slumdog Millionaire co-star Dev Patel last year, was recently spotted indulging in some PDA with her special \"friend,'' American polo player Ronnie Bacardi, in Los Angeles.\nThe Academy Award-winning actress was pictured kissing the player at Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Chao, and the couple seemed completely in love as they walked hand-in-hand. They were also spotted making their way to a popular ice-cream parlour.\n\"We're just friends,\" Freida claimed while speaking to the media back in April, and maintained a similar stance when Mirror contacted her yesterday. \"There is nothing to comment on, really,\" she said. The duo also went on a romantic getaway to vancouver on October 18, where they ushered in Freida's birthday. Barcardi had shared a snap of the actress from their trip, which was captioned: \"Morning meets birthday girl...\".\nFreida has split from ex-beau Dev after a six-year romance and the duo maintain that they are on cordial terms. \"We are incredibly close,\" Dev told Mirror (December 14), while Freida had stated, matter-of-factly (Mirror, September 5), \"Dev and I are best friends. That's never going to change.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:17:48.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
