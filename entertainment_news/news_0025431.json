Think of Yeats’ “The Stolen Child,” which warns that magic in the real world is vanishing, “for the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.” A more familiar example is the resurrection-by-applause of Tinkerbell in every performance of “Peter Pan.”\nMore Information CIRCUS MIRANDUS\nBy Cassie Beasley\nISBN 978-0-52542843-5\nDial Books, 304 pages, $17.99\nWhen the book begins, Ephraim is a very old man raising a fifth-grader grandchild, Micah.\nMicah knows every detail — he thinks — of the story of his grandfather’s encounter with magic. The central fact of that encounter is that, before Ephraim’s allotted time with the circus was over, a mind-bending illusionist magician named the Lightbender promised him “a miracle.”\nBut Ephraim never redeemed the pledged miracle and now he is dying.\nCircus Mirandus wanders the globe, mostly invisible to mortal eyes, or at least to eyes that cannot see with true innocence.\nBut need can do wonders, and a portal opens to allow a messenger through, an intelligent parrot, Chintzy, who memorizes Ephraim’s letter and parrots it back to the Lightbender, who happens to be in Bolivia at the time.\nThe letter is a summons — the time to provide the miracle is now.\nEnter Ephraim’s estranged sister, Gertrudis. She not only does not believe Ephraim’s stories, she absolutely hates magic, and tries to separate Micah from his beloved grandfather, even as he is dying. Gertrudis is thoroughly modern and cruel to boot.\nEnter Micah’s fifth-grade classmate, Jenny Mendoza . She has a factual, scientific mind. She believes in Micah, but finds his stories irrational.\nBut magic manifests itself, once it enters a family, in small ways that often go unnoticed even by the gifted individual. Micah’s gift is an ability with knots. For a school project, he ties knots that resemble the alphabet.\nIn so doing, he — and Jenny — realize that he can tie knots that resemble individuals, but that also can connect them in some way that cannot be explained. Simple magic, but more powerful than either of them know.\nThere is a similarity between “Circus Mirandus” and Patrick Cauvin ’s 1979 novel “A Little Romance,” in that two pre-teens seek a faith-in-magic solution to a real life situation.\nExcept that here there is no actual romance, just a pure and innocent desire to believe in another person’s vision of reality. Nevertheless, the bond between Jenny and Micah is one that may transcend time.\nThis novel for middle-grade readers, the author’s first, is full of hijinks, humorous characters and embarrassing school situations, not to mention wicked great-aunts, but these are beautifully blended with nuanced issues of the human heart — friendship, faith, and loss.\nThe writing is literate, the characters endearing, the plot inventive, the conception memorable. Applause.\nBryce Milligan is the author of a dozen books for children and adults. He is the publisher/editor of Wings Press , now celebrating its 40th year.
