It is a special place where camp counselors speak fluent Finnish, children, who are called “villagers,” participate in Finnish language classes and activities daily, and everyone enjoys traditional Finnish meals.\nSusan Harstad, Salolampi Foundation President and former villager said, “We are so pleased to be able to offer these scholarships to any student interested in attending Salolampi, and we are grateful to the Finnish-American community for their continued support to sustain Finnish language and culture.”\nFor more information, and to register for Salolampi Finnish Language Village summer camp, please go to: http://www.concordialanguagevillages.org .\nOnce registered for Salolampi Finnish Language Village summer camp, all students are welcome to apply to their local Finlandia Foundation chapter to receive an additional scholarship.
