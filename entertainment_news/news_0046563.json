Ellie Goulding (Nick Ansell/PA) \n“I’m fine – it’s actually something someone discovered last year but I never got it checked out. Which is terrible, I have been playing with my life.” \nThe 28-year-old singer, who became a vegetarian two years ago and is a fitness fanatic, has since scaled back her approach to dieting and exercising. \n“I have been very relaxed, I have been chilling and not being as militant about what I eat. It’s nice to know you actually can’t go to the gym, you’re not allowed,” she admitted. \nThe star is currently performing in Australia, but she was forced to shake off accusations that she was lip-syncing during a show at the AFL Grand Final in Melbourne on October 3. \nThere was confusion as she attempted to sing her Fifty Shades Of Grey hit, Love Me Like You Do – but it later emerged that the Burn backing track was playing at the same time, leaving Ellie trying to sing over the top of the noise. Promoted stories \nSome viewers speculated that she was lip-syncing, but Ellie – who was also recovering from the flu – dismissed the idea: Love it when people think I lip sync, what a rad compliment :) Now where does one find a good veggie restaurant in Melbs? \n— Ellie Goulding (@elliegoulding) October 3, 2015 I give 100% in my performances even when people don't give much back. My fans know that. That's because I love what I do so much. :) \n— Ellie Goulding (@elliegoulding) October 3, 2015 Truth be told I've been unwell the past week and I could do with a long spell chill but I was determined to give everything for Oz today \n— Ellie Goulding (@elliegoulding) October 3, 2015 \n“I would rather something go wrong than go up there and people think I am this perfect pop star who everything goes right for, and I’m not human, I’m a robot,” she said. \nShe pointed out that, while her vocals were live, playing with a live band wasn’t an option at the performance at the sports arena. \n“I think technically the thing that people don’t understand is when I am given a gig like that, I don’t have the option of playing with my band live,” she explained, saying she had to use a backing track instead. \n“People don’t realise that most of their favourite artists, their favourite performers, have to do that all the time.” Share article \nShe added: “I’m not hurt by any accusations of lip-syncing. I don’t b****y lip-sync. If I lip-synced I would be terrible at it.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:02:48.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
