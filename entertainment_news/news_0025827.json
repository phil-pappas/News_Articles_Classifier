(DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) \nSnuka, of Camden County, N.J., was charged on Sept. 1 with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in Nancy Argentino's May 1983 death after a grand jury determined he repeatedly assaulted Argentino in the former George Washington Motor Lodge in Whitehall Township, then left her in bed to die. At his booking on the charges, Snuka was in a wheelchair and hooked to a feeding tube following cancer surgery. \nThe grand jury probe was prompted by a 2013 Morning Call investigation that raised questions about the Argentino case 30 years after her death. The Morning Call story revealed a never-before-seen autopsy report that labeled the case a homicide. \nIn a July 17 presentment, the grand jury wrote Snuka's \"assaultive acts and his failure to act to obtain medical attention resulted in her death\" and recommended he be charged with homicide. \nSnuka has been free since posting $100,000 bail the day he was booked. \nSnuka's arraignment is expected to happen in early November, at which time, Kirwan said, he'll enter a plea of not guilty. \nSurrounded by his wife, relatives and friends, Snuka, his white hair in a ponytail, didn't comment as he walked into and out of the Lehigh County Courthouse. He stood before Judge Maria L. Dantos, but didn't say anything. No one from Argentino's family attended the hearing. \nSnuka is recovering from cancer surgery in which three-quarters of his stomach was removed, along with lymph nodes, Kirwan said. He is expected to undergo additional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, possibly in the coming weeks, if he's strong enough, Kirwan said. \nWhile Snuka is regaining his strength and undergoing physical therapy, Kirwan said, he also is anxious to defend himself and shares the prosecution's desire for a speedy trial. \n\"The sooner this gets brought to a court, to a jury, the better. Mr. Snuka, if his health continues to deteriorate, he'd like to leave this world knowing he's an innocent man, not with everyone thinking he's guilty. So we're looking for a quick trial as well, for his sake and for his reputation,\" Kirwan said. \nDistrict Attorney Jim Martin attended the brief hearing and appeared to look over some of Snuka's medical records given to him by Kirwan. At one point, he, Kirwan and Dantos went into a private discussion before the agreement to bypass the hearing was announced. \nAfter the hearing, Kirwan said he \"intends to mount a full-scale defense for Mr. Snuka.\" \nLast week, Sasha M. Brown joined Snuka's legal team. Brown, from Lindon, Utah, said he has a personal connection to the case, having been a friend of the Snuka family for about 25 years. \n\"We've taken the position that 30 years ago when this case was investigated by the DA's office, this DA's office, they determined that there was no crime committed,\" Kirwan said. \"Thirty years has not changed that. He remains optimistic. He is not dreading this trial. He's looking forward to clearing his name and I expect him to be found innocent of all charges. \n\"He has very high spirits.\" \nAs part of the agreement, the grand jury transcripts must be provided to Snuka's attorneys within 10 business days and will remain sealed to everyone else. \nAbout 20 witnesses testified during the grand jury proceedings. Snuka used his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was called.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:53:08.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
