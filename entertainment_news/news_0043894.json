This version stars Kristin Kreuk\nand Jay Ryan\nas an NYPD officer and a former soldier who are romantically involved as she investigates her mother's murder. \"Beauty and the Beast\" has never been much of a ratings performer, averaging a 0.6 rating in 18-49 and 1.6 million total viewers in \"live plus same-day\" estimates for its premiere season in 2012-13. It seemed touch-and-go that it would receive a third season and the numbers proved why: Season 3, which premiered in June, averaged a 0.23 in the demo and nearly 900,000 same-day total viewers, according to Nielsen .\nDespite this, it was known for having an ardent fan base that included CW president Mark Pedowitz\n. \"I truly like it as a summer series,\" Pedowitz told journalists during his executive session at CW's Television Critics Assn. press tour last summer. \"One of our stated goals for the network was to have year-round programming. We're doing more and more of this, and having 'Beauty and the Beast' gives us some scripted programming for summer. We are developing other things at this point for next summer. So I plan to keep it there.\"\n\"Beauty and the Beast's\" 13-episode fourth season, which is wrapping production next month, is expected to air sometime in midseason or summer 2016.\nÂ© 2015 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10000&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:47:05.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
