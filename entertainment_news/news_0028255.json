It was a sell-out with 2,500 tickets sold. \n“There were a lot of compliments about how good The Kings sounded, they have just launched an album and they looked very good. \n“Everyone played their part, but Shaggy stole the show with an amazing performance that went on to 1.30am. He said he was really impressed with Bermudians who knew how to party in the rain,” said Mr Branco. \nHe added: “I must say a few ‘thank-you’s’ to people who helped make the concert a big success. Firstly, Fidelity International for their support of the concert and Tony Brannon – who did an amazing job organizing the concert. \n“James Birch, Natalie Sannemalm and the Premier Tickets team for all their hard work, Julien, Scott, Kate, Frank and all the ACEA team – it was a pleasure working with you on this event. \n“Calico Jack and UberVida did a great job being our floating lounges, Peter Clarke and his team – for doing a great job with security, Malcolm Gosling, Andrew Holmes and the Goslings team and, last but not least, Bermuda for coming out to support the concert despite the weather.” \nThe shorts were given by TABS, and TABS’ Rebecca Hanson said: “It was the Premier’s idea to give them the shorts, and we were more then happy to help Shaggy and Maxi embrace Bermuda style. I would certainly love to see them wear them, perhaps in 2017!” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:04:16.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
