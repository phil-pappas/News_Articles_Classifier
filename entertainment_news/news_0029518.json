Just say \"Bloomin' Monday\" to your server to get the freebie with any purchase. \nOutback gives away the free appetizers when Harvick places in the top 10 of a Sprint Cup on Monday following a race. I have no idea why Outback is giving away the freebies today, since Harvick placed 15th , and is being blamed by some drivers for causing a wreck. \nClick here for the deal. \nLike Doreen's Deals on Facebook ; follow Doreen Christensen on Twitter@PrettyGoodIdeas and sign up for Deals text alerts .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:40:36.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
