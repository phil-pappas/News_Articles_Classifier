Shiva Rajkumar sir's wife, Geetha ma'am, suggested my name to play this character. He had danced at an awards show in Malaysia a while ago and being blown away by the performance, I walked up to Geetha ma'am to appreciate it. She recognised me as the actress of the Tamil film Renigunta. Apparently, Kabira's team has been searching for a leading lady for this project for the past two years. Upon meeting me, she felt I would be apt for the role. It got me thrilled as the character is robust and the project is also strongâ€”script-wise and team-wise. It's a period film set in the 18th century and my character's name is Loyi.\nWhat's your character Loyi like? The film's story is based on a play by B Hisham Sahni about Kabir Das. My character is a street sweet-seller girl, who is delightful and mature, and there is a beautiful love story between Kabira and Loyi. I mostly wear skirts and tops teamed with head scarves.\nTell us your experience on the film's set... For the first few days I was silent like never before in my life, as I didn't know to speak Kannada (laughs). Upon sensing that the crew is friendly and helpful, I started interacting, but they insisted I spoke Kannada and no other language. But the positive side was that I could ask anyone for help anytime and there were no restrictions on that. Now, I have picked up the language a bit, but lose the flow when I become conscious. There are a few offers to do more Kannada movies but I want to ensure that they are substantial roles and ones I am comfortable doing.\nHow was it working with Shiva Rajkumar? He is someone I admire, both as an actor and a person. I could see the amazing patience and professionalism in his work, especially during the filming of certain risky portions. There is a scene in which he is immersed into water, for which the shooting went on for quite a while, drowning and lifting him up from water numerous times. Despite being a tough scene, he kept giving the shots sans a body double until they got it right.\nWithout any starry airs, he even prompted dialogues for me while taking a difficult, emotional scene that serves as a turning point in the love story. The dialogue was quite long and at times I couldn't recollect some words, but it's his support that helped me do justice to the scenes.\nIn your recent Malayalam films like Nirnayakam, you weren't the lead but played a key role in the story, and it looks like you don't insist on being the heroine... It's about the impact a role has on the film and I don't believe in being part of a movie as a namesake leading lady, who appears in a lot of scenes with nothing much to do. While signing up for a film, I consider the team, strength of the story and my character's justification of being part of it. As an actor, I want to ensure that my role is pivotal to the story. In Nirnayakam, for instance, mine is a key character around which the film's message is built.
