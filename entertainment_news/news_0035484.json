So The Late Late Show have decided it's time to give the fans what they want and have a full on Late Late Show country music special. Ye ha! (Did we pull that off?)They will even have the one and only Daniel O'Donnell, fresh from his stint in the Strictly ballroom. Other guests include Ireland’s king of country, Big Tom, who will be making a rare appearance, along with Nathan Carter, Mike Denver, Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam, Declan Nerney and TR Dallas. As well as “Raggle Taggle Gypsy” singer Derek Ryan, and the latest star on the country scene, Lisa McHugh. Finally, The Three Amigos - Jimmy Buckley, Robert Mizzell and Patrick Feeney - will be reuniting for the night. So have your stetson's on hand and get ready to bust out the old line dancing moves, because it's going to be a hell of a hoedown on tonight's Late Late.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:13:06.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
