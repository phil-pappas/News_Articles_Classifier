You’ve grown so much and completely come out of your shell … I think you’re amazing doing this.” \nDuring their final single date, Richie was unable to give Sam the “I’m falling in love with you” declarations offered by Sasha and Michael. But after a few adorable fumbles he said he was “ready to fall in love.” \nUnfortunately, that wasn’t enough for Sam to select the fan favourite to meet her family in tonight’s finale episode. \nViewers fell for Richie’s wicked bone structure and adorable “cool bananas” jokes, but also expressed curiosity over his job title. So what the hell is a rope access technician? Delish. Source: News Corp Australia \nAustralian Industrial Rope Access (AIRA) operations manager Alistair Merrick says his technicians perform a whole range of jobs —“painting, rendering, rigging, repairing buildings, cleaning, inspecting”— on buildings or structures that can only be accessed via abseiling. \n“It’s a real mixed bag,” Mr Merrick told news.com.au. “We do a whole range of jobs in really hard to access, high places.” \nRichie currently works for a company called All Areas Access. His last mission involved oil rigging work offshore. \nAll Areas Access managing director John Lee told news.com.au he only knew Richie was a contestant on The Bachelorette after the show went to air. \n“He kept it all under wraps until we saw it on TV, in typical Richie style. He’s a very humble guy. He’s a very fun guy to work with. He’s a great mate of ours,” Mr Lee said. \nTechnicians basically abseil up and down buildings or structures doing repair, inspection or maintenance work.

They perform weekly “structural inspections” on the Skycoaster ride at Wet‘n’Wild in Sydney. And for the past 13 years, AIRA technicians have installed the steel support structure inside the Christmas tree in Sydney’s QVB building. \nWhile it’s often risky work, Mr Merrick says most rope access technicians stick to the approved industry’s safety code. \n“If you’re abseiling down a building and you slip on something with your foot, you can imagine how the consequences would be astronomical. \n“For third parties and other people working in the field, the main dangers are a lack of supervision and inadequate training,” he said. \nFor those keen to follow in Richie’s career footsteps, there is even an Australian Rope Access Association with more than 2000 followers on Facebook . \nrebecca.sullivan@news.com.au The Bachelorette: Sam reveals that she 'worried' about Richie's feelings for her 0:34 \nBefore deciding who meets her family, Sam felt relieved when Richie finally opened up to her about his feelings for her.
