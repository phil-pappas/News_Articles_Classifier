Starring Ken Jeong (\"The Hangover\" movies, \"Community\") as a family-man physician, the show airs again at 7:31 p.m. Friday (Oct. 9) on WGNO .\n\"Dr. Ken\" calls back Jeong's real-life pre-comedy career as a doctor, some years of which were served at Ochsner Foundation Hospital . Another New Orleans connection for the show was made at Movie Pitchers, the late and lamented Mid-City cinema-and-comedy-and-beer hall.\n\"That's where I met Ken,\" said Mike O'Connell , a writer and executive producer for the series, and with Jeong a member of the late-1990s lineup of the Brown! improv-comedy troupe that performed \"pretty raucous\" midnight shows at Movie Pitchers. \"It seemed like a lot of drunk high school kids just screaming out inappropriate things at us.\n\"It was a really ridiculous place, a kind of a dodgy theater, but you could get beers and stuff. We would have many beers and say inappropriate things all through the evening.\"\nA Chicago-area native who was a Loyola University student at the time he first met Jeong, O'Connell said his friend's day job was well-known to fellow performers on the local comedy scene. (In addition to improv with Brown!, they both performed standup at Amberjack's, he remembers, among other venues.)\n\"He was like the only real human I knew at that time,\" O'Connell said. \"I just knew a bunch of drunks and some Loyola students. I thought, 'Wow, this guy's got a real thing going on here. He's got the best fallback job I've ever heard of.'\n\"We all knew, and it was something he would lord over us -- no. It was very impressive because the rest of us were just kind of hoboes, you know? Nobody had a backup plan except for Ken.\"\nJeong eventually moved his backup plan to Los Angeles, where he continued to practice medicine while working away at a comedy career. After graduation, O'Connell moved back to Chicago to work at comedy, then eventually to Los Angeles, crashing at Jeong's house for his first couple of weeks in California.\nWhile working as a standup and actor, O'Connell started to write scripts, figuring \"this is a great way to use the comedic skills I've learned through standup,\" he said.\nJeong's breakthrough year, 2009 , saw him in both \"The Hangover\" and \"Community,\" and felt entirely earned to O'Connell.\n\"I'd watched him go through so much stuff,\" he said. \"He's always been so driven. He's just like a hungry guy who knows his skills and knows where he can get himself to.\n\"Something like 'The Hangover,' it's random. But he worked so hard up to that point, it's not the type of thing were it's like, 'This guy doesn't deserve that.' This guy put in the time. This is what happens when you put in time and have so much passion, especially when he was still a doctor. He would go from the clinic to The Improv, or he would go on lunch and do an audition.\n\"There was not going to be any physical thing standing in his way.\"\nJeong and O'Connell have collaborated on comedy all along, including writing together for Jeong's talk-show appearances. Together they produced an hilariously raunchy music video called \"What's It Gonna Be?\" The YouTube version of the video has more than 1.9 million views.\n\"We've always just batted stuff back and forth, writing jokes together for certain things,\" O'Connell said. \"After knowing him for 20 years, he knows that I know his voice. He's comfortable with my sensibility.\"\nTheir collaboration on the \"Dr. Ken\" pilot script with Jared Stern launched a two-year development process that started at NBC before landing at ABC.\nFilming the pilot episode in front of a studio audience was \"was just absolutely exhilarating,\" O'Connell said. \"We just knew we finally had a chance to show that we knew what we'd been talking about the whole time. You can write all day long and all night long, but you have to see him say these things in front of an audience, and then you'll know what it's about. He has such control over his performances. He's' so specific about what he thinks is funny and what works. When he gets in front of a crowd, you cant stop him.\n\"The first night we did it, it was like this ... feels ... good. This feels right.\"\nAs does their partnership, given its roots. O'Connell said he and Jeong frequently revisit their early days on the New Orleans comedy scene.\n\"We talk about it all the time,\" O'Connell said. \"We know how important that was to each other and independently. I think that when you're starting comedy and you're meeting all these people, there's a really pure and kind of beautiful connection to that. Ken doesn't forget where he came from, and I don't forget it either, all the people in New Orleans who supported us.\n\"We always remember Movie Pitchers, and we laugh about it. It was absurd, but it was so fun. So fun.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2094090/"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:42.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
