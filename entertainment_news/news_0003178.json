Gold Rush is also one of the most watched shows on cable. Why? Star Todd Hoffman believes, \"People have always had a mystique about gold.\" \nHoffman is one of the gold miners trying to make his fortune in Alaska, and he tells ABC Radio people like his program because it represents part of the American Dream. \n\"Is there a group of Americans or anybody that can go out, put it out on the line and come up good, you know?
