She passed peacefully surrounded by her loving family as they celebrated her life listening to music from her favourite movie, 'The Quiet Man.' \n\"As much as Maureen cherished her privacy, she always appreciated the expressions of good will from people around the world and from all walks of life. She especially loved it when children recognised her from her role in 'Miracle on 34th Street' and asked her: 'Are you the lady who knows Santa Claus?' She always answered: 'Yes I am. What would you like me to tell him?'\" \nMaureen's family also referenced her patriotism in their statement, encouraging her fans to visit Maureen's native Ireland. \nThey continued: \"While we mourn the loss of a very wonderful woman, we also celebrate her remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world, especially in Ireland, to work hard to make their dreams come true and to always have the courage to stand up for themselves. \n\"For those who may ask what they can do to honour Maureen, we have a simple request: visit Ireland one day and think of her. \n\"Her characters were feisty and fearless, just as she was in real life. She was also proudly Irish and spent her entire lifetime sharing her heritage and the wonderful culture of the Emerald Isle with the world.\" \nMaureen's manager added: \"At 95, she used to say that she had the wear and tear that came with that kind of mileage' \n\"Her and John Wayne [her co-star in 'The Quiet Man'] used to always have a saying, 'We are a couple of Rolls Royces and mileage never hurt a Rolls.' She also used to say, 'Old age is tough, especially when you are so young.' \nMaureen will be buried at the Arlington National Cemetery, next to her husband, US Navy pilot General Charles Blair who died in a plane crash in 1978. editors picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:30:43.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
