The 2015 X Factor judges (Syco/Thames TV) \n“I read about the rumours that Louis is coming back. I thought it was just a rumour, then someone told me he was on TV talking about it as a possibility. I have not been told it’s a possibility,” she said. \nThe 32-year-old singer, who had a spat with Louis, added: “I don’t know how Louis could comment on acts he doesn’t know. \n“He doesn’t know anybody, so I don’t know how that would work out. I’m going to make some phone calls.” Louis Walsh on the 2014 X Factor panel (Syco/Thames TV) \nSimon fuelled the rumours about Louis’s comeback when he said: “I wouldn’t rule out anything. If I thought the viewers would like to see him on some of the live shows, why not?” \nCheryl and Louis have swapped barbed comments in the past, with the Irish manager calling her “lazy” and “irrelevant” and comparing her to past X Factor judges Mel B and Nicole Scherzinger. \nThe Girls Aloud star later posted: “Dear Lou Lou. Try using your mouth to say something positive about something positive.” \nThe Sun has also reported that there may even be a “sixth judge” on each show, with a crop of music legends being brought in to attract older viewers away from BBC rival Strictly Come Dancing. Is Cher heading to The X Factor? (Clint Spaulding/AP) \nCher, Rod Stewart, Dolly Parton and Bryan Adams could be brought in to give their verdicts on the live show performances. Former The Voice coach Tom Jones and Sir Paul McCartney are also in talks, according to the newspaper.
