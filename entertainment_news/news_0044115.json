And yet. Hmm. Well, I really liked it, despite my better judgment.\nJohn Cusack is badly miscast as Paul Soames, a Dashiell Hammett-esque American intelligence officer posing as a pro-Nazi journalist in Berlin, who follows a group of German dignitaries for a diplomatic visit to Shanghai.\nA remarkable city, Shanghai is on the verge of being taken by Japanese forces, who already control much of China. The city is filled with soldiers, spies, drug dealers, arms merchants, and call girls from every corner of the globe.\nSoames is called into action when his friend and fellow spy Conner (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is brutally murdered after stumbling on a piece of information that suggests Japan's fleet may be amassing against U.S. forces in the Pacific.\nThat's right: \"Shanghai\" is about Japan's plot to attack Pearl Harbor. It's October 1941, and virtually everyone in the American intelligence establishment is blissfully unaware of Japan's plans. Everyone, that is, except Conner.\nYet instead of honing in on this promising premise, Håfstrom's film zigs, zags, and careers all over the place with a profusion of fruitless subplots. In one, Soames befriends top triad boss Anthony Lan-Ting (Yun-Fat Chow) while falling in love with his wife Anna (Li Gong). The daughter of a principled Chinese nationalist murdered by the Japanese, Anna is a spy for the city's anti-Japanese resistance force. Another subplot has Soames hunt down Conner's Japanese girlfriend.\nThen there's Cusack's interminable voice-overs explaining the plot as the film moves forward (while going nowhere).\n\"Shanghai\" has a fascinating if outlandish premise, amazing photography, and an amazing cast of international stars: Ken Watanabe, David Morse, Franka Potente, and Hugh Bonneville. Yet it is hampered by weak writing and a badly executed story line.\nDespite all its problems, Håfstrom's film has a nostalgic, 1940s film-noir feel that I found attractive. To enjoy \"Shanghai,\" you have to approach it not as a completed film in its own right, but as a disparate series of cinematic gestures that evoke a genre that was long gone by the 1950s.\n'SHANGHAI\n2 out of 4 stars\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731812", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731812&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731812&h=Movie+review%3A+%27Shanghai%27+is+a+likeable+mess"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:41:50.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
