By India.com Sports Desk on October 19, 2015 at 11:25 PM Comments \nAs the whole world knew it, Virender Sehwag had apparently pulled the curtains on his illustrious career and just as the tributes kept flowing in for a batsman widely regarded as one of the most dangerous batsmen to play the game, there are reports stating that the ‘Nawab of Najafgarh’ has quashed all retirement talks. Sehwag is now in Dubai to play the Masters Cricket League (MCA), which features many former greats like Graeme Smith and Brian Lara. \nSehwag was quoted as saying, “If I am not retired I will not play. I will go back to India and announce my retirement”, when quizzed about playing in league that largely features retired cricketers. Many from the Indian camp have also taking to microblogging site Twitter to salute Sehwag’s contribution to the game. \nModified Date: October 19, 2015 11:25 PM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:40:38.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
