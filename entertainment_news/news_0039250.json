Richardson seeks to educate readers on the underpinnings of island culture and people, and how they affect the rest of the world.\nWhether readers come from a country of hundreds of millions or a small island that disappears on a world map, they’ll find invaluable insights for understanding the world they live in. That includes staying close to one’s roots, despite location – an important ingredient to save island life and culture . Readers may learn how to embrace common bonds and preserve what is important amidst rapidly changing cultural, economic and geographic environments.\n“Make a world of difference by being yourself,” Richardson says. “Sometimes unexpected people from the smallest islands can touch the world, which is just another reason to save island life and culture .”\nRichardson shares decades of stories and discoveries from islands around the world to help him establish the Island Foundation, an organization that aims to promote education, the arts, sports and innovation while preserving island culture and heritage.\n“Lovely read, very thought provoking take on island communities,” writes Amazon reviewer Odelay, who gave the book five stars.\nAbout Carlisle Richardson\nCarlisle Richardson, author of the book “Island Journeys: The Impact of the Island Way of Life at Home and Abroad” ( http://www.islandjourneysbook.com ) grew up on St. Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean.
