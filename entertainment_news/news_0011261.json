Chrissy Teigen And John Legend Are Expecting Their First Baby Christine Teigen John Legend \nThe couple have been trying for years to have children, with Teigen opening up about their struggle on a number of occasions in the last 12 months. \nChrissy Teigen and John Legend have finally got the news they’ve been waiting for so long to hear – they’re expecting their first child! The hotshot couple revealed to their fans via social media that Teigen is pregnant with their first baby, after publicly admitting that they were desperate to get their family started. \n“John and I are so happy to announce that we are pregnant,” Teigen wrote as she posted a black and white photo of the couple on Instagram on Monday (October 12th). The happy picture shows Teigen, 29, lying down and grinning, while Legend, 36, is resting his left hand on her belly.

It hasn’t been easy, but we kept trying because we can’t wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family. We’re so excited that it’s finally happening. Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching!” \nMore: Chrissy Teigen wants to be pregnant as an “excuse to be bigger” \nTeigen and Legend met in 2007 on the set of the singer’s music video for ‘Stereo’. They got engaged after four years of dating, and were married in September 2014 at Lake Como in Italy. \nEarlier this year, Teigen opened up to Us Weekly and she and her husband’s struggles to start their family. “I want a huge family. We want a lot of kids. When it happens, it happens. For us it’s hard because he’s on the road so much and I’m working. People think it happens so easily… but the stars really have to align to have a baby and it is a little miracle, so when it happens… we will be so happy.” \nJust last month, the model appeared on ‘FABLife’ with Tyra Banks to speak about the issue. “I would say, honestly, John and I were having trouble. We would have had kids five, six years ago if it had happened, but my gosh, it’s been a process.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:42:44.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
