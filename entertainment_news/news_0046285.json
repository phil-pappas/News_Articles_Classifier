It's the essence of life and the theme of an exhibition on view at the Schweinfurth Memorial Art Center in Auburn. Titled, \"Water Effect,\" the diverse show is comprised of a variety of works by 56 artists selected from 158 applicants. The wide range of media, which is the show's strength, is as vast as the artists' interpretations of the theme.\nMost of the works on view are two-dimensional; but within that 2-D world you'll see painting, drawing, mixed media, printmaking, photography, video and textiles. There are also a couple of wall installations and 3-dimensional pieces. How the artists interpreted the theme of \"water,\" is as fluid as the element itself. Some chose water as their inspiration, using their medium to interpret some aspect of its power and presence in our lives, while others chose a strictly representational approach, capturing the element in one of the many ways in which we know and experience it.\nAmong the non-representational works there are a variety of highlights. Mary Giehl's massive, (100\" x 100\" x7\") wall-mounted, blue craft felt piece titled \"Rising Water,\" (2013) is a visual interpretation to the devastation and power of the 2011 tsunami that devastated parts of Japan. Leigh Yardley's two suspended acrylic on matte polyester film pieces (86\"x48\"x10\") titled \"Field and Stream,\" (2014) are richly textured and patterned works that are abstract reactions to her interactions with nature. Jennifer Hessler's \"Drain Shelf #7,\" (2014), comprised of cast iron, steel, flame-worked glass, plywood, paint, red iron oxide, wax and miscellaneous hardware, is one of only a few 3-D pieces. The glass droplets at the center of the piece â€“ suggestive of tears - extend the interpretation of water beyond nature to a possible human dimension.\nThe three-paneled mixed media piece titled, \"Receding Fog,\" (2013) by Diane Bowie Zaitlin and the two oil on paper paintings titled, \"\"For the Forgotten,\" (2015) and \"St. Vincent's Wake,\" (2015) by Suzanne Onodera are atmospheric interpretations of water's softer qualities; personal impressions, or collective memories of past observations.\nThose working in a representational style also found infinite variety in the possibilities of water as subject matter. James Skvarch's thought provoking, large-scale (48\"x72\") charcoal drawing titled, \"Looking Back at a Different Future,\" (2015) presents Clinton Square a la Venice; canals take the place of roads and water runs atop overpasses, with the modes of transportation ranging from sail boats to gondolas. Nicora Gangi captures the Golden Gate Bridge swathed in murky fog in a darkly-toned oil painting titled, \"It Also Rises,\" (2014) and Henry J. Drexler portrays a serene summer scene in his acrylic painting titled, \"Cooperstown Boat Docks,\" (2015). Chris Baker's gouache painting titled, \"Morning Reflections,\" (2013) is a deftly executed urban street scene that is also a study in shadows and reflections, while Elisa Root's \"Who'll Jump First,\" (2015) captures a childhood moment from an imaginative perspective.\nThose working in photography took fairly straight forward approaches, with the exception of Jean Somlo's two photos titled, \"Pond Patterns 1 and 5,\" (2015) in which we see the abstract beauty found in naturally occurring surfaces. David Weisbrod documents the process of drilling water wells in Uganda and the effects it has upon a community in a set of three compelling black and white photographs. In the digital images titled, \"Ledyard Canal #5 and #31,\" (2014) Willson Cummer captures the Ledyard Canal in Fayetteville as it looks today; a scenic backdrop to the Village, which is a dramatic contrast to the vital commercial waterway it once was.\n\"Water Effect\" is a simple show that demonstrates just how wide an interpretative range artists can find within a single theme. There's a solid assortment of media and styles on view and, while not all of it rises to the level of the pieces referenced above, it's not likely to disappoint.\nThe Details:\nWhat: \"Water Effects\"\nWhere: Schweinfurth Memorial Art Center, 205 Genesee St. , Auburn\nWhen : Through October 18\nAdmission: $7 for Adults, free to members and children under 12\nHours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday\nInfo: 255-1553 or Schweinfurth Memorial Art Center\nWhile you're there: \"Paintings by Kathryn J.
