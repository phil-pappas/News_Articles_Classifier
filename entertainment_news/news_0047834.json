We discuss the hyperscale storage versus market niche storage approaches, and the markets best served by each. \n\nIn every facet of society, data gathering from connected devices - whether connected to each other or used for tracking processes and things - has driven explosive data growth. Machine-to-machine communication, the Internet of Things, and technological advances in fields like telemedicine and manufacturing have created massive amounts of data. \n\nWhen these voluminous amounts of data are replicated regularly to prevent data loss, a never-ending cycle of data growth is born. Enterprise data centers have a finite amount of storage space available, and capital constraints often limit expansion. The natural enterprise response is to turn to the public cloud for storage needs. Cloud-based storage-as-a-service offers an easily scalable, budget-friendly means of storing corporate data. \n\nThe options in cloud storage are numerous, however, and differentiation among mass-market providers is minimal. Instead, this study has determined that the cloud storage market has taken two distinct paths. First, there are mass-market, hyperscale providers like Amazon Web Services, Google, or Oracle that provide basic storage space in their cloud storage offers. \n\nThese providers solve a space issue for customers that need to store large amounts of data, with service being a secondary focus, and often at an additional cost. There are also a number of smaller providers that are differentiating their cloud storage offerings by bundling services that meet a distinct set of business needs. \n\nKey Topics Covered: \n\n1.
