He feels with all the old characters returning, room for salaries and story lines had to be made. Allison Sweeney who plays Will's mom Sami is returning. The actress thinks killing off such a legacy character as Will is a big mistake. Some members of GLAAD are unhappy that the most visible gay soap opera couple (Will and Sonny) is gone. Of course, Paul is still around, but who knows for how long. The plot about Paul being John's son was written by the former regime. No word if the present scripters are invested in the character.\nNot everyone in Salem is dead. EJ, who we saw die in Sami's arms, is alive. Executive producer Ken Corday said anyone who died after September was really dead. He did not guarantee that folks who died before would not come back from the dead. EJ died before September.\nDaniel Goddard (Cane, \"The Young and the Restless\") is still recovering from the broken elbow he incurred on the set while staging a fight scene. The Aussie actor is back in the studio, but he has a long recovery road before him.\nGoddard took to Facebook to give fans an update following his recent surgery. \"Hey I hope you're doing well! I just want to give you an update on my elbow,\" he wrote. \"First of all I hope you are safe and well and taking care of yourself! So... I just got my cast off and fitted for my brace. I have to wear it for the next six weeks. It's been two weeks today since my surgery and I have to start rehab ASAP so that my arm doesn't seize up... Right now it doesn't move on its own, what a bummer! And I need to get it bending soon. It's going to be a long recovery.... But we will get it done together! Talk soon, love you! Daniel\"\nFor \"Young and the Restless\" fans wondering where Jill has been, Jess Walton, who has played the character with a heart of gold, is semi-retired. Living in another state, Walton is fine with her occasionally recurring status. This fall, in commemoration of five decades of \"Days of our Lives,\" the daytime drama will release \"Days of our Lives: 50 Years\" by Greg Meng. The book's release is being kicked off with a multi-city book signing tour including some of daytime's most beloved faces. Cities slated for the tour include: New York, Northvale (New Jersey), Phoenix, Los Angeles, Denver, Kansas City, Atlanta, and Pigeon Forge.\nCast members participating in the nationwide tour include: Deidre Hall, Kristian Alfonso, Thaao Penghlis, Stephen Nichols, Galen Gering, Lauren Koslow, Greg Vaughan, Camila Banus, Melissa Reeves, Billy Flynn, Christopher Sean, Kate Mansi, Drake Hogestyn, Suzanne Rogers, Bryan Dattilo, Martha Madison, James Reynolds, Bill Hayes, Susan Seaforth-Hayes, James Lastovic, Peggy McCay, Arianne Zucker, Eric Martsolf, Jen Lilley, Wally Kurth, Sal Stowers and Judi Evans.\n===", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:21:09.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
