Permission given to use photo by Ubisoft During the late part of this summer, Ubisoft showed off a new feature in Assassin's Creed Syndicate and it was the Chameleon ability, which we found out would be exclusive to Evie Frye, who is one of the two main protagonists in the open-world game. We've heard a lot from readers about their interest in the ability and thought we would share some details on how it plays into your Assassin's Creed Syndicate experience.\nI recently had the opportunity to review Assassin's Creed Syndicate and you can check out my review through this link here , but if you were wondering how long it took me to unlock the ability, that number checks in at roughly 13 hours of playtime. This number encompasses me playing through more side content than main story content, as I chose to level up both Evie and Jacob before fully getting into the story. This isn't to say that 13 hours is the general rule across the board, it's merely how long it took me to unlock the skill.\nIf you're wondering which mission type rewards you with the most experience points (XP) and/or currency, aside from the main missions, I'd have to say that is Carriage Heists. Those usually, if not always, provided me with nearly a skill point after each heist I completed. The first few you play may not be as high in XP, however, after the first few they quickly rise in value.\nSome other mission types that proved to be quite rewarding from an XP standpoint were the Bounty and Templar Hunt missions. They didn't provide me with as much XP as the Carriage Heists, but I learned how to breeze through them, especially when both Evie and Jacob leveled up.\nOne of the things I will say about the Chameleon ability is that it's not as powerful, strong or impactful of an ability as we all thought it would be. The \"invisibility\" nature of it only kicks in when Evie isn't moving and hasn't been completely detected. Personally, it didn't really influence my experience or play style one way or the other. If any ability did, it was the Evie-specific skill that doubled up her knife count, as I used those in just about every mission I played with her.\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate really is one of the best installments I've played in years and it overcame a lot of doubt I had going into the game.
