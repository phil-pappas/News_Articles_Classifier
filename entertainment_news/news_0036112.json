I said what was on my mind. That’s the way I’ve always spoken.” Daniel Craig as James Bond in Spectre (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc) \nIn the Time Out interview, when asked whether he could imagine doing another Bond movie, he said: “Now? I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists. No, not at the moment. Not at all. That’s fine. I’m over it at the moment. We’re done. All I want to do is move on.” \nThe 47-year-old commented: “If I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.” \nBut with the film due to premiere on Monday, he has now said he a return to the role of 007 is an option: “There is no contract. It’s up to me.” Promoted stories Daniel Craig with Bond director Sam Mendes (Joel Ryan/Invision) \nDaniel married actress Rachel Weisz in 2011, and said he was keen to get back to family life after filming – instead of going on a bender. \nHe said: “I used to go and get drunk for a month, but I don’t need to do that any more. I just want to get home. I have been away for eight months. That’s the biggest strain on a film like this, everybody is away from their families. I want to spend some time with them.” \nSpeaking about needing knee surgery after seriously injuring his knee while shooting a fight scene on a train with 6ft 6in baddie Mr Hinx (Dave Bautista), he said: “Sadly the scene isn’t in the film. I wish it was but I had to stop halfway through because I did my knee in and I was like, ‘Woah!’” Dave Bautista, Daniel Craig and actress Lea Seydoux during shooting for Spectre (Kerstin Joensson/AP) \n“I had to have a little surgery. It was a terrifying moment when I thought they were going to have to shut down while I had it. We were right into it by that point. So I had to protect myself a bit more. It slowed me down a bit, but it didn’t stop me doing what I wanted to do. \n“But, you know, it’s movie-making. You fake it as best you can and they’ve done an amazing job – most of it is real, there is a little CGI.” \nAnd with filming stopped so the star could recover, he joked: “I like to think of it as a deliberate trick on my behalf to give everyone a break!” Share article \nSpectre is released in UK cinemas on Monday, October 26.
