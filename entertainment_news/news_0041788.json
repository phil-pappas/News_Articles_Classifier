Launch slideshow » \nWith the arrival of Lyft and Uber in Las Vegas, the transportation revolution is underway whether or not taxi drivers and fleet owners like it. The app-ride-share services are here to stay. Tourists love them because they are already familiar with their service in the cities where they live, and residents will love them because of reliable, clean and prompt service in the suburbs, which have generally been ignored by cab companies. \nLas Vegas, the cutting-edge city of entertainment, has finally gotten with the times and embraced the iPhone and Android hail-a-ride systems. We’re still waiting for the airport authority to allow Lyft and Uber to serve arriving and departing passengers at our McCarran International Airport, but Strip hotels are already setting up pickup and drop-off areas to make the Lyft and Uber experience easy and friendly. \nLyft celebrated its official Las Vegas launch at the new Lavo Casino Club in Palazzo and sister nightspot Tao in the Venetian. I downloaded my app and used it for the first time upon arrival at JFK International Airport in New York last week. It was so easy and smooth. My driver was there curbside on arrival in three minutes, and 21 minutes later I was at my Manhattan Marriott Hotel — all cheaper, cleaner and faster. He even loaded my luggage into the trunk with a smile and no grumbling. \nLyft Chief Marketing Officer Kira Wampler talked with me a few days after Lyft service began in Las Vegas. It was the biggest launch week ever in the history of the company. \nKira, tell me the reaction to what has happened in the first few days that Lyft has taken off? \nA couple of things. One, it’s been our biggest launch week ever in the history of the company, so we think that’s a good vibe. Locals and tourists in Las Vegas are really excited about the service being in Las Vegas. We can see that in the numbers. I talked to a lot of folks at our launch party and our after-party, and people are really excited to have an additional option to get around. \nWhen I spoke to our locals, you know a lot of them work shifts at odd hours, they get out late, and having a convenient, reliable and safe ride home is really important. As well as talking to people who are visiting Las Vegas and love to visit Las Vegas. Having the same kind of reliable convenience and service in Las Vegas that they have in their hometown, it’s something that they really value. \nWe feel really strongly that our role in Las Vegas is to enhance the existing services, so whether that’s enhancing the existing public transportation services, but really hoping to deliver a good experience for a large number of people who live in Las Vegas and visit Las Vegas. I think there is clearly room for multiple services to provide a good experience. \nThere’s no question about that because you could never get a taxi if you lived off the Strip. \nI’ve heard that from a lot of people at the party. One of my colleague’s aunt and uncle live in Henderson, and they used Lyft to get to the party. They were so excited, they had a great experience, they loved their driver, and they said, “Look, we have a lot of people come visit us, we want to come down to the Strip, but we don’t want to fight with parking or traffic, we don’t want to drink and drive. \n“Lyft is a great option because we feel really good about the fact that we can push the button, request a ride, see the car coming, know that it’s going to come within minutes, then get where we need to go immediately and reliably.” \nDo you have numbers yet of how many cars and drivers you have on call? \nWe’re not sure of the specific numbers, but I would say again back to what I mentioned earlier, this is by far our biggest launch. Certainly our biggest opening market in terms of numbers of available drivers. \nWhen I was there, every time I opened the app, the ETAs were about two minutes, meaning that there were sufficient cars such that our cars would get to you within two minutes. Now I was on the Strip, so I wasn’t out, so the ETA of some of the others will vary, but on the Strip it’s looking like cars will be available within one to two minutes. \nAt this moment, neither you nor Uber can operate at the airport, is that correct? \nThat’s correct. However, we’re very hopeful that will change soon. Obviously, we want to work with all of the various local organizations to make sure that we’re doing it the right way. We’re the first and I believe still the only ride-sharing company to have a license from the city of Las Vegas. \nThat’s our style, Robin. We focus on solely good relationships, working very closely with our government and official partners. We’re doing the same with the airport, and we think it’s just a matter of when and where. \nHow was the first week for Lyft? \nFrom what I understand from the team on the ground, it was great. We had tons of drivers, we had plenty of people on the ground helping people sign up for the Lyft app, and we had really good ETAs. \nKira, since you’ve mentioned the U word, who was first into this ride-share-app business? \nIt’s a really good question. John Zimmer and Logan Green are the two founders of Lyft, and the two of them have been working on and obsessed with transportation for over a decade. Logan grew up in L.A., and he likes to describe that he was traumatized by Los Angeles traffic as a kid. \nWhen he went to college, he purposely went to UC Santa Barbara without a car. He was the youngest person on the County of Santa Barbara Transportation Board, and, as you can imagine, he got an-eye opening experience that being on that board was not necessarily going to change the problems of transportation. \nAt the same time, he went on a trip to Zimbabwe and experienced the local jitneys that were private enterprise taking the place of public infrastructure. When he came back from that experience more than a decade ago, he started building a ride-sharing product for the service that he was building on the web. He was really building out a tool at the time that would allow people to share rides, particularly in long distances. \nSeparately, John Zimmer grew up on the East Coast, went to Cornell, obsessed with hospitality and became very influenced by one of his professors in a class about urbanization and really became concerned about what’s going to happen to humans if we all move into cities, which is what’s occurring, and how are we going to connect with each other? How are we going to stay connected to others? \nHe zoned in on transportation as a way to better connect people even as they’re urbanizing. John and Logan were connected to each other through Facebook, and the two of them joined together to create Zimride. Zimride is this early sort of ride-sharing product about a decade ago. \nUber started with a mobile app before we did, and they started with a very different approach, which was there are idle drivers with black cars and town cars and how do we make those idle drivers more efficient. They started that product experience in 2009. \nIn about 2011 to 2012, John and Logan had been working on Zimride. They were doing really well, but they didn’t feel like they were having the impact on transportation that they wanted to have. \nTheir vision is every seat, every car, every driver and such that when all the seats are full in a car, there are fewer cars on the road so we all get along much more quickly. They pivoted to Lyft, and they were the first to launch pure-to-pure car sharing, allowing anyone with a car to drive anybody who needs a ride. \nWe launched in 2012 with Lyft with the pure-to-pure car sharing, and about seven or eight months later, Uber launched Uber X, which is their version of pure-to-pure car sharing. The guys with the app on trying to transform transportation for over a decade started first with a web product that allows for long-distance ride sharing, then we were the first to do pure-to-pure car sharing. \nWe were also the first to launch live sharing in the form of replying back in the summer of 2014, and that was in four markets. Today, we’re coast to coast and now in Las Vegas, which we’re really excited about. \nOne of our key differences is instead of starting with how do we make people who drive professionally more efficient and fill more of their time, we really started with “fill every seat in every car.” \nIs Lyft just America, or are you international, as well? \nWe’re currently just focused on the U.S. market, but we recently signed a big partnership with a major ride-sharing company in China. Thus, the ability for a Chinese traveler coming to the U.S., when he lands, he will be able to use his Chinese app, and what they’ll be getting is a Lyft car, then the reverse experience when a Lyft passenger is traveling to China. That partnership will be one of the ways that we’ll expand internationally. \nSo you are 65 U.S. cities at the moment? With four more announced today? \nLyft Line is an additional market, carpooling, so that’s in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin and New York, and we just announced that we’ll be launching in Boston. Lyft Line will be in Las Vegas soon, but we don’t have a date yet. \nIn the end, do taxi companies embrace you, accept you and stop fighting change? \nIn the end, what has to occur is that these services, whether it’s our service, Uber services, taxi services, etc., have to innovate to deliver a better experience for customers. As any of these companies focus on innovation, that’s the way to win. \nThere are tools they use that may or may not lead to that, but what I’ve seen over two decades of working on products and services that disrupt markets is the way you win is because you’re delivering a great service to customers. \nI think in Las Vegas, 40 million-plus people travel to Las Vegas every year, there absolutely is a need for many kinds of transportation services, but every transportation service is going to have to innovate to deliver a good experience. \nExcept taxis don’t have apps. \nHey, apps are easy to make. \nAs chief marketing officer, do you have a target of where you want to be one year from now in Las Vegas? \nAbsolutely. I think we want to be an integral part of the transportation experience in Las Vegas for locals and travelers. A couple of things we didn’t touch on that are important to know, especially for Las Vegas, because of John, who went to Cornell Hotel School, we’re the only ride app that allows for tips. \nIt’s not required, but we make it really easy to do in the app. Our drivers keep 100 percent of their tips, and in a city like Las Vegas where hospitality and service are so valued and critical, their being able to reward on that service is extremely important to us. \nIt has become a huge differentiation for people who want to drive on our platform. The other thing is we have a program for people who drive a certain number of hours, they keep 100 percent of what they make on the platform. \nWe are alone in that. We’re big believers in treating our drivers really well, allowing for passengers to treat them well, creating a great symbiotic relationship in the car where people end up having a good experience. That’s why we think we have the ability to be the ride-sharing app of choice for drivers and passengers. \nCan a Las Vegas driver work for both companies? \nYes. \nSo your Lyft driver could turn up in a Uber car and visa versa? \nThat’s correct. \nYou’re obviously pleased with how it has started and comfortable that it’s going to expand and will become a regular, accepted part of our transportation system. The majority of Las Vegas residents greatly welcome you and the Uber folks. \nWe’re thrilled to be here, and we’re thrilled to continue to learn the market and learn what it needs. \nSome of the hotels have already designated what I’ll call a waiting zone where the Lyft driver goes to pick up or drop off the Lyft passenger. Is that happening more and more? \nYes. I think what you can expect and what will continue to happen over the coming weeks and months as both ride sharing become more available in Las Vegas, we’ll continue to work closely with hotels. \nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon .
