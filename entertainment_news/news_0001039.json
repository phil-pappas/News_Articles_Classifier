(UPI) -- A California engineer created his own \"real\" version of Marvel hero Thor's hammer that only he can lift using an electromagnet and fingerprint technology.\nAllen Pan, who posted the video to his Sufficiently Advanced channel on YouTube, took his \"real\" Mjolnir hammer out on the streets of Venice Beach and challenged strangers to attempt to lift the hammer from metal surfaces.\nThe video shows numerous participants fail to lift the hammer before Pan easily picks it up himself.\nPan revealed the hammer works using an electromagnet from a microwave oven that creates a magnetic pull strong enough to make the object seem too heavy to lift. He said a thumbprint sensor on the handle can tell when he is the one trying to lift the hammer and switches off the magnet.\nOne of the bystanders recruited by Pan to attempt to lift the hammer calls the engineer out upon discovering the thumbprint scanner, while another manages to lift the hammer itself by spinning it off of a manhole cover and onto the non-metal sidewalk.\n\"If anybody knows Chris Hemsworth or Stan Lee let'em know that I can register multiple people's fingerprints to the hammer,\" Pan wrote in the video's description.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738994&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738994", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1738994&h=%27Real%27+version+of+Thor%27s+hammer+can+only+be+lifted+by+the+%27worthy%27"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:24:54.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
