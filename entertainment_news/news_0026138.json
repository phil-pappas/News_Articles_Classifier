It also shifted more units than any other album this week. This is Gomez's second No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. Total worldwide sales of Gomez's albums stand at nearly 7 million units and single sales are over 22 million worldwide.\nOn October 9 th release day, Selena hosted a #REVIVALListeningParty on Spotify and a Q&A on Twitter for it's first-ever \"New Music Friday.\" During the campaign the hashtag was used 446k times generating over 36 million impressions.\nRevival has also earned Gomez a host of rave reviews. Entertainment Weekly called it \"one of fall's sleekest albums\" and \"as fresh and forward-thinking as the music of indie darlings Tove Lo and FKA Twigs,\" while Rolling Stone raved \"this is the sound of a newly empowered pop artist growing into her strengths like never before.\" USA Today noted that \"Gomez is bound to get at least a few skeptics off of Instagram and onto the dance floor\" with her \"cool, groovy and electro-savvy\" album. \"Gomez arrives with a pop vengeance throughout the record, as ear-sucking hooks and telling lyrics lay the groundwork for '80s-infused dance riffs and head-rushing genre-hopping that saturates all 14 tracks,\" raved Complex .\nThe first single from Revival, \"Good For You\" featuring A$AP Rocky, is Gomez's biggest hit to date. It is her fastest-ever platinum seller as well as her highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Good For You\" spent three consecutive weeks at No. 1 at Top 40 radio.\nLast week, Gomez announced that she will embark on her worldwide \"Revival Tour\" in 2016. The first leg will find Gomez traveling to 41 cities across the United States and Canada. The tour kicks off in Las Vegas on May 6 th at Mandalay Bay and hits major markets including New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Boston , Dallas , Toronto , Montreal , Vancouver , and more.
