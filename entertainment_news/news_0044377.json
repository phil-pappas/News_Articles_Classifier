I don’t know whether that’s a good or bad thing,” Daniels praised the star. \n“I remember the love scene you did with John Cusack. I said, ‘John, you’re hurting her.’ You were bent over the washer and dryer. I said, ‘Nicole, are you OK?’ And you said, ‘I’m fine.’ But it was clear that he was throwing you around the f**king room like a mop. [laughs] And the next day you came to set bruised.” \nKidman explained that actors don’t want to “humiliate” each other in certain scenes.
