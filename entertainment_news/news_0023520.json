We want to get a green screen,\" she said. \"The sky is the limit for the kids.\" \nChatfield has been teaching for seven years and started at Williamsburg Collegiate Charter School as a reading teacher. \nBut her background is rich in theater. \nShe graduated from Barnard University with an English major and a concentration in theater. She's the co-executive director for the National Theatre for Student Artists , an organization that brings in students from across the country to create new off-Broadway work. \nAnd as a teen, she started her own theater company, she said. \n\"It was a big part of the reason why I’m really big on student-run, student-managed work,\" Chatfield said. \"That’s what I was doing at that age.\" \nWith money for new equipment, Chatfield hopes that the school will be able host a short film festival at the end of the year, with three to four films produced and created entirely by students. \nIdeas for the student's short films go far beyond the gang culture storyline that first inspired her to apply for the grant. \nThe screenplays include a tale of a dragon attacking a kingdom where the princess — instead of the prince — must save the day to a story of a zombie apocalypse where a young girl must take a boy under her wing. \nStudents are expected to start filming by December and have a festival at the end of the year, Chatfield said. \n\"They are definitely creative kids,\" she said. \"Their ideas are just mind-blowing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
