They’re joined by five other hopefuls: Jason Bemowski, Lisa Campbell, Ted Hoffman, Lance Gregory and Robin Grundmeyer. Each highlight their plans to meet the city’s infrastructure needs.\nRAISING FUNDS Candidates approaches to achieving the goal vary.\nGrundmeyer said the city should focus on attracting businesses along Hamner Avenue to bring in sales tax and other fees. A recreational runner, Grundmeyer said more events such as 5K runs would draw people into town and may keep them there overnight, raking in more tax revenue.\n“We need to think outside the box about the types of events that can be hosted at our facilities,” Grundmeyer said. “The Brew N Cue Festival (a barbecue at Norco’s George Ingalls Equestrian Center) is a perfect example of how the right events can draw large groups of folks to our town.”\nMany candidates said it’s important to strike while the iron is hot with respect to Silverlakes.\nThe city should capitalize by seeking businesses, restaurants and hotels, Campbell said.\n“This means developing multiple vacant parcels within the city with point-of-sale businesses that will benefit the city via our portion of the sales tax revenue,” Campbell said.\nCampbell, Gregory and Bemowski said one way to entice businesses is to make the city’s code enforcement department more efficient. Both recommend streamlining the permit process to reduce delays on new projects. Gregory said the city should hire another code enforcement officer to ensure the town doesn’t fall into disrepair.\n“When there is a lack of enforcement this creates a ripple effect and can hurt home values and have a negative impact on the desire to be a destination spot,” Gregory said.\nBemowski also criticized the permitting process, saying the cumbersome format has stifled growth.\n“Our permitting process is horrible and prevents business from easily growing and building,” said Bemowski, who pledged to make it “how it should be, with the city begging you to build and develop.”\nRAISING REVENUE As Norco works to become a destination city, Higgins and Hoffman have proposed selling advertisements at local parks. For example, Higgins said, an arena at Ingalls Park could be named for a company and dozens of banners sold to regional advertisers.\nSelling unused city land to developers was a quick, revenue-generating move favored by nearly all the candidates. Higgins took it one step further, proposing the partial sale of Neil Snipes Park along Hamner Avenue and the full sale of Parmenter Park on Reservoir Drive. The mayor said he’s met with developers and lawyers, trying to find the best fits for more than 130 acres of city land.\n“It will give us more diversity, infrastructure money on development impact fees and an increase in tax dollars,” Higgins said.\nHoffman said Horsetown USA should push for businesses such as hotels to generate more taxes. Hoffman stressed the importance of protecting rural lifestyles as new development occurs.\n“With two large properties (former Wyle Labs and Norco Egg Ranch) being looked at for future development, it is imperative that the council makes sure it protects the integrity of our city charter and zoning in its decision making,” Hoffman said.\nHanna, a current councilman, said he would push to market Ingalls Park and Silverlakes. Beyond that, Hanna said he’d look to the suggestions of a specially-formed city panel for a recommendation on how to build a rainy day fund for infrastructure.\nRAISE TAXES?\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gomcc30i.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q3-b88525681z.120151002155401000guhccael.10.jpg", "http://www.electlancegregory.webs.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gomcc30i.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbkcf.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba30.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba1e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbp8j.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba9m.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba9m.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gc5cb2sb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q4-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbkcf.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://www.robingrundmeyerforcouncil.weebly.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba1e.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gdrcbp8j.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000grrcba30.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nvm7q5-b88525681z.120151002155401000gc5cb2sb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvm7q3-b88525681z.120151002155401000guhccael.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:16:28.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
