She filed a “terroristic threats” report with Metro police at 10:51 p.m., but there have been no reports of any arrests, or no indication of whether the county commissioner has a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Neither the commissioner nor his wife have returned calls seeking comment, which speaks volumes.\n“The complainant advised that she felt that he was trying to intimidate her even though he did not verbally say anything,” according to the police report. After the incident, McKeithen said she had David Self, who is running for the 6th District seat, and some others walk her out to her car.\nMr. Self said he did not see Shabazz flash the gun but could tell she was concerned when McKeithen asked him to help.\nAccording to the Georgia Code, an individual found guilty of the offense of a terroristic threat or act shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years, or both.\nThis is a serious charge against Mr. Shabazz, as any candidate for public office must be free to state his or her opinions about how local government is being run. Indeed, many of the precious freedoms that all Americans enjoy today stem from brave citizens who stood up to the tyranny of an English king. Savannahians shouldn’t have to fear local officials who think and act like tyrannical monarchs.\nFor those reasons, local authorities must give this terroristic threat case the attention it deserves in the days and weeks ahead prior to the election.\nThat means Metro police investigators and Chatham County District Attorney Meg Heap must give this case a high priority and show there is no room for intimidation in the electoral process. Voters in the city’s 5th District on Savannah’s westside deserve to know by Nov. 3 whether one of the two candidates in this race was trying to bully and threaten the other. And don’t forget about Savannah’s ongoing crime problem. This alleged episode illustrates Savannah’s gun-violence problem in a microcosm — someone with a gun allegedly threatening the weak and innocent. Mr. Shabazz, through his own irresponsible antics — trying to organize a boycott against an Augusta Avenue convenience store owner last year following the arrest and shooting of a wanted man and striking a city employee at a traffic stop this summer then fleeing the scene of the accident — has been a huge embarrassment to the people in his district and to the entire County Commission that, by their own silence, appears to tolerate his reckless if not illegal behavior.\nIf anything, this arrogant blow-hard appears to be acting as if the laws don’t apply to him — and, worst of all, those who are in position to do something about it seem to be cowed into looking the other way. Their continued insistence not to censure or reprimand one of their own, even though the county’s Code of Ethics seems to provide that option, defies all logic.\nBut Metro police officials can’t look the other way, not when, by their own statistics, 4,026 gunshots have been reported in the city between Jan. 1 and Aug. 30 this year and 26 people are dead.\nNeither can Ms. Heap, who has a responsibility to prosecute law-breakers without fear or favor.\nAgain, Mr. Shabazz hasn’t given his side of the story. And law-abiding citizens have rights to own and carry firearms, but they must do so lawfully. When such gun laws are violated, police and prosecutors must make examples of the violators to help keep gun-violence in check. Keeping commissioners in check is a job for county commissioners. The previous commission, under the leadership of Chairman Pete Liakakis, made a serious stab at enforcing an ethics code. While it probably won’t stop ethical breaches, at least it gives county governments the ability to police the behavior of commissioners who shame their office. And Mr. Shabazz needs serious policing.\nIn Oct. 1990, the Commission enacted an ethic ordinance that set out rules against commissioners using improper influence, doing business with the county, soliciting favors and accepting gifts.\nSome actions required by the law never happened, apparently after County Attorney Jon Hart raised questions. The law required every elected county official to file annual reports showing his income interests and property holdings, as well as those held by his spouse, children, businesses and trusts. The law also called for creation of a five-member Board of Ethics. Members were to be appointed from the Savannah Bar Association, Board of Commissioners, and Superior Court judges.\nMr. Hart questioned the constitutionality of that setup. For example, separation-of-powers prevent the commission from forcing Superior Court judges to participate, he said. Mr. Liakakis, to his credit, named a five-member panel, chaired by attorney Steve Scheer, to address Mr. Hart’s concerns. “The main thing is to ensure citizens of Chatham County know that officials, elected and appointed, are acting in a manner where there’s no appearance of impropriety,” Scheer said in March. That ideal is still worth pursuing.\nUsing your public office to campaign for another elected official — Commissioner Shabazz going to political forums to campaign for his wife’s re-election to City Council — reeks of nepotism and is an inappropriate use of a county office. The county’s Code of Ethics would seem to prohibit Mr. Shabazz’s shenanigans, regardless of the threat charge.\nIn a code section that addresses “Use of Prestige of Office; Harassment; Improper Influence,” the code states that “an official shall not intentionally use the prestige of his/her office or official title or position for his/her own personal gain or that of another.”\nThe code further states that “any elected official of the county who knowingly violates any provision of the Code of Ethics shall be subject to public reprimand or censure by majority vote of the Chairman and Commissioners.”\nIt’s time for the county to get cracking on its Ethics Code. Unfortunately, there’s no urgency on the county’s part, which sends a message that commissioners don’t want to be bound by restrictions on their behavior. Sadly, that’s a win for the bullies.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:28:13.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
