Masterton was also issued a notice of remedial warning saying that he violated a board policy related to ethics and conduct when he \"failed to demonstrate integrity and honesty.\"\nThe notice alleges that Masterton \"disregarded the legal rights of and procedures due [to] students and parents as required under the regulations of the Illinois State Board of Education.\" It also accuses Masterton of disregarding federal regulations concerning the \"determination of student eligibility for special education services and prior parental notice of changes.\"\nBut what, exactly, Masterton allegedly did is unclear.\nA description of Masterton's alleged actions was completely redacted from the notice of remedial warning that was provided to the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate following a Freedom of Information Act request.\nDistrict 64 attorney Terry Hodges said releasing the details contained in the notice could potentially identify a student because Masterton teaches a small group of children.\n\"The district strongly believes that it needs to protect student confidentiality and will weigh the request for FOIA documents with that in mind,\" Hodges told the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate. \"When the circumstances are such that we believe a student can be identified, we are going to redact the relevant information that would allow the identification.\"\nHodges did say that \"there was something done to a student that violated [the student's] special education rights\" and that the alleged actions did not result in physical harm to a student.\nThe warning says administrative staff had previously discussed \"deficiencies\" with Masterton and that could \"lead to [his] dismissal\" if not corrected immediately.\nMasterton did not respond to a request from the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate seeking comment. Erin Breen, president of the union representing District 64 teachers, also did not respond to an email message.\nBoard President Anthony Borrelli declined to provide specifics of the allegations against Masterton, citing advice from the district's lawyers.\n\"We're not legal savants or legal representatives,\" Borrelli said. \"We take our marching orders in areas of legalities from the district's legal representatives.\"\nMasterton spoke to the board on Sept. 28 during a closed-door session prior to the start of the regular school board meeting, Borrelli said during the public portion of the meeting.\nVoting against Masterton's suspension was board member Tom Sotos. Scott Zimmerman, who was participating in the meeting via phone, voted \"present.\"\nSotos said he was \"happy\" to have had the chance to hear from Masterton.\n\"It gave us an ability to hear his side of what happened and gauge his sincerity,\" Sotos said during the Sept. 28 meeting. \"I would like to say that the conduct in question, in my opinion, should not be construed by anybody as a purposeful act or acts done maliciously by Mr. Masterton to negatively affect any of his students. On the contrary, in my opinion Mr. Masterton had good intentions and had his students' best interests at heart.\"\nSotos went on to acknowledge that \"certain policies and rules were violated.\"\nThe Park Ridge Herald-Advocate has filed an objection with the Illinois Attorney General's Office, asking that District 64 be directed to release the redacted portions of Masterton's warning.\nThis is the second time in a month that District 64 officials have heavily redacted information about alleged teacher misconduct, arguing that it could identify students.\nDistrict officials declined to provide details in September on a $16,500 fine that was issued to Kate and Victor De La Pasqua. Kate De La Pasqua is listed as a teacher at Lincoln Middle School in Park Ridge, according to the school website.\nAt the time, Borrelli would only say that matter involved a \"residency\" issue. The De La Pasquas did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\nThe Park Ridge Herald-Advocate is also awaiting a response from the Illinois Attorney General's Office on that case.\njjohnson@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @Jen_Pioneer\n Educators Freedom of Information Act", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5618395f/turbine/ct-prh-teacher-suspension-tl-1015-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:21:57.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
