Hunting and habitat loss had eradicated the species in the 1800s.\nVeverka said the bear was last seen in the Michigan City area in late July and is believed to have spent most of the past two months just north of the state line, feeding on native nuts, berries and insects that are becoming increasingly scarce.\nNow that he's back in Indiana he's been raiding residents' bird feeders and trash cans.\n\"A bear's life is ruled by food. And now he's trying to build weight, to build fat for winter. He's trying to get food wherever he can,\" Veverka said.\nPete Livas of Panos Farms, a Michigan City honey and herb farm about four miles south of the Indiana-Michigan state line, said the bear visited the farm early Thursday, upended a trash can and feasted on peanut butter and old honey in discarded jars.\nHe found the bear's footprints in the area where the farm's bee hives are kept, but those hives are now in winter storage. During the summer, however, the bear broke into some hives and devoured close to 10 pounds of honey, Livas said.\nFirst black bear in 144 years roams northwest Indiana Ted Gregory The Chicago Bears are where they're supposed to be — in preseason training camp.

The northwest Indiana bear is being a little less cooperative.\nSince June, a black bear tracked from Michigan and thought to be a male weighing about 200 pounds has been roaming Indiana, primarily around Michigan City,...\n(Ted Gregory) The bear has now visited the farm four times since June, but Livas said it hasn't been too much of a problem. In fact, he and his wife find the elusive animal an amusing and interesting visitor.\n\"We think it's kind of cool that's he still around,\" he said.\nVeverka said the bear could possibly hibernate in the Michigan City area if it finds a suitable den such as a hollow tree. Black bears usually hibernate between late November and late December.\n\"At this point, I'd say it's unlikely that he moves real far back north,\" he said.\nAssociated Press\n Biology", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185204/turbine/ct-indiana-black-bear-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55bbd0d5/turbine/ct-black-bear-northwest-indiana-met-20150731"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:25:35.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
