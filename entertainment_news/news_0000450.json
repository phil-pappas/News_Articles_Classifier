The actor came to the Sri Kanteerava Studio driving the car himself. After paying homage at his father Rajkumar's memorial, he attended the muharat. His mother Parvathamma switched on the camera for the first shot while his wife Geetha and brother-in-law Madhu Bangarappa held the clap-board for the shot.\nTo add to the moment, younger brother Puneeth directed the first scene. The film is the third for director Manju Swaraj after Sishira and Shravani Subramanya. Producer B Mahadevu and son Manu had vowed after their previous disaster that they would make a film only with Puneeth. When asked about it the producer said they will first make a film with Puneeth's elder brother Shivarajkumar but the film with Puneeth is still on.The surprise at the muharat was actress Prema. She was seen in public after a long time. It turns out that the actress has settled down in New Zealand and was back in Bengaluru for a short time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:05:06.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
