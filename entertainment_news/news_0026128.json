Our home has eight doors like the ones in the photo, all made of hollow, hard plastic that try to imitate the look of wood. Their finish is faded and looks fake and the doorknobs are horribly ugly. One of the downstair doors has a hole because the plastic door was not strong enough to stop the impact of another doorknob. The laundry room has a cheap light imitation wood that I would also like to replace. I would love white, more contemporary and sturdy wooden doors with modern doorknobs. It would feel good to walk into my house and see a fresh, new look!
