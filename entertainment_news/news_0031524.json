I'm a captain,\" the 52-year-old, Emmy winner told reporters at New York Comic Con Sunday.\n\"This feels like an old, comfortable glove that just slips on, but it's a new glove,\" Chiklis said of his character in the Batman origin story. \"I'm not interested in re-treading and doing the same things that I've done before. That's not interesting to me. That's not fun. What's interesting is it is this sort of great hybrid of two of the genres that I've spent a lot of time in my career -- that I keep gravitating towards, I suppose -- and, also, I guess the industry gravitates towards me for them, which is law-enforcement stuff and comic-book stuff. But, in both circumstances, this character and this world are very different than the ones I've visited prior. And, also, there is this great, heightened thing that goes on with Gotham . The DC Universe is very different than the Marvel Universe. It's a much more noir, Heart of Darkness kind of a feel, right? So, it gets into the evil that men do kind of darkness and I love the whole serialization of this show that we're going for; that it's not this stand-alone procedural. We're going big or going home. These guys have really blown the top off the whole storytelling aspect of it and it is exciting.\"\nChiklis' other credits include the 2005 Marvel film Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer , as well as the short-lived sci-fi comedy series No Ordinary Family .\n  Paul Reubens to play Penguin's dad on 'Gotham' 'Saturday Night Live' guest host Amy Schumer appears in viral video 'Guns' Disney XD renews 'Guardians of the Galaxy' for Season 2 CBS orders 'American Gothic' series from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:54:12.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
