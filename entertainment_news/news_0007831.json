Fans eager to return to the Yukon got three hours of their favorite gold miners. There was an hour of the pre-show called, \"The Dirt,\" followed by a two-hour season premiere which was chock-full of drama down to the last minute.\nThere was an initial disappointment when \"The Dirt\" returned without the familiar host, Christo Doyle. Doyle, the Executive Producer of \" Gold Rush ,\" was replaced with Matt Rogers. Doyle encouraged viewers on Twitter to give Rogers a chance. He is knowledgeable about the series and the miners, but he certainly does not have the rapport with them that Christo had.\nWhen the main attraction started, Christo’s absence in the pre-show was soon forgotten. The episode was the most intense, action-packed show of all the previous five seasons of \"Gold Rush.\" Viewers were kept on the edge of their seats with suspense on and off the various claims.\nParker Schnabel found himself without his foreman, Gene Cheeseman, and all but one of his crew. Starting from scratch, he was unable to purchase his own ground to mine as planned at the end of last season. This turn of events forced Parker to have to humble himself and go back to his landlord, Tony Beets .\nThe heated dialogue between these two very independent men was fascinating. Negotiations over Parker’s contract with the Beets, both Tony and Minnie, for the McKinnon Creek claim suddenly fell in his favor. When the couple tried to employ Gene Cheeseman to head up the operations on the dredge, it turned out that Gene had signed a non-competition clause in his contract with Parker. This prevented the Beets from getting the most knowledgeable miner in the Klondike on their team.\nParker, in a move that showed us a young man wiser than his years, used this leverage to his advantage. He not only got his current claim back but an even larger, better claim he had been eyeing for some time. Parker has done a lot of personal reflection and just growing up over the off-season. Although his mining career is at a low point, he seems to be at a very good place in terms of personal growth and overall maturity.\nThe Hoffman group has taken on another Hoffman. Todd’s teenage son Hunter has joined the crew. There have been several remarks about his looks both on “The Dirt” and Twitter. He has been compared to Justin Bieber. I was thinking that he resembled Zack Morris from “Saved by the Bell,” but perhaps it’s just the perfectly coiffed hair. He doesn’t look or act likes his father, other than the occasional glimpse of a humorously sarcastic personality.\nThere was a nail-biting emergency on the Hoffman claim in this episode. Logan was stranded on a piece of equipment that went through the ice and almost completely sank with him in it. Thankfully, the resourceful crew was able to help him get it out.\nWhat a celebration on social media about the return of “Gold Rush!” It is no wonder that this show has been the top-rated non-scripted show for so long.( Check out the numbers ) Bravo, Christo Doyle, it was an amazing episode.", "external_links": ["http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/gold-rush/?rfc=1", "http://deadline.com/2014/10/gold-rush-ratings-record-5th-season-debut-discovery-channel-856046/"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:28:20.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
