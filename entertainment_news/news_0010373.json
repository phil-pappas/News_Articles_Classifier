After scoring his first No. 1 set back in July with his third studio album \" DS2 \", the rapper recently ruled the chart again with his and Drake 's joint mixtape, \" What a Time to Be Alive \". The project was released just a day after it was officially announced in late September. It also became the second No. 1 effort for Drake who topped the list in February with his other surprise mixtape, \" If You're Reading This It's Too Late \". With the arrival of \"What a Time to Be Alive\", both Drake and Future simultaneously became the first hip-hop acts to have two No. 1 albums in a calendar year since Jay-Z did so in 2004 with his and R. Kelly 's \" Unfinished Business \", and a collaborative album with Linkin Park called \" Collision Course \". With 375,000 equivalent album units collected in its first week, Future and Drake's tape posted the third-largest sales week of 2015 behind Drizzy's \"IYRTITL\" which remains the biggest-seller with 535,000 and fellow Canadian star The Weeknd 's \" Beauty Behind the Madness \" (412,000). \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:34:34.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
