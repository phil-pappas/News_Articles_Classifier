Aaaarrgg when did that happen? She was just 17 a minute ago. \n“Not a better feeling in the world than dancing until it hurts with these two beauties. Happy birthday Ginge. I love you more than words.” \nShe also added: “My baby girls all grown up but in the most beautiful way possible.” \nThe birthday girl, who turns 30 today (October 5), ensured the spotlight remained on her as she chose a dress with a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit. \nKimberley, who opted for a black-and-white cropped top and skirt, also shared photos of the night, including a shot of Nicola’s mermaid cake. Amazing 30th birthday party for the one and only Miss @NicolaRoberts thanks to @LoveEnt you're the best! #party #big30 #Nicola 's30th 🎈🎈🎈 \n— Kimberley Walsh (@KimberleyJWalsh) October 5, 2015 Share article \nThe trio, who had enjoyed a girls’ night out at the Pride Of Britain Awards a few days earlier, munched on burgers.
