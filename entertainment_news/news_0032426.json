JAY BLAKESBURG/COURTESY OF KRONOS QUARTET The Kronos Quartet -- from left, John Sherba, Sunny Jungin Yang, David Harrington and Hank Dutt -- premiered Jonathan Berger's haunting work \"My La\" at Stanford University Oct. 10. ( Jay Blakesberg ) \nMy Lai remains an indelible stain on the collective American consciousness. Nearly 50 years have passed since American soldiers slaughtered more than 500 Vietnamese citizens in a South Vietnamese village on March 16, 1968. But the images the incident engendered still register with visceral force. \nWithout Thompson's courageous act of resistance, My Lai might never have come to light. The pilot witnessed the killings and interceded. He was vilified for his efforts, and \"My Lai\" suggests that he never recovered. \nSaturday's premiere, performed without intermission, created an 85-minute sensory immersion -- and a sense of history repeating. Kronos first violinist David Harrington formed the quartet more than 40 years ago to perform \"Black Angels,\" George Crumb's musical response to Vietnam. Advertisement \nBerger and librettist Harriet Scott Chessman tell the My Lai story from Thompson's point of view as a cancer patient in a Louisiana Veterans' hospital (he died in 2006.) He begins by recounting his first landing in Vietnam, rhapsodizing about the country's natural beauties. \nThe massacre that follows is described in stark imagery -- a ditch filled with bodies; a small child who reminds Thompson of his own son back home -- which leave him shattered and reliving the day in an endless loop of flashbacks. A later scene makes him an unwilling contestant in a nightmare fantasia on game shows and congressional hearings. \nBerger isn't the first composer to write for traditional string quartet and Asian instruments, but his score brings them together effectively with the electronically processed sounds of helicopters, human voices and snippets of American blues. The writing isn't operatic -- it never quite soars -- but it moves with its own kind of insistent force. \nThe performance took place around a square platform. The Kronos players -- Harrington and violinist John Sherba, violist Hank Dutt, and cellist Sunny Yang -- were seated on one side, delivering the composer's jolting lines and keening melodies in fierce, eloquent attacks. Vo, stationed on the other side, produced haunting sounds from an array of Vietnamese gongs, chimes, stringed and mallet instruments. Lighting by Brian H. Scott and sound by Brian Mohr enhanced the proceedings; on the floor in front of the players, a scattering of white flowers on a blood-red cloth added a poignant visual. \nIn the middle was Eckert, who delivered Chessman's texts in blunt, muscular outbursts expressing Thompson's anguish and rage. His singing wasn't pretty. It didn't need to be. \"I am caught in this,\" he sang. \"It will never be over.\" \nTragedies such as My Lai never really are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:09:58.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
