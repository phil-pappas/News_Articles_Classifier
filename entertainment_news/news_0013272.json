I’m back! And I could not be more excited.” \nSwan, 41, was controversially replaced by Matt Tilley when Mix was rebranded as KIIS, but told Herald Sun Confidential she has derived no satisfaction from seeing her old show flounder without her. \nBut she did admit that, given the survey results since her departure, her bosses “probably made a mistake” in letting her go. \nThe mother-of-three said she had also not spoken to her former co-host Jane Hall since it was announced she was also being replaced. The pair worked together for three years. \nHall’s replacement is rumoured to be Meshel Laurie who is leaving Nova breakfast. \nNova chief Louise Higgins said, “We are delighted that Chrissie Swan will be joining Nova 100 next year. Chrissie’s relatable style and quick wit makes her the perfect choice for breakfast and will put us in a strong position for success in 2016.” \nHiggins added, “I would like to sincerely thank Meshel for her contribution to Nova Entertainment. She’s a great broadcaster and we wish Meshel success for the next stage of her career.” \nMeshel Laurie and Tommy Little will continue to entertain Melbourne listeners for the rest of 2015. An announcement about Nova 100’s 2016 line up is expected to be made this week. Nova 100 Breakfast hosts Meshel Laurie and Tommy Little.
