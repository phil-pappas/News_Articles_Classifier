If people all over the world… would do this, it would change the earth.” – William Faulkner\nWhat I see before me across our nation is a light for the future; it is the voice of the youth who refuse to stand by as docile receptors of blatant injustice. What I see before me is the historical legacy of the student voice in the public sphere. I see a united people from all walks of life refusing to accept the pillaging of our future. What I see is the government oppressing the voice they fought to emancipate. What I see is a government afraid of the people that they once protested to free. What I see is the gross violation of democracy, a spit on the graves of men like Steve Biko and Nelson Mandela by their brothers and sisters who sit safely in their glass palace behind a line of armadillo like riot police.\nI hear the songs and speeches, the cries for justice and peaceful protest. I hear outsourced workers singing for a living wage, for a move from a slave like employment. I hear the clapping and dancing as it proceeds to the gates of discrimination, the procession of change. I hear the stun grenades, the screams of students, the march of heavy boots on hot tar and above this I hear haunting sound of protesters singing the South African national anthem in the face of those betraying it. Then I hear running and the chaos, the stampede of fear, the herding of students into tear gas like sheep to the slaughter.\nI smell the burning tires muddled with the sweat of students that refuse to let the heat stop the cause. I smell the sweet spritz of oranges handed out by fellow protesters to those others who have begun to exhaust in the sun. I feel the pounding of hearts, two hearts. The first is that of a united student body, full of passion in the face of adversity and fervor to be heard. The second is disjointed, it staggers and jumps, it is unsure and fearful, it is the armadillos’ hearts that look at one another for approval, it is a guilty heart; the heart of pawns being played by the puppeteers of government. The guilt is in their eyes and it is in their actions.\nOn the streets of Cape Town’s CBD, outside of the Parliament building, on the 21 of October 2015, South Africa saw the reality of our country. On the one hand we have been shown the gross brutality of a police force still conditioned to the violence they deployed during apartheid. We have been shown the hand that was meant to feed, is in fact the hand that bites. We saw the cabinet members sitting in parliament acting oblivious to the cries of the youth just beyond their gates. We saw the blatant disrespect that those in power feel for anyone that stands in the way of them and a juicy bonus. We saw that the very voices that these ‘men’ in government once fought for against an oppressive apartheid regime, the voice they protested for, were arrested for, abused for and even died for, is the very voice they now fear. We saw that there is fear within our leaders because of the monster of justice they have created, their Frankenstein creation of freedom. The violence of the riot police is the embodiment of fear; it is the realization of a change that their rubber bullets cannot kill.\nThe next reality, the one that is the most important for us to see, is the reality of a united nation. It is proof that change is possible, that working together is the only way forward. We saw a spark of fire that will surely burn down the rickety systems that have corrupted our nation. The ivory towers that house these corrupt men and women will fall. It is not an option for them not too. As students sang the national anthem as retaliation to violence, we saw a refusal by the youth to let our country fall victim to any more injustice. 21 years later, we saw that, as those before us did, we have to stand up against those who want to make education, and thus a better life, a commodity. What we saw yesterday was the beating of one heart, the true formation of a rainbow nation that has been stuck in a rut of neo-apartheid like unfairness. Let us not be afraid in the face of bullets and gas, for these are only weapons that they use to protect their criminality. The voice of students across the country will echo into the ears of those in power, they will haunt them as they fall asleep on their bloody Egyptian cotton sheets while those who sing refuse to rest.\nI cannot say for certain what all this will mean, but I know for certain (as history has taught us) that when we stand together, when we build one another up and support our brothers and sisters the powers that be will have no choice but to come forth and face the consequences of their greedy actions. I know that, as we have seen done by those who once fought for democracy, that change is possible together. I also know that those who have betrayed their fellow South Africa’s and stole bread from the mouths they promised to feed cannot be allowed to continue. By stealing the education of the youth, they are stealing from the future of our country, they are stealing from a better future for those who have been historically oppressed. They are stealing from our economy, robbing our industries of bright minds that propel us into the global system as real economic players. They are stealing away from our peace and pushing people into lives of desperate crime, and then locking them up for a lifestyle they did not choose. They are stealing from generations to come, taking away students who wish to teach those to come. It’s been 21 years, what has come of it? We as a people have waited for a promise that will never be fulfilled and now is the time to take our hopes into our own hands and create the future we envision.\nKeep singing students, keep dancing, keep marching, keep pushing, keep screaming, keep sharing, keep fearless and relentless, and keep fighting against those who wish to stifle the future of South Africa. Our nation needs education, it is the portal to change and true freedom, it is not a fight we can allow ourselves to loose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:18:57.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
