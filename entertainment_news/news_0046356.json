Prosecutors Are Reviewing Case Against Bill Cosby 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nBill Cosby may face sexual assault charges in connection with a 2008 alleged incident at the Playboy Mansion, depending on the results of the Los Angeles County prosecutors' review. \nAccording to the Los Angeles Times , the LAPD presented the findings of their investigation to the district attorney's office, and prosecutors are now reviewing whether or not to charge Cosby in connection to the claims. Chloe Goins , 24, alleges that when she was 18, Cosby gave her a drink at the Playboy mansion and she subsequently blacked out. Goins says that when she woke up, she was naked on a bed with Cosby biting her toes and masturbating. \nCosby's lawyers have denied the allegations and say the comedian wasn't at the party that night. \nBill Cosby's accusers will speak out in an A&E special \nProsecutors previously declined to charge Cosby with another alleged sexual assault at the Playboy Mansion because the statute of limitations had run out. The alleged victim in that case, Judy Huth , filed a civil suit against Cosby last month. \nThe statute of limitations is generally six years for sexual assault cases, Loyola law professor Laurie Levenson told the Times . However, there are other reasons the LAPD would investigate Goins. Due to a 1996 change in a California evidence law, accusers can testify as witnesses in others' cases, even if their own never resulted in charges in order to demonstrate a pattern of behavior. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:39.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
