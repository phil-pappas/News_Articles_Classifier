Spiller Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images View all 6 photos When the New Orleans Saints beat the Dallas Cowboys 26-20 in overtime on Sunday night, Oct. 4, 2015, it not only snapped the team's six game home losing skid, but also ended the fourth Sunday of NFL Football . The game-winning play was an 80-yard touchdown pass from Saints quarterback Drew Brees to C.J. Spiller on the second play of the extra session. It was also the 400th career touchdown pass of Brees' NFL career and gave New Orleans their first win of the season. Here is a look at the other games of the day.\nNY Jets (3-1) 27, Dolphins (1-3) 14 : @ Wembley Stadium , UK - In what was a deemed a \"home game\" for the Miami Dolphins , the New York Jets crushed their division rival. In the first quarter of this game played in London, Brandon Marshall had three catches for 89 yards as the Jets built a 10-0 lead. The Jets dominated the rest of the game by way of a swarming defense and devastating ground game in which running back Chris Ivory had 29 carries for 166 yards and one touchdown. In total offensive yardage, the Jets outgained the Dolphins by a margin of 425 to 226. The only element which stopped this game from being a complete rout, was the Jets being penalized 14 times for 163 total yards. having now been outscored 68-28 in the last two games, the Dolphins now enter a bye week. It is anyone's guess as to whether or not the team's current head coach Joe Philbin will still be on the sideline when the team returns to action on Sunday, Oct. 18 when they will face the Tennessee Titans.\nFalcons (4-0) 42, Texans (1-3) 21: @ Atlanta - Atlanta Falcons second-year running back Devonta Freeman continued his dominant play and his team remained undefeated. His second touchdown of the game came early in the second quarter and gave his team a 14-0 lead over the visiting Houston Texans. Texans running back Arian Foster returned from injury and was making his season debut, but it mattered not. Houston committed three turnovers on the day, one of which came in the second quarter when Foster's own lineman stripped the ball from Foster's hands. Atlanta cornerback Desmond Trufant recovered the fumble and raced 24 yards for a touchdown to stretch the lead to 21-0. From there, it was all Falcons all the time, as raced out to a 42-0 after three quarters. Freeman finished with the day with 14 total carries for 68 yards and three touchdowns.\nPanthers (4-0) 37, Buccaneers (1-3) 23: @ Tampa Bay - Playing in front of his hometown fans, the trials and tribulation of Bucs rookie quarterback Jameis Winston continued. The number one overall pick in this year's NFL draft, Winston was productive but threw four interceptions and was sacked twice as his team fell to a record of 1-3 on the season. The Bucs outgained Carolina by a wide margin (411-244 in total offensive yardage), but also committed five total turnovers to just one turnover committed by their opponent. Carolina quarterback Cam Newton had a modest day, throwing for 125 yards and rushing for 51 more. Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin had 20 carries for 106 yards and one touchdown. Carolina cornerback Josh Norman had two interceptions and now leads the NFL with four picks overall.\nRedskins (2-2) 23, Eagles (1-3) 20: @ Washington - The Redskins waged a fierce division battle in front of their home fans. In the end, they prevailed in a game which will be talked about for some time. The home team held a 13-0 halftime lead before the real drama began. In the second half, Philly scored two touchdowns less than four minutes apart, to tie the game 13-13 in the third quarter. After a Washington field goal, the Eagles scored a touchdown just 20 seconds into the fourth quarter to take their first lead of the day. Late in the quarter, the stage was set and Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins flourished in the spotlight. Cousins led his team on a 15-play 90-yard drive which culminated with a four yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon, with just 26 seconds left in regulation time. On the Eagles final possession, the Washington defense sacked Philly QB Sam Bradford, twice.\nGiants 24 (2-2) 24, Bills (2-2) 10: @ Buffalo - In this interconference battle of intrastate teams, the New York Giants prevailed over their upstate counterpart. This game was as conservative as it was evenly played. The 313 total offensive yards gained by Buffalo, were just 10 more yards than the 303 yards gained by the Giants. The two areas which tilted the game in favor of the Giants,were the running game in which they gained 92 yards to the 55 yards gained by Buffalo, and committing just one turnover to the Bills' two. Giants quarterback Eli Manning threw three touchdown passes. Buffalo wide receiver Charles Clay had a big day for his team, with nine catches for 111 yards.\nBengals (4-0) 36, Chiefs (1-3) 21: @ Cincinnati - In front of a raucous crowd at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati, the hometown Bengals downed the faltering Kansas City Chiefs. As a result, the Bengals remained undefeated while Kansas City suffered a third straight loss. The Chiefs were able to move the ball effectively, but faltered in critical moments. Kansas City were only able to convert seven of 16 first down opportunities and had to settle for seven field goals as they failed to find the end zone. Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith threw for 386 yards, but was also sacked five times. Cincy running back Jeremy Hill scored three touchdowns on the day. Kansas city outgained Cincy 461-445 in total offensive yardage, but poor execution in the red zone, proved to be their undoing.\nBears (1-3) 22, Raiders (2-2) 20: @ Chicago - Playing in their home stadium, the Chicago Bears welcomed back starting quarterback Jay Cutler. Cutler had missed the previous two games due to a hamstring injury. Cutler again teetered the line between hero and goat, but this time, avoided becoming the latter. The Bears held a 19-17 lead as time wound down in the fourth quarter, when Cutler threw a red zone interception to Charles Woodson. The Raiders then marched down and kicked a 41-yard field goal to take the lead with 2:05 left in regulation time. Instead of cracking under the pressure, Cutler took command. His team started the drive at their own 20-yard line and 12 plays later, won the game on Robbie Gould's 49-yard field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock. This was head coach John Fox's first regular season win as coach of the Bears.\nColts (2-2) 16, Jaguars (1-3) 13: @ Indianapolis - Colts quarterback Andrew Luck missed a game for the first time in his four-year career. Nursing a sore shoulder, Luck gave way to veteran Matt Hasselbeck in front of the home crowd. It wasn't easy, but the Colts managed to overcome two turnovers and win this conservative back and forth division struggle. Particularly troublesome to Indy, was the strong rushing attack of the Jags. The visiting team outgained them 142-60 in rushing yardage and 431-326 in total yardage. Jacksonville running back T.J. Yeldon ran for 105 yards on 22 carries, but it doesn't mean a thing if the team cannot find the end zone.\nBroncos (4-0) 23, Vikings (2-2) 20: @ Denver - In front of the home crowd, the Broncos blew a 13-0 first half lead and had to overcome two interceptions thrown by their veteran quarterback Peyton Manning. The big difference in this game, was the relentless pressure Denver's defense put on Minnesota quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. The second-year signal caller was harrassed most of the game and though he did not throw an interception, he was sacked seven times and lost a fumble late in the game. Having brought his team almost all the way back, Bridgewater was sacked, and fumbled at his own 47-yard line with just 35 seconds left on the clock. The fumble was recovered by Denver linebacker Von Miller. Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson had 16 carries for 81 yards and a touchdown, but was outshone by Denver running back Ronnie Hillman who had 103 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries. Peterson's longest run of the day was 48 yards, but Hillman's longest was 72 yards.\nChargers (2-2) 30, Browns (1-3) 27: @ San Diego - Playing in their final game without suspended tight end Antonio Gates, the San Diego Chargers won a tense contest in front of their home crowd. This was an evenly played game, as both teams were able to move the ball on the other's defense. The two squads combined for 870 yards of total offense, with San Diego winding up with an edge of just six more yards. Quarterbacks Philip Rivers of San Diego and Josh McCown of Cleveland were both efficient. Neither threw an interception; Rivers threw three touchdown passes and MCcown, two. McCown did lose a fumble, which was the game's only turnover. The game eventually came down to a succesful 34-yard field goal by San Diego's rookie kicker Josh Lambo, as time expired. Between the two teams, a total of seven field goals were made over the course of the game.\nRams (2-2) 24, Cardinals (3-1) 22: @ Arizona - Despite having a roaring home crowd behind them, the Cardinals could not avoid falling from the ranks of the undefeated. The NFC West may or may not be the best division in the NFL, but none is more competitive. In this game, the Rams were finally able to showcase their secret weapon; running back Todd Gurley. The Rams took what was considered a gamble when they drafted him tenth overall in this year's draft. Last week he played in his first NFL game and had nine yards on six carries. Against the Cardinals, Gurley ran for 146 yards on 19 carries. He was considered a gamble because he suffered a torn ACL in November 2014 during his final season with the Georgia Bulldogs. He also showed true breakaway speed in this victory over Arizona and provided he stays healthy, Gurley seems destined to be a star.\nPackers (4-0) 17, 49ers (1-3) 3: @ San Francisco - After throwing five touchdown passes in his last start, Packers superstar quarterback Aaron Rodgers did not have a great day, but the storied Green Bay franchise did remain among the ranks of this season's undefeated teams. While Rodgers struggled to find a good rhythm with his receivers, the Green Bay defense had no such issues. The Packers defense corps spent the day making life miserable for San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick. \"Cap\" was limited to just 160 yards passing, was sacked six times and threw an interception. The 49ers were held to just seven first downs and 196 yards of total offense. The Packers had 18 first downs and 362 yards of total offense. Packers Running back Eddie Lacy had 18 carries for 90 yards.\n.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees", "https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/dallas-cowboys-new-orleans-saints-20151004018/", "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/sfl-dolphins-jets-london-recap-20151004-story.html", "http://www.nfl.com/scores"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:38:55.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
