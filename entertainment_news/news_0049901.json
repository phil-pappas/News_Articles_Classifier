Alejo\nOctober 2, 2015 When people say a simple mobile app can change the landscape of things in the world, there is no more reason to doubt it. If Dubsmash could change the life of one girl and turn her into a noontime show celebrity, and the “Kalyeserye” that has spun around her and a would-be partner into a “phenomenon,” it’s not hard to believe an app like Wattpad could change the way entertainment is enjoyed; specifically, the way people read and write stories.\nALLEN LAU, CEO of Wattpad (Photo by Annie S. Alejo)\nWhen Wattpad CEO and co-founder Allen Lau visited Manila recently to attend the 26th annual Manila International Book Fair (MIBF), he faced a select group of media practitioners and bloggers to share with them some numbers that make up the Wattpad story so far.\nFounded in 2006, the Wattpad free app has brought people together to discover and share stories to what has now built up to about 40 million users around the world. With these users said to been engaged for 13 billion minutes, according to Lau’s presentation, this “new form of entertainment” as he describes it has truly become a dramatic success story and a game changer of epic proportions. It’s not bad for a mobile reading app created on an old Nokia brick handset which only showed four lines of text at the time (Lau would later on create the app for a Motorola Razr that showed 10 lines of text; “an improvement,” he laughed).\nThe stats in the Philippines he presented are just as stunning: Apparently, Filipinos spend 25 million minutes a day reading on Wattpad; Filipinos who write, meanwhile, have shared about 9.5 billion words on the app. Their numbers also show 5 million unique visitors in the Philippines; add to that there are already 19 million story uploads in the country, with local followers spending 25 million minutes a day reading on Wattpad. Over 500 stories from the app have seen print to date.\nLau says Wattpad’s second biggest market in the world is the Philippines, next only to the US. They attribute their success here to three things: social media, mobile use and the app’s concept of episodic content.\nMore than that, though, Lau believes what matters to their users is what’s at the app’s core. “One thing that will never change on Wattpad is storytelling – it has been around for thousands of years. What we will change is to bring new ways for people to share their stories,” he pointed out.\nLau confirmed majority of their users are under 30, and it is not hard to imagine a lot of them are always online thus making Wattpad the ideal go-to app for reading and writing aficionados. “But one thing I find interesting, even for people who are very busy, is you have your phone with you all the time,” Lau said. “You can always find 15 minutes. If you get stuck in traffic – and I’m sure you guys get a lot of this is Manila – it’s good enough to write a chapter.”\nLizquen IN ‘Just The Way You Are’\nThe app has changed the way people read and write stories, but more importantly, it has brought young users back to reading and writing. Local fiction stories, for instance, are written in the vernacular and the stories come alive with popular jargon and slang, making it an easier read for more Filipinos.\nCROSSOVER SUCCESSES\nWattpad has become an incubation ground for a new breed of fiction writers that have reaped success. Under the username SGWannaB, Bianca Bernardino wrote “She’s Dating the Gangster,” which became a blockbuster movie starring Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla. Kimberly Joy Villanueva (Ilurvbooks) wrote “The Bet,” the basis for the hit movie “Just The Way You Are” starring Enrique Gil and Liza Soberano.\nOn the small screen, TV5’s Wattpad Presents has turned stories like “I’m in Love With A Dota Player,” “How To Break Up With A Bad Boy,” and “Mistakenly Meant for You,” among others, each into a series.\nFEEDBACK\nWattpad gives writers a platform to receive feedback. Whereas older readers and writers come with a wealth of knowledge and experience, younger users sometimes “see things from a different perspective,” said Lau. “It’s nice that people from different ages and cultures in different countries can help together and share stories.”\nPARENT-APPROVED APP\nLau said, “It’s not uncommon to see young writers who would start on Wattpad whose writing quality may not be very good in the beginning. But after a year or two, their writing skills are getting much better. In fact, many parents tell us since their kids joined Wattpad and read and write more, their grades are noticeably improving.” He adds, “I’m very optimistic about what we can do in people’s lives and how we can continuously encourage people to read and write more.”\nVALIDATION\nKATHNIEL in ‘She’s Dating The Gangster’\nAlthough Wattpad and its contents have its share of critics, Lau pointed out the fact that stories from the app actually get published traditionally. “The quality must be pretty good to be published,” he said. He also notes writers who started on Wattpad that have gone on to win awards – notably Carmaine Mercader Lasar (username @justmainey), who won the grand prize in the Filipino Division of the Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards (CPMA) for Literature.\nPARTNERSHIPS\nWattpad partners with Smart’s Talk ‘N Text for the expanded Wattys Awards. Two new categories have been added and open only to Filipino users: the Best TNT Panalo Story and Talk ‘N Text Ka-Tropa Favorite, each awarding special prizes to winners. The deadline to enter is on Oct. 30. The ka-Tropa Favorite winner will be selected via SMS voting between Nov. 2-12; all winners will be announced in late November.\nTO USE HIS OWN\nLau maintains his own account on Wattpad and even writes poetry when he has time. He’s started to write what’s called 60-Second Stories that can be read, as it says, in 60 seconds. He says they are “very hard to do. For instance, one story took me almost a whole day to write – 200 words. You have to be very precise and concise to compress all the things you want to say.” Lau kids, 10 and 13, also use the app. “The younger generation, they’re online all the time; use their phones all the time. This is their window to the world. It’s kinda cool to have a daddy who truly understands,” he said, smiling.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:54:29.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
