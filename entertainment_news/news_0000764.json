For half a decade heâ€™s inspired complete strangers to fantasize about rearranging his dumb little face. Few of us have legitimate cause to actually punch the guy though.\nRonda Rousey does .\nAs she recently told Cosmo, Bieber was once a dick to her and her little sister. Shocking, right? The incident in question went down at the Cannes Film Festival where Ronda's little sister Julia spotted Bieber and wanted to get a picture. But she was nervous so Ronda asked him for her sister. Bieber's response? \"I've already taken a billion pictures today. A BILLION.\"\nWhat a dick.\nRonda was pissed. Julia was crushed. And Justin, in all likelihood, immediately forgot about it. Wanna bet he'd do things differently now though? No one wants to be on Rousey's shitlist. Not even Floyd Mayweather's BFF .", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/87-gcN9vjPE", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a47347/ronda-rousey-bieber-feud/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:08:54.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
