They work in conjunction with the chefs downstairs, but we do have our own chefs up here as well.” \nSituated in the oldest commercial building in downtown South Bend — a historical landmark property built in 1868 that first housed the St. Joseph Hotel and later Sonneborn Sporting Shop that served as the area’s premier sporting goods store from 1934 to 1984 — McDonnell opened LaSalle Grill in 1991. \nWhen he bought the building seven years later, McDonnell’s first move was to partner his fine-dining restaurant on the first floor by opening the jazz venue Club LaSalle upstairs on the third floor. \nIn 2013, he changed the club’s name and focus to LaSalle Kitchen & Tavern in a move intended to keep up with the mortality of a professional clientele that could afford the upscale prices of the LaSalle Grill and give the younger crowd a more relaxed eating and drinking atmosphere as well. \nThe best of both fine-dining worlds under one roof turned out to be very prophetic considering the sale of the area’s other exclusive fine-dining restaurant, the Carriage House, earlier this year. \n“I wanted to create something that appealed more to the millennium generation because if you keep this going, it would be like a Carriage House,” McDonnell says. “And I said, I cannot let my customer base die. I wanted to start a new one where the brand is recognized. As they age and marry and get career jobs, maybe they’ll transfer down here (to LaSalle Grill) and go, ‘Well, I like both places, so I’ll go and eat and do my special occasions at LaSalle Grill, and hold my home-meal replacement up at LKT.” \n“We do get a different clientele,” O’Block adds. “I don’t want to say an age demographic, because it’s more of a foodies type … that want the smaller gastro pub type of feel.” \nTwenty-four years and counting, and now LaSalle Grill is the only restaurant in Indiana to receive the Four Diamond Award for 19 consecutive years. McDonnell also points out the Wine Spectator magazine Award of Excellence the restaurant has garnered for the past 10 years. \nBut McDonnell is quick to insist that although the awards are nice, the customer comes first. Look no further than the LaSalle Grill’s hardwood-grilled double-cut pork chop, an impressive chunk of chop served on the bone that could melt in the mouths of at least two sharing diners. \n“We still do that double-cut pork chop,” McDonnell says. “We went to a thinner, what I thought was superior tasting and more bite-sized chop, but the people were going, ‘Where’s that big?’ … I want that big’.’ \n“They want the big,” he says, “so put ‘the big’ back on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:12:14.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
