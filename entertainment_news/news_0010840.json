A federal judge in Massachusetts has refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought against Cosby by three women who say he sexually abused them decades ago. The ruling Friday, Oct. 9, 2015, is a legal blow to Cosby, who has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press PITTSBURGH â€” \nA Pittsburgh-area woman who appeared on television with Bill Cosby as a teenager has sued him, claiming he defamed her after she gave an interview detailing his alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s. \nRenita Hill's lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Pittsburgh. Cosby's publicist and attorneys didn't immediately return messages Thursday. \nThe woman claims she was 16 when she met Cosby during a talent search in 1983 for an educational children's television show, \"Picture Pages.\" \nShe says Cosby hired her and soon after began flying her to cities where he was performing. There, he'd give her alcohol she believes was laced with drugs and molest her in hotel rooms. \nShe also says statements Cosby issued questioning the honesty of his various accusers defamed her. \nThe AP doesn't normally identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly.
