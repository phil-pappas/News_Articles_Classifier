Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich wins Nobel Prize in literature 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich has won this year’s Nobel Prize in literature.\nIn announcing the prize, the chair of the Swedish Academy , Sara Danius , praised Alexievich’s “polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time.”\nThough little known in the West, Alexievich, 67, has won numerous awards for her books, including the 2005 National Book Critics Circle Award for “Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster,” published in 2005.\nHer first book, “War’s Unwomanly Face,” 1988 — the first work in a cycle of books, “Voices of Utopia” — relies on interviews with hundreds of women who participated in World War II. The academy wrote that, “By means of her extraordinary method — a carefully composed collage of human voices — Alexievich deepens our comprehension of an entire era.”\nAlexievich is the 14th woman to win the prize in its 114-year history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:09:04.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
