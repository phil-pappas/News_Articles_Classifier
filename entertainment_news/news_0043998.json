Writer-director Jack Newell, left, and Au Bon Accueil owner Laurent Fiot at the restaurant in Paris. (\"Open Tables\") Nina Metz Contact Reporter Chicago Closeup Here's a great-looking indie that cost $50,000. So it can be done, Project Greenlight. \nDon't let the marketing fool you. The relationship comedy \"Open Tables,\" which screens Saturday and Tuesday as part of the Chicago International Film Festival, is not a foodie movie. \"We've kind of been promoted that way,\" writer-director Jack Newell told me, \"but it's more about the shared experience of eating together\"— and the winding, often alcohol-fueled social dynamic that reveals itself when you sit down and break bread with people. \nMade for $50,000, the film looks better than it has any right to (including a crisp opening montage of clean, sleek interiors of such restaurants as Antique Taco, The Bristol and Fat Rice before they are overrun with diners). With its modest budget and focus on the romantic tensions consuming a group of chatty urbanites, it lands in the same cinematic territory as the films of Edward Burns. Nearly half of \"Open Tables\" was improvised, and the Chicago cast is filled out with some key improvisers (TJ Jagodowski and David Pasquesi), but also theater talent with substantial Steppenwolf credits (Keith Kupferer and Caroline Neff). \n\"One of the things I like about improv,\" Newell said, \"is that you get what I call the 'fear in the eyes' — that you get people who are listening in a way that you don't see in cinema a lot. So you get this extra level of listening, on camera, which better resembles how we are in real life.\" \nNewell also co-stars in the film (\"I'm not really an actor, and I wouldn't consider myself an actor at all, actually; I went through it like I go through life — just playing dumb\"), which is anchored by a long, gorgeously shot dinner party scene that takes place in the twinkly-lit backyard garden at Salvage One, a location Newell described as \"this place on West Hubbard that has a lot of old, random, weird stuff from bygone eras that they sell. But they also have a really cool warehouse and backyard space that they rent out for weddings.\" \nIf you've been watching HBO's docuseries \"Project Greenlight,\" which I wrote about here and which purports to capture the behind-the-scenes sweat equity involved in making a low-budget — $3.3 million — film ( I wrote about the show in this space last week), Newell's $50,000 budget looks absolutely puny by comparison. And yet he was able to film in 40 locations around Chicago, as well as some flashback scenes in Paris. You can make a minuscule budget work, despite how it is portrayed on \"Project Greenlight.\" Urban Belly \"Open Tables\" Jack Newell and Caroline Neff at Urban Belly in a scene from \"Open Tables.\" Jack Newell and Caroline Neff at Urban Belly in a scene from \"Open Tables.\" (\"Open Tables\") \nHere's Newell: \"I do know how fast it can get spent, though. This movie, for example, it's either a $50,000 movie or a $500,000 movie — it's really hard to do anything in between. Here's why: With this size cast, if we were one budget level up, that would increase costs a lot. We were paying the actors $100 a day at the ultra-low budget agreement (with the Screen Actors Guild), but if I had moved up in budget even one rung? We would have to pay them each $600 a day. And in an ensemble cast of 18 people, you can see how quickly that money evaporates.\" And the crew was nonunion, which is also significantly cheaper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:41:44.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
