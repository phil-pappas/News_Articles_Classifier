Christie denies having plastic surgery but has used Botox and laser skin treatments. Christie Brinkley/Instagram, Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Supermodel Christie Brinkley is stunning at 61, and has redefined what successful aging is. Christie, who still has a sensational bikini body after three kids, said her anti-aging beauty and fitness secrets are a vegan diet, yoga workouts, and a positive attitude.\nBrinkley, who has been a vegetarian since she was a teen, now follows a mostly vegan diet, citing her love for animals. \"I truly believe that my No. 1 [anti-aging beauty secret] is that I became a vegetarian when I was 13,\" Christie told Yahoo Oct. 20. \"I made the decision because I loved animals and didn’t want to be a part of the slaughter industry.\"\nBrinkley continued: \"I’ve been reaping the benefits of that karma ever since. I’ve avoided the constant antibiotic injections into animals and the growth hormones. If you ask me, growth hormones are probably very aging, if it’s trying to make cattle age faster. That’s just my own personal opinion.\"\nChristie, a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl, also exercise almost every day, doing yoga, cardio exercise and strength-training, Celebrity Health & Fitness reported. Brinkley said she typically does 100 push-ups every day and also loves to do unstructured workouts when she's outside, such as bicycling, paddle boarding, surfing, skiing, and swimming.\nBrinkley has denied getting plastic surgery, but admits she tried Botox and relies on laser skin treatments to keep her skin youthful-looking. \"If something bothers you, then get rid of it, but I think it’s wrong when you’re trying to change your face to look like someone else,\" said Christie. \"I tried Botox when I thought I was getting a horizontal line that bothered me. And it was horrible.\"\nBrinkley said Botox made her eyebrows droop, so she prefers laser skin treatments to zap age spots and smooth out wrinkles. In addition to diet, exercise and skincare, Christie said the secret to aging well is a positive attitude.\n\"The other thing that I think contributes to a youthful look is a joie de vivre,\" said Brinkley. \"I really believe that being flexible and grateful contributes a lot to your happiness, which contributes to your health, and contributes to your look. When you feel good, you look good. And vice versa.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/christie-brinkley-on-hating-botox-1281411205062710.html", "http://www.celebrityhealthfitness.com/31591/christie-brinkley-61-details-anti-aging-beauty-secrets-vegetarian-diet-and-yoga-workouts/"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:41:01.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
