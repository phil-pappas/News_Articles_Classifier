Charlie's home is a flimsy corrugated hut, with a ceiling so low that he cannot stand up. We see him sitting cross-legged there, his eyes focused on a window before him. But it is not a physical window. It is an old color photo that allows him to look across a great distance — back to a better time of his life. That was during his boyhood, decades before white men seized his property and started chipping away at his sense of identity and self-respect. Now he lives alone, on the outskirts of a village tightly run by a new generation of demanding white men. In his testy interactions with the ruling class, Charlie struggles to mask his anger. Meanwhile, toward others, he displays generosity — even handing out money to the truly destitute. We also find that he uses bitter humor as a defense mechanism. (Cops and other officious government employees are usually the targets of this sarcasm and derision.) His best friend is Black Pete (Peter Djigirr), who drives a rubbish truck. When he is not working, Pete likes to hang out with Charlie or join him out in the bush to hunt or fish. We also learn that each man is an adept tracker. Charlie’s soul is most at peace when he is in the wild — living off the land or sleeping under the stars. In a beautiful scene reminiscent of “Cave of Forgotten Dreams” (2011), ancestral voices well up within his mind as he sleeps beneath ancient animal paintings on a rock face. But ever in the back of Charlie’s brain are the problems of Bobby, another long-time friend of his. His health — like Charlie’s — has deteriorated from years of poor diet. Confined to a wheelchair, Bobby confides to him that his time on Earth is almost over. Charlie fears that they may both live out their final days at a distant hospital. At a certain point, Charlie’s patience runs thin and he lashes out. The course of his life has become a downward spiral. The falling curve of this outdoorsman’s life is suggested by two distinct images framed against the sky. One is the soft parabolic contours of the Sydney Opera House. The other is the sharp arches of wire atop a prison wall. Will Charlie’s life continue to trace a downward arc? Or, like a parabola, will it finally reverse course to move in a more positive direction? The movie has some weaknesses. As a character, Charlie remains a bit flat, because we are told little about his past. Has he ever been married? How did he earn money during his earlier years? Also, a few lines of muddy dialogue need subtitles. David Gulpilil had already built an impressive acting career, through such movies as “Rabbit-Proof Fence” (2002) and “The Tracker” (2004). Last year at Cannes, he collected a “Best Actor” award for his fine work in this film. “Charlie’s Country” will be shown in Room 320, Jefferson Academic Center, Clark University, at 7:30 Thursday and Saturday, and on Sunday at 1 and 3:10 pm. Tickets: $6 adults, $4 seniors 60 and over, $3 Clark students, faculty and staff (with Clark ID).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:58:22.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
