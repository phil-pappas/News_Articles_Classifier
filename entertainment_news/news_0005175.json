It was a remarkable come back from Spain and they were beating everything and anything that stood between them and the cup, fortunately they got their hands on it.\nAfter the opening loss, Springboks were written off in the competition and no one have predicted their come back. It is undeniable that the Springboks came back strong and focus and breaking records as they beat the other remaining teams on their Group B.\nWhen it comes to cup perspective winners, many people still write Springboks off suggesting that the All Blacks will defend the cup easily. Well others have shockingly favoured Ireland.\nWith the injury of our captain De Villiers many thought the team would be weaker, but our new captain Fourie du Preez proved them wrong as he did a remarkable job in leading Springboks to number one in their Group B.\nMany have predicted that SA will face defeat in the semifinals should they face All blacks, but at the same time we should note that Springboks have every skill and quality to beat the All blacks, and if the dice roll otherwise on this prediction, Springboks can shock the world for snatching the cup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:25:44.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
