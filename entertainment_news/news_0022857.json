This year’s theme should have the combination of nature, man and machinery represented in the film equally.\n“Taklub” tells the story of Bebeth, Larry and Erwin, whose lives intertwine after “Yolanda” ravaged the city of Tacloban. They are all trying to rebuild their lives, protecting what remains of their faith and sanity.\nVeteran actress Nora Aunor plays Bebeth, a woman searching for the remains of her three children. Larry (Julio Diaz), who lost his wife to the typhoon, consoles himself by joining a group of devout Catholics carrying a life-size cross around the city. Erwin (Aaron Rivera), on the other hand, tries to hide the truth of their parents’ death from his little sister.\nLast May, “Taklub” also won the Ecumenical Jury Prize-Special Mention at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in France. It will compete next in the Crosscut Section of the 28th Tokyo International Film Festival from Oct. 22 to 31 in Japan.\nMeanwhile, Brillante received the Outstanding Artistic Achievement Award in the 25th International Film Festival Message to Man in Russia recently.\nBrillante serves as this year’s President of Jury at the festival. Message to Man is the only international documentary, short, animated and experimental film festival in Russia that is officially registered at the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF).", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:47:49.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
