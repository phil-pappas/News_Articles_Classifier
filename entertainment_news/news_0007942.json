A baseball fan may have found an out-of-orbit experience while halfheartedly watching the Houston Astros big win.\nThe woman was witnessed by an Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter snorting what he believes was cocaine from Minute Maid Park’s grandstands.\nDerrick Lewis captured the woman allegedly blowing coke on video as fellow fans went wild, disapproving at her alleged life choices.\n“Damn shame,” Lewis wrote in an Instagram post Sunday night. “Lady doing coke at the Astros game.”\nIt’s not clear if the woman realized she was being recorded or if the mysterious substance was actually the illegal drug. She has not been identified.\nThe zoned-out woman only came back to Earth as fans around her cheered at an unspecified play, joining in with her own show of support.\nThe Astros beat the Kansas City Royals 4-2.\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8tw-ZZxQ1g/?taken-by=thebeastufc"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:16:14.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
