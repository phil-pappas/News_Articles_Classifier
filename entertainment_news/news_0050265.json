Mike Portillo, 40, now serves Jurupa Valley, where he grew up. MELANIE C. JOHNSON, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » INLAND PEOPLE Mike Portillo\nAge: 40\nResidence: Riverside\nOccupation: A sergeant with the Riverside County Sheriff's Department\nNotable: Portillo serves the community where he grew up\nIt’s not unusual for Mike Portillo to run into a teacher who knew him in elementary or high school.\nThe Riverside County sheriff’s sergeant, who joined the department 20 years ago, grew up in Pedley, now part of the city of Jurupa Valley. He attended Van Buren Elementary and Jurupa Middle schools. He went to Rubidoux High School before transferring to the then newly built Jurupa High School, graduating as part of the campus’s first class.\nIn 2005, Portillo, 40, returned to the area to patrol, and more than 20 years after graduating, he now supervises 10 school resource officers serving the Jurupa and Corona-Norco Joint unified school districts.\nFor the Riverside resident, making a career in law enforcement happen was a dream come true, with returning to his hometown adding a level of specialness to it.\n“Every kid growing up wants to be a cop or a fireman,” he said. “For me, it just never went away.”\nIn high school, Portillo took a police science class. He talked to his campus school resource officer, who told him about the Sheriff’s Department’s Explorer Program.\nPortillo said most of what he did as an explorer was pretty routine, but he specifically recalled a search for human remains he participated in that was part of a cold case murder investigation. A hiker had spotted some human remains in the area of the 71 freeway and Green River Road, and the explorers helped to expand the search.\n“That was kind of a taste,” he said. “It felt important. It felt like we were working to give the family closure and bring a suspect to justice.”\nAfter graduation, he worked for a title insurance company, until he turned 21 and could apply for the sheriff’s academy. It was a grueling 26 weeks, he said.\n“It was challenging, very stressful,” he said. “It prepares you for what you might come across on the streets.”\nHe has had assignments in the county jail, Banning and Moreno Valley before his current post at the Jurupa Valley station. And despite a relatively quiet existence, the married father of three appeared on an episode of the television show “Cops” 11 years ago.\nIn one scene, Portillo and another deputy arrest a group of parolees and discover that one had a gun with the help of a weapon-sniffing dog from the K-9 unit.\n“When my daughter told her friend I was on cops, she asked, ‘Did he steal a car? Did he rob a bank?’” Portillo said, laughing.\nHe said the biggest change since he started his career is that the public’s perception of law enforcement officers is more negative. Portillo added that technology, specifically the body cameras deputies now wear could help ease that.\nAs a young deputy, the excitement of the job was the big thing, he said. After 20 years, it’s more about helping people and being of service, he added.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvpxy9-b88529616z.120151004161317000gt0cc0ej.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvpxy9-b88529616z.120151004161317000gt0cc0ej.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:11:14.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
