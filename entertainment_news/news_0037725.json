Not since the biography of Harvey Milk has there been such interest in a book about LGBT History. Segal is sparking change in the way books are promoted. You can see book ads on billboards and taxi cabs and Mark is making appearances in casinos as well as traditional venues such as universities, libraries, festivals, and bookstores.\nMark Segal was just eighteen when the Stonewall Riots of June 1969 erupted in New York right in front of his eyes. Determined not to stand idly by, Segal leapt into action that night and was one of the leaders who helped form the Gay Liberation Front from the ashes of Stonewall; and, within a year, he founded Gay Youth, the nation’s first organization to deal with the issues faced by LGBT youth. Mark Segal has been a force to be reckoned with in the fight for gay rights every step of the way since then, from ending LGBT invisibility to marriage equality. In his evocative memoir, AND THEN I DANCED (October 2015, Open Lens, an imprint of Akashic Books), Segal chronicles his involvement in this crucial chapter of American history—and what he sees for its future.\nFor interview requests, contact Tanya Farrell, 646-450-8030, tanya(at)wunderkind-pr(dot)com.\nAND THEN I DANCED | a memoir by Mark Segal | Open Lens, an imprint of Akashic Books | Publication Date: October 6, 2015 | 320 pages | Nonfiction/Memoir/LGBT Studies I Hardcover, $29.95, ISBN: 978-1-61775-410-4 | Trade paperback, $16.95, ISBN: 978-1-61775-399-2 | E-ISBN: 978-1-61775-427-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:36:09.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
