The two came into contact about 1:20 p.m. after the man failed in an attempt to rob C. Stefanou Realtors on Chili Avenue, said Gates Police Chief James VanBrederode.\nHe ran away, carrying a handgun, and crossed Chili Avenue to Sprucewood Lane, where the woman lives. He forced her into her Toyota Corolla and drove it three miles to the Genesee River near Flint Street in Rochester.\nHe then abandoned the car there, with the front passenger wheel dangling over the ledge and the water. He must have driven on the bicycle path, as the road ends well short of the river.\nA nearby person heard screaming from the river and called 911. When police arrived, they found the woman in the 52-degree water. Police did not say how they believe the woman got from the car into the river.\nShe was rescued by the Rochester Fire Department and taken to Strong Memorial Hospital. VanBrederode said she “seemed to be OK,” considering the circumstances.\nAnyone with information is asked to call 911.\nJMURPHY7@Gannett\n.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:06:55.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
