The actor explained how difficult it was to do both at the same time, especially with co-star Kerry Washington. \n\"It's a challenge, but it's really fun,\" he admitted on Monday's Good Morning America . \"You know, I have tons of support. Doing it on Scandal , we're a family so it's just kind of sliding over chairs. Except that Kerry mercilessly teases me when I'm directing.\" \nIt also helped that Goldwyn had actor/director Tom Verica right beside him. \"Tom, who is a fantastic director and one of our producers, will come down if I'm doing a tough scene and just keep an eye on it,\" Goldwyn added. \"If I'm going off the the rails, he'll tell me.\" \nThe actor, who plays President Fitzgerald Grant on the ABC series, said this season is all about his character and his onscreen love interest, Washington's Olivia Pope. \n\"Look, what's so amazing about this season is we're getting to see what it means for Liv and Fitz to be together, and it's rough,\" he teased. \nScandal airs Thursday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern on ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:14:25.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
