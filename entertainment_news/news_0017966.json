The pictures are still on the Daily News website.\nThe letter also admitted that the photos are real images of Bieber -- not doctored fakes.\n\"We recently became informed that your company has obtained and is distributing unauthorized photographs of our Client including images showing him without clothing,\" reads the letter.\nBieber's legal reps say that publishing the photos violate his publicity and privacy rights; they also claim that the pictures infringe on Bieber's trademarks. The team at Myman Greenspan law firm are threatening to sue if the photos are not removed.", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/bieber-fever-gallery-1.75917", "https://twitter.com/JeremyBieber/status/652506486124449792", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/justin-bieber-nude-photos-legal-830810"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:34:01.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
