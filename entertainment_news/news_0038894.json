The trailer for the upcoming movie was released earlier this week and it bears all the hallmarks of an epic Western including gun slinging, shoot outs and a torrid but ultimately ill-fated romance. Natalie Portman at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in May 2015. \nRead More: Despite Oscar, Natalie Portman Was \"Woefully Underprepared\" For Black Swan . \nWhat’s It All About? \nThe film follows Jane Hammond, a woman who has attempted to build a new life for herself along with her husband and her child, on the Western frontier. Earlier in her life, Jane was tormented by the villainous Bishops Boys gang, led by Colin. She discovers they’ve returned to torment her when her husband, Bill ‘Ham’ Hammond, returns home one day pursued by the gang. As her husband is recovering from the gunshot wounds he has suffered at the hands of the Bishops Boys, Jane reaches out to her former fiancé Dan Frost to help defeat the gang. Jane, with Frost’s help, pits herself against the gang, fighting for her survival and that of her child. \nThe Cast? \nPortman stars as Jane and Noel Emmerich plays her husband, Bill. Joel Edgerton co-stars with Portman as Jane’s former fiancé and ally, Dan Frost. Ewan McGregor plays the villain, Colin. Rodrigo Santoro, Boyd Holbrook, Alex Manette, James Burnett and Sam Quinn also have parts. \nThe Script? \nJane Got a Gun is based on the original story developed by Brian Duffield. Duffield, who is best known for co-writing the screenplay for Insurgent, has written the script alongside Anthony Tambakis and the film’s star Joel Edgerton. Tambakis also co-wrote Warrior with Duffield whilst multi-talented Edgerton has previously written (and often directed) nine screenplays, including The Gift. \nRead More: Natalie Portman To Star As Jackie Kennedy In Darren Aronofsky's First Lady Biopic Jackie. \nThe Director? \nJane Got a Gun is directed by Gavin O’Connor, the director best known for his work on Pride and Glory and Warrior. Initially, the project was supposed to be helmed by Lynne Ramsey ( We Need to Talk About Kevin ) but she left the project on the day filming started in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2013. As the Guardian reports, Ramsey was sued by the film’s producers for damages following her walk out but they settled in July 2014. Sources claim she took issue with the lack of scheduling and finance on the set. \nAs For The Producers? \nIt’s not been an easy ride for the film’s producers. The project appeared to have been shelved until this summer when a lawyer came to the rescue. Sounds fairly odd but it’s apparently all about having the right connections. Zach Schilling is producing the film and, according to reports in Deadline , Schilling is the son of lawyer Jonathon Schilling. A large portion of the film has been financed by Jonathon’s law partner, David Boies. \nWhen Can We See Jane Got a Gun ? \nWell, fairly soon in the U.K. The film is set to be released in November. For those in the U.S., the film is expected to be released in February 2016. \nWatch the Trailer for Jane Got a Gun : Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:01:39.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
