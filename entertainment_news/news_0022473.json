Originally, the industry insiders were expecting it to move close to 500,000 copies opening week, but that number was later adjusted, and the final sales land somewhere squarely within the updated projections. The album dropped on iTunes and Apple Music exclusively last weekend, and did damage with 339,538 units opening week. Including streams, the number rises to 378,630. While it's not quite 500k, they'll likely get there soon enough, especially once the album starts streaming Spotify. Still, they land a #1 debut on the Billboard 200. Mac Miller's first week sales for GO:OD AM have also arrived this afternoon. Mac's sales projections were looking like 75,000, however he's actually surpassed that. GO:OD AM reportedly moved 78,024 copies opening, 90,152 including streams. Thus, he'll likely debut at #3 on the Billboard 200.
