The September PMI is the lowest reading since May 2013 when the PMI registered 50.1 percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.\nA PMI ® in excess of 43.1 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the September PMI ® indicates growth for the 76th consecutive month in the overall economy, and indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector for the 33rd consecutive month. Holcomb stated, \"The past relationship between the PMI ® and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI ® for January through September (52.2 percent) corresponds to a 2.9 percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis. In addition, if the PMI ® for September (50.2 percent) is annualized, it corresponds to a 2.2 percent increase in real GDP annually.\"\nTHE LAST 12 MONTHS \nMonth \nPMI ® \n\nMonth \nPMI ® \nSep 2015 \n50.2 \n\nMar 2015 \n51.5 \nAug 2015 \n51.1 \n\nFeb 2015 \n52.9 \nJul 2015 \n52.7 \n\nJan 2015 \n53.5 \nJun 2015 \n53.5 \n\nDec 2014 \n55.1 \nMay 2015 \n52.8 \n\nNov 2014 \n57.6 \nApr 2015 \n51.5 \n\nOct 2014 \n57.9 \nAverage for 12 months – 53.4 \nHigh – 57.9 \nLow – 50.2 \nNew Orders\nISM ® 's New Orders Index registered 50.1 percent in September, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points when compared to the August reading of 51.7 percent, indicating growth in new orders for the 34th consecutive month, but at a slower rate. A New Orders Index above 52.1 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars ).\nThe seven industries reporting growth in new orders in September — listed in order — are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Chemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing.

ISM ® makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.\nData and Method of Presentation\nThe Manufacturing ISM ® Report On Business ® is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Membership of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is diversified by NAICS, based on each industry's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). Manufacturing Business Survey Committee responses are divided into the following NAICS code categories: Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies).\nSurvey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers' Inventories, Employment and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).\nThe resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (PMI ® , New Orders, Production, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The PMI ® is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries (seasonally adjusted), and Inventories.\nDiffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A PMI ® reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A PMI ® in excess of 43.1 percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 43.1 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 43.1 percent is indicative of the strength of the expansion or decline. With some of the indicators within this report, ISM ® has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis.\nThe Manufacturing ISM ® Report On Business ® survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to ONLY report on information for the current month. ISM ® receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses in order to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM ® then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.\nThe industries reporting growth, as indicated in the Manufacturing ISM ® Report On Business ® monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.\nResponses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days. These responses are raw data, never revised, and not seasonally adjusted since there is no significant seasonal pattern.\nAbout Institute for Supply Management ®\nFounded in 1915 as the first supply management institute in the world, Institute for Supply Management ® (ISM ® ) is committed to advancing the practice of supply chain management to drive value and competitive advantage for its members, contributing to a prosperous and sustainable world.
