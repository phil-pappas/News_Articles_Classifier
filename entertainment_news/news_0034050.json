But restorations only began in earnest in 2009 and finished with the ramp's official opening to the public on Tuesday. \nForum Superintendent Francesco Prosperetti said the ramp links two very different areas: The public areas of the Forum, where day-to-day business and public administration was conducted and the more private residential area up on the hill. \n\"Today we can give back to the public an unknown portion of the Imperial Palace,\" said archaeologist Patrizia Fortini. \nThe ramp boasts seven levels connected by six hairpin turns, some underground and some above ground. It empties onto a hilltop terrace offering stunning views of the Forum, Rome beyond. \nThe ramp was opened to the public on the same day the public was invited to help fund other restorations of Italy's cultural heritage. A new crowd-funding initiative, Loveitaly!, was launched to encourage fans around the world to contribute to the upkeep of the country's artistic treasures amid a decline in public spending for conservation projects. \nThe first restorations funded by Loveitaly! include a room in the Domus of the Centaur in Pompeii and a sarcophagus at the National Gallery for Ancient Art. \n___ \nLoveitaly! is at www.loveitaly.org Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
