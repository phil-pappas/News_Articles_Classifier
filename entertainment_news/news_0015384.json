First, remember that Friday night, Rain & Leaves -- a relatively new band on the Webster music scene -- will take the stage at the Harmony House for their CD release party.\nRain & Leaves is comprised of Josh Falling and Cassie Roberts, both Webster residents whom you might already have seen performing around town. Their new release, called Buttons EP, includes six original tunes: “Next,” “Stop,” “Rewind,” “Play,” “Fast Forward,” and “Record,” featuring Cassie on bass and vocals, and Josh on electric guitar, acoustic guitar, ukulele, synth, drums and vocals. Together they create a sound which they describe as “electropop original,” interspersed with an entertaining assortment of popular and alternative covers.\nIn addition to music from Rain & Leaves, the concert will feature appearances by Barry’s Crossing , Seek No Bounds and Gregg Albertson .\nThe party begins at 6:30 pm on Friday October 16 at the Harmony House, 58 East Main Street in Webster. Admission is $6, which includes a copy of Buttons EP, or $3 without the CD. Tickets will be available at the door.\nFor more information about Rain & Leaves, and to purchase a copy of their new Buttons EP , log onto their website at www.rainandleaves.com , or their Facebook page at www. facebook.com/rainandleaves .\n* * *\nIn the past few months, I wrote about two Eagle Scout service projects completed by Greg Grillo of Troop 110 and Paul Padgett of Troop 163. Both young men worked on replacing the bridge and boardwalk on the Whiting Road Nature Preserve Red Trail.\nThe two projects were funded by the family of and dedicated to the memory of Carl (Rick) Gumina, who died suddenly in 2012.\nRick Gumina was a 1975 graduate of Webster Schroeder and a former Boy Scout. He moved to Fort Collins, Colorado after college and became a professor of statistics at Colorado State University. He loved being outdoors, and he appreciated Webster's efforts to preserve open space. Every time he was in town visiting family he would hike the trails at Whiting Road Nature Preserve.\nThe new Red Trail bridge and boardwalk were officially dedicated to Rick on October 10. The ceremony was attended by Rick's wife Judy; his brothers Rory, Greg and Carmen; his children Jamie and Joshua; and grandchildren Zachary and Maya.\nThe new structures are an apt tribute to Rick's memory. For years to come, they will allow others to more fully enjoy hiking on the Whiting Road trails. Many thanks to the Friends of Webster Trails , Greg Grillo and Paul Padgett for all their work.\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.barryscrossing.com/", "http://www.webstertrails.org/", "http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog", "https://www.facebook.com/SeekNoBounds?fref=nf", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7a5e973451db84a29a7b0f353a8e1c7c3732259/r=292x400/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23279-Scouts-with-Carm.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e92ef67907c7ccea3e1f7a1e25967ad1e0b906a5/r=447x400/local/-/media/2015/10/14/Rochester/wp-ROC-WebsterBlog-23279-Dedication-Plaque.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:48.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
