I understand the need for caution but it can't hurt to know the tendencies toward certain disorders. This is especially true regarding symptoms associated with narcissistic personality disorder.\nOf course, before looking too closely at children, parents might need to check their own tendencies toward narcissistic behavior. Some parents model narcissistic attitudes and behaviors without knowing it.\nThe parent, for example, who always insists on being right or on knowing more than others should not be surprised if his children adopt the same behaviors.\nOther parents raise children to be narcissistic by failing to correct behaviors associated with the nine symptoms of narcissism.\nSo I am inviting parents to take inventory on this matter because a narcissistic life is personally destructive and socially disruptive.\nNarcissistic personality disorder is assigned to someone who meets five or more of the following nine symptoms:\n1. A grandiose sense of self-importance (expects to be recognized as superior; is angered when not recognized)\n2. Preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty or ideal love\n3 . Believes that he or she is special and unique (can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people or institutions).\n4. Requires excessive admiration, craves attention.\n5. A very strong sense of entitlement, (strong expectations of favorable and special treatment; demands compliance with his or her expectations)\n6. Exploitative of others, (takes advantage of or uses others to achieve his or her own ends â€” will even exploit people who should be appreciated)\n7. Lacks empathy, (unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others where it conflicts with his or her agenda)\n8. Is often envious of others (resentful toward the achievements of others who outshine him or her; and believes that others are envious of him or her)\n9. Regularly shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes (must be the most important person who knows more and is better than others; desires to be the center of attention)\nAre you parenting in ways that encourage narcissistic symptoms? Are you modeling narcissistic behaviors?\nParents are wise to correct tendencies toward these behaviors and to avoid doing things that encourage narcissistic thinking. Those who overly indulge their children by jumping at every request actually encourage narcissism.\nSome of these parents wrongly think this is how to be a good parent. They fail to appreciate that the world they're sending their children into won't jump for them. This kind of overindulgent parenting will only set children up for self-destructive expectations and broken relationships. Parents who fail to be clear and decisive in correcting selfish behaviors are not protecting their children from narcissism.\nEight clarifications\n1. Honest words of encouragement and compliment are important for our children. Our children also need to know that we are confident in them.\n2. Help your children see themselves as valuable beings made in God's image.\n3. Encourage your children in their gifts and strengths but always in context of humble appreciation toward the Giver of our gifts.\n4. Challenge your children to use their gifts and abilities to help others.\n5. Be careful not to wrongly judge self-confident people as narcissistic. Narcissism is not so much about confidence in public roles, but whether one holds distorted versions of reality regarding herself. Quiet or seemingly shy people can also be narcissistic.\n6. When people are self-absorbed or self-assertive in ways that involve arrogance and condescending attitudes toward others, the warning flag of narcissism is being waved.\n7. Don't be like the parents who overindulge a child's sense of personal beauty or talent in a way that distorts reality. This approach will lead to self-deception, narcissism and social dysfunction. It's also a sure path to marital misery!\n8 . Don't overreact when detecting these symptoms in your children. Our fallen nature as humans comes with a gravitational pull toward narcissism. But be sure to teach your children to detect and deal with narcissistic attitudes and behaviors.\nSteve Cornell is pastor of Millersville Bible Church. www.millersvillebiblechurch.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:03:42.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
