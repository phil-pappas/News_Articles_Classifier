You really don't want to know how they make the sausage.\nA report from Clear Food, a company that genetically tests food products, found that 2% of the hot dog and sausage products they tested contained human DNA and 10% of all vegetarian products appeared to contain meat.\nThe company tested 345 hot dog and sausage products from 75 brands and 10 retailers.\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER\nClear Foodâ€™s report says that of the 345 hot dog and sausage products tested, about 14% had problems ranging from hygienic issues to finding ingredients in the product not listed on the labels.\nAside from human DNA contamination, Clear Food found pork substitution in three percent of the samples they tested, mostly chicken and turkey sausage.\nThe report says that the biggest insight when analyzing the food was that there was no correlation between price and the score the product received.\nNot everything from the report was bad though, all kosher products they tested were pork free.\npliotta@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.clearfood.com/food_reports/2015/the_hotdog_report", "http://www.twitter.com/nydailynews"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:17:47.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
