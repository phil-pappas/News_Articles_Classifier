The disgraced former broadcaster is in court again today for the second day of pre-trial motions as he faces five charges, including four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Michelle Siu \nTORONTO - Disgraced former broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi is headed to trial after he pleaded not guilty to five charges, including four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking. \nGhomeshi is set to return to court Feb. 1, 2016, when the trial is scheduled to begin in front of a judge only. \nThe former host of CBC's radio show \"Q\" once again did not take questions from reporters as he entered — and left — the courthouse in downtown Toronto. \nThe court dealt with a motion in private Thursday and Friday. \nThe 48-year-old was originally charged with seven counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking, but the Crown withdrew two sexual assault charges in May because they said there was no reasonable prospect of conviction. \nThe CBC fired Ghomeshi last October after executives saw what they described as graphic evidence that he had physically injured a woman. \nThe former radio star has admitted to engaging in rough sex, but said it was always consensual. \nGhomeshi is also facing one charge of sexual assault that is being tried separately. That trial is scheduled to begin next June. \nIf convicted, Ghomeshi faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:00:37.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
