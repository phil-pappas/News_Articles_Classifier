Cruz , October 9th, 2015 12:40 AM Previous Next \nBIÑAN, Laguna—“Competition is good for everyone. It keeps people on their toes,” said singer Martin Nievera, one of the hosts of ABS-CBN’s Sunday variety show “ASAP 20,” on reports that a rival program, GMA 7’s “Sunday PinaSaya,” can be considered a serious threat in the ratings game. \n“That’s great! That should make us happy,” the singer told the Inquirer weeks prior to the program’s “Kapamilya, Thank You Biyaheng Biñan” special presentation held at Alonte Sports Center here. \n“I actually think that it’s the best thing that’s ever happened to ‘ASAP.’ Many noontime Sunday shows… came and went, but our show is still around after 20 years,” the singer said. ADVERTISEMENT \nIn August, Martin posted a comment on Twitter that many suspected to be about the sudden change in the program’s format. “What has happened to the noontime shows on Sunday?” he asked. \nAside from its usual concert format, “ASAP 20” featured a skit featuring “Forevermore” lead stars Liza Soberano and Enrique Gil (LizQuen). Also in August, its producers divided the hosts into two competing teams. \n“It wasn’t about our show, per se. It’s just about what’s happening to noontime shows in general,” Martin said of his Twitter post. “I have nothing against it because we’ve never had to do it during our time.” \nHe added: “We have always believed in reinventing ourselves and adapting to the times. I personally think that we can do without it. There are shows in other stations that can do that, but [not] ‘ASAP.’” \nHeavy rains did not stop residents of Biñan and nearby municipalities of Laguna from flocking to the 5,000-seat Alonte Sports Center on Sunday to watch some 40 Kapamilya stars perform. \nThey cheered the loudest for popular onscreen partners LizQuen, and Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla (KathNiel). Jodi Sta. Maria and Ian Veneracion also got their share of shrieks, since their characters’ love story in “Pangako sa ’Yo” is among the most-followed. \nMartin was joined by Jed Madela and Erik Santos in serenading the stars of drama series “Ningning,” “Nasaan Ka Nang Kailangan Kita” and “All of Me.” \nEnrique and Maja Salvador danced to the iHeart Memphis tune “Hit the Quan.” \nOther performers were “ASAP” mainstays Gerald Anderson, Kim Chiu, Enchong Dee and Rayver Cruz, and actors Anjo Damiles, Jerome Ponce, Joshua Garcia, Diego Loyzaga, Albie Casiño and Richard Yap.
