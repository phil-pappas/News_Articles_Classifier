It is unfortunate that this is happening. I would like to believe that he (Farhan) has been misled,” Kapoor told IANS during a telephonic conversation from Poland, where he was shooting his next film “Fitoor”.\n“Rock On 2!!” is the sequel of the 2008 Indian rock music drama “Rock On!!”, in which Kapoor directed Farhan.\nHowever, Kapoor has moved the Bombay High Court to stall the making of the sequel to the film, claiming that he had been working on it since September 2011 and he has accused Farhan's production banner Excel Entertainment of giving writer Pubali Chaudhuri sole credit for the script.\nTalking about the matter, Kapoor said: “At the moment, we are in court. It is the script that I have written and the producers are not giving me credit for it. I just want credit for my script and I don't know where is the problem.\n\"It takes a lot to write a movie and develop a film and when someone doesn’t give credit for that, that’s not good. It's a matter of principles,” he added.\nKapoor's next film \"Fitoor\" features actors Katrina Kaif and Aditya Roy Kapur. The romantic drama film also stars Aditi Rao Hydari, Tabu, Lara Dutta and Rahul Bhatt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:37:03.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
