(AP) — Southern California TV station KABC-TV had to do its afternoon newscast from the building’s front lawn after a bomb threat. \nThe station’s anchors David Ono and Ellen Leyva stood on the grass Wednesday nd used trucks to broadcast as though they were reporters in the field. \nGlendale police said they received a call from an anonymous man who said there were multiple bombs inside the building. \nA bomb squad and search dogs were combing the offices, which are also home of West Coast operations for ABC national news. \nThe KABC newscast included shots of the empty newsroom from an unmanned camera. Still, the mood outside was light-hearted. \nWeatherman Dallas Raines, in 90-degree heat, said it was neat to be in the weather rather than just forecast it.
