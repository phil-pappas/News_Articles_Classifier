Talent is often unwilling to consider an employment offer, and when they do, it's for a premium over what companies with a good reputation can offer\" said Elliot Clark , CEO of Corporate Responsibility Magazine , the host of the annual forum. \"At the COMMIT!Forum, we call on business and sustainability leaders to share their insights on how to improve the role of business in society and how corporate responsibility and sustainability improve asset values.\"\n\"Individuals want to work for organizations with a positive reputation and ethical c-suite leadership,\" said Jill Schwieters , President of Cielo Healthcare. \"The research demonstrates that a bad reputation could cost real money by increasing recruiting costs as organizations perceived as unethical struggle to successfully recruit women and millennials.\"\nWorking for Companies with Bad Corporate Reputations\nAccording to respondents, the bad behaviors most harmful to a company's culture and reputation include public exposure of criminal acts (33 percent); failure to recall defective products (30 percent); public disclosure of workplace discrimination (21 percent); and public disclosure of environmental scandal (15 percent).\nOf the employed Americans surveyed, only 67 percent would take a job with a company that had a bad reputation if they were offered more money. In 2014, 70 percent of respondents were willing to take a job with a company with a bad reputation for more money. Of the 2015 respondents, 46 percent would need a pay increase of 50 percent or more to consider moving to a company with an unfavorable reputation.\nSurprisingly, young people (18-34 year age range) are the least concerned about corporate reputation. Over three-quarters (77%) would take a job with a company with a bad reputation vs. 61% of those 35 years and older.\nWorking for Companies with Good Corporate Reputations\nIn contrast, the vast majority, 92 percent, would consider leaving their current jobs if offered another role with a company that had an excellent corporate reputation. Forty five percent of 35-44 year olds would leave their current job for less than a ten percent pay increase to join an excellent company. In contrast, only twelve percent of the same group would leave their current job for less than a ten percent pay increase to join a company with a bad reputation.\nResults from this year's corporate reputation survey will be presented by CR Magazine and Cielo on October 21 st at this year's COMMIT!Forum.\nFor more information on The COMMIT!Forum, please visit www.commitforum.com .\nFor more information on Cielo, please visit http://cielotalent.com/ .\nMethodology\nThis report presents the findings of a telephone survey conducted among two national probability samples, which, when combined, consists of 1,012 adults, 512 men and 500 women, 18 years of age and older, living in the continental United States.
