John Russell reports.   \nIn a no-holds barred attack on the Hollywood wage gap on Tuesday (October 13, 2015), \"Hunger Games\" star Jennifer Lawrence said that in the past she worried about being labeled a spoiled brat when negotiating movie deals. But men do not have that problem, she said in an essay, , titled \"Why Do These Dudes Make More Than Me?,\" for the Lenny newsletter produced by \"Girls\" writer and director Lena Dunham. Lawrence, 25, who according to Forbes was the world's highest-paid film actress last year with an estimated 52 million dollars (USD) in earnings from movies and endorsements, found out through leaked Sony Pictures emails last year that she had been paid millions less than any of her three male co-stars in the 2013 movie \"American Hustle.\" \"When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid, I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early,\" Lawrence wrote. Lawrence, who won a Academy Award in 2013 for her role in \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" may be the biggest Hollywood earner among women - but she came nowhere near the estimated 80 million pay day for \"Iron Man\" star Robert Downey Jr., according to Forbes.  //reut.rs/1ZBa41i", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:22:35.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
