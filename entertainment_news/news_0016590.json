TBS said Monday that the episode will air on Nov. 10. \nO'Brien said he'll be joined by his longtime assistant Sona Movsesian, who is of Armenian descent. \nSaid O'Brien: \"I think it's every boss' responsibility to take their assistant back to their ancestral land. That's why I'm going to make sure my next assistant was born in a five-star resort in Tuscany.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:55:46.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
