She said… \n“I couldn’t go 30 minutes to an hour without cocaine and I would bring it on airplanes.” – “I would smuggle it basically and just wait until everyone in first class would go to sleep and I would do it right there. I’d sneak to the bathroom and I’d do it.” – “That’s how difficult it got and that was even with [a] sober companion, somebody who was watching me 24/7 and living with me.” – “I was able to hide it from them as well,” \nShe explains how bad it got one time… \n“I was going to the airport and I had a Sprite bottle just filled with vodka and it was just nine in the morning and I was throwing up in the car and this was just to get on a plane to go back to L.A. to the sober living house that I was staying at.” – “I had all the help in the world, but I didn’t want it,” \nWhen did she realize she had a problem??? \n“When I hit that moment I was like, it’s no longer fun when you’re doing it alone. I’ve really never talked about this stuff before… I don’t know if I should be sharing this.” 23 Current Visitors On This Page CRYPTOCURRENCY COMING TO COMMODITIES SOON Commodities are powered by Investing.com RECENT ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:07:15.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
