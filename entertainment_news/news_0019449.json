Such a visit might well have its darker elements but Lewis is also an entertainingly offhand and apparently absent-minded performer whose songs take the kind of direct, simple route that I suspect requires more honing than they suggest.\nShare article In a voice that hovers somewhere between James Taylor and Nashville Skyline-era Bob Dylan he sings of rivers of heartache, bad dreams, the effects of extra-strength mushrooms and the safety and succour that his grandmother’s house offered. His guitar picking looks slightly awkward but it gets an effective job done, matching his songs’ relaxed, bluesy atmospheres with sympathetic patterns and the occasional flourish that we’re not supposed to notice or be impressed by. His time onstage wasn’t long but he made the sort of impression that will see this Glasgow debutant welcomed back.\nKrista Detor’s revelations about her Bloomington, Indiana beat included an aunt who’s been married ten times - and an uncle nine - so it’s little wonder her love songs have a certain cool quality. Her voice, however, is warm and beautifully pitched as she sings accompanied by her own keyboard and accordion plus guitar and bass. If the songs didn’t linger quite so strongly, her melodiousness and mirthful, natural presentation made for a fine opening set.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:17:24.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
