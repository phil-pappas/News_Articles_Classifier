He started making sweet treats as a way to relax. His desserts have gotten rave reviews from friends and co-workers, he said. \n\"People were giving me feedback and sort of enjoyed what I did. It sort of kept snowballing and snowballing,\" he said. \nHe later launched his own baking company, Man Bakes Cakes , and today mostly focuses on teaching and doing demos at cake shows. Some of his concoctions can be seen on his Facebook page . \n\"Halloween Baking Championship\" premiered early this month on Food Network and is hosted by former \"Top Chef\" winner Richard Blais , with an episode airing each Monday until the finale on Oct. 26. \nEach week features a different challenge for the contestants — in the first episode, they had to create a baked good that looked like a classic Halloween costume — with one participant sent home at the end of the episode. \n\"It was fun to sort of think on your feet,\" said Martinez, who's still in the running so far. \nFor more information and to watch clips of the show, visit Food Network's website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:57:53.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
