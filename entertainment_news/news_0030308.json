Al Franken is not done with his career as an author. \nThe second-term Minnesota Democrat, former “Saturday Night Live” writer-performer, and bestselling author is working on a memoir about his years in Washington. He is describing it as a “psychological thriller.” \nThe 64-year-old Franken, whose previous books include “Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot” and “Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,” doesn’t have a title or publisher for the new book yet. \nFranken is being represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett. \nBarnett says Thursday that he will be in touch with publishers over the next couple of weeks. Barnett’s other clients include President Barack Obama and one of Franken’s fellow Democrats in the Senate, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
