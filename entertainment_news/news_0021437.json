Often, le Carre – like a human version of predictive text – would anticipate his biographer’s question and formulate his reply before it had even occurred to Sisman.\n“I sometimes felt like a plonking figure following him about, he is so sharp.”\nLe Carre, who does not actually exist – “the name is a mask for somebody called David Cornwell. To use an espionage expression, it is a cover name” – was 84 on Monday, the day Sisman’s biography was released from heavy embargo. A few days earlier, however, it was announced that le Carre will publish his memoir, The Pigeon Tunnel, next September. His first work of non-fiction, subtitled “stories from my life,” according to publisher Penguin Random House, “is an exhilarating journey into the worlds of his ‘secret sharers’ – the men and women who inspired some of his most enthralling novels.”\nPromoted stories What does Sisman, who was given unprecedented access to le Carre and his private archive, make of the announcement? “I don’t think this is in any sense an autobiography. Nor is it a complete surprise, because a memoir consisting of vignettes about people and places le Carre has known has been mooted for some years. The timing of the announcement is interesting. I can only speculate as to whether my book spurred him on – that certainly seems possible,” he replies via email.\nNonetheless, it’s tempting to suggest that the formidable le Carre is seizing back control of the agenda, although Sisman won’t comment on that observation. What does emerge from his fine, elegantly written biography is a revelatory portrait of man who is – to borrow Churchill’s remark about Russia – “a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.”\nSo who is the famous John le Carre, who, after a desperately unhappy childhood, became exceptionally good at inventing himself, first as a spy, then as a best-selling writer? “‘I’m a liar,’ he explains,” Sisman writes. “‘Born to lying, bred to it, trained to it by an industry that lies for a living, practised in it as a novelist.’”\nThis did not deter London-born Sisman. Speaking from his home in Bristol, he says that he has the attribute every biographer needs, “I am nosy.” He’s always loved le Carre’s 24 novels. He read The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, when still in short trousers, a pupil at St Paul’s School, in London. “I did that terrible thing, I went to see the film, which made an enormous impact, then read this powerful book.”\nHe’d always wanted to write the definitive biography but his friend, Robert Harris, was commissioned almost 20 years ago to write le Carre’s life. “I thought, ‘I’ve always wanted to do that’ – at the time I wasn’t even a writer.” Then, over lunch in 2010, Harris disclosed he no longer intended to write a full biography, and encouraged Sisman to do so.\n“There are huge hindrances,” le Carre warned Sisman, citing his “messy private life” (there have been a number of love affairs, beginning with Susan, wife of his best friend, Scottish novelist James Kennaway). Other drawbacks were “... the demise of so many people I worked with or otherwise knew, and my habitual reluctance to discuss my very limited & unspectacular career in intelligence.”\nStill, Le Carre agreed that Sisman, an Honorary Fellow of St Andrews University and the critically acclaimed biographer of Hugh Trevor-Roper and A J P Taylor, should write his biography “without restraints.” The only basis on which Sisman, who has written an award-winning biography of biography, so to speak, in Boswell’s Presumptuous Task, was willing to proceed.\nSisman spent some 50 hours with le Carre – “far more time, so he tells me, than he has given anyone previously.” He enjoyed le Carre’s company and the privilege of interviewing him in depth, because his previous subjects have all been dead, although he knew Trevor-Roper quite well. “He asked me to write his biography, which I began only after he died. Actually, I got to know him much better after his death.” Interviewing le Carre was not as helpful as you might imagine, he says, because le Carre’s memory so often plays him false.\n“Some of what he told me was not wholly accurate – I would find the real story only in the archives. I do think it is natural for him to invent. We all rewrite our own history, of course, and he has used his own life in fiction. But I did a lot of detective work.” For instance, le Carre refuses to discuss his experiences with MI6, constantly saying that he is bound by the Official Secrets Act, although the cold war is long over.\n“I was frustrated by the fact he wouldn’t talk about MI6 but I do think it’s a mix of honourable feelings and self-serving. It suits him to have an air of mystery. He did once say to me, ‘Why do you always believe other people not me?’ Most of what I have written about that time was gleaned from other sources.” By spying? “Absolutely, although I haven’t done any burglary!”\nSisman acknowledges the warmth of his feelings to le Carre’s second wife, Jane, and other members of his family, but hopes that he’s preserved “the splinter of ice in my heart that every writer needs, according to Graham Greene. I had to keep reminding myself that he is not my friend because he is very seductive, very charming -- everyone falls in love with him, men as well as women, then they are disappointed because that love can never be consummated. He will always be an enigma, he says, ‘I have no centre,’ so preserving this idea of a secret centre.\n“Think of that image of the Russian dolls in the BBC’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy – they have no centre, there’s nothing there. Although his exterior is urbane and sophisticated, there is this churning rage and emotion inside him, anger burning away, particularly against his mother [who abandoned him and his elder brother when le Carre was five-years-old].\"\nWas the ice in danger of melting? “That’s for readers to decide,” Sisman responds. “What do you think?” I tell him I think it’s still frozen since he writes dispassionately, particularly about le Carre’s troubled childhood. His flamboyant father, Ronnie Cornwell, was a conman, fraudster and womaniser. The brothers were sent to private boarding schools – le Carre survived by pretending he was a secret agent.\n“Abandonment and betrayal are constant themes in his work, but I don’t think he would have become a writer had it not been for Ronnie, this monster of a father who so messed him up,” says Sisman. “But what a fantastic life! I know my book is embarrassingly long, it could easily be much longer. The thing is he is still living his life – I intend to produce a revised edition, because this is a work-in-progress. I remember him saying a couple of years ago, ‘Most people my age are mowing the lawn but I have got to keep going.’ He works very hard and is extraordinarily driven. He just keeps pushing and pushing at whatever it is that is eating away at him.”\nAfter editing the letters of Patrick Leigh Fermor, Sisman is chasing his next subject. “I’m sorry I can’t tell you who it is,” he apologises. Alive or dead? “Recently dead,” he admits, although he offers a tantalising clue that he has recently spent a great deal of time in the National Library of Scotland.\nWhat lured him to biography? “I began my career in publishing but always wanted to write and assumed I’d become a novelist but couldn’t think what to write about; I wrote about myself and soon realised that I’m not that interesting so I began thinking about the lives of others.\n“My own theory of biography is that we can only understand another person’s life if we can find something of ourselves in it, even if that is just the starting point. All biography is in a sense autobiographical. I suppose in wanting to write about le Carre I was looking for something inside myself, trying to make sense of my life.”\nFinally, does Sisman agree with the poet Ted Hughes – the subject of another hefty biography, albeit a controversial one – that literary biographers are “vampiric?”\nShare article “I think there’s an element of truth in that – the presumptuousness of the biographer, nosing around in other people’s lives. But I believe biography has to be a humane and sympathetic process – I don’t dish the dirt. Well, not much!”\nJohn le Carre: The Biography, by Adam Sisman (Bloomsbury, £25).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-25T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:52:50.435+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
