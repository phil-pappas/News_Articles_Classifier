Goucher College of Baltimore, Mass., is taking back the honorary degree they conferred upon him in 2001. Lehigh University of Bethlehem, Penn., rescinded an honorary degree given to Cosby in 2005. \nThe Bill Cosby rape allegations: A timeline of bad behavior \nIn September, Fordham and Marquette took back their honorary degrees. In 2014, Spelman College suspended a professorship funded by Cosby. UMass-Amherst cut all ties with Cosby (who is an alum of the school) in November of last year, and he voluntarily stepped down from the board of trustees at Temple University a couple weeks later. \nA statue of the comedian was removed from Disney World's MGM Hollywood Studios park this past July. \nOver the course of the last year, more than 40 women have accused Bill Cosby of a variety of inappropriate behaviors, including sexual assault, covertly administering drugs, and rape. He has not been formally charged with any crimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:31:18.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
