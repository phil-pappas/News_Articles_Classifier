You probably had that figured. \nBut Crosby’s impotence in the Penguins’ first few games doesn’t seem a byproduct of trying too hard/often to get the puck to sharpshooting linemate Phil Kessel. Crosby just played very poorly. That isn’t likely to last. \nIf it does, then the Penguins really are in trouble. \nThe Penguins aren’t facing a crisis. Yet. But if they lose Tuesday's home opener to Montreal and the superstars are once again no-shows, things get tight. \nIt’s too early to question coach Mike Johnston. But some of his decisions aren’t easy to understand. \nHere’s a real head-scratcher: Beau Bennett is far better at right wing than left wing. David Perron is decent at both, but prefers the left. \nWhy, then, is each playing his weaker side on the same line? \nAnyway, Perron is an established top-six forward. He should be centered by Crosby or Malkin, not Nick Bonino. \nThe power play is 0-for-7. Nothing seems gained so far by using Crosby and Evgeni Malkin on separate units, and Malkin is already antsy about the situation. \nBut that’s tough to solve, because both want to play in the same spot, namely the right half-wall. Malkin’s prior alternate spot, the left half-wall, is now occupied by Kessel. Put Crosby down low, and he rotates to the right half-wall like a homing pigeon. When Crosby and Malkin are on the same power play, they often wind up standing too close to each other. The foe’s penalty-kill benefits by the clog. \nThat’s not a coaching problem. That’s on Crosby and Malkin. They just can’t work out being on the same power play. \nJohnston insists on having his defensemen “activate,” to use one of hockey’s latest hot-button watchwords. He wants them to join the rush as often as possible. \nBut what’s the payoff? \nOf the Penguins’ current defensemen, only Kris Letang has tallied 30 or more points in a season. Olli Maatta will eventually crack that barrier, and then some. \nThe others, not so much. When the forwards involve a defenseman not named Letang or Maatta in the transition game, the other team doesn’t mind. Ian Cole, Brian Dumoulin, Ben Lovejoy and Rob Scuderi won’t do much damage. \nBut opposition odd-man breaks might. The Penguins are left vulnerable. \nEvery coach wants a team framework. But you must take individual talents into account and adjust accordingly. \nDerrick Pouliot had a rotten camp. But perhaps the Penguins should have kept him anyway. At least Pouliot has the skill set to execute what Johnston is asking his defensemen to do. \nThe Penguins need to get more traffic in front of the opposition goalie. They had the boo-boo face far too often in their first two games. The Penguins had plenty of difficulties at Dallas and Phoenix, and most were nothing new. \nBut right now, the primary problems are Crosby and Malkin. \nNow, more than ever, the Penguins will go as their big-ticket players go. Marginal talents like Bonino won’t score 25 goals out of nowhere. Chris Kunitz has seen better days. Sergei Plotnikov has been more nyet than da. \nWhen Crosby and Malkin put up zeroes, the Penguins won’t win. For the Penguins, hockey isn’t a team game. Not this season. Not with this roster. It’s Sid and Geno’s big-budget movie. Most of their teammates are just extras. \nIroning out the power play would make up for a multitude of sins. For two such talented players to be so mediocre, inconsistent and inflexible with the man advantage should be embarrassing to both. \nThe Penguins are not a perfectly constructed team by any means. So the players who make the most money have to do more. \nAsk the owner. Been there, done that. \nMark Madden hosts a radio show 3-6 p.m. weekdays on WXDX-FM (105.9).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:19:27.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
