The issue was expected to appear on the full City Council’s Wednesday agenda, but a city spokeswoman says a vote has been scheduled for next week. \nConstruction could start next spring with the museum operating as early as 2019. \nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks has sued the park district, arguing the museum isn’t in residents’ bests interests and will violate the public trust because it’ll be built on reclaimed land that was once Lake Michigan. \nLucas chose to build in Chicago over San Francisco.
