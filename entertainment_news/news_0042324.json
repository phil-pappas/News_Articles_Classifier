This was the finding of a new study released today by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) , an independent watchdog of grantmaking organizations in the U.S. Co-authored by NCRP researchers Niki Jagpal and Ryan Schlegel , \" Families Funding Change: How Social Justice Giving Honors Our Roots and Empowers Communities ,\" finds that, between 2004 and 2012, only 9 percent of grant dollars from family foundations went toward social justice strategies like advocacy and grassroots organizing. In comparison, private foundations, community foundations and other types of grantmaking institutions gave 14 percent. However, previous research from NCRP has shown that these strategies are particularly effective in benefitting communities, garnering a return of $115 for every dollar spent. \n\"It is our hope that 'Families Funding Change' will provide valuable insight for family funders into the challenges they may face when they consider adding a social justice lens to their work,\" said NCRP Executive Director Aaron Dorfman . \"We believe that embracing a social justice framework opens new doors for family foundations, and is compatible with the goals of every funder dedicated to improving the lives of the people they serve.\"\nFamily foundations, often driven by passion, legacy and commitment to their communities, are well-positioned to fund strategies that empower their stakeholders. However, these same attributes subject them to unique challenges when they begin exploring an explicit social justice framework. \nUSEFUL TOOLS TO START SUPPORTING SOCIAL JUSTICE \nThis report offers three useful tools for family foundations to begin their journey in being effective social justice philanthropists:\nA discussion guide for grantmakers – Seven key questions to consider when developing strategies, recognizing perceived barriers and solutions to overcome them. Profiles of family foundations – Learn from three different family philanthropies that went through the process of explicitly deciding to engage in social justice work: Hill-Snowdon Foundation, the Needmor Fund and Surdna Foundation. Additional resources – A handy list of reports to help family philanthropies understand the nuts and bolts of how to effectively incorporate a social justice lens into their work. No matter the issue area a foundation focuses on, from arts to the environment, the need for foundation funding of community organizing and advocacy is crucial. \nNCRP urges trustees and staff of family foundations to read \" Families Funding Change: How Social Justice Giving Honors Our Roots and Empowers Communities \" and begin supporting efforts to find lasting solutions to the tough challenges faced by the communities they care about.
