Alan Carr Tweet \n\"You're getting a drive-thru Costa Coffee at the business park! You excited about that Wolverhampton? That one's right up there with 'wheelie bin falls over' and 'seagull steals a chip'.\" \nThen comes the trademark giggle/shriek and the whole Civic Hall - including this rather red-faced E&S journo - falls into fits of laughter. \nIt set the tone for the night, where nothing and no-one was exempt from a bit of Micky-taking - all sprinkled with Alan's high-energy, high-camp, high-pitched stardust. \nThere's his dirty friend and her particularly rank bedroom floor; his boyfriend and his OCD-way of managing the kitchen ('he goes around shutting the cupboard doors like the woman off Wheel Of Fortune') and his mum and her super-strength gasping ability ('I once lost my contact lenses in the suction'). \nBut he saves the best stuff for himself: his 'mincer's leg', the voices in his head telling him to give his dad a Chinese burn while driving on the motorway and the time he went on holiday to Oman and had to 'act butch' for a week in light of their, shall we say, rather more conservative laws. \nIt was OTT-comedy-ridiculousness and the audience loved him for it. \nWe've all seen Carr on TV, charming and schmoozing with the world's biggest celebs on Chatty Man, but what surprises you when you see his stand-up live is the level of physical comedy. \nFree from the confines of his Chatty Man chair, he runs, skips and, yes, even drags himself around the stage. \nHe twists his face into brilliantly brutal impressions, contorts his body into everything from his interpretation of a leg of lamb to a 'feral mute' and is generally something of a whirling dervish. One with fabulous glasses. \nIt took the show to next level: something beyond witty one-liners, bitchy put-downs and tales of that time he rescued a man hanging off Blackpool pier with Lionel Blair. True story. \nThe show, entitled Yap! Yap! Yap!, was the perfect Friday night tonic. The chance to see a comedian - is he a national treasure yet? - at the top of his game prove why he's one of the brightest and best. \nNow, do you reckon we'll be able to get him to open the new Costa Coffee? Skinny lattes on me if he does. Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
