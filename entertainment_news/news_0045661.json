The Score get deep with Natasha Bedingfield at Jonas party \n'All My Love' hitmakers The Score have had a whirlwind rise from being signed to hanging out with Natasha Bedingfield at a party thrown by Nick Jonas. \nThe Score had a ''deep life convo'' with Natasha Bedingfield at a party thrown by Nick Jonas . \nThe indie pop band - consisting of friends Eddie Anthony and Edan Dover - have just been signed to Republic Records off the back of their catchy tune 'All My Love' and revealed that just a few weeks ago they ended up at the 'Chains' hitmaker's house chatting to the British songstress. \nSpeaking exclusively to BANG Showbiz, lead singer Eddie recalled: ''There was only like 20 people there at the party. You know it's funny, and who is a very sweet person? I don't know how this happened but we ended up having like a 20-minute a deep life convo with Natasha Bedingfield. We were just talking and we're all kind of drinking and I'm like, doing my like British accent. She's really sweet. We were talking about some deep stuff, I don't know how we got onto it. She's really cool though.'' \nEdan said: ''She's super cool and down to earth. She had some really massive songs.'' \nBut the pair were even more thrilled to be ''eating tacos and drinking tequilas'' at the pop superstar's party and with the massages they received. \nEdan added: ''Yeah, getting massaged from a pretty cute Russian girl. I did not think that was gonna happen! It was like, 'Now we're in LA, at Nick Jonas' party, getting massages!' '' \nThe boys released their debut EP 'Where Do You Run' last week and are working on their album of the same title due out early 2016. \nBut they're grateful for people like Ariana Grande - who is also signed to Republic Records - for reassuring them that they're in good hands. \nEddie shared: ''We met Ariana Grande. She was like, 'Welcome to the family!' She said, 'You've made the right choice, you're with great people.' '' \nEdan added: ''It's gratifying because you're literally going insane. You think what you're doing is good, people tell you what you're doing is good, but there's always part of you that's insecure, do I know what the hell I'm doing? So getting signed is like, 'OK, here's a professional seal of approval.' You know what you're doing and you're making money from it.'' \nLearn more about The Score online at www.thescoreofficial.com Contactmusic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:07:23.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
