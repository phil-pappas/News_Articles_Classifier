Celebrating its 10th year, there has been such a big demand that in addition to the show at the Javits Center, it has expanded to utilize the nearby Hammerstein Ballroom to highlight TV programing by a number of networks. \nThe show was expected to draw in more than 150,000 fans with having nearly 1,000 exhibitors. There will be panel discussions, signings, merchandise for sale plus meet-and-greets with actors, authors and artists with their fans. \nThis year there were a couple of panels that had a buzz around them. More space was allotted to host panels on \"The Walking Dead,\" a revival of \"The X-Files\" after a 13 year hiatus and a panel for Batman fans on the 30th Anniversary of DC Comics \"The Dark Knight Returns.\" \nAlthough tickets for the four-day event were sold out, fans watched the New York Comic-Con 2015 live stream at the NYCC website . \nAristide Economopoulos can be reached at aeconomopoulos@njadvancemedia.com and you can follow him on Twitter at @AristideNJAM and Instagram Find NJ .com on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:38:36.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
