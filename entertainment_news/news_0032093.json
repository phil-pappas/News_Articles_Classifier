Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Lewis Ericson’s gripping soul-searching tale finds Tirrell Ellis striving for redemption no matter what the cost.\nTirrell didn’t think his life could get any worse, but he is about to be proven wrong. Old acquaintances and enemies threaten to re-enter his life, placing everyone he loves in danger. Lack of money and mobility don’t help the situation. Trapped in a wheelchair, resentful of his older, more successful brother and feeling smothered by his overprotective grandmother cause him to feel like more of a failure.\nGod must surely have a sense of humor because Tirrell is the last person Alex Solomon wanted to ever contact again. They didn’t part on the best of terms, but strange things are afoot and she’s running out of options. She can’t shake the foreboding that her past is about to catch up with her and that means she’ll do whatever it takes to keep her mother and daughter safe – even making a deal with the devil.\nIf the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then Tirrell and Alex can keep each other company.\nReaders who wish to experience this powerful work can purchase “Retribution” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
