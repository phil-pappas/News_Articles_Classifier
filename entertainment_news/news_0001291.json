Mr Lambert died on October 8, 2015, aged 89. Photo: Canberra Time archives\nCanberra's taxi industry is about to experience huge challenges and change through the launch of a rival transport service Uber.But the man who led arguably one of the industry's biggest shake-ups in the 1950s won't be around to witness the impact of the ride-sharing service.\nKenneth Keese Lambert died at Calvary Hospital on Thursday after a short battle with cancer. He was 89.\nMr Lambert was integral in the establishment of the Aerial taxi group and a central figure in the cab industry in the capital for decades.He grew up in Cessnock NSW,, marrying his bride, Marion, in 1949 and then buying the Coolah General Store.\nWhen he was 18 months old he was diagnosed with polio and had to spend years away from his family under the care of Sister Kenny in Sydney. The physical efforts of running the shop took their toll and driving – always his favourite activity – seemed a better option. With a second baby on the way Mr Lambert asked an uncle in Canberra, who already had a hire car license, as they were then called, to keep an eye out for one for sale.\nAdvertisement Mr Lambert eventually secured license H-4. At that time, the city only stretched from Watson in the north to Yarralumla in the south, serviced by 27 taxis and three taxi ranks -–Manuka, Kingston and Civic.\nIn 1956 two-way radios were introduced to the industry and hire cars became known as taxis. In Canberra there were two groups. Deluxe Taxis consisted of the older drivers who had established client bases.\nMr Lambert and his brother Bruce were part of a group called Black and White Taxis, but this group didn't follow specific protocols and it was a very loose agreement among drivers.\nSo, the brothers set up an office in the Ampol Service Station in Narrabundah and began to quietly select their A-team of drivers. The brothers and five others broke away and launched their own company.\nOvernight they repainted all seven cabs with a red V on the bonnet and attached a 1-metre aerial to the middle of the roof. Aerial Taxis was born. Hard work was part of the job. Long hours were expected.\nMr Lambert's day started by meeting the morning train at 5am and he'd drive people home from the picture theatre at 11pm.\nWhen the Snowy Mountain Scheme was underway, drivers would make multiple trips to work sites to return crews to their jobs and pick up others keen for a few days off. By 1969 Mr Lambert had enough of the roads and was appointed secretary/manager of Aerial Taxi Cabs Co-operative Society.\nHe immediately reorganised the finances, bought a computer and increased patronage by innovations like having Australia's first wheel chair -accessible cab – a mini bus with a meter.\nDuring his time in charge Mr Lambert was integral in forming a strong network among the states eventuating in yearly conferences in various states for the National Taxi Cab Association, now known as the Australian Taxi Industry.Getting all states to join together was difficult. South Australia proving the most difficult, but Mr Lambert was the man to make it work and at a conference in Adelaide he was voted to become the association's secretary, a position he held for nine years.\nHe had retired from Aerial Taxis in 1986 aged 60. After outgrowing its headquarters, he commissioned new headquarters in Fyshwick that still stand today. The building, Ken Lambert House, was named in recognition of his influence on the industry.\nHe stayed on with the association before announcing his exit at the Alice Springs conference in 1990. Fittingly the group immediately rewarded his services and innovation with life membership.\nNot long after his retirement was in full swing he proudly received an Order of Australia medal for services to the taxi industry. Mr Lambert didn't know how his later years would be impacted by the polio suffered as an infant and he wanted to ensure he spent time travelling with Marion and their friends, as well as family gatherings and holidays to his beloved Buckenderra.\nHe was a strong and active member of the new Ngunnawal Presbyterian Church. His daughter Susann has just retired from her life as an early childhood teacher, while son Ian is the current Anglican Bishop to the Australian Defence Force.\nHe was a son, a brother, wonderful husband to Marion, a father, a grandfather to six and a great grandfather to five. His family remember him as a marvellous storyteller, singer, a noble citizen and a true gentleman, now with God.\n– Kerry Lambert", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:03:36.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
