You can even make sweet music with the pages of the Daily Echo it seems. \nThe exhaustingly energetic performers brilliantly weave their rhythmic magic onto everyday items and their own bodies. \nThe lack of any spoken word explains Stomp’s global appeal and, judging by last night’s audience of young families, teenagers and pensioners, it also transcends age barriers. \nDespite being a bona fide phenomenon, the show has managed to retain much of its original charm. It was first dreamed up by buskers and became a huge street theatre hit at the Edinburgh Fringe and off Broadway. \nThere are genuine laugh out loud moments, particularly for the youngsters, who couldn’t get enough of the toilet humour and willy jokes. \nAudience participation is positively encouraged. In fact, the crowd were worked into such a frenzy as they played along with Southampton ’s own Stomp performer Phil Batchelor that they refused to leave, stomping their own feet on the floor until the crew reappeared for an encore. Share article \nAfter more bin lids were whacked in perfect harmony, the performers bowed in front of a well-received standing ovation. And, unlike the death-defying circus skills of required in that other global phenomenon, you can try all this again at home. \nStomp runs until Saturday.
