But the stage comedy by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman dictates that 19 actors be found and, not unexpectedly, these more experienced actors had only high praise for student co-stars. \nThey were not just being nice, proper or polite. \nTrue, the first thing one notices at Tech’s Maedgen Theatre is a scenic design by Joshua Whitt that not only fills the stage — it must with a cast this large — but also allows room for Sycamore family members to paint their individual personalities. \nGrandpa’s chair must hold a place of honor, but the furniture is no more important than proper space for the xylophone and snake terrarium and, of course, enough room left for dancing and wrestling. \nIn fact, with Charney and Marks planning to travel this play, one can appreciate designer Melissa L. Merz’s costume choices while wondering how they ever hope to duplicate the setting. \nAh well, that’s all the more reason to make sure to see the play this weekend. \nThe play’s conflict is romantic. Alice Sycamore has fallen in love with Tony Kirby, the son of the man who owns the company where she works. But while Tony is convinced that love can conquer all, Alice is led to believe that Tony’s rich, stodgy family never could accept the unpredictable collection of family and friends who call the Sycamore household home. \nOne may smile as Reese Thompson (Tony) and Hannah Johnson (Alice) express their affections. Yet for much of the three-act play, it appears Alice may be right. \nNevertheless, watching the Sycamore family and friends proves to be medicinal, a cure for whatever might ail you, a guarantee that patrons eventually will leave the theater feeling better than when they walked in. \nGrandpa (Williams) walked away from his job 35 years ago when he realized that he wasn’t having fun and, when saying grace before dinner, he is thankful for their health and leaves everything else in the hands of whomever might be listening. \nWhat’s more, he has convinced others that it is important to do only what generates joy, which includes writing plays, building fireworks, playing Beethoven on the xylophone or taking dance lessons for eight years, none of these feats attaining a semblance of success. \nIs it any wonder than an IRS agent, played by Zachary Haile, doesn’t stand a chance when demanding back payment of income tax?The play has no small number of funny lines. Dean McBride, as Alice’s father, says, “No, I just like to play with it.” As an aside, Williams’ Grandpa will remark, “Do you like my hat? The government gave it to me.” \nBoris Kolenkhov, the visiting Russian, will bellow, “What did I do?” And Kelsey Fisher-Waits, playing a word association game as Tony’s mother, answers, “Wall Street.” \nObviously this is no joke-a-minute Neil Simon comedy. Rather, the laughter throughout “You Can’t Take It with You,” while generous in servings, is character generated. And what a wonderful collection of characters. \nOne admires Marks’ casting process and ability to guide characters to comedic heights — especially in a play where some scenes beg the audience to scan the stage and keep up with everyone’s contributions. \nSpace will not allow all actors to be mentioned. Some must be recognized. \nOn a larger stage, Josylynn Reid’s side-splitting work as Essie might be considered a star-making performance. Talent, after all, is necessary to portray someone lacking it. Quite often, one wonders whether Reid is following planned choreography or her own improvisation. \nShe and other cast members work splendidly together. Thomas Laney, for example, is wonderful as her “musician” husband, Ed. \nIn early stages on opening night, projection threatened to be a problem. Those with softer voices did improve. Yet a large number knew how to make themselves heard on the back row, one being Randall Rapstine as Essie’s Russian ballet teacher, Kolenkhov, who happens to keep up with former Russian royalty now working minimum wage jobs. Rapstine is a delight. \nFew could win more laughs with the brief time, and little dialogue, granted Caroline Jane Davis as a visiting, drunken actress. \nIsiah Columbus proves to be comfortable with physical comedy as Donald, the cook’s boyfriend. One is taken by Thompson’s intensity, and there is no way the characters of Paul and Mr. De Pinna could work without the contrasting forms of innocence and naivete shared by actors McBride and Christopher Kiley, respectively. \nRichard Privitt is solid as Mr. Kirby, Tony’s father, and Ansolabehere is funny when flippant but at her believable best as a mother heartbroken at perhaps losing a daughter. \nWilliams is a walking, breathing theater class. He builds Grandpa upon a frame of individual nuances, effective whether sharing a near-silent laugh or shuffling to reclaim his chair before another intruder swipes it. \nVeteran actress Sylvia Ashby is the perfect choice to portray Olga Katrina, a Russian Grand Duchess before the revolution and now waiting tables at a Childs’ Restaurant. Given her preference to do what makes her happy, she cooks. \nAnd just as Ashby’s Grand Duchess knows not to be stingy with the blintzes, Marks and his wonderful cast of “You Can’t Take It with You” never are stingy with the laughs. \nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:40:59.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
