A day we celebrate coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) or as an ally. \n27 years ago, on the anniversary of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, National Coming Out Day was first observed as a reminder that one of the most basic tools is the power of coming out. One out of every two Americans has someone close to them who is gay or lesbian. For transgender people, that number is only one in 10. \nComing out – whether it is as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or allied – still matters. When people know someone who is LGBTQ, they are far more likely to support equality under the law. Beyond that, these stories can be powerful to each other. “The history of the LGBT movement shows the true power our stories have to change hearts and minds,” said HRC President Chad Griffin. “In the decades since Harvey Milk first urged every LGBT person to come out to our family, friends, neighbors and coworkers, we’ve caused the opposition to equality to fall away. As more and more people continue to speak their truth, we’re inching closer to a day where no LGBT person ever feels compelled to hide who they are out of fear. National Coming Out Day is helping us reach that moment.” HRC is marking NCOD 2015 with a week-long blog series showcasing the many ways people can come out. Additionally, we have released a compilation video celebrating the importance of visibility and will be using our social media platforms to highlight the stories of celebrities and public figures who during the past year, took the brave step to live openly, or to support a family member who has come out.They include Caitlyn Jenner, Jussi Smollett, Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA), and youtubers Austin and Aaron Rhodes. We are also encouraging our more than 1.5 million members and supporters to join our social media campaign with the #ComingOut by sharing images that celebrate their support for LGBT equality; and collecting personal stories for our recently- launched Campaign for YOUth , where people can submit advice to the next generation. The Top Ten will be featured on HRC’s blog and on social media for teens everywhere to see.
