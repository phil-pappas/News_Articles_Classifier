Abrams' nerdy flourishes. But to maintain the balance in the Force, it's hard not to pick at the potential flaws, too.\nHere, then, is one nerd's take on two minutes and 30-second peek of what we'll see when the movie hits theaters on Dec. 18:\nTHE FORCE WAS STRONG WITH...\nLucasfilm/Disney John Boyega is one of the welcome new additions to 'Star Wars' lore, making the galaxy a lot more diverse than in the original trilogy. 1.) \"The Force Awakens\" focuses on three new heroes -- Daisy Ridley's scavenger Rey, John Boyega's reformed Stormtrooper Finn and Oscar Isaac's X-Wing pilot Poe -- none of whom are white males. That diversity may have inspired racists who are trying to mount a head-scratching boycott of the film. But it's about time that the galaxy far, far away finally is a little closer to mirroring the real world.\nLucasfilm/Disney Awww. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) shares a moment with Han Solo (Harrison Ford). 2.) There's even more Han Solo than I had hoped! Considering the love/hate relationship actor Harrison Ford nursed for his signature character, the fact that he's in so many frames is a gift. (Even if he's more of a scruffy-looking nerf-herder than he was 30 years ago.) That he seems to have grown into a Yoda-like font of wisdom for Rey and Finn is all the better.\nAnd what self-respecting “Star Wars” fan didn’t tear up at the sight of Princess Leia embracing Han, still in love after 30 years?\nLucasfilm/Disney From Stormtroopers to X-Wings, there is plenty of recognizable imagery for 'Star Wars' fans. 3.) Abrams clearly is enough of a nerd that he has embraced all of the points that make the \"Star Wars\" franchise so universally beloved. From the music to the signature lightsaber battle between Finn and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, with each frame of the trailer, it's clear this isn't a cynical money grab.\nFEAR LEADS TO THE THE DARK SIDE\nLucasfilm We’re starting to see a little too much of Kylo Ren ...and that takes away some of the mystery. 1.) Kylo Ren already seems a little too close to Hayden Christenson's Anakin for comfort. His slavish devotion to the burned husk of Darth Vader’s helmet makes him more needy and less intimidating. Remember, Vader himself wasn’t exposed to be a flawed anti-hero until deep into “Episode VI.” This is a franchise built on keeping its marquee villains as enigmatic as possible for as long as possible.\nLucasfilm Here’s to hoping that Rey (Daisy Ridley) is not crying over the body of a dead Wookiee. 2.) That fleeting shot in the trailer of a weeping Rey standing over what appears to be a mound of fur has my Spidey-sense tingling. A lot of fan speculation is pointing to Han Solo being bumped off before the closing credits, but that looks like it could be Chewbacca. To paraphrase the words of wisdom from C3PO, let the Wookiee live!\nLucasfilm/Disney Here’s to hoping that Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is not a villain and just a creepy hermit. 3.) Not counting the quick shot of a robed figure with a robotic hand stroking R2-D2, there's been no sign of Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in any of the trailers or on any of the posters.", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:15:32.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
