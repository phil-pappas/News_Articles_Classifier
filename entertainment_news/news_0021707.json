And my fear was no they wouldn't. Then it made me feel ashamed that I was hiding something, it made me feel ashamed that I couldn't be honest and really be who I am and I just didn't want to pretend to be someone else any more so that people would like me.\" \nThankfully things worked out brilliantly for Ellen and she now has a hit day time chat show and is happily married to actress Portia de Rossi. \nBut despite her success the star never lets it go to her head and tries to remember some of the life skills she's picked up over the years. \n\"It's hard to hold on to everything I've learnt that I think is important (but) I think the most important thing is compassion,\" she added. \"I've learnt that obviously from some tough times (because) it gives you compassion, you understand what it feels like to be on the end of hurt.\" Copyright WENN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:12:09.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
