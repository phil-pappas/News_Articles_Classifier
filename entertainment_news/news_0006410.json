In Tryst's place, the bottom of the email reported:\n\"A contemporary nightlife concept will be forthcoming.\"\nI just happened to be calling Afrojack on Wednesday, when I was reading the email, so I asked the DJ (now at Omnia, playing there on Oct. 27 and 30; he previously worked at Wynn clubs) what he thought.\n\"Honestly, Tryst has always been a small version of XS. And these days, XS is like a small version of Omnia,\" Afrojack said.\n\"You can't expect the smaller places to keep going steadily if they don't bring anything special to the table.\"\nI told him I always think of nightclub years equaling dog years. A 10-year-old club is really more like 70.\nBut Afrojack made a good point.\n\"I have to say, there are some clubs that have been doing it a long time. Tao has something special about it. They've been there a long time, and they're still doing fine, but that's because they have their own style,\" he said.\nHis new Vegas club flaunts such style, he said.\n\"Omnia is a club you will never see anywhere else in the world. People, later, will probably come to Vegas just to see this club. It's out of this world. You go to Disneyland to go to Space Mountain. You go to Six Flags to go on the Goliath. You go to Vegas to see Omnia. At least, that's what I tried to make of it when I helped them do the design.\"\nSimon Cowell is new judge...
