By the time Flossy died in 2010, she'd been with Barrymore for nearly half her life.\nAccording to Barrymore, she took Flossy's ashes to India and spread some them at Gandhi's house in New Delhi. Then she sprinkled some ashes at a Buddhist monastery in the Himalayas and in the Ganges River. A small portion of Flossy's ashes came back to Malibu with Barrymore.\n\"She was an old soul,\" Barrymore recalls. She writes about staring into Flossy's eyes and talking to her, then taking photos of the dog's blonde eyelashes and creating art projects with those pictures.\nBarrymore has two dogs today, but admits that now she has kids , her relationship with her pooches is more traditional than it was before she became a wife and mother.\nShe also writes that her relationship with her own mom was anything but normal. To this day Barrymore doesn't know her mother's age. She calls that \"one of many mysteries I had with this woman.\"\nBarrymore was emancipated from her mother at the age of 14 and rarely speaks with her to this day. However, she says that she'd be unable to \"function\" if she didn't know that her mom was \"taken care of.\"\n\"My mother and father were both incapable of being parents, and I don't fault them for it,\" she writes.\nconfidential@nydailynews,com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:11:29.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
