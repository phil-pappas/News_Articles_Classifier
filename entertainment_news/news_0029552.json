The musician, who recently put out an album filled with his covers of the pop diva's \" 1989 \" songs, even compared her to William Shakespeare. Opening up to the publication about the making of the covers album, which is also titled \" 1989 \", Adams said that the transition from working on his own material to recording Swift's songs was like \"being in 'Ghostbusters' or something, and then all of a sudden I have to go do Shakespeare.\" \"Well, look, those songs are popular for a reason,\" he explained the comparison. \"She's a popular artist for a reason.\" In the interview, Adams said that he'd been a longtime Swiftie and his \"1989\" was the result of his love of Swift's music. He then gushed over \"White Horse\" off the former country darling's 2008 album \" Fearless \", saying that he got \"chills\" from \"head to toe\" when he first listened to the song. \"I remember feeling shocked by her voice, shocked at how clean that song was,\" he recalled. \"I like stuff that sort of penetrates through my regular consciousness and hits me where I'm not looking. That's usually stuff that's a little darker.\" \"You know, that song is really about disillusionment on such a grand scale. I just thought about how this is hitting me like a tidal wave, it's so romantic and so beautiful, and yet so sad and so disillusioned - it's all the stuff I love about The Smiths ,\" he continued. \"That song f**ked me up and I couldn't believe it. Her voice does this thing. It just goes through all my bulls**t detectors and right into my heart and soul.\" \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:00:58.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
