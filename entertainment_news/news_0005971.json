After the streaming service announced in a now-deleted tweet on Sunday, October 18 that the rapper would be among the event's performers, his name was nowhere to be seen in the official line-up shared later in the day. Drake's addition and removal from the \"Tidal X\" list of performers came amid heated battle between Tidal and Apple Music. Some speculated that Tidal featured the Toronto native, who has an exclusive deal with Apple, in the tweet as a subtle jab against its competitor. — TBN (@TheBizzNiz) October 18, 2015 As fans may remember, Apple appeared to make a big fuss over Drizzy's surprise appearance during Lil Wayne 's concert streamed on Tidal in late August. His performance ended up getting blocked from the live streaming with Tidal claiming that Apple ordered them not to air his set. The \"Tidal X\" concert is planned to celebrate Tidal's 1 million subscribers. Set to take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on October 20, it will include performances by Jay-Z , Beyonce Knowles , Prince , Nicki Minaj , Lil Wayne , T.I. , Thomas Rhett and Nick Jonas among others. \n© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:30:22.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
