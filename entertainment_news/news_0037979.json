It added \"Picture\" to the title in growing up as a campy but beautiful movie; it's now aged into a brittle parody of itself, as costumed midnight audiences repeat overly scripted echoes of what once was.\nIn the old and careworn Alchemist Theatre in Bay View, a space holding 64 seats is celebrating Halloween by doing the time warp — with a grittier \"Rocky\" that restores cut songs and dialogue, while still delivering some of those terrible thrills promised by the show's opening paean to sci-fi and horror classics.\nIt's sung here by Hayley San Fillippo with sweet simplicity, while clips from fondly recalled movies — from \"King Kong\" and \"The Invisible Man\" to \"Tarantula\" and \"Forbidden Planet\" — flicker behind her.\nThat set-up liberates this production from any need to wink at itself or the audience; the nostalgia in that first song is real, just as the hapless Brad and Janet truly do want to get back to the ostensibly more innocent 1950s they've forever left behind upon entering Frank N. Furter's orgiastic castle.\nWhile I'd have liked a fuller sense of how this production's Janet (Erin Hartman, who also directs) is actually transformed by all she goes through there, Jason Powell's Brad sketches a compelling dramatic arc. Frank reduces this Brad from alpha-male wannabe to a pathetic puddle, who nevertheless poignantly pines for his lost innocence, particularly in an affecting torch song — unaccountably cut from the movie but sung earnestly and well here.\nPowell is among the few decent singers in this vocally subpar cast — a deficiency that doesn't matter nearly as much as you'd think, given the deliberately grainier texture of this production and the all-out sincerity of its performers.\nAnd, most of all, given the effective, thematically resonant contrast that's thereby established whenever Nathan Wesselowski showcases his first-class pipes as Frank — that not-so-sweet transvestite from Transylvania who always wants to be the center of attention.\nNo worries on that score, here, and not just because this mad scientist gets the most air time and some of the best songs. Already tall, Wesselowski's platform shoes ensure he towers above everyone else — true to Frank's unbounded, out-of-control ego.\nThe balding Wesselowski looks nothing like the Tim Curry who channeled Mick Jagger. Why should he? No good Frank can possibly imagine a world where everyone doesn't want to look and be exactly like him. Little wonder that the put-upon Riff Raff (an evocative Bob Hirschi) eventually kills him, returning home and sending the rest of us back to the flatlands of the future.\nIF YOU GO \"Rocky Horror Show Live\" continues through Oct. 31 at Alchemist Theatre, 2569 S. Kinnickinnic Ave. Visit www.thealchemisttheatre.com .\nTAKEAWAYS From Carrie to Columbia: During this same weekend last year, I first saw Anna Pfefferkorn on stage, as the lead in a production of \"Carrie,\" where she initially dressed down and tucked in, as a character trying to deny her sexuality and herself. Dressed here as Marilyn Monroe, Pfefferkorn is embodying Columbia, the cast-off Frank groupie who flaunts her sexuality and gives us a taste of dirty dancing alongside Eddie (Sean Duncan).\nFor all their differences, what Pfefferkorn's versions of these two characters most obviously share — alongside Rapunzel, played by Pfefferkorn in an intervening Skylight Music Theatre production last spring of \"Into the Woods\" — is Pfefferkorn's own lovely voice. But as she presents them, Carrie, Rapunzel and Columbia also share a heightened sense of themselves as outsiders, excluded from the sexually and emotionally fulfilling relationships others around them enjoy. In all three roles, Pfefferkorn has seemed alternately frightened and forlorn — afraid of what she's missing and sad all the same that she's missing it.\nGot to Keep Control: Bob Hirschi's Riff Raff looks far more wan and worn than the younger, cockier version delivered on screen by \"Rocky\" creator Richard O'Brien. Until he gets a helping hand from one of the usherettes (a cheerfully obliging Liz Whitford), this Riff Raff can't even heave open the creaky door to Frank's castle. And Hirschi is considerably older than Amanda Hull's iteration of Magenta, Riff Raff's puckish sister and ally.\nAll of which underscores the differences between the hedonistic Frank and an obedient servant who, in Hirschi's hands, would be right at home in \"The Remains of the Day,\" as he gamely tries to keep things together while the world around him falls apart.\nFun as \"The Time Warp\" is, Hirschi reminds us in singing it — with a voice that at various points during the night will morph into a wailing howl of pain — that madness does indeed take its toll, making it harder than ever to keep control of oneself. This version of Riff Raff has been through the ringer, and it makes us more sympathetic toward him, when he finally turns the table on the insouciant master who has long taken him for granted.\nMasterpiece Theater: Ensconced on a raised platform in a padded wingback chair, Jim Owczarski is a stitch as a narrator whose fraught, portentous and overly ripe prose is a perfect match for the excess unfolding before him. Much like Frank, this narrator is full of himself; also much like Frank, he thinks the world revolves around him (it's no accident that his small platform not only includes a mess of books on horrific topics like vampires, but also includes a globe). Owczarski's earnest delivery of his purple-prose passages — suffused with a sense that he is and should be the center of attention — complements Frank's abiding love affair with his own voice.\nAll Hail, Macbeth: There are similarities between the plot of \"Rocky\" and numerous Shakespeare plays, especially \"The Tempest.\" But true to the gore of many past Alchemist shows — as well as the many horror flicks being commemorated in \"Rocky\" — what's conjured here are the witches from \"Macbeth,\" reborn as the slinky trio of Becky Cofta, Jasmine Ridgell and Hayley San Fillippo. Sensually slithering and sliding around characters like Brad and Janet, they bring to life all those repressed desires that walk abroad in a castle whose inhabitants practice what Frank preaches: we should be and live our unfiltered dreams, no matter how outrageous they may be or what the consequences are.\nThe Seventies Quartet: Alchemist artistic director Aaron Kopec is billing \"Rocky\" as the eighth and final of the Alchemist's wildly popular Halloween shows (many of this year's performances are already sold out). But one might also view it as a coda to this year's \"New York Stories,\" a trilogy of Alchemist plays taking us back to the 1960s and especially the 1970s.\nEfforts in this \"Rocky\" to scrape away some of the thickly slathered camp — which has made it so hard to see what the 1970s \"Rocky\" once was and meant — are akin to efforts in Alchemist's preceding trilogy to relive that same decade.\nGiven all that's happened since, the 1970s seem as innocent and carefree as the 1950s did, to the 1970s theater artists who birthed \"Rocky.\" By tapping the same nostalgic feelings in us for the 1970s that the original \"Rocky\" engendered for the 1950s, this \"Rocky\" underscores — dare I say, even occasionally recaptures — a vital and often missing emotional undercurrent in this show.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/331732271/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A", "http://www.thealchemisttheatre.com/"], "published": "2015-10-10T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:36:24.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
