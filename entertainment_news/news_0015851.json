Especially since engaging audio books help douse backseat bickering.\nThe internet is teeming with helpful lists of best children’s audiobooks.\nMost include classic beloved books like “Harry Potter,” “Anne of Green Gables,” “Wrinkle in Time,” “Peter Pan” (and sequel “Peter Pan in Scarlet”), “Ramona the Pest,” “Because of Winn-Dixie,” “Holes,” “The Golden Compass,” “Charlotte’s Web,” “The House at Pooh Corner” and “Brown Girl Dreaming.” All of which are as engaging as audio books as they are in print.\nA long-distance family trip or just a one hour ride from Savannah to Hilton Head Island can be made immeasurably better with any audiobook from The Penderwicks series or The Roald Dahl Audio CD Collection.\nAnd I confess I continue to listen and laugh at the sweet characters in “The Gooney Bird Greene Collection” of four books by Lois Lowry long after I dropped my kids off at school.\nBut here are some titles that deserve being on a best children’s audiobooks list, too. These are five bewitching audiobooks that my kids could listen to again and again.\n“Wee Free Men”\nBy Terry Prachett\nRead by Stephen Briggs\nThe narrator does brilliant voices in this tale of brogue-talking, sheep-stealing 6-inch tall blue fairy boys who reviewers call as “fierce as they are funny” and young witch-to-be Tiffany Aching.\n“From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler”\nBy E.L. Konigsburg\nRead by Jill Clayburgh\nNarrator Jill Clayburgh brings the young brother and sister duo Claudia and Jamie Kincaid to life in this classic children’s novel. You and your kids will envy the adventures these two children have when they run away from the suburbs to live temporarily in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC.\n“Inkheart”\nBy Cornelia Funke\nRead by Lynn Redgrave\nThis 15.5 hour audio book lasted so long it seemed to infiltrate every family car trip for weeks. My kids were engrossed in every minute thanks to narrator Lynn Redgrave’s ability to magically change her voice to portray the preteen main character Meggie and the spooky villains the first book of Funke’s trilogy.\n“Maniac McGee”\nBy Jerry Spinelli\nRead by S. Epatha Merkerson\nI credit this audiobook with keeping my children calm on a particularly long, stuck-in-Atlanta rush hour traffic trip. Narrator S. Epatha Merkeson of “Law and Order” fame beautifully tells the story of Jeffrey Lionel Magee, a kid in Two Mills, Pa., who can do practically anything well — despite his rough beginning —including solving race and class problems in his town.\n“Skellig”\nBy David Almond\nRead by the author\nThis spooky audiobook has it all — a talk by the author David Almond about who the winged creature Skellig is; a reading of the mysterious novel by Almond himself; as well as a short story about winged dinosaurs by Almond called “Journey to the Archaeopteryx” and two selections from the Skellig opera. All of which gives kids plenty to think about as they gaze out the backseat window looking to spy a winged Skellig of their own.\nContact Anne Hart at anne@southernmamas.com .\nBy Anne Hart", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:14:25.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
