He among others recreated the memorable moments from \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Saving Private Ryan\", \" The Bourne Identity \", \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", and many more films. For the take, which Corden titled \"Role Call,\" the duo used low-budget props and had quick costume changes, quoting famous dialogue from the past two decades of Damon's notable roles. They, in one scene, put on shrimp outfits for \" Happy Feet Two \", for which Damon provided his voice. Damon also came out in a spacesuit for his upcoming movie, \" The Martian \", but rather than doing a line or two from the film, he just promoted the movie, noting it \"opens everywhere.\" That was not the first time Corden did the so-called \"Role Call\" take. The host previously reenacted iconic moments with Tom Hanks and Arnold Schwarzenegger from their films. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com More The Late Late Show with James Corden News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:21:43.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
