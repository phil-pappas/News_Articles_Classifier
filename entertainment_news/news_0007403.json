The lawyer said Saturday, \"Ms. Huth is happy that the deposition of Mr. Cosby and her deposition are proceeding as planned.\" \nHowever, Allred also noted, \"We will also be seeking to take a further deposition of Mr. Cosby at a later date.\" \nThe deposition is sealed by the court for about two months. \nAlso on Friday, a Massachusetts federal judge declined to throw out a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim Cosby sexually assaulted them and that his representatives tarnished their reputations in denying the allegations, The New York Times reports. \nMore than 50 women have made sexual assault accusations against Cosby. His lawyers have denied sex assault accusations against the comedian in the past, and Cosby has never been criminally charged in connection with any of the allegations. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:15:16.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
