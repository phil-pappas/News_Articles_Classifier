Comment   Writer Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 11:54 AM Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 11:54 AM Pratt, Kan. Want to hear the rich sounds of Neil Diamond? The Pratt Community Concert Association begins its fall line-up of concerts for its 77th year featuring Denny Diamond. The concert is set for 7 p.m. Monday, Oct. 26 at the Carpenter Auditorium on the Pratt Community College campus. Since his appearance on Dick Clark’s television show “Your Big Break” in 2000, Denny Diamond has become one of the most sought after Neil Diamond tribute artists in the US. Joined by his sons Lucas and Spenser, they perform music by some of America’s favorite entertainers including Neil Diamond, Johnny Cash, and Buddy Holly, to name a few. Come early at 6:30 pm for the extra perk of a Lisa Rawlings cello performance. You won’t want to miss her performance either. During intermission all are welcome to check out the Riney Art Gallery. Refreshments will be served by Club 62+. If you want to ride the RSVP bus, call Tiffany 24 hours in advance at 672-7811, 50 cents one way, $1 round trip. Individual concert tickets are available at the door for $15. Individual season tickets are $35; family season tickets are $75. Student season tickets are $10. Get ready for a fun family show that includes lots of audience interaction, toe tapping, singing and smiling! Hope to see you there.
