Review | 'Glory of the World' powerful \nThe official opening in New York is slated for Jan. 21 with previews scheduled for Jan. 16, 19 and 20. \nInstead of recounting Merton’s life, the characters in “The Glory of The World” are at a birthday party for Merton where they discover that many have vastly different interpretations of who he was and, as if in a serious contest, compete to impress each other with their knowledge of the man. \nActors Theatre said Waters will reprise his role as a man who appears and is mostly silent onstage at the beginning and the end of the play during preview and opening performances. Singer-songwriter Will Oldham , also known as Bonnie “Prince” Billy, will play the role in the remaining performances. \nThe cast of Charles Mee's \"The Glory of the World\" directed by Les Waters for Actors Theatre of Louisville's 2015 Humana Festival of New American Plays.

Humana Festival play ‘The Christians’ tests rigors of faith \nHe also directed “The Christians” for its premiere at the 2014 Humana Festival. In September, this off-Broadway production, which had opened in August, received an extended run through Oct. 25. That cast includes original cast members Emily Donahoe, Andrew Garman, Larry Powell and Linda Powell. \nLike “The Christians,” the New York production of Mee’s play “The Glory of the World” also includes many members of the original cast. The cast includes Eric Berryman (Roland), Ryan Bourque (Arnold), Andrew Garman (Benny), Aaron Lynn (Robert), Bruce McKenzie (Albert), Barney O’Hanlon (Bobby), Conrad Schott (Conrad), David Ryan Smith (Cameron), and Cameron Benoit, Josh Bonzie, John Ford-Dunker, José Leon, Joe Lino, Max Monnig, Collin Morris, Brian Muldoon, Blake Russell and Lorenzo Villanueva as Ensemble. \n“The Glory of the World” marks a return to working partnership between Mee and Waters at Actors Theatre and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 2000, the theater’s Humana Festival premiered Mee’s “Big Love,” updating of Aeschylus’ “The Supplicant Women,” with Waters directing. The play also was part of the academy’s 2001 New Wave Festival. \nElizabeth Kramer can be reached at (502) 582-4682 and and ekramer@courier-journal.com.
