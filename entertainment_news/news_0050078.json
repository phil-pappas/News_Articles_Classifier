He then asked the group to collaborate. \n\"When I was told that Will Smith wanted to collaborate on a remix with Bomba, I couldn't believe it,\" band founder and multi-instrumentalist Simon Mejia said in a statement. \"This opportunity to work with Will was beyond anything we have dreamed of. ... It's just magic.\" \nSmith raps in both English and Spanish on the song. He recently shot a music video for the remix with Bomba Estereo. \n\"Fiesta\" is nominated for record of the year at next month's Latin Grammy Awards. Bomba Estereo's album, \"Amanecer,\" is up for best alternative music album. \nWhen the nominees were announced last month, Smith posted a selfie with the quartet on his Facebook page and wrote: \"Felicidades to BOMBA ESTEREO on their Latin Grammy Nominations!\" \nBomba Estereo also includes singer Liliana Saumet, drummer Andrés Zea and multi-instrumentalist Julian Salazar. They formed in 2005 and have performed at major music festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury and Lollapalooza. \nSmith's hits include \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It,\" ''Miami,\" ''Wild Wild West\" and 2005's \"Snatch.\" \nThe 16th annual Latin Grammys will air live on Nov. 19 on Univision from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:45:00.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
