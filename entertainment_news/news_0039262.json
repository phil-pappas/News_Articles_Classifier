In a recent interview, Marshall discussed the long-in-gestation follow-up to the 1964 classic and was very careful about he approached the nature of the film.\n\"It is not a new Mary Poppins. P.L. Travers wrote eight books all together. They worked from the first book, and we are working from the other books, not touching the iconic brilliance of Mary Poppins. This is an extension. I’m a huge fan of the original, and I’m a very good friend of Julie Andrews, and I hold it in such awe. There is all this new material - it was the Harry Potter of its time - and they were never turned into anything further than that adventure.\"\nIs that not a sequel, basically? Is it because they're fearing the backlash of a Mary Poppins sequel that they're refusing to call it as such? Who knows.\nWhat is known, however, is that Disney is looking to push Mary Poppins in the near future, having hired both Marshall to direct and Life of Pi screenwriter David Magee to adapt the follow-up. There's no release date scheduled yet and no word, either, on who'll be playing Mary Poppins, however Marshall believes that Dame Julie Andrews could play a role.\n\"She is a very dear friend, and if she could be involved in some way, it would be very special,\" Marshall explained. \"I know she is very happy that we're doing it and, after 50 years, feels that it is time.\"\nWhat do you think? Is a Mary Poppins sequel a good thing or should it be left alone?
