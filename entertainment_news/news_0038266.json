Why not?\" Cooper asked. \"If that's going to clear up some sort of inequality, why wouldn't we do it?\"\n40 Photos Sienna Miller The former model-turned-actress is now featured in a slew of acclaimed films, including \"Foxcatcher\" and Clint Eastwood's \"American Sniper\"\nWhile Miller agreed having the global conversation about the wage gap is a \"huge step forward,\" she said there's more to it. \"It has to come from the value that we place in ourselves as much as anything else,\" Miller said. \"I have consistently walked into situations and felt less than. I'm not really sure why.\"\nIt wasn't until she recently turned down a role in a play she was passionate about - and would have been paid less than half of what her male counterpart would have received for doing the same job every day - to really be aware of the issue, she said.\nCooper and Miller co-starred in \"American Sniper\" in 2014, where Cooper played Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and Miller played his wife, Taya. Now, in their new movie, \"Burnt,\" Cooper portrays Adam Jones, a hotheaded chef looking to resurrect his career and earn his third Michelin star. He seeks the help from a talented sous chef, Helene, played by Miller.\n\"I found [Jones] to be tremendously complex and you got to go through a lot of different emotional levels with him,\" Cooper said.\n\"It's such a human story, it's a real character. And I kind of love how 'un-Hollywood' it is in that sense,\" Miller said. \"This is a reality of a man who's battling his demons and really trying to overcome them and it's an honest look at that, which I think is so refreshing.\"\n\"And to the love story too, it's not sort of formulaic in the relationship between Helene and Adam also,\" Cooper added.\nCooper said there were no doubles for the cooking scenes.\n\"I mean sort of peeked behind the curtain, that level of cooking and what the pressure is and the attention to detail -- and the fact that we all did it,\" Cooper said.\nCooper, who said he's having the best time in his life right now, admitted he has no idea what his career trajectory will be from here.\n\"I've always had big dreams, always, even as a kid, but I've never had plan -- ever,\" he said. \"I've never been a guy who has like the five-year plan. I just want to stay healthy, basically. And I also know that this isn't going to last, so as long as I'm here, I'm going to enjoy it every day. Shame on me if I don't -- that's how I look at it.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.lennyletter.com/", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/12/20/71a7b44b-0203-427a-bcb3-cc0b04d157a1/thumbnail/220x140/1cf2b087192811e50c660c91e01e93df/sienna-miller-promo-457754672.jpg", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/30/e92027e7-67b3-49fb-88d2-a9af083e0965/thumbnail/220x140/e6df7f51bd69af5cadaf4c696d9e6ac2/bradley-cooper-457600708.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:35:45.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
