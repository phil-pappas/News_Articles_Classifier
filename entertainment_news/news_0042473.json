The Cavaliers will play their next game in Columbus on Oct. 29.\n“It’s natural for me. Growing up, I was told to never show emotion when I got mad at myself,” said Ginn, who is 19-12 this season. “When you have a good attitude, you will play your best, and that’s what I try to do when I’m pitching.”\nThe second game went to extra innings tied at 3-3, with the international tie-breaker in effect. Gracie Hartzog started the top of the eighth at second for the Cavaliers and came into score on a bunt single by Ny’Taisha Willis. Katie Miller and Abbey Slingluff also had bunt singles in the frame, setting up Ginn with the bases loaded. She responded with a sacrifice fly to center that gave Calvary a 5-3 lead.\n“I was impressed with our perseverance,” Calvary coach Sherry Griffin said. “We made some errors that cost us, but we fought through to get those 21 outs and advance to the next level. Jessica (Ginn) plays her position well, she won’t let a call affect her next pitch.”\nIn the second game, the Cavaliers took the lead in the second inning. Hartzog drove in a run with a sacrifice bunt, and Slingluff, who was 3 for 4 in the second game, brought home another with a single to left. Ginn’s RBI infield single put the Cavs up 3-0.\nBut the Patriots rallied in the bottom of the third when Annie Corbin led off the inning with a homer to left. A pair of Calvary errors led to another run, but Ginn kept her head up and got out of the inning. The Patriots tied it up at 3-3 in the fifth when Kyndal Brown drove a shot just out of the reach of Calvary second baseman Miller, who laid out with a backhand dive at the ball.\nThe Patriots had the tying run at second in the bottom of the eighth, with the dangerous Corbin at the plate. She hit a sizzling liner to third, where Sydney Wilson made the grab to clinch the series.\n“I try not to panic in those kind of situations,” Wilson said. “It was just a reaction on that last out.”\nIn the first game, Ginn went 2 for 3 with a pair of runs, and went the distance in the pitching circle. When Strong Rock scored a pair of runs to cut the Calvary lead to 3-2 with the tying run at first — Ginn induced Madisyn Brown to ground out to Wilson to end the game. Ginn scored a run on a second-inning error, and Wilson delivered a clutch two-run single up the middle as the Cavs went up 3-0, after a leadoff triple by Morgan Sterrett in the fifth.\n“Jessica (Ginn), Sydney (Wilson), Morgan (Sterrett) and Catie Thomas have been hitting in the clutch for us all season, and they continued to do that when it counted today,” Griffin said.\nThe Cavaliers will make the trip to Columbus next week to meet an opponent to be determined.\n“We want to go out there and play as well as we can,” Wilson said. “We want to finish strong.”\nCALVARY 3,\nSTRONG ROCK 2\nSR 000 000 2 - 2 9 2\nCDS 001 020 x - 3 5 0\nW-Jessica Ginn.
