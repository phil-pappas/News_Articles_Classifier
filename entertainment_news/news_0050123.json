These hazards are not directly related to Hurricane Joaquin, which is expected to pass well offshore.\nRain amounts of 3 to 7 inches are likely through the period with localized amounts possibly exceeding 8 inches, especially along the Savannah River and including the Savannah metro area. The risk for flash flooding will be especially high around the times of high tide.\nThis rain event has the potential to become significant with life-threatening flash flooding, forecasters warn. During the times of heaviest rainfall road closures could become common and motor vehicle travel could become impossible. Where the heaviest rain falls standing water could remain and could impede or prevent travel for extended periods of time. In some areas water could enter structures.\nResidents are urged to avoid driving during the periods of heaviest rain. Drivers should be prepared for flooded roadways and road closures.\nFlash flooding is likely in normally flood-prone areas, including coastal communities around the times of elevated high tides, but even areas not normally prone to flooding could experience flash flooding during this event.\nDuring the periods of heaviest rain - including the times of elevated high tides along the coast - water could enter some homes and other structures. Some areas could even become cut-off by high water, and many rescues could be required.\nThere is a high risk for rip currents for all beaches.\nGiven the expected heavy surf and strong rip currents, Tybee officials are advising that people stay out of the water this weekend especially in the hours before and after high tide.\n“Young children and people with limited swimming skills would be at serious risk should they be allowed or choose to enter the water with such a large, powerful hurricane off shore,” City Manager Diane Schleicher wrote in a press release. “Tybee Island’s Ocean Rescue team became inactive for the season as of October 1st, so lifeguard protection will be unavailable. Therefore, only swimmers with tethered flotation devices will be allowed in the water while the rip current warning remains in effect.”\nThe added risk of flooding near the recent spring tides will also increase the chances that U.S. Highway 80, Tybee Road, may be covered near the hours of high tide. Highest high tide at Ft. Pulaski Station was at noon Friday. It will be somewhat lower on Saturday at 1 p.m., and lowest on Sunday at about 2 p.m. The evening high tides are much lower than the afternoons’ and have a lower risk of flooding the road, although they could contribute to run-off problems during rain. These times will be Saturday at 12:36 a.m., Sunday at 1:35 a.m., and Monday at 2:32 a.m.\nThe Chatham Emergency Management Agency offers tips for flood safety, including:\n• Monitor flooding / weather conditions on radio, television or the Internet.\n• Get to high ground and stay there.\n• Don’t try to cross through flooded intersections/roads in a vehicle. Just one foot of water can float a small vehicle!\n• Avoid areas subject to flooding.\n• If your vehicle stalls, abandon it immediately and seek higher ground.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/FLOODING.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/FLOODING.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:49:03.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
