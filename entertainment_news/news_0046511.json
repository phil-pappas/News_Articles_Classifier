By Luke Reilly \nThe SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) union has today confirmed its strike referendum was a “resounding success” with over 96% of its members voting in favour of a potential strike. \nSAG-AFTRA notes that this result does not mean its members are currently on strike, but it does give the union the authority to declare a strike if they remain unhappy with their ongoing negotiations with the video game industry. \nThe union’s list of demands includes residuals for games that sell over two million units, stunt pay for vocally stressful recording sessions, and a stunt coordinator on set during performance capture. These demands can be viewed in full on their website . \n“With this result in hand, the Negotiating Committee will seek to return to the bargaining table and continue to press for a fair resolution on behalf of performers working in video games,” explained SAG-AFTRA in its statement. \nThe Interactive Media Agreement expired on December 31, 2014 but negotiations in February and June of this year have failed to produce a new agreement. \nMembers of the SAG-AFTRA acting union were called to vote on whether to authorise potential strike action back in September .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:36:08.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
