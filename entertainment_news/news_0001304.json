He is typically the guy behind the guy who creates art and ideas for the biggest ventures in the world. He certainly has a long roster of A-list clients like Puff Daddy and Bill Gates - and global brands like Nike, Pepsi, and Rolex. He's the kind of guy whose name you'd never know. His face is his work, and he likes it that way.\nBut after years of contributing to the success of billion dollar empires, he's stepping out of the darkness with a message in protest of it all. He's taken up the moniker \"Larkin vs Larkin,\" which is indicative of the battle against oneself.\nAfter sitting in the back shadows of the studio, watching Sean Combs put together his upcoming album, Larkin, was compelled to make music he had been dreaming of for years. Say what you will about Puff, in the studio, he is a genius - and it's contagious.\nLarkin vs Larkin is releasing a music project entitled - Hopium (re)Mixtape. A series of remixes juxtaposed to the content he found on Badboy, Larkin's objective is to elevate the spiritual man with his lyrics. He says he wants to, \"break the chains of capitalism, consumerism and egotism.\" It's a mix of inspiring soulful vocals over cushy experimental beats. Larkin calls it, \"God Music.\" Hopium will drop this winter.\nLarkin is giving us a taste of what to expect with the first single dropping on Tuesday, Oct. 27: \"Secrets,\" a remix of Flume and Chet Faker's, \"Left Alone\" produced by Gravez & Ta-ku.\nStay in touch with the music at larkinvslarkin.com and @larkinvslarkin\nContact:\nShabazz Larkin\nshabazz@creativeschoolofthought.com\n804-349-9996\n releases/sean-combs-former-creative-director-dropping-experimental-album-hopium-remixtape-635858.htm\n Shabazz Larkin\nLarkin vs Larkin\nTelephone: 804-349-9996\n Shabazz Larkin\nWeb: http://www.larkinvslarkin.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/contact/635858?utm_source=worldnow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=distribution", "http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/sean-combs-former-creative-director-dropping-experimental-album-hopium-remixtape-635858.htm?utm_source=worldnow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=distribution", "http://www.releasewire.com/?utm_source=worldnow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=distribution", "http://www.releasewire.com/press-releases/sean-combs-former-creative-director-dropping-experimental-album-hopium-remixtape-635858.htm"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:39:36.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
