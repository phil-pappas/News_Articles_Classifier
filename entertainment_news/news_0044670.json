Similar to the one dropped last July , the new interactive visuals for the \" E.Mo.Tion \" cut finds the singer traveling around the world, but this time viewers get to decide what she will do next. Viewers can choose what country they want Jepsen to be in, what activity she will do, where she will go and more by clicking one of the emojis offered as response to a series of text messages that pop up once every a few seconds during the four-minute video, which landed online via her website on Friday, October 23. \"Run Away With Me\" serves as the second single off Jepsen's critically-acclaimed \"E.Mo.Tion\" album, which came out in late August. She will follow up the song with \"Your Type\", but it's currently still unclear when the Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk-produced track will start impacting radio stations. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:05:17.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
