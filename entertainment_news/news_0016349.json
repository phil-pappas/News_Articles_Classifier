I'm returning to the area and would like to visit my former camp, but I have no record on where the camp was located. Any ideas? I heard that there was a fire at the camp after it closed. It this true? Also, when did the Rocky View Hotel in Hawley burn? Thank you. T.C., Harrisburg The entrance to Camp Tanalo was along Cherry Lane Road between Tannersville and Analomink. It is true that there was a fire at the camp. It occurred during the late 1980s and razed the dining hall and kitchen building of the then-abandoned camp. To answer your second question: The two-story Rocky View Hotel about two miles from Hawley was destroyed by fire in September 1964. Nine people were hospitalized from injuries received in the fire. Friends and I are trying to remember what building was on the site before the Brodheadsville Burger King built. I guessed that was an old, abandoned house that burned or was torn down. D.M., Effort You're close to correctly guessing. In 1988, West End and Polk Township firefighters, participating in a training exercise, honed their skills by burning a barn that was on the site of the present-day, fast-food restaurant. The barn, which was slated for demolition, had been part Bush's Produce business. For R.F. of Stroudsburg, who in adding to a \"Write to Know\" list of 1964-65 World Fair items that had been relocated to the Poconos, mentioned that some parts of General Motors Futurama exhibit were moved to the area: Regrettably, I found no data to support the claim. However, there was request for the exhibit to be displayed in the Poconos. In the 1960s, the Pocono Mountains Chamber of Commerce president invited General Motors to relocate the Futurama exhibit permanently to a site near the East Stroudsburg exit on Interstate 80, but the request was declined. In a letter, the exhibit manager wrote to the chamber president stating that the regular General Motors shows in Atlantic City, Detroit, Chicago and Los Angeles would \"absorb all the feature items.\" Do You Need Answers ?
