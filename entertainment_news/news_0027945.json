Wu is taken outside a nightclub by a group of men posing as cops in what appears to be a meticulously planned and perfectly timed operation.\nIt turns out that the men who took Wu were out cruising for anyone who looked wealthy. They ran into Wu 24 hours after they had taken a young man parking a $100,000 sports car.\nThe criminals are led by Zhang Hua (Wang Qianyuan), an immensely intelligent and equally brutal ex-con whose nihilism will make you squirm in your seat.\n\"We value money more than life,\" he says matter-of-factly to a chained-up Wu.\nIn fact, Zhang puts no value on life at all.\nWe learn this -- and find out about the kidnapping -- from his own sneering lips. The story is told by Zhang while in police custody.\nArrested 18 hours after taking Wu, Zhang seems entirely in control. He tells his interrogators that his pals will execute the actor within hours, regardless of any developments.\n\"Saving Mr. Wu\" is terrific fun as a crime thriller, with great photography and tense action sequences. Yet it truly excels in its quieter moments during the parallel set of conversations Zhang has with Wu and later with the police.\nWu, who is remarkably calm and self-possessed, tries to get at the root of Zhang's criminality, while his captor denounces the society that produced him. Their conversations are veritably Dostoevskian in scope and depth.\n\"Police Story 2013\" may have proved Ding to be a master at making loud, fast, explosive -- if schlocky -- action yarns. With \"Saving Mr. Wu,\" he also shows a fine understanding of character and the psychology of violence.\n'SAVING MR. WU'\n3 out of 4 stars\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731810&h=Movie+review%3A+%27Saving+Mr%2E+Wu%27+is+a+smart+thriller", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731810&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/entertainmenttoday/s-1731810"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:35:19.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
