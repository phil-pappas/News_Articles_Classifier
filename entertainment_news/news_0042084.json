I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered.\"\n\"This is not being dealt with in anyway at all,\" he added. \"That's why we are out here. If it was being dealt with, then these murdering cops would be in jail or at least be facing charges.\"\nThe rally first gathered at Washington Square Park and continued two miles down Sixth Avenue.\nThe event was organized by RiseUpOctober, a group that had put on two more protests in New York earlier this month. The latest protest spanned three days.\nQuentin Tarantino marched with us today in #NYC in protest of police brutality & negligence. #RiseUpOctober pic.twitter.com/J0F1TQwUa0 \nÂ— Simon Moya-Smith (@SimonMoyaSmith) October 24, 2015 Airdate and title of ...
