But the state attorney general's office withheld approval of the acquisition, and in August state regulators told the Lawrence County Commissioners that Jameson would be required to seek new suitors. \nAt the time, county Commissioner Dan Vogler said the state was concerned that a Jameson-UPMC merger would control an outsized portion of the Lawrence County healthcare market. In response to the state's demand, Jameson agreed to accept merger requests and UPMC extended a deadline for its offer until the end of this year. \nJameson Hospital officials said the hospital has received merger offers, but said confidentiality agreements prevented them from saying what entities were pursuing an arrangement. \nThe protracted process has already affected hospital services. Jameson closed its obstetrics department in August because of inability to retain doctors for it. That move, along with the 2013 closing of Ellwood City Hospital's obstetrics department, leaves Lawrence County with no remaining hospital child-birthing facilities. \nJameson's board also had voted to close the system's 24-hour inpatient behavioral services clinic because of expenses, but decided in August that the facility would remain open at least through this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:29:31.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
