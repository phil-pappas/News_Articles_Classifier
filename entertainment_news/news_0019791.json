(Casey Curry/Invision/AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nCeeLo Green says he has grown personally and professionally and wants to return to \"The Voice.\" \n\"I've talked very possibly about doing 'The Voice' again,\" Green said in an interview Wednesday. \"So I just kind of put that out there, wishful thinking, kind of willing it. Because I would love to do it again.\" \nAn original coach when the show premiered in 2011, Green left last year after facing charges in a felony drug case. He pleaded no contest to giving a woman ecstasy at a 2012 dinner and recently completed his sentenced community service. He remains on probation. \nAfter entering the plea, Green posted a series of messages on Twitter, including one that read: \"Women who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!\" He later posted an apology, but the statements led to the cancellation of a reality show and several concert appearances. \n\"It was a very redefining moment in my personal and professional life,\" Green said. \"I get in front of my creator, humbled, and I ask, 'What does this mean? What is this supposed to mean for me? What am I supposed to learn from it?' And (to) have that revealed and have it bestowed upon me is a blessing, of sorts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:39:48.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
