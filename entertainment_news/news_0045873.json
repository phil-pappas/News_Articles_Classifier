Are we now trying to work towards an old tradition that is dated for our society? \nNow, don't get me wrong I am very much an old fashioned romantic and the idea of settling down is wonderful, however I am also aware of the modern day world that we live in. \nWith the quite frankly mass of modern social media and dating apps, meeting the one is quite frankly impossible, but finding 40million bizarre ones, a one night stand or some naughty sexting is just a swipe away. \nI'm not worried about being single and am not ready to get married - I want to spend the next 10 years working, writing, travelling and meeting fabulous people. \nI would just like to get to the point where I can go onto Facebook without feeling slightly guilty for not wanting to settle down, and that it's ok to break the judgment mold of approaching 30. \nMy friends and I had this rather drunken debate recently and we decided we are all going to do it our way - meet someone when the universe wishes, with someone that you want to wake up every Christmas morning with and honestly couldn't imagine yourself without - not when society dictates. That will be truly fabulous. \nFollow Ollie Locke on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ollielocke More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:51:18.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
