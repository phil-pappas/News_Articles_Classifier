The executive producer is set to reprise his guest role as Senator Edward Morra in the episode \"Side Effects May Include...\" which will broadcast Tuesday, October 27 (10:00-11:00 PM, ET/PT). The news was announced by producer Craig Sweeny at New York Comic Con in New York City. Bringing the A-list actor back for the series was a challenge due to his hectic schedule. \"We are subject to the whims of Bradley's schedule,\" Sweeny said. In the first episode, Morra provided Brian Finch ( Jake McDorman ) with a temporary inoculation from the severe side effects of the brain-enhancing drug NZT and hinted he had future plans for Brian. In his return, he demands a high price in exchange for another inoculation as Brian's physical and mental health begin to deteriorate again. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:36:50.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
