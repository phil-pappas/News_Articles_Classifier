This is why shears were necessary. They are useful to cut fences.\"\nIn response, LTF, the Franco-Italian company set up to do preliminary work on the line, filed a charge with an Italian prosecutor arguing that such a statement from a famous person like De Luca increased the risks faced by their employees. Some of its staff had already received death threats, it said.\nAs Monday's hearing began, De Luca repeated his opposition to the proposed rail link. The line \"should be obstructed, impeded, and sabotaged in legitimate defense of the health, earth, air and water of a threatened community\".\nHe added that, even if he weren't the accused, he would have come to the court to see what he described as \"an experiment, an attempt to silence dissenting words\".\nDe Luca, who was part of the now-defunct Lotta Continua (Continuous Struggle) revolutionary group in the 1970s and 1980s, says the plan to drill a tunnel through the Alps would release asbestos and radioactive deposits.\nLTF said it had done rigorous environmental checks.\nFrench President Francois Hollande said earlier this year that work on the line would start in 2016, some 15 years after an agreement to build it.\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer and Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:44:22.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
