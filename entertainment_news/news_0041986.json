(AP) - A University of Connecticut student who went on an obscenity-laced tirade against food service workers when they refused to sell him jalapeno-bacon macaroni and cheese has apologized.\nLuke Gatti acknowledges in an online video he was drunk. He says he's ashamed of his behavior and has problems he's addressing.\nThe 19-year-old freshman from Bayville, New York, is due in court Tuesday on charges of breach of peace and criminal trespass stemming from the Oct. 4 outburst, which was captured on video.\nGatti argued with and shoved a food service supervisor. Police and the supervisor say Gatti was refused service because he was carrying an open alcohol container.\nGatti says in his apology no one deserves to be treated the way the supervisor was.\nGatti previously got into trouble when he attended the University of Massachusetts.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:20:14.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
