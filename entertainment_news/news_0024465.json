The rough solo version recorded by the late frontman of the band is more haunting and poignant than the catchy song released under the title \"Verse Chorus Verse\" on 1993's compilation album \" No Alternative\". The demo version of \"Sappy\" will be included on the companion album to HBO's documentary \" Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck \". The soundtrack, \"Kurt Cobain - Montage of Heck : The Home Recordings\", will be released on November 13, the same day the critically acclaimed movie will be released on DVD and Blu-ray. The soundtrack will also include Cobain's cover of The Beatles ' \"And I Love Her\". The standard version will include 13 tracks from Cobain's personal collection, while the deluxe edition double-LP vinyl will boast 31 tracks. The deluxe edition will be hitting the shelves on December 4. Both versions of the soundtrack will be available digitally. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:31:15.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
