ALI TADAYON, STAFF Related article » HOW TO HELP Want to help Kendra Santos and her family?\nGo to www.gofundme.com/yt65ewtg\nOne of the nine workers injured Friday, Oct. 9, when a section of the 91 freeway on-ramp under construction above East Grand Boulevard in Corona dropped unexpectedly by more than a foot and snapped wooden support beams is fighting for his life, his fiancee said Monday, Oct. 12.\nJarrell Boyd, a 33-year-old Riverside native, may not survive injuries suffered when he was struck by the falling beams, fiancee Kendra Santos said. His shoulder, neck and femur are broken, and doctors have drilled a hole in his skull to monitor swelling, she said.\n“The neurosurgeon came in and said there’s a possibility he may not make it,” Santos said.\nSeven workers remained hospitalized Monday night, said John Standiford, deputy director of the Riverside County Transportation Commission. No update has been given on the condition of three men who were initially reported in critical condition.\nAll construction has been halted on the $1.4 billion 91 freeway expansion project following Friday night’s accident – save the erection of a safety fence at the affected site – while state transportation officials investigate the mishap.\nStory continues below.

The road has since been lowered to accommodate the final placement of the expanded on-ramp. During the procedure used Friday, the plan was to slowly lower the 118-foot, 750-ton slab into position. Instead, the slab fell into the wooden support beams and snapped them.\nAtkinson Walsh, contractors for the project, successfully completed another 91 bridge using the same method, Standiford said. This approach had been planned for three more bridges, but that is being re-evaluated.\nSpokespersons at Atkinson Walsh did not respond to repeated inquiries about the incident.\nCaltrans and OSHA are investigating, as well as an independent company hired by the contractors. There was no estimate on how long the process could take.\n“At this point, we’ll take whatever time is necessary to learn what we need from what happened,” Standiford said of the three-day setback. “Safety is way too important to cut corners.”\nRoughly 500 construction workers have logged more than a million hours of labor on the project so far, Standiford said. Prior to Friday’s incident, five people had been injured, and only one of those required time off from work.\nOn Monday, a pair of construction workers leaned against a concrete barrier along East Grand Boulevard, urging drivers to slow down while passing under the freeway. Several men in hard hats and high-visibility vests took measurements at the base of the newly-installed Main Street on-ramp. RCTC officials say the ramp is undamaged and placed in the proper position.\nFor now, Santos said, all she can do is wait and hope for the father of her 7-year-old son to wake up. She doesn’t place the blame on anyone in particular for what happened, but said she hopes that lessons are being learned.\n“I feel like what (construction crews) do is already so dangerous,” Santos said. “The safety of their employees should always be their top priority.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9644, poneill@pe.com , @PE_PatrickO", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://www.gofundme.com/yt65ewtg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw56wv-bridgecollapse.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4zfq-b88537830z.120151012190920000gv8ci2r6.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4zfq-b88537830z.120151012190920000gv8ci317.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4zfq-b88537830z.120151012190920000gv8ci2r6.10.jpg", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/graphics/PE_R_BRIDGECOLLAPSE_1013.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw56wv-bridgecollapse.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4zfq-b88537830z.120151012190920000gv8ci317.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:13:24.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
