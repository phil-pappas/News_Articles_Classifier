It was hosted by Jimmy Kimmel , who later officiated the couple's nuptials, and the comedian had to \"bully\" the actor to come to the party. \"It was the most G-rated [bachelor party],\" Jimmy Kimmel quipped. It was so quiet that it didn't even wake up a sleeping baby, literally. Theroux remembered showing up on Kimmel's doorstep and was greeted by the late-night host's wife, Molly McNearney, holding their toddler. Theroux and Kimmel also teamed up for a so-called \"Mad Mac\" video which spoofed a viral video of a drunken student demanding macaroni and cheese. The sketch didn't include an apology video posted by the teen. Theroux said he would keep it for a sequel later on. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:47:59.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
