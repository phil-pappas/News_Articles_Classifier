According to CBS News .com, photos of the blond cheerleader dressed up as the metal-mouthed rapper were originally posted to Facebook and eventually appeared on sports blog Deadspin.com , causing a furor. Football fans appear to be split on whether the costume was offensive or just harmless fun. \"If she wasn't a Dallas cheerleader, would it really matter?\" Cowboys fan Laura Pyhrr said to CBS 11 Dallas. \"It's Halloween, you know. You get to go how you want to go.\" \"I'm assuming you would hold yourself up to a higher standard - especially if you're playing for the Cowboys,\" Richard Vasquez says. \"But wow, not much I can say about that - it speaks for itself.\" Neither the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders nor the football team itself would officially comment on the incident. However, a spokesperson for the sports team said that they are aware of the situation and are addressing it. Controversies associated with blackface have been making a comeback in the news lately. While Isleib was posing as Lil' Wayne, a couple of Chicago Blackhawks hockey players decided to celebrate Halloween by dressing up as former Bulls players Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen , complete with brown skin. In an episode of \" America's Next Top Model \" that aired Oct. 27, Tyra Banks got her models to pose as \"hapa\" women in a sugarcane field. Also on TV, Harry Connick Jr. publicly expressed his disgust at a skit on the Australian TV show \"Hey Hey It's Saturday.\" In it, four men in blackface and Afro wigs sang and danced behind a Michael Jackson impersonator who wore white makeup. Blackface, in which white people used dark theatrical makeup to play black people, rose to prominence in the 19th century but by the mid-20th century, it had become associated with racism.
