Call it the beginner's luck or just better execution of plans by the team headed by Vishal , the newly sprang up 'Pandavar Ani' is said to have swung the election results completely in its favour with a comfortable win over Sarathkumar and his team. \nThe relatively young team has taken over all 5 positions that were up for grabs, which now gives them the absolute power and authority to run the Artists' Association on their own terms. The 'Pandavar Ani' is said to have won the elections with a difference of more than 100 votes. \nSpeaking to the media right after the results were declared, Vishal expressed his happiness over the way the elections were conducted, \"It was the fairest affair (election) in the last 10 years as many actors and actresses came forward to cast their votes. Some of them made it with the help of wheelchairs just to cast their votes\", said the new General Secretary who was visibly emotional. \nNasser, the senior most of them all, said no one from his team intended to \"defeat\" anyone, \"the aim of this election is not to defeat anyone, it's only to bring about a positive change. The relationship between Sarathkumar and myself will remain the same and our friendship will continue\", he said. \nBut there were no signs of friendship in the way the elections were actually conducted, for sources claimed that there were bloodshed amidst chaos as Vishal was allegedly injured by some miscreants. There were also reports suggesting that Vishal had to be taken to hospital as he was bleeding. \nHaving said that, all's well that ends well and the new team is now all geared up to fulfill the promises they made prior to the elections. \nCheck out the slides below to know who has been assigned what role: 'Nadigar Sangam' Election Results: A Grand Win For Vishal's 'Pandavar Ani' Amid Chaos And Bloodshed? 1/7 Vishal \nAs mentioned earlier, Vishal is the new General Secretary.
