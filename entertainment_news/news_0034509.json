It’s not as if it isn’t a great pattern/textile/statement for every time of year, but once the air starts getting chilly, there’s just something about the rich colors and the cozy textures of the fabrics that traditionally pair with plaid that call to us.\nMaybe it’s got something to do with Boston’s history with Ireland and England, or because our fall weather here so perfectly complements nubby plaid scarves, wool plaid capes and cashmere plaid linings in our jackets. Who knows? As far as I’m concerned, for whatever reason you choose, now’s the season to let your inner plaid-mad self get rad.\nAnd rad, it is. This fall is possibly the most interesting one for plaid I can remember, mostly because designers are doing very new things with it.\nLet’s start with Burberry, since everyone knows they’re basically the Kings of Plaidland. Their signature pattern is recognizable across the planet, but now they’re moving beyond just that — it almost looks like they’re looking to own plaid as a universal concept, with their new “Scarf Bar.” With a few clicks of your keyboard on burberry.com or in stores, you can pick among a slew of intricately woven cashmere plaids — azure and purple mixes, olive with grays and creams, garnets with crimsons — and have them personally monogrammed and set on your doorstep. It used to be when you bought a Burberry scarf you looked like everyone else with one. Not anymore.\nOn the highly stylish but affordable front, Target has embraced plaid in a huge way, and has brought on Adam Lippes. Primarily an upscale designer, Lippes worked at Oscar de la Renta and Ralph Lauren before launching his own line of refined, timeless womenswear years ago. But now, he’s created casual-cool and wallet-friendly pieces for Target: swingy women’s ponchos for day and structured jackets for the office, pretty plates for the home, and sleek unisex gray-and-black shearling backpacks for running around town in super-chic plaid.\nAs for what I’m buying for my boutique (Gretta Luxe in Wellesley), I found and absolutely love designer Yigal Azrouel’s cozy-as-can-be fringed, subtly plaid sweater. I imagine living in it all fall.\nConsider all of the above your absolute go-tos for making cooler temperatures as cool as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:48:23.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
