(Zbigniew Bzdak / Chicago Tribune) Michael Phillips Contact Reporter Is Michael Shannon the busiest good actor in movies? \nIn \"99 Homes,\" 41-year-old Michael Shannon gives his latest fiercely accomplished performance as an Orlando real estate broker whose name, Rick Carver, indicates a knife-like ability to slice up the economic opportunities of the moment. \nCo-writer and director Ramin Bahrani structures his film as a moral thriller and a seduction. One homeowner evicted early in the film, a construction worker played by Andrew Garfield, is desperate for cash. He does a one-off job for Carver as yet another foreclosure scavenged by Carver is readied for a quick flip and a nice profit. Then he becomes his business partner, at a price. \n\"Nobody trains to be an evictionologist,\" Shannon says to me. It's late morning and we're sitting in an empty restaurant at the Virgin hotel downtown. He's explaining Carver's lot in life, how the character fell into his specialty after the 2007 real estate bust. The movie's set in 2010, when foreclosures were peaking. \n\"Everybody involved in the movie wanted to present an accurate and authentic depiction of what this experience is like for these people. Andrew and Laura (Dern, who plays the construction worker's mother) represent people who don't have a voice. We felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of obligation to those people. The last thing you want to do is take this subject matter and use it for your own advantage, for 'great drama.' \" \nShannon pauses. \"Rick's a broker, but nobody has any money, so the money's in evictions. And even the devil needs a friend.\" \nShannon has plenty of friends, and as busy a professional and personal life as one Chicago-bred stage and screen actor, who also has a band (Corporal), can comfortably manage. He shot six films in the last eight months. This week he takes off again for another month to make \"Nocturnal Animals\" for \"A Single Man\" writer-director Tom Ford. His co-stars will be Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams. '99 Homes' trailer \nOfficial trailer for '99 Homes.' \nOfficial trailer for '99 Homes.' See more videos \nThen he'll return to Chicago, where Shannon and his partner, Steppenwolf Theatre ensemble member Kate Arrington (currently in \"East of Eden\") recently purchased a condo in Old Town where they live with their two daughters, 7 and 1. He'll then dive back into final preparations for a new play, rehearsing around Shannon's schedule, at the theater Shannon co-founded. A Red Orchid Theatre's world premiere of \"Pilgrim's Progress\" by Brett Neveu begins previews Nov. 4. \nWhen their respective productions conclude, the Shannon/Arringtons relocate back to the place they're renting in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y. In the spring, Shannon will play Jamie Tyrone in the Broadway revival of \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" starring Jessica Lange and Gabriel Byrne. \nOne of the films in the can: \"Elvis & Nixon,\" in which Shannon dons the most famous sideburns in American history. Kevin Spacey plays the president. \n\"Ideally,\" Shannon says of his back-to-back projects, \"most people if they were going to play someone like Elvis, they probably wouldn't be working on something else right before that. They'd take, like, a year. I didn't have that luxury. I had a couple of weeks.\" Pause. \"Sometimes I look at Daniel Day-Lewis and think: That guy's really figured it out. He makes one super-amazing movie every three, four years, and everybody thinks he's a god. Which he is. Sometimes I think I should give that a shot. I'm not at that level, but ... you know, I'm trying to get there.\" \nGratitude for his opportunities, combined with a detectable undertow of guilt, helps drive Shannon's maniacal work pace. Four years ago, when we last talked, he acknowledged that his increasingly rich film career (this was before he played General Zod in \"Man of Steel\") was clouded somewhat by the knowledge that so many of his acting pals and colleagues struggle to make the rent. \nAs he told the National Post in 2011, around the time he made Jeff Nichols' \"Take Shelter,\" which remains Shannon's favorite film experience to date: \"A lot of my friends are still in Chicago and they are as talented and as gifted as I am, maybe more so, but they are still there. And they can't make a living out of doing what they love, so I feel I owe it to them, out of respect, to take every opportunity I get and treat it very seriously.\" \nIt helps, Arrington says, to have what Shannon has: \"a supernatural constitution. Mike can function on so little sleep. He actually doesn't understand people who need a lot of sleep and good nutrition.\" She laughs. \"I don't understand that at all.\" Arrington and Shannon met here in Chicago, and began dating when he was doing \"The Pillowman\" at Steppenwolf and she was doing \"King Lear\" at the Goodman. \"I think he's absolutely something that no one else in the world is,\" she says. \"He has something no one else in the world has. You don't forget Mike. On stage, on film, he's honest and scary and so, so committed.\" \n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" playwright Neveu says Shannon has \"an amazing ability to surprise in rehearsal, not just every single day, but every time he does a scene. Something new happens, and it's always growth toward what we're aiming at … it's like having somebody needle the play, prodding more and more out of it. I'm just trying to make the script as good as his acting. It's not easy. He's a hell of an actor.\" \nHas he changed, I wondered, since his Oscar nomination (for \"Revolutionary Road\"), since Zod in \"Man of Steel,\" since films such as \"Take Shelter\" established him as an internationally respected screen presence both malleable and distinctive? \n\"No,\" Neveu says. \"He's the same guy. Same guy I met here at Red Orchid, when he was doing 'Mr. Kolpert.' \" Coincidentally that blistering German black comedy, produced in 2003, marked my first encounter with the actor in question. From the Tribune review: \"Shannon anchors the show with a clenched jaw, a squinty gaze — apt, since he's playing someone morally blind — and some pricelessly dry line readings.\" \nNeveu: \"Well, wait. He's changed, in that I think he's gotten more settled into who he is, what he wants to do and what he believes in. Acting can sometimes make a person feel ridiculous, the older you get. I think he's turning it into an examination.\" \nGoing into \"99 Homes,\" Shannon says, meant learning about a world \"I wasn't interested in. I'm not a real estate junkie. I don't sit there and read the listings, and watch the market go up and down. There was stuff in the script, I was like, I don't even know what this means. So I had to find somebody to illuminate all that for me.\" He spent time with a Florida broker-evictionologist, someone co-writer and director Bahrani had met. \nShannon says the broker \"taught me about everything, and the whole time I was studying his personality. A very affable, sweet guy, and he certainly had an awareness of the impact he has on people's lives. But the fact of the matter is, if you're getting evicted from your house, if a guy like Rick shows up at your door, the game's been over for a long time. It's over.\" Pause, a sip of wine, and then: \"But you know? I could tell he was unhappy. He confided in me that it was hard for him to sleep at night.\" \nAs written, Carver is a ruthless adversary, the product of an economic system that \"bails out the winners,\" as Shannon's character says in the movie. Shannon tends to take his time on set in the early days of rehearsal, holding back, finding his way. \"First day,\" he says, \"I've had directors ask me: 'Are you going to do … something?\" He smiles. \"And I'll say: 'Yeeeaahhhh, don't worry, I'm doing something. I've done this before. It all comes out in the wash.' \" \nAnyone who's played a surfeit of sociopaths, killers and troubled souls, as Shannon has, risks the pigeonhole of typecasting. But then, Shannon was used to that by his early 20s, as he made his way across a variety of Chicago stages and beyond. Paradoxically, he says, \"the key principle of acting for me is: relax. You gotta relax. Nobody wants to watch somebody being all anxious about their business. That's no fun. And try and stay out of the way.\" Meaning? \"An actor's job is by and large invisible; it should not be noticed. You should not walk out thinking, 'That moment when he looked out at the stars, and started crying, with a French accent — wasn't that wonderful?' I find that obnoxious. I'd rather you notice the story, and the people.\" \nOn the other hand, there's undeniable satisfaction in watching a first-rate actor go to town. \"Yeah, I suppose. Chewing the scenery, as they say. Which I get accused of from time to time. It's fun to watch other people have fun. Most of the fun we have in our lives, we have vicariously, through some other person, or some situation. It's not usually self-generated fun. You have to be somewhere, where something's happening.\" \nWe talk about kids, and the importance of good playgrounds. Shannon's life, like any life, has changed across the years. \"When I was here (years ago), I stayed at Red Orchid sometimes. I slept there sometimes. And across the street from the condo I now own, there's a building I used to stay in the attic of. A very nice woman rented me her attic. Cheap. I can look out the window, and I see it. Long before Kate, and the kids. It's interesting to see the chapters of your life that way.\" \nBack to Elvis: \"I just never thought it was a good idea, playing Elvis. I just thought I should not play Elvis. Doesn't make any sense.\" But one of the producers, Holly Wiersma, who worked on the film version of Tracy Letts' play \"Bug\" co-starring Shannon and Ashley Judd, convinced him. Shannon liked the director, Liza Johnson, for whom he did the overlooked homefront drama \"Return\" alongside Linda Cardellini. So he jumped in, jumpsuit and all. \nIn the few days he had to prepare, Shannon says, \"I submerged myself completely, saw every documentary I could, all the Elvis movies I could see, watched his press conferences, read books on him. First day comes, I'm on set. I got the wig on, the sunglasses, the sideburns. We had to start with the Oval Office scenes, the climax of the whole movie, because of Kevin's schedule. We're doing the scene, it's my first close-up. We do a take, the director comes over, and she says: 'Maybe just be a little more … I don't know … maybe, like this isn't a big deal for you,' to be meeting Nixon. 'Be, I don't know, a little more charming.' I say OK, we do another take.\" \nJohnson says cut. \"Yeah, I don't know … maybe …' \" And then Shannon, frustrated, says to her: \" 'Liza, what is it? What am I doing wrong? I've done all my research. How is it coming across?' And she says, 'Well, it seems like you're really scared.' And I'm like, I am scared! I'm really scared.' And then she said: 'Well, don't be. It's OK. Don't be scared.' \" That's all he needed. Shannon exhaled and, he says, \"we did the next take and she said: 'That's what I'm talking about.' She popped the balloon that first day.\" And then it was time to do the work. \nShannon appears in \"99 Homes,\" opening today, and \"Freeheld,\" which opens next Friday. \"Pilgrim's Progress\" at A Red Orchid Theatre begins preview performances Nov. 4. \nMichael Phillips is a Tribune critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:37:50.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
