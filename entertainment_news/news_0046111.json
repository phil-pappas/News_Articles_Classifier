Getty archived image With summer officially over, “Daylight Savings Time 2015” and “Daylight Saving Time 2015” looks to be a trending topic online with folks wondering when the clocks are due to “ fall back .” The days are getting shorter as darkness creeps in during dinnertime for many today.

The actual terminology is “Daylight Saving Time,” but “Daylight Savings Times” is also an acceptable term in other areas of the world and it's becoming quite the norm when doing a search through “Google News.”\nIn the U.S. Daylight Saving Time begins on the second Sunday in March at 2 a.m. and it ends on the first Sunday in November at 3a.m. For 2015, that day will be Sunday, November 1.\nWhile most of the U.S. observes Daylight Saving Time, Hawaii and a good majority of the area of Arizona keep their clocks the same all year. They don't participate in changing the clock twice a year, according to MNR Daily,\nIn Europe, Daylight Saving Time ends earlier than in the United States. Their Daylight Saving Time officially started on March 29, 2015 and will end on Oct. 25, 2015 at 3 a.m. which also falls on a Sunday.\nAustralia also recognizes Daylight Savings Time , where they use \"savings\" in their terminology.

In Australia Daylight Savings Time will officially start on, Oct. 4, 2015 at 2 am, when they put their clock an hour ahead.\nAccording to Time and Date.com : “'Daylight Savings Time' is very commonly used, especially in Australia, Canada and the United States.
