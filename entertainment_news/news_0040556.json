Alfred Taubman had a 500-piece collection spanning every period, genre and medium. The collection will be auctioned over four dedicated sales, three in November and one in January. \nIn advance of those sales, Sotheby's has transformed its building inside and out to give a real sense of its depth and scope. Three hundred of the works fill the lobby and the entire 10th floor of the building. The dedicated exhibition runs for four days only, from Saturday through Tuesday. \nThe auctions are estimated to bring more than $500 million. If they do, it would be the most valuable private collection ever sold at auction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:33:02.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
