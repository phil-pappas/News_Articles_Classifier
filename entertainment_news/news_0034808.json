The carbon fiber package ($4,000) on the test model featured a front lip and rear diffuser of the high-strength, lightweight material that is preferred by modern performance cars. It came in a reflective gray coat that Audi calls Nardo but we'll call battleship.\nAdding to the sedan's eye-catching profile were 21-inch wheels (20-inch standard), with grippy summer tires for an extra $1,000, which showed off the red front- and rear- brake calipers that are part of the dynamic package with steel-spring sport suspension (instead of air suspension) for $5,500.\nBoth the dynamic and carbon fiber packages are new for 2015.\nThere were plenty of add-ons to make the car stand out amid competitors such as the Porsche Panamera, BMW 6-series Gran Coupe, Mercedes-AMG CLS63 and the Tesla Model S, but also to make it stand out in Audi's own lineup of the A7 ($65,900) and the S7 ($82,500). There is a TDI version, but we're not going there.\nThe Racing Sport 7 version, which was first launched in 2013, starts at $106,500 and is the handsomest of the bunch.\nThe difference is mostly under the hood, though the RS 7 is nearly 2 inches longer, likely due to the front spoiler and rear diffuser.\nTesla Model S P85D: The D is like nothing else on the road Robert Duffer Certain experiences promise a thrill: roller coasters, free fall, love. Add The D to the list.\nTesla's Model S P85D, the all-wheel-drive variant of the all-electric Model S, is like no other car on the road. I say this without hyperbole or overstatement.

The D goes 0-60 mph in 3.2 seconds, making...\n(Robert Duffer) It houses a whopping 4.0-liter twin turbo V-8 that makes a gut-dropping, chest-shaking 560-horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. When fully opened, it can throw you back in your seat as much as lift you up, surprisingly similar to the instant torque of the all-electric Model S, except for the V-8 roar that settles into a warbling popping explosion when you lay off the gas.\nThe thrust comes from the twin-turbo, which scoffs at lag by getting up to max torque at 1,750 rpm and stays there through 5,500 rpm. The low center of gravity coupled with all-wheel drive and a lowered suspension on the RS 7 lets drivers be as aggressive as the stability control and other safety features allow.\nThere isn't much reason to disable those features outside of a track. Of the four driving modes, Dynamic is tuned to performance but Auto provided plenty of thrills, and the 8-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic shifted more mindfully (OK, better) than we could do with paddles.\nThe performance of this near 4,500-pound fleet-footed beast only tells part of the story. It is a surprisingly subtle and smooth ride, like a luxury sedan should be, but it's also versatile enough to accommodate family-of-four activities.\nBMW reveals redesigned 7 Series flagship sedan Charles Fleming BMW has pulled the covers off its 2016 7 Series sedan, the sixth generation of the German luxury car maker's flagship vehicle.\nThe company promises to deliver \"the future of luxury\" in its 740i and 750i xDrive models, and to deliver those vehicles to U.S. showrooms in late 2015.

They will be priced...\n(Charles Fleming) Audi didn't try to jam in a fifth seat, and despite the arching roofline, four average-sized adults can fit comfortably in the quilted honeycomb seats swaddled in Audi leather.\nInstead of a trunk there is a hatch that broadens out as it deepens, enough to fit a big hockey bag, small guitar amp and sundry other gear for a weekend full of family activities.\nThe seats fold down flat to open up more cargo room than most full-size sedans, and this really broadens its utility compared with the more limited use of most performance sedans. Chances are the few hundred owners (Audi has only sold 5,500 of the A7 lineup through September) aren't going to be hauling lumber with the RS 7, but the versatility could come in handy for the random demands of a small business owner or for a jaunt to the college kid in need of supplies.\nBehind the wheel is about as comfy as it gets. The sport seats aren't too rigid, and everything from the console to the armrest on the door fits in an Audi way that few other automakers can match. The perforated steering wheel, which is thick and meaty but not clingy, is emblematic of a car whose fine attention to details enhances the overall experience.\nAudi's MMI connected car system is not the leader it once was, however. The 8-inch screen still disappears into the carbon fiber-trimmed dash when the system is off, but when it's on, the four buttons flanking the four smaller buttons surrounding the center controller knob get confusing. The four interior buttons correspond to subnavigation in the corners of the screen; the four outer buttons are for main navigation function for navigation, phone, audio and car. Other similar systems such as BMW and even Mazda have evolved into simpler layouts. We're ready for the next, simplified version.\nCylinder deactivation helps limit fuel use on light loads of the fastback, enabling an average of 21.5 mpg over 200 miles in mixed driving that never aspired to fuel economy. The EPA estimate is 18 mpg combined.\nThe RS 7 exists in a sliver of a shrinking segment, yet for the few who can afford it, there are no compromises.\nAudi RS 7 at a glance\nVehicle type : Performance sedan\nBase price : $106,500\nAs tested : $121,700 (excluding $925 destination)\nMPG : 15 city, 25 highway\nEngine : 4.0-liter turbocharged V-8\nTransmission : 8-speed Tiptronic automatic in all-wheel drive\nParting shot : Sophisticated fastback sedan belies wild performance machine\nrduffer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DufferRobert\n Auto Reviews Audi BMW Mercedes-Benz", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bc71d/turbine/sc-2015-audi-rs7-autoreview-1008-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54eb52e1/turbine/sc-cons-0219-autocover-tesla-the-d-20150217", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5579f88f/turbine/ct-bmw-2016-7-series-flagship-20150611"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:26:10.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
