Originally featuring only six classes in 1978, the show now includes 43 classes, including the prestigious best wine of show, a sign of the growth of premium wine in the west.\nAfter a class is judged, the panel compares scores and any wine pointed 18.5 or above (gold medal worthy) is re-poured for another tasting and dissection before chief judge Jane Faulkner and each panel decide which deserve gold.\nClick here to WIN a double pass to the Top 50 tasting \nThe whole judging process is neither easy nor pleasant; swirling, sniffing and spitting 60 cabernets at 8am may sound enticing but teeth go black within hours (and shouldn't be brushed until the next morning) and constant concentration is required all day.\nLuckily experience is always on hand - panel leaders and judges include Gourmet Traveller Winemaker of the Year Virginia Willcock from Vasse Felix, Hong Kong wine guru Eddie McDougall and renowned local riesling guru Rob Diletti.\nAlthough winners won't be announced until the awards night next Friday, we can reveal some gold-medal winners below that you can try at the top 50 tasting, while we review five other gold-medal wines from the show further down.\n10 gold-medal winners from the show: \n1. 2015 Larry Cherubino Ad Hoc Riesling\n2. 2015 Sandalford Margaret River Classic Dry White\n3. 2014 Forest Hill Vineyard Block 1 Riesling\n4. 2014 Talisman Gabrielle Chardonnay\n5. 2014 Vasse Felix Heytesbury Chardonnay\n6. 2014 Singlefile Family Reserve Chardonnay\n7. 2013 Voyager Estate Chardonnay\n8. 2013 Devil's Lair Ninth Chamber Chardonnay\n9. 2013 Alkoomi Black Label Shiraz Viognier\n10. 2015 Xanadu Next of Kin SBS\nWinestein Uncorked – 5 gold-medal winners from the show \n2014 Sandalford Margaret River Shiraz\n$20, 15%, 94pts \nSandalford is an institution in the west and arguably making wines better than ever, as evidenced by several gold medals at the WA Wine Show for their $20 range of wines. This wine highlights the quality of Margaret River shiraz – a sweet-fruit wine with velvet tannins and a long, gentle finish, the 2% splash of viognier adding vanilla and cinnamon spice. What a bargain.\n2012 Xanadu Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon\n$85, 14.5pts, 97pts \nSourced from the famed Wilyabrup sub-region of Margaret River, this houses 5% each of petit verdot and malbec – a true Bordeaux blend minus the merlot. There's a cascade of dark berry flavours on the palate, enhanced by top-quality firm tannins and fine oak.\n2015 Kerrigan + Berry Riesling\n$30, 11.5%, 95pts \nMade from the historic Langton vineyard in Mt Barker. Impressive seamless structure, bright acidity and lingering complex flavours that lean towards citrus and spice – what's not to love?\n2014 Rockcliffe Single Site Pinot Noir\n$40, 14%, 94pts \nThere's a Japanese twist on the nose, with satsuma, caramel and soy. Has quite the structure and poise, with sweet cherry and plum prancing elegantly on the palate. Will really puff its chest out in a few years.\n2012 Vasse Felix Cabernet Sauvignon\n$42, 14.5%, 95pts \nFrom Gourmet Traveller Winemaker of the Year Virginia Willcock comes another solid cabernet from Margaret River's first winery. It's pristine in every way, extremely well balanced and ripe upfront fruit that slowly evolves on the palate long after it's gone down.\nThe Top 50 Tasting\nDate:  Sunday 25 October\nTime:  4pm-7pm\nPrice:  $55pp\nLocation:  Print Hall, St Georges Tce, Perth\nTickets:   www.wineshowwa.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:25:38.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
