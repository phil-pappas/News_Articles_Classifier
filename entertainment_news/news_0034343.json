Atlanta’ \nThey’ve got a debut album, Stovall , out last year, chock full of poetic, heart-wrenching tales outlining moments when you feel like you’re not enough, the days when you question your ideals, when you find the good despite your mistakes. It’s all quite reminiscent of peak-aughts emo, a dash of Manchester Orchestra and Taking Back Sunday. Though below all the blood-pumping honesty is just a bunch of guys who are pretty goofy. \n“I’d definitely say if you spend any amount of time with our band, you would find that we don’t take ourselves serious hardly ever,” bassist Tyler Hill said. “Which is pretty funny because on Stovall and a lot of our songs are pretty serious subject matter, but day to day not so much. \nEven before singer-guitarist Nathan Hardy launches into an emotive hurricane of “I’ve been wasting all my time”-s in the video for “but not often,” a track off their recently released split EP with Buffalo’s Head North , the foursome are shown reenacting exaggerated and silly versions of their own daily lives. You’ve got drummer Tito Pittard dousing himself in mocha cappuccino mix mid-run, guitarist Wesley Swanson pouring beer into his cereal, Hardy singing with a mouthful of a PB& \n“Nathan had that idea,” Hill said. “He’s like, ‘I want it to be a relatively accurate portrayal of our daily lives. You need to be drinking wine with your cat.’ And I’m like, ‘Well that actually is my daily life. So let’s do it. ” \nNow, however, more and more of their day-to-day includes touring, this time kicking off a tour with Have Mercy, Transit and Somos, coming to the Foundry on Wednesday. \nBut before Microwave could revel in the successes of Stovall \n“How I met Tito is one of my favorite stories ever. I was sitting down at the bar with some of my buddies, and he just walks up, and I’d never met him before, and he goes, ‘I loved her dude.’ I was like ‘Uh… I’m Tyler. It’s nice to meet you, man. I’m sorry to hear that.’ The rest is history.” \nEven throughout quirky introductions and personality-filled music videos, Microwave still manage to captivate with relatable pop-punk with tinges of indie and emo, grounded by Hardy’s lyrics, even possessing the ability to affect not only fans but band members themselves. \n“I connect with a lot of the things that he writes,” Hill said. “It hits home hard for me just as much as it does for the other listeners.” \nAll things considered, it’s natural to compare Microwave to the heavyweights of the pop-punk/emo phase. They’re not a cop out or imitation attempt, either. Microwave are the real deal. \n“[Emo] rose to its peak maybe and then everything got dark and it wasn’t cool to be sad again,” Hill said. \nBut as emotional music is hitting its stride again, does Hill think his band is cool enough to be sad? After a thoughtful pause, you can almost hear his smile as he replies, “We’re all too goofy.” \nMicrowave with Have Mercy, Transit and Somos, The Foundry, 1100 Canal St., 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 14, tickets .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:08:00.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
