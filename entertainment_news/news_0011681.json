Edsel is a Dallas-based author who wrote \"The Monuments Men,\" which was made into a 2014 movie starring George Clooney.\nHe told The Dallas Morning News (http://bit.ly/1RnyDJ5 ) on Tuesday that the foundation will stop operating at the end of October. Sharing the WWII unit's stories has cost the foundation more than $7 million over 10 years. However the team has only raised $3.5 million in funds. Edsel, who made his money in oil and gas, paid the rest.\nThe foundation's seven-person team will stop operating at the end of the month, but Edsel will pay for two researchers to finish writing the short biographies the foundation publishes online.\n\"Our commitment was to make sure they were honored, make sure their legacy was preserved, and that the world knew not only what they've done but also what was possible, in regards to the protection of cultural treasures,\" Edsel said. \"We've certainly done that.\"\nThe 345 treasure hunters will be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal Thursday in Washington, D.C. The award is Congress' highest honor of appreciation for distinguished achievement.\nFour or the surviving members will attend the ceremony. Harry Ettlinger, a member of the Monuments Men whose Jewish family fled Germany in 1983, will speak to more than 200 relatives of the Monuments Men at the ceremony.\nEdsel began pushing for congressional recognition after meeting Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, in 2007. Granger sponsored the legislation to honor the group.\n\"The Monuments Men will now forever be honored and recognized,\" Granger said in a written statement. \"What started out as one of the greatest untold stories from World War II has become a celebrated chapter in our nation's history,\"\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/\n___\nInformation from: The Dallas Morning News, http://www.dallasnews.com\nSociety & Culture Volunteering & Philanthropy The Dallas Morning News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:25:13.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
