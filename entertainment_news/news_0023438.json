Comment   TV Guide Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 4:33 PM Updated at 6:04 PM Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 4:33 PM Updated at 6:04 PM It's a good news, bad news kind of day for Halle Berry . CBS has canceled its summer sci-fi drama Extant , which starred Berry as an astronaut who returns from space pregnant with an alien baby, after two seasons, TVGuide.com has confirmed. However, Berry doesn't seem to be too sad letting the show go.\"I am so proud of what we accomplished on Extant ,\" the actress said in a statement. \"This season seemed such a natural place to end Molly's journey that I, along with CBS, felt it best served the story to leave it there. I've loved this experience working with such a talented cast and creative team. ÂŽIt was my first foray into episodic television and I'm excited to continue my relationship with CBS, producing more compelling stories through my 606 Films production banner.\" TV Scorecard: Which shows are returning? Which aren't? Indeed, on the heels of the cancellation, CBS announced that it is developing a new drama series with Berry. The new project, titled Legalese , features a biracial lawyer from Chicago who follows a case to New Orleans. There, she partners with a good ol' boy white attorney in a justice system that will ultimately expose the biases that still exist. Steven Lichtman ( The Good Wife ) will write the pilot, which will be executive-produced by Berry and Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas . It is uncertain whether will Berry will have an onscreen presence in the new project. Extant underwent a bit of a reboot in order to improve on its so-so Season 1 ratings. However, Season 2 only averaged 4.7 million viewers per episode, which, despite a lucrative deal between CBS and Amazon that allowed the streaming service to run episodes shortly after broadcast, was not enough to justify continuing the show. CBS boss addresses Under the Dome 's future, defends Big Brother casting \"Extant played an important role in expanding CBS's line-up of original scripted programming in the summer,\" CBS Entertainment President Glenn Geller said in a statement. \"We are proud of the show's success on the Network, as well as its popularity on Amazon Prime Video. We also want to thank the incomparable Halle Berry for her commitment and support for the series and look forward to working with her on our next project together.\" Page 2 of 2 - In August, CBS canceled fellow summer series Under the Dome after three seasons, but renewed its freshman thriller Zoo . Are you sad to see Extant go? (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS.)
