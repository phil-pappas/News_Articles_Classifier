Even though the Justice Department also has an Antitrust Division, Congress resisted, and the FTC survived.\nNow the FTC is interfering in the burgeoning “sharing economy,” in which smartphone apps connect people for services. In the cross-hairs are such popular services as Uber, the ride-hailing company, and Airbnb, which matches visitors with home rentals.\nIn an Oct. 1 speech, FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez came out for greater federal involvement.\nAlso, some cities have been trying to heavily regulate Airbnb, or even shut it out. We have opposed such meddling, but at least the impetus is on issues like noise and street parking.\nBy contrast, there is no reason regulators in Washington, D.C., should get involved. We hope this topic comes up at the next presidential debates.\nA good tone was set last week by GOP candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, who called for fewer, not more, regulations on the sharing economy. “Uber didn’t even exist when our current president was sworn in,” he said. “Today it’s worth $51 billion.”\nIdeally, some of the candidates will call for finishing Reagan’s job and getting rid of the FTC.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:12:36.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
