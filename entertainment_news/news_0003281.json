During a commercial break, she invited me to be the first male nude centerfold of the magazine.\nAlthough no one had ever shown a naked man in a magazine before, Helen believed women have the same \"visual appetites\" as men, who'd been looking at naked women in Playboy since 1953. She wanted the same prerogative for women. It would be a milestone in the sexual revolution, and she said I was the one man who could pull it off. I found out later she'd asked Paul Newman first, but he turned her down.\n Helen didn't have to talk me into it. I was flattered and intrigued. I wish I could say that I wanted to show my support for women's rights, but I just thought it would be fun. I said yes before we came back on the air. (I may or may not have had several cocktails in the greenroom before the show.)\nOn the way to the photo shoot, I stopped for two quarts of vodka and finished one before we got to the studio, which was freezing cold (bad for a naked man's self-esteem).\nMore From Cosmopolitan The famed Francesco Scavullo photographed me on a bearskin rug. He took hundreds of shots: with a hat in front of my…tallywacker, with a dog in front of it, with my hand in front of it. (If I was trying to prove something, why would I cover it up with my hand? I have very small hands.) They promised to burn the outtakes and give me the negatives.\nThe magazine hit the stands in April 1972, three months before Deliverance opened, and quickly sold all 1.5 million copies.\nA version of this story was published as \"Vintage Beefcake\" in the November issue of Cosmopolitan.
