Recalled into the Indian Test team after a gap of one year, Jadeja returned with figures of 21-1-75-6 to dismiss Hyderabad for 148 after they themselves were bundled out for 102, courtesy some brilliant bowling by Mehdi Hassan (5/43) and Vishal Sharma (4/30). (Also Read: Umesh Yadav picks up four as Vidarbha dismiss Assam for 206) On a day when 20 wickets fell, Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Shah’s decision to bat first backfired as his team was dismissed in 42 overs. Sagar Jogiyani (51) was the top scorer for the hosts and apart from him and Shah (17), none of the other batsmen could reach doubles figures. In reply, Hyderabad was tormented by some brilliant spin bowling by Jadeja and Kamlesh Makvana (4/23), who returned with a four wicket haul as the visitors were dismissed in 42.2 overs. At the draw of stumps, Saurashtra were 10 for no loss with openers Avi Barot (8) and Jogiyani (2) at the crease. They trail Hyderabad by 36 runs with 10 wickets remaining. Brief Score: Saurashtra: 102 in 42 overs (SD Jogiyani 51; M Hassan 5/43) & 10/0 in 8 overs. Hyderabad: 148 in 42.2 overs (K Sumanth 41; R Jadeja 6/75). \nModified Date: October 22, 2015 7:04 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:39:35.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
