Paula Deen will compete on this season of 'Dancing with the Stars' By Josh Rayburn After six weeks of dancing, fun and tears, Savannah celebrity chef Paula Deen learned she had been voted off the current season of “Dancing with the Stars” on Monday night.\nBut before her big goodbye, Deen and dance partner Louis Van Amstel took a turn on the dance floor to Madonna’s “Vogue.” The performance was an homage to Madonna’s performance of the song at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards.\nCritics of the show agreed with its judges, with one reviewer from TVLine.com saying: “the routine consisted of little more than Paula getting pulled across the dance floor by the men. Oh, and hand motions. Lots and lots of hand motions.”\nBut as for Deen, she had a lot of fun and can’t wait to get home to Savannah.\n“I get to go see my grandbabies!” she exclaimed to host Tom Bergeron after her elimination was announced.\nAnd she certainly has no regrets.\n“I’ve been like a fish out of water for six weeks. It was worth it!”\nAnd here's a link to Madonna's original performance", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTaXtWWR16A", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/PaulaDeenVogue.JPG", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/PaulaDeenVogue.JPG", "http://tvline.com/2015/10/19/dancing-with-the-stars-paula-deen-eliminated-season-21/", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:15:40.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
