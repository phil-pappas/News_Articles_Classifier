(Photo by Amy Sussman/Invision/AP) Sponsored Links The Associated Press NEW YORK â€” \nScore one for the selfie stick: Cindy Crawford believes those photos of you by you can help boost self-image. \n\"It's empowering for kids to take their own image in their own hands in a way,\" she said in a recent interview. \"It's a form of self-expression.\" \nBut she cautions that they can be both good and bad. \n\"I certainly think a little guidance is good because when we're young we kind of forget that things might come back to haunt us, she said. \"I tell my kids, 'If you have any doubts at all just check with me first.' \nCrawford credits selfies with teaching the masses the secrets to looking good in photographs. \n\"Every 14-year-old girl these days is a model in their own life because so much of their social media and just their interaction are through selfies. Kids are so much more sophisticated of like their angle and how they want to portray themselves than I ever was.\" \nCrawford's latest endeavor is \"Becoming by Cindy Crawford,\" it's a coffee table book with 150 photographs and anecdotes from her career as she prepares to turn 50 next year. \nIn a recent interview, Crawford talked about models today and her lookalike daughter Kaia. \n___ \nAssociated Press: You came up in an era where we called models by their first name and called them supermodels. Then there weren't as many. What do you think of models today? \nCrawford: I was really lucky to be in fashion at the time that I was and it was like such a moment for models. ... I think for a while for whatever reason there wasn't that connection to models, but I think this new group of models, Gigi (Hadid) and Kendall (Jenner.) Everyone knows them by their first name and I think so much of that is the power of social media. ... They can put out who they are and get their personalities out there, individuality out through their social media and I think that's what fans are loving/ \nAP: Recently people started really noticing your 14-year-old daughter, Kaia, and commenting on her resemblance to you. What's that like? \nCrawford: Since she was little, people have said, 'She looks just like you' and she would say, 'We look nothing alike.' And I think now as she's getting older ... the resemblance is coming out more because, you know, when people started seeing images of me they weren't that much older than the age that she is now. And she's starting to figure out it's not such a terrible thing. \nAP: What do you think of Kaia going into modeling? (She recently walked in the Public School runway show at New York Fashion Week.) \nCrawford: I just want her to be a kind person and have work that she loves. ... My husband and I have both been really fortunate that we love our jobs and we would want that for our kids too. In terms of modeling if she wants to do it, I wouldn't dissuade her because it's been great for me. \nAP: How are you when you're taking family photos or pictures with friends? Is it hard to turn off the model part of your brain? \nCrawford: I definitely think having been photographed by the Irving Penns and the Helmut Newtons of the world, I'm aware of light and angles. You can't really throw that away, but I also try not to be annoying. Fashion photography is art. When you're just doing snapshots it's a different purpose. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:16:20.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
