The public recently got a chance to see the theater and hear plans for its renovation. The 1931-era theater still has many of its original furnishings, such a tiles in the old bathrooms, and possibly a painting of Disney cartoon characters in the “Crying Room” for babies and toddlers. The theater was also one of the first ones built with “talkies” in mind, with loudspeakers planned right from the beginning. However, in 1953, the theater became obsolete in some ways when widescreen movies were introduced to combat television’s growing popularity. The back of the theater was designed for the old, squarer-shaped screens. The building just wasn’t wide enough to show Cinemascope movies properly. The Redwood Theater officially closed in 1969, but was still occasionally used for showing movies later than that. (This reporter can testify it was used in 1971: he saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory there with his parents when that movie was first released, and had nightmares about it for weeks afterward.) More recently, the building has served as a health facility, with the ground floor turned into racquetball courts. The investors state the new, approximately $1.2 million upgrade will use digital projectors to show first run movies and special-themed movie experiences such as classic movies and holiday fare. The planned opening date of the reborn Redwood Theater is Memorial Day, 2017.
