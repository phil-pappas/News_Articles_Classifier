Nevertheless, the old one will still close as scheduled this weekend.\nThe old, 2,600-square-foot Wendy's is expected to be demolished once its replacement is fully up and running. The 0.7-acre site at 1500 E. Algonquin Road already is being marketed by the commercial real estate firm Sperry Van Ness.\n Business News Dining Schaumburg Commercial Real Estate", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:05:10.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
