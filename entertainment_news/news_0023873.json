The emphasis is on participation and this year’s workshops include \"Uke Can Sing\" and a \"Family Ukestra\". There will also be performances by song writing and talent competition winners and top New Zealand ukulele bands The Nukes, Will Crummer and the Rarotongans and 2Pouz Fynist. New Zealand entertainer, singer and comedian Jackie Clarke will MC the day. \nThis year’s special international guest is none other than James Hill - frequently described as one of the world’s best players. Hill plays the ukulele with a seriousness and technique more usually attributed to classical musicians of the highest calibre. He learnt to play the instrument at school in Canada where it was part of the compulsory curriculum and this is will be his 3rd time joining the festival. James Hill will perform on the mainstage as the headline act, as well as taking a masterclass with the Development Squad who will perform his arrangements. \nAn annual highlight of the festival is when 2500 children fill a grandstand to play in a massed ukulele orchestra called the Kiwileles. The Kiwileles come from schools involved in the New Zealand Ukulele Trust's music education programme. They come from all over the Auckland region, Northland and Waikato with one school annually making the trip from Christchurch. The New Zealand Ukulele Trust is a volunteer charity which give thousands of children a start in music by donating instruments, producing songbooks and CD’s, running competitions, supporting schools and creating performance opportunities for young musicians. \n\"The festival provides motivation for children to practise, and the chance to experience the exhilaration of performing at an outdoor music festival - just like the stars,\" says Chairperson Mary Cornish. \"They entertain the crowd for over an hour, generating joy and pride.\" \nSupported by a professional band and guest artists, this year’s Kiwileles set includes music by; Six60, Baby Sitter's Circus, Stan Walker, Hirini Melbourne, Grieg and Haydn. Introducing the children to a variety of musical styles is one of the trust’s goals. \nThe Kiwileles will also perform 10-year-old Melissa Main's song On Top of the World. Melissa's song was the over-all winner of the all ages APRA Uke-Can-Do-It Songwriting Competition last year. Melissa will be back this year to lead the song backed by 2,500 of her peers. \nThe New Zealand Ukulele Festival Saturday 28th November at The Trusts Area, Henderson, Auckland. 11am-4pm: Non-stop music, workshops, food, stalls, competitions and giveaways. \nAll ages, all welcome, family friendly and free.
