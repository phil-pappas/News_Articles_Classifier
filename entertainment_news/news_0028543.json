John Lowe is invited to a dinner party, while Alex confronts the Countess about what happened to her son. \nJust in time for Halloween, \" American Horror Story : Hotel\" will be celebrating \"Devil's Night\" next week. In a preview for the new episode, Det. John Lowe receives an invitation to attend an exclusive Devil's Night Soiree which isn't as fun as one might think, prompting him to ask if it's a Halloween trick. Meanwhile, Alex is confronting the Countess about her son and the latter may show Alex that \"the world can be such an evil place.\" There's also a shot of a little boy entering his coffin and a woman screaming in her bed and running down the hallway of Hotel Cortez with a scared face. Also in the episode, Alex tries to diagnose Holden's strange condition. Titled \"Devil's Night\", the new episode airs Wednesday, October 28 at 10 P.M. on FX. The episode will feature Darren Criss as an arrogant hipster and Lily Rabe as infamous serial killer Aileen Wuornos. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:47:19.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
