But where? The public already knows that streaming is the wave of the future, but for one reason or another, the majority still hasn’t signed up for one of the many services, and there are still hundreds of millions (or potentially billions, depending on the business model) of people just waiting to be persuaded to hand their money over for unlimited music playing. Is it because the value of streaming hasn’t been communicated properly? Is it because people don’t want to spend the money ? Yes and yes, but there’s another reason, and it’s one that only a few of the streaming options have recently tackled: the platforms currently on the market don't’ make sense for families. Today, Rhapsody , one of the first major players to enter the streaming market, has announced a big new channel that will allow families everywhere to finally get on board with the idea of all-you-can-listen-to music—if they were waiting for something that was family-friendly. The company is launching Rhapsody KIDS , which will only feature music that has been deemed appropriate for children.Aimed at those listeners under the age of ten, KIDS will come pre-programmed with a massive library of music that is ready for younger ears. According to representatives for Rhapsody, KIDS will feature 16,000 artists, 80,000 albums, and over 1.1 million tracks at first launch, but that’s just the beginning. Kids will be able to play around with that impressive catalog on their own, but from there the numbers only grow. Parents can alter their children’s accounts as they see fit, adding and subtracting content as they go along. So, say one family is totally in love with the complete discography of James Taylor (which few could say is harmful to kids, but I digress). The parents would be able to go into their own Rhapsody account and add his albums and songs to the list of approved music that their kids can listen to. No two families are alike, and every parent should have control over what their children are listening to (at least at a young age), and Rhapsody is intent on respecting that.In launching a new subset of Rhapsody dedicated only to younger audiences, Rhapsody CFO Ethan Rudin says they are finally addressing “an audience that has gone mostly neglected” in the race to win customers in the streaming game, and he’s right. While millions of people subscribe to platforms like Rhapsody, Rdio, Spotify, and the like, how many of them are doing so with their entire family in mind? This is an untapped demographic, in that it hasn’t been properly marketed to, and Rhapsody is smart to be one of the first to go after it.
