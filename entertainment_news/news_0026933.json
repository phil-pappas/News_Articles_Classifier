Andrew Tropeano, a technology expert and the host of NewsWatch, conducted the review and shared with viewers how this light will keep any home safe.\nCompanies around the globe have taken traditional home appliances like locks, thermostats, and lights and turned them into smart connected devices. Meaning, homeowners can not only access them remotely on their phone, tablet, or computer, but also that they’re more than just lock or a light, they have integrated functions.\nThe Maximus Smart Security Light goes beyond being just an aesthetic, decorative light. It's a smart light, which means that the light can be controlled remotely, set on a timer, and be motion-activated. What makes this light unique from other lights is its built-in security system.\nThe built-in HD camera starts recording when it detects motion. Once it detects someone the owner receives a notification on their phone or tablet through their app so they’re always able to keep an eye on their home. They can then interact and talk with the person and determine whether they’re friend or foe.\nThere’s even the option of prerecording a message to play when someone approaches the door. The Maximus comes in four different designs with more coming soon, including a companion light. The Maximus light can be purchased at homedepot.com for $199.\nTo learn more, visit http://www.homedepot.com today.\nAbout NewsWatch\nNewsWatch is a weekly 30-minute consumer oriented television show that airs on the Discovery Channel and ION Network.
