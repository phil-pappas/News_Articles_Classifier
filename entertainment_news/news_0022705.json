Marijuana investment and wholesale cultivation companies have the fewest women in executive roles, at 28 and 33 percent, respectively.\nMarijuana Business Daily based its findings on answers from 632 cannabis professionals and executives who responded to an online survey.\nDina Rollman, co-founder of Illinois Women in Cannabis, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting women's roles in the industry, wrote in an email that she was encouraged by the survey but believes the numbers would be \"drastically lower\" in Illinois.\n\"Through my various roles within the Illinois industry, I have observed a dearth of women in C-suite roles,\" said Rollman, who is a founding member of the Illinois Cannabis Bar Association, a board member of the Illinois Cannabis Industry Association and Chief Compliance Officer for GTI-Clinic Illinois Holdings, which has two cultivation licenses and one dispensary.\nShe sees great potential for female executives in cannabis because it is \"too new to have a glass ceiling,\" with no institutional barriers to keep women from rising to the top.\n\"Illinois has no shortage of female accountants, attorneys, insurance experts, finance executives, commercial bankers and other professionals to fill executive-level positions at medical cannabis companies,\" she said. \"I hope that as the industry develops in Illinois, we see women holding 50 percent, if not more, of the leadership roles.\"\naelejalderuiz@tribpub.com\nTwitter @alexiaer\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d6510/turbine/ct-women-in-marijuana-1014-biz-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:26:56.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
