Here are the favorites By Jim Harrington Posted: 10/08/2015 11:40:44 AM PDT Updated: 10/08/2015 04:22:10 PM PDT There have been some incredibly safe bets to make it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in recent years. Notably, Nirvana (2014) and Green Day (2015) were absolute shoe-ins in their first years of eligibility. \nYet, that's not the case this time around. The most recent batch of nominees for the Rock Hall — which was made public on Thursday — is pretty much a crapshoot. You could make a case for any of the artists to make it in, but all of their resumes would appear to have some holes — at least in the eyes of the 600 Hall of Fame voters.

(Chris Pizzello/AP) \nThe fact that none of the 15 nominees are in their first year of eligibility seems to underscore a lack of confidence in whether these acts truly deserve to be enshrined alongside Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Aretha Franklin, Public Enemy and all the other immortals in the Rock Hall in Cleveland. (In order to be eligible, an act must have released its first single or album 25 years before nomination.) \nStill, the Hall will need to enshrine some artists — probably five or six — when the induction ceremony is held in New York in April. \nHere are five acts that have a strong shot at making it into the Rock Hall's Class of 2016. We'll start with the most likely inductees and work our way down. \nJanet Jackson Advertisement \nThe good people of \"Rhythm Nation\" should have reason to celebrate next year, since their favorite R&B-pop star appears to be the most likely to succeed in this Rock Hall race. She certainly boasts an impressive track record, having reportedly sold over 100 million albums worldwide and chalked up an amazing number of Top 10 singles. Plus, it doesn't hurt her chances that her latest record, \"Unbreakable,\" has garnered strong reviews. Yet, one has to worry why it's taken this long for Ms. Jackson — who has been eligible for induction since 2007 — to land her first-ever nomination. \nN.W.A. \nIt's time for the madness to stop. Voters have passed over N.W.A. — one of the most influential acts in popular music history — in its first three years of eligibility, when, really, the group should have been a slam-dunk selection in Year One (2013). It really makes one wonder if voters have paid any attention to this little thing called hip-hop over the last 30 years. (It's pretty great, they should check it out.) Let's hope that the critically acclaimed music biopic \"Straight Outta Compton\" will provide the push it finally takes to get Dre, Cube and crew into the Hall. \nSteve Miller \nIt's sheer nonsense that the Bay Area rock legend has been eligible since the early '90s and still hasn't made it into the Rock Hall. What's even more shocking is that this is the first time the multiplatinum rocker has even been nominated. Sure, he might not be a first ballot Hall of Famer, but his music has certainly stood the test of time, as it's been passed down from one generation to the next. I like his chances in 2016, especially given a less-than-stellar classic-rock field. \nLos Lobos \nThey started out as a self-proclaimed \"Just Another Band From East L.A.,\" but they appear to be headed to the Hall of Fame. It's really just a matter of time for this influential — and excellent — act, which has been eligible for induction since 2003. \nNine Inch Nails \nIt's pretty easy to make a case that Trent Reznor and crew actually deserved to be inducted a few months back, in their first year of eligibility. Nine Inch Nails' impact on music over the last 25-plus years has been undeniable — and it shows no sign of lessening in the years to come. Plus, aren't you just dying to hear the all-star jam on \"Closer.\" Here's hoping Paul Shaffer leads it! \nFollow Jim Harrington at twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:49:24.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
