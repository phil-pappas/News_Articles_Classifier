(AP) â€” Police say an actor known for his role in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been arrested in upstate New York after a fight with a girlfriend.\nSaratoga Spring Police Lt. Bob Jillson says Nicholas Brendon, who played Xander Harris in the show, faces charges of felony third-degree robbery, misdemeanor obstruction of breathing and two criminal mischief counts.\nJillson says the woman told officers called to a downtown hotel around 11 p.m. Wednesday that she had gone to return property to Brendon and intended to leave. Jillson says Brendon objected, took her car keys and cell phone and started choking her.\nBrendon was arrested nearby. Authorities say they don't know if he has a lawyer. He was released from jail Thursday after posting a $20,000 bond.\nThe arrest is the latest in a string for the 44-year-old Sherman Oaks resident over the past year.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
