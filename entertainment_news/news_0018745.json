The only other new entry in the top 10 this week was actress and country singer Jana Kramer’s “Thirty-One,” at No. 10. \n(This version of the story corrects headline to say The Game debuts at No. 2, last paragraph to say “at No. 10” instead of “the bottom of the group.”) \n(Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Richard Chang )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:07:31.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
