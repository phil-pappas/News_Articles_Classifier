The former Celebrity Big Brother housemate was 16 when she married actor Doug, then 50, in Las Vegas, after meeting him via an online acting workshop he had been running.Because of her age, she needed parental consent. \n© Instagram / @courtneystodden Now, five years later, she wants to put their recent rocky patch behind her and renew their vows – and as she's now an adult, she can plan them herself. She told Us Weekly : \"I can finally [plan] it myself, you know, because I was 16 and I had to have it signed [by my parents], so I think finally not having any parents involved and just doing it myself is going to be great. I want to do a big thing, because, you know, our first time around we married in Las Vegas next to a Chevron — it was not that glamorous! So I really want to play it up. I want to do the whole Cinderella thing.\"Courtney was 16 years old when she signed up for an acting course Doug was running online. They began exchanging emails which turned flirty. Doug claims he thought she was around 21 judging by her pictures. When she revealed she was 16, he turned to her parents, Krista and Alex, to request their permission to continue their email romance.He told ABC News : \"I said, Krista, I don't know if you know this or not, but your daughter and I are falling in love…. If you and Alex have any misgivings whatsoever about this … I will respect you, and Courtney will respect you. And we will step back. Krista said, 'I can feel my daughter's love for you. I can feel it inside of my heart and I can feel your love for her. So rest assured: Me and Alex, we have absolutely no problem with you two falling in love.'\" \n© JB Lacroix/WireImage \n© Instagram / @courtneystodden Apparently it was Krista who brought up marriage first, pointing out in some US states a 16-year-old could marriage with parental permission, which is what happened.Courtney and Doug went through a rock patch two years ago: after Courtney's appearance on CBB in 2013 , they legally separated but remained close friends. She told us at the time: \"What's been great about our separation, though, is that we remain close friends and desire nothing but the very best for each other. I'm so proud of that.\"\"We, honestly, are the best of friends now. I can talk to him about anything and everything. I'm eternally grateful for meeting him and I have zero regrets.\"But a year later, the romance was back on, with the couple announcing a re-engagement in August 2014. Krista told Fox 411 at the time: \"Courtney realised just how much love she really had for Doug. They really love each other and wanted to be together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:55:47.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
