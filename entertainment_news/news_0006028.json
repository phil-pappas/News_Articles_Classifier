The company's flagship nightclub, Hakkasan at the MGM Grand, is 80,000 square feet. \nThe new club is designed by The Rockwell Group, headed by David Rockwell, a firm with work on display at several places on the Strip, including The Cosmopolitan and its Marquee club. It will be a multi-level venue with a mezzanine and five \"unique and secluded suites above the dance floor, each with its own exclusive entry,\" according to today's announcement. \nIt also promises \"a first-of-its-kind production wall featuring dual-sided LED video screens and special effects lighting, also allowing for 360-degree movement.\" \nHaze was operated by The Light Group and closed almost a year ago, in the wake of pimping and prostitution allegations. The club was the origin of a confrontation that led to the 2013 shooting of Kenny \"Clutch\" Cherry on the Strip and the death of a taxi driver and passenger struck by Cherry's vehicle. \nRead more from Mike Weatherford at reviewjournal.com.
