He's returning in an innocent avatar as Prem - an onscreen name he has taken on several times in the past. And the first look has already sent a message that the film will be all about love, fantasy and romance. \nSRK and Salman are known for their bittersweet bond off-screen, but on the big screen, they have shared the frame in films like \"Karan Arjun\", \"Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam\" and \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\". \nOver some time now, it seems they are writing a new chapter of healthy competition in Bollywood as Shah Rukh unveiled the first look of “Bajrangi Bhaijaan”, and Salman has maintained that there will be 'double dhamal' with his \"Sultan\" and Shah Rukh's \"Raees\" releasing on Eid in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:17:07.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
