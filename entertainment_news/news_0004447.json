Ash and four other college students go to a cabin, which, by now is clearly never going to be on our vacation destination list. Thanks to a tape recording of incantations from the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Book of the Dead, evil demons and spirits descend upon them, as they do. The film became a hit, in part for its innovative camerawork, extreme gory mayhem (so much dismemberment and karo syrup fake blood!) and a few surprising black comedy elements. [...] check out the trailer, in which you can see a montage of Ash arming up with a chainsaw: From here on out, the franchise really hits its stride when it comes to its ramped-up humor and making Ash a hero who is unfazed by the inane horror around him. Returning hallmarks included: the cabin setting; the frantic camerawork; the grimoire, now called the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis; chainsaw action and the evil demonic spirit zombies hereafter known as Deadites. Later, his now-possessed hand tries to kill him in this excellent sequence that pushes Ash to take extreme measures: Ash becomes a low-tech cyborg In a sequence reminiscent of Ash arming up in the original film, the chainsaw is installed where his possessed hand once was. S-Mart employee of the millennium Since this is a time-travel tale, the film plays up all the anachronisms that Ash's presence brings in 1300 A.D. Part of that is giving him a backstory, one of a very loyal employee of S-Mart who knows how to wield a shotgun, or a \"boomstick,\" to the unwashed Medieval folks. Ash vs. lots of Evil Ash Ash sure loves to beat himself up in this series, and in Army of Darkness, he first becomes victim to multiple tiny versions of himself:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:43:30.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
