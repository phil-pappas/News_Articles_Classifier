The program will be held at the Library on Thursday, October 15, 2015 , 4:00-6:00 p.m.   John Hope Bryant, entrepreneur, businessman, thought leader, and philanthropist, will be the keynote speaker.  Bryant is founder, chairman, and CEO of Operation HOPE, a financial literary program for the empowerment of youth, the working poor, the underserved, and the struggling middle class.  His award winning book, How the Poor Can Save Capitalism: Rebuilding the Path to the Middle Class will be available for purchase and autograph. The event is free and open to the public. Mr. Bryant's address on \"The Power of a Unifying Voice\" will speak to how economic empowerment strengthens the individual and the community and is a key element in the quest for equality and justice.  \"We're looking forward to hearing from Mr. Bryant about ways to sustain the middle class and how those methods are influenced by economics and race.  His address will connect the dots between activism, hope and community achievement,\" said Loretta Parham , CEO and director of the AUC Woodruff Library.  \nThis event is also the official opening of the exhibit, Start Something: Activism and The Atlanta Student Movement that will be on display in the Library October 15, 2015 – March 31, 2016 . \nThe exhibit documents how students from Atlanta University, Clark College (now Clark Atlanta University ), The Interdenominational Theological Center , Morehouse College , Morris Brown College , and Spelman College strategized and worked together to stage protests, actions now known as the Atlanta Student Movement. The students organized nonviolent marches, sit-ins, picket lines, and boycotts that forced Atlanta merchants and government officials to desegregate stores and public facilities.  \nVisit www.auctr.edu for event directions and parking information. \nAbout the Atlanta University Center (AUC) Robert W.
