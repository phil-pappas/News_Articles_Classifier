The title is the second single off their upcoming studio album \"Made in the A.M\". Shot entirely in black and white, the video captures the boys inside Intercontinental hotel in New York City which has the iconic Times Square as the view. It captures a day full of activities for One Direction. They meet fans and press in the morning, trash the hotel rooms in the afternoon, and have a tattoo done at night. \"Perfect\" is a song written by Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson with Bunetta, Shatkin, Jacob Kasher, John Ryan and Maureen Anne McDonald. It was rumored that the track is about Styles' former girlfriend Taylor Swift . Neither Styles nor Swift has commented at it but she reportedly has no problem about it. \"Made in the A.M.\" will be released on Friday, November 13, the same day Justin Bieber drops his \" Purpose \" album. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:41:07.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
