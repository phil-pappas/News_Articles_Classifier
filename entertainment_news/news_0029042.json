Dick Blume/The Post Standard The interior of the Landmark Theatre in downtown Syracuse (Dick Blume/The Post Standard) It's not scary unless you're prone to being scare \nThe Landmark Theatre is haunted. Fortunately for us, the spirits that live there are friendly. \nOn Friday, Oct. 23 and Saturday, Oct. 24, the theater will open its doors for a pair of \"haunted tours\" of the 86-year-old theater. Each night, the tour will be followed by a lobby party with music, food, drinks and costumes. \nGhosts are more than welcome to join. \nLeading the tour each night is medium-slash-psychic-slash-ghost-hunter Maggie, who goes by \"The Violet Nile.\" Maggie is empathic, clairvoyant, sentient and a bit telepathic. Basically, that means she can feel spirits. She can hear their voices. She can even smell them, she said. Tim Mahar of Baldwinsville sits down for a rest during the Krock Zombie Ball, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2013 at the Landmark Theater. Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse. She first took a handful of Landmark employees along on a \"hunt\" about a year ago. The theater has piqued her interest since she moved here 13 years ago, she said. She could feel energy each time she drove by. So she finally asked if she could come poke around. \nPrior to entering the theater, she didn't research any of the its history. She didn't want the rumors and legends to cloud her judgment. After all, she said, there are a lot of phonies out there. \nMaggie said she first encountered a spirit named Clarissa, and found scores of \"energies\" throughout the theater. None were malevolent, however. She described the haunting of the theater as a \"family-type feeling.\" \n\"Back in the day people stayed there,\" she said. \"They were suffering hard times and they lived there. The employees were very close. A few times the theater was almost shut down and they came together so they wouldn't lose it.\" \nMaggie has been doing public ghost hunts and tours for about five years. She's vanquished \"negative\" spirits and even once dealt with a demonic possession in Chittenango, she said. There, a woman had been possessed by an evil spirit. \n\"There was a deep growl,\" Maggie said. \"Her eyes changed color. They changed shape. I knew it was the energy of a demon that was there. They attach themselves then suck the life out of you.\" \nAs for the Landmark, there's nothing so nasty, she said. She advises people to be very aware of their body when on the tour and to bring a camera. The more cameras, the more likely someone is to capture a spirit on film (or, more likely, a phone). \n\"It's not scary unless you're prone to being scared,\" Maggie said. \"You can actually go there, take some pictures and experience for yourself the history that's there.\" \nEach tour will have room for 20-30 people, said Landmark manager Danielle Bianco. Tours start at 7 p.m. If the tour sells out, the theater will add an earlier show. \nBoth nights, a Halloween-themed party will follow the tour. \nFollowing Friday's tour, the theater will host the Rock & Roll Freak Show featuring Pale Green Stars, Hobo Graffiti, Amerikan Primitive, Spring Street Band and The Stacy White Suite. \nSaturday's tour culminates with the K-Rock Zombie Ball, including psychics, palm readers, costume contests, a \"blood carpet\" photo opportunity, a zombie movie and DJs. \nTickets for the Freak Show, the Zombie Ball and the haunted tour are $10 apiece, sold individually via Ticketmaster.com or at the Landmark Theatre box office. \nIf you go: \nWhen: Friday, Oct. 23 and Saturday, Oct. 24, 7 p.m. Where: Landmark Theatre, 362 S.
