Ted Cruz, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Front-runner Donald Trump didn't attend. \nPrestonwood Pastor Jack Graham said all of the major candidates from both parties were invited to attend, but only Republicans accepted. Graham identified the 7,000 people in attendance as evangelical \"Christians who believe the Bible.\" \nThe candidates answered questions about their personal faith and how they would apply it to public policy. \nSound: \n%@AP Links \n219-a-13-(Dr. Ben Carson, Republican presidential candidate, at presidential candidates forum)-\"call it schizophrenia (applause fades)\"-GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson says recognition of God is on U.S. currency and is essential to America's heritage.
