Witnesses perform different functions on two consecutive evenings, which includes appearing on-camera on one of the nights. The process lasts approximately 2.5 hours, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. , each night.\nWitnesses work with two Pennsylvania Lottery drawing officials, who will directly perform all drawing tasks, and two independent Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), who will monitor all tasks to ensure that all procedures are properly performed and security standards are met.\nOver the two nights, witnesses directly participate in the selection of the drawing machines and ball sets used for drawings, observe all pre-drawing and post-drawing tests and appear on-camera during the live televised drawing show.\nDrawings take place at the studios of WITF-TV in Harrisburg . Volunteers are responsible for their own transportation and, if necessary, lodging. Scheduling is usually conducted a month or more in advance.\n\"Our witnesses tell us that they enjoy being part of the process and are greatly impressed with the degree of careful work that goes into making sure drawings are conducted fairly and with integrity,\" Svitko added.\nVisit www.palottery.com and look under \"About Us\" and \"Become a PA Lottery Drawing Show Witness\" to find an email address and phone number to learn more about the opportunity.\nThe 6:59 p.m. drawing show is carried by the following television stations: WJET, Erie ; WGAL, Lancaster ; WTAJ, Altoona ; WNEP, Scranton ; WTXF, Philadelphia ; and WPXI, Pittsburgh .\nThe evening drawing includes all PICK games and Cash 5, seven nights a week.
