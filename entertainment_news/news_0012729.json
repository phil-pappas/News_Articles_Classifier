Staff writers news.com.au Rove to replace Dan and Maz on the radio? Staff writers news.com.au Rove is no stranger to radio and has hosted quite a few shows on air before. \nRUMOURS are rife that Rove McManus will return to Australia next year to host a breakfast radio show. \nAccording to The Australian , the 41-year-old comedian is set to replace Dan Debuf and Maz Compton as the host of the Hit 104.1 2Day FM breakfast show in Sydney. \nThe station has been struggling in the ratings ever since The Kyle and Jackie O Show defected to KIIS FM at the end of 2013 and took most of their audience with them. \nThey were replaced by Jules Lund, Merrick Watts and Sophie Monk who only lasted one year on air before The Dan & Maz Show was given the breakfast slot in January 2015. If the rumours are true, what will happen to Dan and Maz? \nBut they haven’t been able to make an impression on the Sydney market either, with a disappointing 3.1 per cent audience share in the latest FM radio ratings compared to WSFM’s Jonesy and Amanda who are in front with 8.5 per cent and Kyle and Jackie O not far behind with 8.3 per cent. \nAccording to The Australian , the deal with Rove is understood to have been arranged by Southern Cross Austereo’s new CEO, Grant Blackley, who was the Network Ten CEO when Rove’s talk show was on TV.
