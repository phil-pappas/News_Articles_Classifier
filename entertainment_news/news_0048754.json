(Photo: Archie Comics)\n22 CONNECT 44 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Jughead Jones is more than just a guy who really likes hamburgers — though you can’t sleep on that kid’s appetite.\nArchie Andrews recently received a modern makeover with writer Mark Waid and artist Fiona Staples' Archie comic book. And his longtime best friend stars in the new Archie Comics series Jughead launching on Wednesday, courtesy of writer Chip Zdarsky ( Sex Criminals, Howard the Duck ) and artist Erica Henderson ( The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl ).\nThe title spotlights Archie's constantly hungry pal, Jughead’s mercurial look on life and the occasional conflicts that arise — and they start right in the first issue, when a new principal replacing Mr. Weatherbee downgrades the cafeteria food.\nSuffice it to say, that doesn’t fly in all corners of Riverdale High.\nUSA TODAY\n'Archie' landscape gets a 'juicy' reboot\nUSA TODAY talks with Zdarsky and Henderson about their favorite Archie characters, Jughead’s biggest rival and the truth about that hat of his.\nAs you started working on the series, how much did you look at Jughead’s past?\nZdarsky: I definitely went back and read a lot of the older stuff, but really I've been taking my cue from what Mark and Fiona have been doing with the main Archie series. It sounds cliche to say they've created fresh new takes on everyone while staying true to the characters, but it's true. It's true .\nHenderson: I looked more at the new versions because I'm pretty intimately familiar with earlier iterations of the characters. Most of the research I did involved looking at teen fashions from the past couple of years. One of my favorite things about reading the Archie digests as a kid was how cool everyone's clothes looked — especially Betty and Veronica.\nWe get introduced to his new principal nemesis in the first issue. How much will he be a thorn in Jughead’s side?\nZdarsky: Oh, a total thorn. The main Archie series focuses a lot on the interpersonal teen dynamics, so with Jughead I wanted to focus on a situation a bit more by introducing a new system at Riverdale High. Principal Stanger is a great foil because he's smart and an over-the-top stickler for rules and the hierarchal system. He demands respect, but that's not Jughead's thing, man. The best way to get to the heart of Jughead is to throw obstacles at him and see what he does.\nNot only does he like to eat but Jughead loves video games and his canine friend Hot Dog. (Photo: Archie Comics)\nWhat’s the trickiest thing about taking a character who has mainly been known as a sidekick and making him the lead of his own series?\nZdarsky : I suppose just oversaturation? It's not like he's in danger of being Wolverined anytime soon, but you want him to still feel special. Even as a lead though, you still have the Archie supporting cast, so we're not denied any of the players that make the main Archie comic work. Look, between you and me? If this doesn’t work I’m just going to call the series Archie 2 and push Jughead to second banana.\nHenderson: Jughead has always been No. 1 in my book. He's been my favorite since I was a kid, so no issues there.\nWho’s thus far been your favorite supporting player?\nZdarsky: I love Betty! She feels like Jughead's opposite in a lot of ways. She works hard, is idealistic and selfless. And yet they both find common ground as third wheels when Archie and Veronica are on again. It’s a good dynamic to play with.\nHenderson: Ahh, Chip! I was going to say that. Since this is a Jughead book I'm going to take Hot Dog then, his best friend and loyal canine companion. He's basically just a second Jughead in dog form — he's smart (smarter than your average dog), loves food (like your average dog) and is pretty lazy. Honestly, I just want the excuse to draw more cute dogs.\nUSA TODAY\nArchie musical is in the works\nThere’s a little flight of fantasy in the middle of the first issue. Are those diversions that venture past reality going to be a regular attraction?\nZdarsky: Yeah, at least for the first arc. I wanted to use the old \"alternate universe\" Archie stories in some way, and making them Jughead's fantasies and dreams seemed like the best way to do that without pulling away too much from the more grounded feeling that Mark and Fiona are doing in Archie . We’ll be riffing on the old Superteens , riffing on the ‘90s Time Police , stuff like that.\nHenderson: A lot of Archie comics in the past have had the gang in fantasy situations and I'm glad we get to play with those in a comic that takes place in \"real life.\" It's a really fun nod to decades of Archie history.\nJughead's appetite is as healthy as ever in his new comic book. (Photo: Archie Comics)\nAre we finally going to learn what’s up with his hat?\nZdarsky: The hat is just his thing, man. Completely uncool yet somehow weirdly cool in its uniqueness and the fact that Jughead doesn't care what you think of it.\nHenderson: Oh, time for my weird collection of facts to come in handy. The hat is a whoopee cap. It was popular in the early to mid 20th century. It's made by trimming a fedora. In its earliest incarnation, it signified that the wearer was a mechanic, so maybe in his first appearance it was to show that he was a blue-collar guy. Think Goober Pyle from The Andy Griffith Show .\nThere’s food, friendship and video gaming in the first issue. What other passions of Jughead’s will come to light?\nZdarsky: We're going to explore his philosophies of life in the face of a rule-enforcing new principal. Jughead likes to bend the rules to the point where he can get away with stuff and not get caught.\nHenderson: We also get to see hints of Jughead's longstanding rivalry with Reggie, which I love.\nSo far what’s been the most surprising thing about tackling Jughead?\nHenderson: Just the fact that I'm doing it? When I first got the e-mail asking me about it, no joke, I reread it for about five minutes over and over again because it just wasn't processing in my brain. I wasn't kidding before when I said that Jughead is my favorite character from Archie. I'm working on another book at the same time and so I asked who was writing because I felt like it would be crazy to tackle two at once. When they told me Chip was involved, that was it. I was 100% in.\nZdarsky: How ingrained all the characters are in me! It's so easy to find their voice cause they've been in my head all my life. It’s such a kick to sit down and write things like “Jughead gleefully eats a burger” and have that be official. It’s a good life, I’m excited about this, and I hope it comes through in the comic.\n22 CONNECT 44 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1Rk5iQg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1Rk5iQg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793458419385897-Jughead-1RegCvr.jpg", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/283435319/content?start_page=1&view_mode=slideshow&access_key=key-vVymWSzc2Cz5K9A1pDEp&show_recommendations=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c4253c0e453aea62061a50dc723031b04980da1f/c=0-1783-2493-3658&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793458319233255-Jughead-1Hackvar.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a1237f16e697e7806f68fbb024a62526190a2ca/c=59-82-2443-1875&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793463369141626-Jughead2015-01-3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb0e74ce74a6f17dee6c35e3a6bd0c9c7330e6e7/r=260x400/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793458419385897-Jughead-1RegCvr.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rk5iQg&text=%27Jughead%27%20puts%20focus%20on%20Archie%27s%20quirky%20pal&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rk5iQg&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2dddd8a077192ded207ba45fd6b4f4d6c45aaa1/c=0-1055-1994-2182&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/06/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635711479955699266-Archie2015-01-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9a95f7bd4f460e4eac27ed1015e5836b46c2e1b6/c=0-50-1620-1670/local/-/media/2015/07/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635732677044414937-XXX-B-ARCHIE-16-CCI-1470505.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae2e9905aa994b97fe50a3b8cda29b90be755e26/c=0-18-2493-3343&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793458419385897-Jughead-1RegCvr.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:54:12.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
