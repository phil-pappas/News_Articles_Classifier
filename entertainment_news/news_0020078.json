On Saturday, the Aerosmith frontman sent a ‘cease and desist’ letter to the Republican presidential candidate, demanding that he stop using the band’s song at campaign events, reports hollywoodreporter.com. The letter was actually the second time Trump has been warned about using the song . The former “The Apprentice” host was first told to not use the song after an event in Mobile, Alabama on August 21. “‘Trump for President’ does not have our client’s permission to use ‘Dream on’ or any of our client’s other music in connection with the Campaign because it gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump’s presidential bid,” the letter read. “We are unaware of any public performance licence granting ‘Trump for President’ the right to perform ‘Dream On’ in connection with the Campaign . If ‘Trump for President’ has any such licence, please forward it to our attention immediately.” Trump was given 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of the letter . “If ‘Trump for President’ does not comply with our demands, our client will be forced to pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies which our client may have against you,” the legal warning added.
