Just fight it. Fight, fight.' That's all,\" said the 32-year-old Daniel Artest, who met Odom as a 6-year-old growing up in New York through his older brother Ron Artest (now the Los Angeles Lakers'Metta World Peace). \"I've been reading the news, and stuff like that online, and that whole situation, like how he was found and what not, but I don't care man. I don't care. I just want you to come home, man. Keep fighting. Just come home. We're here. We love you.\" \nHow did this all happen so fast, from Odom as a two-time champion, top-tier NBA talent and beloved teammate just four years ago to a post-Khloe Kardashian free fall that led him to a Nevada brothel where he was found unresponsive and rushed to a hospital where he remains Wednesday? \nEven through all the negative headlines about DUIs and drug problems and the daily chronicling of his now-broken marriage with Kardashian, the reality television star, Odom inspired an affection that never waned. NBA players flooded Twitter with their support when the news of his condition first broke. According to a report from Mark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News, several members of the Los Angeles Lakers, including friend and former teammate Kobe Bryant, visited him at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas after a preseason game against the Sacramento Kings that was played in Las Vegas. \nRELATED: Lamar Odom hospitalized after being found unresponsive in Nevada brothel \n\"Man, he's just real,\" said Daniel, who lives in New York with his family but is currently visiting his brother in Los Angeles. \"Just that one word. He's real. It's always been real, always been love. Family, man. Always like a brother. \n\"I don't know what's been going on the past couple of years, but it just hurts so bad that he's going through that. It hurts so bad. I don't care what he's done, or whatever they say in the media…it's hard. He's like how much Ron means to me as a brother – he's up there. I don't have many people I can say that about, you know?\" \nTheir shared New York roots are well-chronicled, as Odom was the Queens kid and Ron Artest the Queensbridge native who played together on AAU teams. Daniel would attend all their games, and over time he became part of their gritty group. \n\"I had the pleasure of playing against him at a basketball tournament in Queensbridge (N.Y.) a couple years back when I was in high school, and (their relationship) grew from there,\" he said. \"He comes by the house, and it grew from there. At first, it was, 'Oh, that's Ron's friend,' and then it goes deeper than that.\" \nBut the part that Daniel can't reconcile is this image of Odom as a wandering soul. He ran into him not too long ago in Los Angeles, in fact, and said he hardly looked like a desperate man. \n\"Whatever they're saying, you see him and it doesn't look like he's going through anything,\" Daniel said. \"That's why I say I don't believe it (regarding the drug use), you know? I grew up in an area where when people would say stuff, like 'Somebody is doing this' or 'Somebody is doing that,' and I see it. Where I come from I can physically see it, and you know that this person is out of it. But that is not the case with this man. That's why it's so hard to believe.\" \nEspecially considering what he was told seven months ago. Despite the fact that Odom hadn't played in an NBA game since May 3, 2013, there were rumblings of another comeback that never came to pass. Daniel, a basketball talent in his own right who also labels himself \"an aspiring personal trainer\" on his Twitter page, had discussed the possibility of training Odom with his brother back in March. \n\"We talked about it once or twice,\" Daniel said. \"I was all up for it, but it never came through.\" \nSeven months later, Odom's story is much bigger than basketball again. \n\"I just hope that God has mercy,'\" Daniel said. \"Just fight, man. Just fight.\"  //on.whas11.com/1RI6P2W TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:14:46.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
