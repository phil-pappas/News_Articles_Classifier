Allred represents Judy Huth, who claims Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him in the 1970s.\nAllred says Huth will be deposed on Thursday. She says a California judge will decide in December if the testimony will be made public.\nLawyers for the 78-year-old Cosby say Huth's lawsuit is frivolous and that Huth's former attorney attempted to extort Cosby.\nCosby also faces two other cases: a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who claim he abused them decades ago and a suit filed Tuesday by a model who alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her.\nSociety & Culture Crime & Justice Bill Cosby Gloria Allred", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:28:01.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
