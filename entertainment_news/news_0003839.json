Moser Contact Reporter Marvel Universe Live at Allentown's PPL Center makes comic book characters come to life \nWhen Cody Evans-Gan is in the midst of his role as The Incredible Hulk in the live-action arena production “Marvel Universe Live!,” it’s hard for him to hear what’s going on. \nThat’s because he’s covered with the thick animatronic costume of the giant green, super-muscular superhero and concentrating on walking on stilts beneath all the gear. \nBut Evans-Gan says he still can hear the reaction of the crowd when he appears at a pivotal moment in the show. \n“It’s like Beatlemania,” he says with a laugh. “Beatlemania or Aerosmith coming back on tour. They go nuts. It’s also like the grandeur of him coming out and he’s huge. … We played in a couple of cities where it was just thunderous, nonstop.” \nThat larger-than-life response to a larger-than-life character is pretty representative of “Marvel Universe Live!,” which opens a four-day, seven-show run at Allentown’s PPL Center at 7 p.m. Oct. 15.

They include heroes Spider-Man and the Avengers (Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow), Black Cat, Captain America, Cyclops, Falcon and Hawkeye, and villains Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Red Skull, Madame Hydra and Electro. \nJust as impressive, say promoters and performers, is the show around those characters — with martial arts, controlled car chases, motorcycle stunts, high-speed flying, explosions and pyrotechnics, including a full-body burn. \nThe show also uses “movie-quality” technology, according to show producer Feld Entertainment. Projected motion graphics create an “immersive experience” that turns the arena into different locations, making the audience feel like it’s flying through New York, for example. \nPhoto Gallery -- The cast of Marvel Universe LIVE! works with Children from the Pediatric Cancer Foundation of the Lehigh Valley at the PPL Center in Allentown. (MICHAEL KUBEL \\ THE MORNING CALL) \n“This whole show in general is so epic that the crowds pretty much go wild,” says Amani Velma, who plays Storm, a character associated with the X-Men who can control the weather. “In general, the crowds are kind of crazy, and the kids are just losing their minds over seeing all these superheroes in real life.” \nPreparing to save the world \nThe popularity of comic superheroes has soared in recent years with movie franchises such as “The Avengers” and “Iron Man.” But Feld Entertainment spokesman Scott R. Handfinger says it was important to make the arena show different, yet still epic. \nThe first live production of the Marvel brand, the show was two years in development. It included intense training for the 55-person cast, which includes not only traditional actors, but former X Games athletes. \nLouise Forsley, an X Games silver medalist at Endurocross and a seven-time North American Women’s Trials Champion, plays Black Widow, who is among several characters who ride motorcycles during the show. \n“We spent three months just training for fighting [and] martial arts,” Forsley says. “I spent a lot of classes on learning how to be more feminine; walking more like a lady, the way the Black Widow would walk around, striking the Black Widow pose.” \nVelma says, “A lot of what we focused on in training was getting on the same page as far as physical storytelling, as far as different fight styles for different characters, how to tell the impact of a certain punch versus another. …‘This is, like, the Spidey pose. This is how you hold your hand. This is how you move your head.’” \nThat was true even for Evans-Gan inside the Hulk. “It’s basically a tank of a costume,” he says. “So there’s no margin of error when you’re out there. So there’s a combination of balancing and also trying to bring the actual creature The Hulk to life. It’s just pretty difficult. \n“One of the big things I do is a lot of animation with the arms, like the Hulk does in some of the movies, and just kind of the underlying anger that he has. \n“So there’s things like you breathe hard, and it makes the costume look like he’s breathing up and down. There’s a couple things where he smashes or he swats at some of the bad guys. So that alone, that physicality alone, takes a lot out of you.” \nEvans-Gan is a classically trained actor with a Shakespearean background. “There are certain things you can bring from your acting background, some physicality in movements — not so much from Shakespeare,” he says with a laugh. \n“I think the one thing I can use from my training in Shakespeare in this show is the similar focus you need to have. When you do Shakespeare, when you see it especially on stage, everybody’s very focused on what they’re doing ­— very myopic about how they’re executing lines and things like that. I think that’s what carried over into the Hulk thing.” \nForsley says she requires concentration of a different sort for her motorcycle stunts. \n“My character has two pretty cool entrances,” she says. “The first one, it’s a fight she’s doing … . And the second one is me, Captain America and Falcon, we ride in on motorcycles and we pretty much just do an awesome trick to our spot where we’re gonna stop. I do a 180 [degree] nose wheelie, and then land — which, for somebody that’s not really expecting it, it’s a very cool maneuver. \n“I feel like my riding, that’s what makes my part impressive. I’m not a fighter or a strong gymnast. I don’t really have the skills that some of the other roles without bikes have. So I always think to myself that I need to make the riding look as impressive as possible, just so I can express The Black Widow that way. I think on a motorcycle, it’s very impressive.” \nDifferent, but the same \n“Marvel Universe Live!” has other elements that make it unique. \nIt has an original storyline, framed around the battle over the Cosmic Cube, a source of massive power and one of the most feared and coveted treasures in the Marvel Universe. In the story, it has been shattered to pieces by Thor to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. \nWith the pieces scattered across the globe, Thor’s villainous brother Loki devises a scheme to clone its powers — a threat that could obliterate the universe. Marvel’s superheroes band together and trek across the globe, fighting the villains, to retrieve the Cosmic Cube fragments and unite them. \nThe show also assembles heroes who have never before worked together in any Marvel book or show, and has some heroes fighting villains they’ve never fought before, promoters say. \nThere’s even an element of audience participation. At one point, audience members use devices to empower some superheroes. \nThe show was designed for all ages, and to appeal to the entire family. That means the show has some strong female characters to help it appeal to girls and women. \n“Storm is a pretty big role model for a lot of little girls,” Velma says. “So you’ll see a lot of little kids running down the aisle at the end of the show. … Big cheers happen for Spider-Man and Iron Man at the beginning, ’cause they’re the first superheroes who are going off to save the day, but Storm kid of gets her big moment late in the show.” \nForsley says the show has other strong female characters, such as herself and Captain Marvel, who at one point flies high speed around the arena. \nEven The Hulk gets star treatment, Evans-Gan says. “I think kids tend to find him as this big, lovable guy in some ways, even though he’s kind of always angry. So the kids go absolutely insane. The parents actually go insane, too.” \nPromoters know that recent movies have made superheroes popular, so expect many elements of those movies to show up. \n“It a good show, it’s a very linear story, and it’s something that appeals to both adults and kids will love it,” Evans-Gan says. “It’s a nice adventure that takes pieces from the movies right now and puts it on stage. So all around, it kind of appeals to everyone.” \nVelma puts it more succinctly: “Basically anything you expect to see in a Marvel movie, you get to see live in front of you.” \n‘MARVEL UNIVERSE LIVE,’ 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday Oct. 15 and 16; 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. SaturdayOct. 17; and 1 and 5 p.m. Oct. 18 Sunday, PPL Center, 701 Hamilton St., Allentown.
