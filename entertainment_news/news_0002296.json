Julie Noce reports.   \nIt was a 'celebration' for disco-funk band Kool & the Gang as they were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Known for hits like \"Jungle Boogie\", \"Ladies Night\", \"Celebration\" and \"Hollywood Swinging\", the band has gone through various line-ups since forming in the 1960's. Four of the original band members posed for pictures and spoke to the crowd about receiving the honour. (SOUNDBITE) (English) SINGER, ROBERT \"KOOL\" BELL, SAYING: \"I'm not going to take up too much of your time. Again, we'd like to say we love you, we love our fans, we thank you for the support and let's keep Hollywood swinging.\" (SOUNDBITE) (English) DENNIS \"DT\" THOMAS, SAYING: \"We love California, we love the world. We would love the world at large because there's so much love in this world and we're very blessed that our music touches people's hearts and their minds and keeps you dancing and tries to keep you happy on this planet.\" Kool & the Gang have sold over 70 million albums worldwide since they released their self-titled album back in 1969. The star is the 2,560th to be given on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  //reut.rs/1ZjCVHk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:01:05.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
