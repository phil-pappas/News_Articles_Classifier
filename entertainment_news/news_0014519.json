Coming from people who've fallen off a bike or two in our time, we know the pain all too well.\nNow, with that out of the way, here's a photo of a cyclist falling off their bike on Harcourt Street as a topless model walks by.\n*You can make your own jokes about topless behaviour and people falling over on Harcourt Street, that's not out style/we couldn't think of a good enough joke\nThis is 100%, the greatest photo ever for so many reasons ðŸ˜Â pic.twitter.com/3XMwXwgIuI\n— Daniella Moyles (@daniellamoyles) October 12, 2015\nThe picture couldn't be any better timed, although we can't be sure if the model caused the crash, or if it was just horrible(brilliant) timing.\nFrankly, we don't care. All we know is that it made us laugh, and a bit concerned.\nActually, we we're also a bit bemused as to the reason why a topless model was on Harcourt Street, so we looked into it and as it happens, it's for Breast Cancer Awareness. So it's done a fantastic job.\nMORE: Luke Skywalker throws his support behind Kerry, so Dublin has...
