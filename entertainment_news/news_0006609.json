Published by New York City-based Page Publishing, Cheryl Stabler’s poignant tale tells a story about a family, their search for a church and the journey while dealing with an unexpected turn of events.\n“The Hollywood Preacher” is a fictional story of a church that rises and falls within three years. The preacher is well-known in the community, star struck, and a womanizer that has a gift with words. His anointing to teach God’s word draws in a family who is seeking a different kind of church. The family seeks a church with a strong teacher, a small congregation, and a church family that is welcoming. In this story, the family finds a new church home, so they think, and are taken aback by the fallout of what happens soon after. They stay to keep the flock/family together, but they witness the church hurt an entire community.\nReaders who wish to experience this profound work can purchase “The Hollywood Preacher” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
