All films are shown at 7 p.m. in the first-floor Abbott Room of the library, 106 High St. \nThe screenings are free and open to the public. October films touch on the theme of death and dying, as an early bow to National Hospice Month in November. Up next, on Oct. 23, is “Amour” (2012, France/Germany/Austria). This classic French drama showcases an all-star cast that includes Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva and Isabelle Huppert. The film focuses on an elderly couple, retired music teachers Anne and Georges, and their lives following Anne's stroke. Georges struggles to care for his wife at home, even while he remembers their long years together, and copes with the visit of their musician daughter (Huppert). As his own health declines, he must make a critical decision for both of them. “Amour” is screened in French with English subtitles. \nThis month’s series will close with “My Life Without Me” (2003, Canada/Spain) on Oct. 30. For information on the Friday series’ schedule and films, call the library at 338-3884. \nCourier Publications’ A&E Editor Dagney C.
