He told me last year that there were bottles of Champagne waiting in the basement after Game 6 because then-Cub Moises Alou had reserved the space for himself and his teammates.\nStanley’s never did get to host that Cubs celebration, as you already know, but the Lincoln Park bar and restaurant hosted another one 12 years later Tuesday.\nCubs President Theo Epstein entertained his scouting staff at Stanley’s after the team defeated the St. Louis Cardinals and advanced to the National League Championship Series. They were joined by Pearl Jam rocker Eddie Vedder, who sat alongside Epstein on Monday during Game 3, former Cub Kerry Wood, a member of that 2003 team, and Joel Murray.\nVedder and Murray also celebrated Monday’s Game 3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Stanley’s, as did Murray’s “Mad Men” co-star Mark Moses, former Cub Ryan Dempster, former Blackhawk Chris Chelios and D.B. Sweeney (“The Cutting Edge”). Sweeney, John Cusack and Mike Starr (“Dumb and Dumberer”) watched Game 1 of the Cubs-Cardinals series Friday at Stanley’s.\nElsewhere around town, Cubs players, including Anthony Rizzo, Dexter Fowler and David Ross, opted to celebrate Tuesday’s win at Parliament . Cubs manager Joe Maddon had dinner with his wife following the game at Jellyfish, where he is somewhat of a regular.\nOn the record: “I wish I was in Chicago right now on my ninth beer and third gyros #GoCubsGo” – “The Mindy Project” actor Ike Barinholtz following Tuesday's win, via Twitter\nJoe Maddon Photo courtesy of Joseph DeVito Cubs manager Joe Maddon (second to right) and his wife Jaye Maddon (left) at Jellyfish Oct. 13, 2015 with restaurant co-owners Joseph DeVito (second to left) and Josh Carl (right).\nCubs manager Joe Maddon (second to right) and his wife Jaye Maddon (left) at Jellyfish Oct. 13, 2015 with restaurant co-owners Joseph DeVito (second to left) and Josh Carl (right).\n(Photo courtesy of Joseph DeVito) “Not just a celebrity. A lifelong, 40-year Cub maniacal fan, who happens to be a celebrity.\" – Cusack, when referred to as a celebrity in his interview with Comcast Spots Net after Tuesday's victory\nHeads up: Wood and former U.S. soccer star Brian McBride are expected to appear Friday at the seventh annual Champions for Children’s at the Hilton Chicago hotel, which benefits Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Rizzo was scheduled to attend so that he could be honored for his charitable work, but that appears to be unlikely due to the team’s playoff run.\nBy the numbers: $10,500 .

Sharp was traded to the Dallas Stars in July.\nZahra Schreiber, Seth Rollins, Lisa Marie Varon and Bob Backlund Photo courtesy of The Squared Circle (L to R) Former WWE NXT Diva Zahra Schreiber, WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, former WWE Diva Lisa Marie Varon (aka Victoria) and WWE Hall of Famer Bob Backlund at The Squared Circle Oct. 12, 2015, which is owned by Varon.\n(L to R) Former WWE NXT Diva Zahra Schreiber, WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, former WWE Diva Lisa Marie Varon (aka Victoria) and WWE Hall of Famer Bob Backlund at The Squared Circle Oct. 12, 2015, which is owned by Varon.\n(Photo courtesy of The Squared Circle) Help homeless dogs: Former WWE Divas champion AJ Brooks (aka AJ Lee) has teamed up with Beautiful Disaster Clothing to release her AJ’s Animal Avenger clothing line, which will benefit the homeless animals-focused PAWS Chicago. The collection includes T-shirts and tank tops and features Brooks and her dog, Larry. She and husband and former WWE Champion CM Punk adopted Larry, from PAWS Chicago earlier this year.\n“This past February, I was home healing from a surgery and was struggling to keep a positive attitude,” Brooks said, via press release. “I needed a purpose greater than throwing a daily pity party for myself. I’ve been a rescue dog mom several times and occasionally found comfort in scrolling through pictures of animals on various adoption center websites, just to fantasize about adding to the family. Then I found my guy on pawschicago.org . ... He has brought so much happiness into our home that I wanted to find a way to give back to the amazing people who took care of our furry baby before we could.”\nSightings: WWE Champion Seth Rollins and his girlfriend and former WWE NXT Diva Zahra Schreiber hung out Monday at The Squared Circle following “Raw” at Allstate Arena (read my interview with Rollins here ).
