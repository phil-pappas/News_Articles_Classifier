Pet Harbor It was a tragic and heartbreaking parting of the ways when Scooby, a 14-year-old Chow Chow was forcibly pulled out of the arms of his elderly owner who was going to an assisted living facility. And even though Scooby and his human had been together for nearly a dog's lifetime, no family member ever considered Scooby's feelings - after all he is \"just a dog.\"\nScooby, however is not \"just a dog,\" and advocates hope to find a safe and loving environment for the 39-pound pooch, whose only medical notes indicate he has cataracts. A Facebook page for this dog can be found here. Click here for Scooby's PetHarbor listing. SCOOBY - ID#A0949837 \" My name is Scooby and I am a neutered male, black and gold Chow Chow mix.
