Tyra Banks and fellow Top Model judge J Alexander (Matt Sayles/AP) \nTyra, the programme’s host and executive producer, has recently launched the syndicated daytime talk show FABLife. \nAmerica’s Next Top Model debuted in 2003 on the now-defunct UPN channel and was the first series on fledgling CW in 2006. It is shown on Sky Living in the UK. \nMore recent series have featured plus size or “fiercely real” models and male models – with its first male winner crowned in Cycle 21. \nTyra tweeted about the show’s end, saying she felt it was the right time.
