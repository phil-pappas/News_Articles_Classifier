With the exception of a few immigrants to the outside world, the newcomers remain private and separate from the rest of planet earth’s inhabitants until one of their group decides to sell the innovative knowledge of the science and technology that brought them there to a greedy, corporate C.E.O. from the outside world.\nReaders who wish to experience this captivating work can purchase “Bluestone” at bookstores everywhere, or online at the Apple iTunes store, Amazon, Google Play or Barnes and Noble.\nFor additional information or media inquiries, contact Page Publishing at 866-315-2708.\nAbout Page Publishing\nPage Publishing is a traditional New York based full-service publishing house that handles all of the intricacies involved in publishing its authors’ books, including distribution in the world’s largest retail outlets and royalty generation.
