And now you can watch the official version online. After the footage leaked online over the weekend, WB's marketing chief... (Tribune wire reports) \nLeto even pranked his castmates, including Jim Parrack, who plays his henchman, Jonny Frost. \n\"I was just thinking that the Joker would probably just say, 'F-- you,' and hang up,\" Leto, who called Parrack with orders to spray paint roses and fill a backpack with nails, said. \nHe also sent Margot Robbie, who plays Harley Quinn, a dead rat and bullets to Will Smith (Deadshot). \"Not a single word exchanged off-camera. He was all in on the Joker,\" Smith said about Leto's commitment to the role in a recent interview. \nLeto also revealed how he breathed new life into the classic villain. \n\"I always get the sense that the Joker may be much older than people think,\" he said. \"It's something different. If you don't break rules, you're not going to strike new ground. I think I'll be cooling down for the rest of my life.\" \nDirected by David Ayer, \"Suicide Squad\" also stars Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukuhara as Katana, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, Adam Beach as Slipknot and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. \nThe movie hits theaters on August 5. \nVariety", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:14:04.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
