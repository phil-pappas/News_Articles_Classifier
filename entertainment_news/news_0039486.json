And she’s continuing to keep it real with pube chat. \nThe 31-year-old has taken to her website KhloeWithaK.com and posted a blog called “Let’s Talk About the Hair Down There”. \n“You guys know I’m not gonna beat around the bush (no pun intended), so let’s get straight to it: I’m all about the landing strip,” she wrote, adding that she feels “uncomfortable” when she sees women with “nothing down there”. \n“I like to be clean; I like to be manicured. When there’s nothing there, it’s weird, in my opinion — especially when you have tits and an ass. It just freaks me out a little bit.” \nAnd like most sisters, Khloe subscribes to the theory of “your life is my life” and gave herself permission to spill the details on Kim and Kourtney’s pubic hair.
