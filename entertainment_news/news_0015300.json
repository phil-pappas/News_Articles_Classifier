Bang Showbiz Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nHAYDEN Panettiere is seeking treatment for her postpartum depression following the birth of 10-month-old Kaya, her spokesperson has confirmed. \nThe 'Nashville' star has checked into a facility to help her overcome depression following the birth of ten-month-old Kaya, her first child with fianc√© Wladamir Klitschko. \nHer spokesperson said: \"Hayden is voluntarily seeking professional help at a treatment centre as she is currently battling postpartum depression. She asks that the media respect her privacy during this time.\" \nMeanwhile, the 26-year-old beauty previously insisted postpartum depression should be \"talked about\" more. \nShe shared: \"I can very much relate. It's something a lot of women experience. \n\"When you're told about postpartum depression you think it's, 'I feel negative feelings towards my child, I want to injure or hurt my child' - I've never, ever had those feelings. Some women do. \n\"But you don't realise how broad of a spectrum you can really experience that on. It's something that needs to be talked about. Women need to know that they're not alone, and that it does heal. \n\"There's a lot of misunderstanding - there's a lot of people out there that think that it's not real, that it's not true, that it's something that's made up in their minds, that, 'Oh, it's hormones'. They brush it off. \n\"It's something that's completely uncontrollable. It's really painful and it's really scary and women need a lot of support.\" celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:06:24.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
