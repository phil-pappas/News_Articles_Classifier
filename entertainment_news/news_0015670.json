Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, for example, was pretty damn stupid - but it was a lorra lorra fun.\nSo, with that in mind, Pride And Prejudice And Zombies finally has a trailer and release date after a lot of stalling and starting with the production.\nThe cast, we've got to say, is quite good - Lena Headey, Sam Riley, Matt Smith, Douglas Booth whilst Cinderella's Lily James and Boardwalk Empire's Jack Huston turn up in leading roles.\nTake a look at the first teaser.\nIt's quite strange because, for a few minutes, you genuinely do believe that it's one of those BBC period drama adaptations that they do so well before, y'know, Lena Heady goes crazy with an axe and people start stabbing each other.\nPride And Prejudice And Zombies hits our screens on February 12th of next year.\nMORE: Daniel Craig says he's NOT done with James Bond just yet\nMORE: Robert DeNiro reteaming with Joe Pesci, Al Pacino & Martin Scorsese for I Heard You Paint Houses\nMORE: Watch: The first trailer for Ip Man 3 sees Donnie Yen take on Mike Tyson (Yes, really)", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcTBj7e4k80"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:36:58.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
