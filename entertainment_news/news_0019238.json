And in NBA.com's annual survey of the league's 30 executives, they have done so unfavorably for the Bulls.\nBeyond picking the Cavaliers to win the championship and longtime nemesis LeBron James to be named most valuable player, only Jimmy Butler received even one vote for best at his position.\nThe consensus best five were Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Marc Gasol.\nAdding to the slights, former Bulls assistant Ron Adams, now with the Warriors, drew the most votes for league's best assistant coach. And Tom Thibodeau somehow landed in the \"others receiving votes\" category for the league's best defensive schemes despite being unemployed. The Bulls are still paying him after firing him with two years left on his deal.\nMore favorably, Pau Gasol ranked as the second-best international player behind brother Marc; Bobby Portis drew the second-most votes behind the Heat's Justise Winslow for the draft's biggest steal; and Fred Hoiberg ranked third behind the Pelicans' Alvin Gentry and Thunder's Billy Donovan for biggest impact as new coach.\nSurprisingly, Derrick Rose drew no votes for \"fastest with the ball\" category topped by the Wizards' John Wall.\nButler also ranked tied for third with James for best perimeter defender behind the Spurs' Kawhi Leonard and the Grizzlies' Tony Allen. And Butler tied with the Lakers' Kobe Bryant for third-toughest player behind Allen and the Warriors' Draymond Green.\nPrivacy Policy LeBron James Chicago Bulls NBA Jimmy Butler Anthony Davis Stephen Curry Cleveland Cavaliers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562659af/turbine/ct-nba-gm-survey-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:52:55.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
