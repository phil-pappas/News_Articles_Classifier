The Alphabet gives \" Dr. Ken \" a back-nine episode order, ultimately picking it up for a full 22-episode season. The multi-camera family comedy starring \" The Hangover \" actor Ken Jeong premiered on October 2 to 6.7 million viewers. It has been receiving consistently high ratings for the past couple of weeks on the Friday 8.30 P.M. slot, averaging 6.6 million viewers and an 1.5/6 in adults 18-49. Created by Jeong along with Jared Stern and John Fox, \"Dr. Ken\" chronicles the daily life of a brilliant physician who tries to balance his career with his family life, which can be difficult on both fronts, especially with having a therapist for a wife. Jeong, who is a doctor in real life, said of his series, \"Everything has come full circle with 'Dr. Ken.' I'm just so grateful to even work as an actor. They have my own vehicle, based on my life, based on my past, and to be able to kind of wear comedy and medicine on the show.\" The first comedy to receive a full-season order this fall, \"Dr. Ken\" joins new dramas NBC's \" Blindspot \", FOX's \" Rosewood \" and ABC's \" Quantico \". Meanwhile, FOX comedies \" Grandfathered \" and \" The Grinder \" as well as The CW's \" Crazy Ex-Girlfriend \" have only received additional script orders. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:01.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
