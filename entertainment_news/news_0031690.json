He remained in the hospital until he died at 7:50 Thursday evening. \nKlein treated some of Hollywood's biggest stars, including Dustin Hoffman, Elizabeth Taylor, Sharon Stone, Goldie Hawn, Dolly Parton, and Cher. He was also known a pioneer of Botox. \nBut it was his relationship with Jackson that made him a public figure. The two often spent holidays and took vacations together.

(AP Photo/Matt Sayles) \nWhen Jackson died in 2009, TMZ reported Klein injected Jackson with Demerol 51 times during the three months before his death. He also allegedly took Jackson to a number of surgery centers and gave him Propofol, the anesthesia that eventually contributed to his death. \nAfter Jackson's death, Klein's life went downhill. He ended up declaring bankruptcy. \nCoincidentally, Klein was in the news Thursday in a story about Jackson's son, Prince, implying Jackson wasn't his biological father. For years, Klein has been rumored to be Prince's biological father, though TMZ says it has evidence neither Klein, nor Jackson, is his father.
