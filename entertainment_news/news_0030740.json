PacketSled received five-out-of-five stars across all categories: features, ease-of-use, performance, documentation, support and value for the money. Out of all the solutions tested, PacketSled was recognized for its unique, interactive visualizations and excellent analytics, earning the coveted \"Recommended\" status.\nAccording to SC Magazine's Lab, PacketSled is \"an excellent tool with depth and a massive amount of actionable information available to prevent and analyze complex breaches.\"\nWhile the majority of solutions in the space are focused on a single threaded approach to solving for detection and response, PacketSled identifies threats using a combination of sensor based and cloud analytics, signatures, and threat intelligence, providing incident responders the ability to dive deeply into a threat, or hunt through data on a massive scale.\n\"We're very pleased to be rated so highly in this group test. Continuous Monitoring, Forensics, and Incident Response are the fastest growing areas in security for good reasons. Attackers are continuously evolving their strategy, making the combination of real-time visibility with a full fidelity network history one of the most important considerations in information security,\" said Matt Harrigan , the company's President and CEO. \"Our consumption-based billing and cloud model enables us to help customers in the mid-market that have previously been unable to deploy these measures due to cost considerations.\"\nPacketSled can ingest data at speeds ranging from sub-1Gbps to 100Gbps and can be deployed via a software install in mere minutes. The platform gives security analysts the ability to discern real attacks from noise, dramatically reducing the time it takes to resolve serious security incidents.\nRead the complete SC Magazine Digital Forensics and Online Fraud here: http://www.scmagazine.com/packetsled/review/4436/\nLearn more about PacketSled and evaluate the platform:\nhttp://www.packetsled.com\nContact:\nMatt Harrigan\n1-858-225-2352\nsales@packetsled.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/packetsled-earns-perfect-score-in-sc-magazines-digital-forensics-and-online-fraud-group-test-300152794.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.packetsled.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/packetsled-earns-perfect-score-in-sc-magazines-digital-forensics-and-online-fraud-group-test-300152794.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA17661&Transmission_Id=201510011321PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA17661&DateId=20151001", "http://www.scmagazine.com/packetsled/review/4436/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:54:52.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
