There have been rumors of discontent between “The Good Wife” television co-stars Julianna Margulies and Archie Panjabi have had for a handful of years.\nTheir off-set feud was apparently resurrected on Oct. 4, when Margulies took to the New Yorker Festival stage to dispel past gossip.\nDuring the three-day arts event, Margulies explained that her “Good Wife” co-star did not show up to film their last scene together due to Panjabi’s commitment to filming for another television show, “The Fall.”\nMargulies also expressed that she “ went along with whatever (co-creator Robert King) asked me to do .”\nOn Monday, Panjabi responded on Twitter , saying there was nothing true to Margulies’ tale.\nThe pair’s behind-the-scenes feud is just one on a long list in Tinseltown history.\nHere are five of the most popular supposed television co-star feuds:\nMICHAEL CARONNA/REUTERS 'Sex and the City' cast members Sarah Jessica Parker (left) and Kim Cattrall were reportedly not always the best of friends behind the scenes of the hit show.

Will Smith vs. Janet Hubert\nIn 2011, actress Janet Hubert — better known as the original Aunt Viv on the 1990s syndicated television show “Fresh Prince of Bel Air” — called Hollywood actor Will Smith an a e and an egomaniac .\nHowever, it was Hubert’s 2009 memoir, “ Perfection Is Not a Sitcom Mom ,” that she first detailed her dislike for the “Suicide Squad” actor in print.\nThe working actress has said that she would attend a “Fresh Prince of Bel Air” reunion, should the opportunity present itself.\nIn the 1990s, actress and producer Shannen Doherty was a teen idol, thanks to her role as Brenda Walsh on the Fox television series, 'Beverly Hills, 90210.' Shannen Doherty vs. Everyone\nBefore “The O.C.” and “One Tree Hill,” there was “Beverly Hills, 90210.”\nThe prominent teen television drama remained on the air for 10 seasons.\nBut one of its most notorious stars, Shannen Doherty, was soon fired playing the character Brenda Walsh.\nSuggestions of fights with fellow co-stars and being difficult to work with led to Doherty’s demise on the hit program.\nDoherty soon found herself starring in another Aaron Spelling-produced drama, “Charmed.”\nThe actress was ousted from this series as well, as hints of “ rough days ” with her co-stars — actresses Alyssa Milano and Holly Marie Combs — surfaced in an interview between Milano and Bravo late night talk show host, Andy Cohen.\nLarry Busacca/Getty Images Pop singing sensation Ariana Grande starred in another Nickelodeon teen sitcom titled 'Sam & Cat.'
