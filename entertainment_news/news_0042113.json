All I want to do is move on.\" \n\"This dude needs a reality check,\" Pompeo tweeted along with a link to a story about Craig's remarks. \nBut hold on. \nOne person pointed out on Twitter that Craig's remarks, which were part of a longer interview, may not be what they appear to be. Pompeo conceded that point. \n\"You are absolutely right!\" she tweeted. \"I certainly have been there.\" \nIt's been almost a decade since Craig took on the role of the suave spy. His latest, \"Spectre,\" is due in U.S. theaters on November 6. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
