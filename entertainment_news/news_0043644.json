Having known Eli for a long time and worked with him during her run for the State's Attorney office, Alicia says she no longer trusts her former campaign manager. Meanwhile, Cary and Howard Lyman engaged in a tense argument. Later, Cary and Diane look hilariously ridiculous as they join what looks like professional development session with other co-workers in the office. \"Payback\" airs Sunday, November 1 at 9 P.M. on CBS. Jason employs aggressive investigative tactics when he assists Alicia and Lucca with a student loan case. Also in the episode, Howard Lyman alleges ageism at Lockhart, Agos & Lee, pointing to Cary as the primary offender, and Eli stirs up Florrick family drama on Peter's presidential campaign. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:10:52.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
