Caught: Adam did not survive his first episode on the show (Colin Hutton/Channel 4) \nThe Hunters were tweeting throughout the show, letting the fugitives know they were never far behind. Some advice for you, Stephen and Martin. Keep a low profile. I'm everywhere. #Hunted pic.twitter.com/HKiSJ1klTg \n— Hunted HQ (@Hunted_HQ) October 1, 2015 \nHere is what we learned from week four of Hunted. \n1. A single sheep is called a sheep What do you call a lone sheep (Gareth Fuller/PA) \nWalsall lads Stephen and Martin started the show with an impressive display of rural ignorance, when Stephen asked his companion what a single sheep is called. \nIt confused us too. \n— The Creative Medium (@FrijjMagnate) October 1, 2015 Sheep ffs….. sheep! #Hunted \n— Anne-Marie Evans (@AnnemarieEvans) October 1, 2015 On the run from @Hunted_HQ . Doesn't know what a single sheep is called. We're giving him 30 minutes, tops… #Hunted \n— Channel 4 (@Channel4) October 1, 2015 \n2. You don’t need money when you have skills Despite his poor countryside knowledge, Stephen is a reliable plumber (Colin Hutton/Channel 4) \nStephen and Martin showed their initiative, however, by securing a pair of bicycles for free, in exchange for a quick bit of plumbing work. Fixed his tap, and got free bikes. That's the way to do it. #hunted", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:10:00.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
