THE PRODUCERS is the hilarious Mel Brooks smash-hit that took Broadway by storm in 2001, winning a record-breaking 12 Tony Awards and three Olivier Awards.\nTickets to THE PRODUCERS start at $39. Discounts are available to members of The Hanover Theatre, groups of 10 or more, corporate partners and Woo Pass holders. $20 student rush tickets are available online with the code RUSH and a student ID. Tickets are available online at TheHanoverTheatre.org, by phone at 877.571.SHOW (7469) or at The Hanover Theatre box office located at 2 Southbridge Street in downtown Worcester.\nTHE PRODUCERS revolutionized Broadway Musical Comedy, and as Ben Brantley raved, “It is, to put it simply, the real thing: a big Broadway book musical that is so ecstatically drunk on its powers to entertain that it leaves you delirious, too.”\nBased on the Academy Award-winning 1968 film of the same name, this Mel Brooks masterpiece chronicles the side-splitting adventures of washed-up Broadway producer Max Bialystock and his mild-mannered accountant Leo Bloom, as they scheme to get rich quick by producing the most notorious flop in the history of “showbiz.” It's a comic tour-de-force that spoofs the big, old-fashioned Broadway musical while paying tribute to it at the same time.\nOften hailed as the funniest Broadway musical of all time, THE PRODUCERS features a riotous mix of eccentric characters and show-stopping songs including \"I Wanna Be a Producer,\" \"When You Got It, Flaunt It,\" \"Prisoners of Love” and of course “Springtime for Hitler,” as well as Susan Stroman’s eye-popping, Tony Award-winning production numbers.\nWritten by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan, with music and lyrics by Mel Brooks, THE PRODUCERS features Susan Stroman’s Tony Award-winning direction and choreography recreated on tour by director Nigel West and choreographer Lauren Kadel. David Johnson stars as the infamous Max Bialystock with Richard Lafleur playing the role of his mousy accountant Leo Bloom. For more information visit http://www.TheProducersOnTour.com .\nAbout The Hanover Theatre:\nThe Hanover Theatre continues to draw over 170,000 patrons annually with world-class performances and headlining acts including Broadway hits (“Les Misérables,” “Jersey Boys,” “Camelot”); comedians (Dave Chappelle, Jay Leno, Daniel Tosh); musical acts (Neil Young, Aretha Franklin, John Legend); and everything in between (“A Christmas Carol,” Maya Angelou, Rudy Giuliani, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre). Consistently ranked by POLLSTAR as one of the Top Theatres in the World, the theatre opened in March of 2008 following a $32 million historic renovation. Over the last seven seasons, the theatre has established its place as a world-class performing arts venue, acting as a catalyst for the economic development of downtown Worcester. In the spring of 2015, the theatre finalized the purchase of a vacant, three-floor former office building with street-level retail space at 551 Main Street. The building will ultimately house office space for theatre administration, function areas, a restaurant on the ground floor and an educational space on the lower level. The building is set to open in 2016.\nWorcester Center for Performing Arts, a registered not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, owns and operates The Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts.
