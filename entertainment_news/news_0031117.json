MORE 'STRICTLY': \nBruno was heaping praise on Jay McGuiness and Aliona Vilani’s Paso Doble, when he told the duo: “Oh yes, those are the bull's bollocks. He really went for it. Your arms were like the wings of a flamingo.\" \nStory continues below the video... \nWhile the panel giggled and Darcey Bussell put her head in her hands, Tess Daly apologised to viewers and the BBC also posted a message online: We are sorry for any offence caused by Bruno's comment during the live show, for which Tess apologized immediately. \n— BBC Strictly (@bbcstrictly) October 24, 2015 \nDespite scoring an impressive 33, Jay and Aliona didn’t manage to top the leaderboard, and they were pipped to first place by Kellie Bright and Helen George, who both received a total of 35 points from the judges. \nAnother celebrity will leave the competition this evening, and things aren’t looking good for Ainsley Harriott and Jeremy Vine, who both failed to impress the panel. \nWatch Jay and Aliona’s swear-inducing routine below… Close Strictly Come Dancing's Best Ever Routines of   EastEnders' used car salesman Max Branning turned into an overnight sex symbol with this Samba to 'Mambo No. 5' in 2014. It was just a pity his partner lifted the choreography from her stint on 'So You Think You Can Dance?' When Alesha Dixon performed his show-stopping routine on series five, we were convinced she was about to become the next Beyoncé. Instead, she later became the next Arlene Phillips, replacing the veteran on the panel. The Charleston was a fairly new dance to 'Strictly' when S.E.B took it on in 2013. And despite it only being week two of the competition, she and partner Brendan Cole bagged a whopping 36 points for the routine. 2013 champ Abbey wowed the judges with this beautiful waltz in week one of the competition, and brought it back for the final, where they scored a perfect 40 and lifted the glitterball trophy. If you can remember as far back as series two in 2004 (!), you'll no doubt remember this knockout performance from Jill and partner Darren Bennett. We don't think anyone has ever had as much fun as Lisa and Robin Windsor did performing their Samba on the show in 2012. Cazza's Turkish interpretation of the Charleston cemented her as the favourite to win in 2014. She also performed the dance again in the final, which eventually saw her crowned winner. Given the sexual tension in this performance, it's no wonder Kara and Artem Chigvintsev announced they were an item shortly afterwards. Not only did Louis Smith capture a lot of attention with his toplessness, but his dancing was pretty good in this too. Matt went from Dean Wicks to snake hips with his performance of the Salsa in series five in 2007.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:48:52.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
