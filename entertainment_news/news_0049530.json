The film is completing 50 days of screening shortly and an official announcement on the sequel will be done after that. While the first film, which takes its idea from Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None, was set on an island, the sequel will see the principal characters stranded on an island.\nBut the film team is in no mood to reveal more. Director KM Chaitanya said, \"We have hinted at a sequel at the end of the film itself. The film's basic idea is that our country is waiting to explode, like Naipaul says in his book Million Mutinies Now. We are trying to explore that anger. We are not asking people to kill anyone but we have to do something about it. The rest of the film will be carpentry work about it and can be set on an island, desert or an aeroplane.\nThe film said that no man is an island. The island in Aatagara is symbolic. No man is an island and all our actions are connected. The theme will continue in the sequel.\"\nProducer Yogish said, \"The film will be made with the same team. Where it will be set can be a speculation now. It is not the budget that makes a film good but what new we are trying to say. Many people asked me why we were not tackling bigger crimes in the film. No, that was never the idea. We do not want to make a film about terrorism or some big scam. Big crimes are rare. But there is more volume of crime at the lowest level. They become the norm in society. For example, we find it convenient to go to a tout to get a licence rather than follow the procedure ourselves. That is where our focus is.\" Chaitanya adds to this idea, \"I was asked why we are not attacking the police and politicians. We need not tell people that politicians are bad. But the voter who takes money to vote is equally wrong. Our idea is that even cynicism about voting is also bad. We are tackling such issues.\"\nAbout the schedule of the sequel Yogish said, \"Dwarakish Chitra's 50th film Chauka will commence in November. The work on the sequel for Aatagara has begun informally. As of now, the schedule is not fixed. Both the sequel and Chauka may overlap.\" Meanwhile, people across the spectrum who rarely watch films are heaping praise on Aatagara. Former city police commissioner HT Sangliyana who watched the film asked Yogish why he did not consider casting him in one of the roles. Former Lokayukta Santhosh Hegde, Infosys Foundation's Sudha Murthy and others have watched Aatagara after the issues addressed in the film made news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:35:35.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
