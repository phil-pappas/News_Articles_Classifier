He slipped in every Hootie hit for those Generation Xers who just came out to hear \"Let Her Cry.\" \nHe covered artists from Black Crowes to Blackstreet. He touted Burt Reynolds. He told stories about his kids and how he wrote \"Let Her Cry\" with some inspiration from the Crowes and Bonnie Raitt. \nOn the whole, however, he was on a mission to play good old fashioned country music, complete with a backing band called the Carolina Grey Boys and a pair of rising country stars for openers: Cam and David Nail. Darius Rucker sings 'No Diggity' Darius Rucker sings \"No Diggity\" by Blackstreet at the War Memorial in Syracuse, Oct. 23, 2015 \nFor 90 minutes, Rucker roamed the stage, serenading the crowd with that deep, soulful voice. Onstage, he was honest, raw and perhaps even a bit bourbon-y. He slurred some words and had to pause at one point to look at his set list and ask, \"What're we playing now?\" \nDuring his encore, Rucker came to the front of the stage to play \"So I Sang,\" a number he described as the \"most honest song he's ever written.\" Tears filled his eyes and a smile spread across his face as he sang about having music through all the difficult parts of his life, including his mother's death. \nHe followed with \"Wagon Wheel\" -- the song that's helped define him as a country artist, and he gave a nod to the song's originator, Old Crow Medicine Show (with a little help from Bob Dylan). \nAt times, Rucker seemed irritated with someone (or someones) in the crowd. During \"Only Wanna Be With You\" he yelled \"Stop that!\" at someone twice, and put his hands up, seemingly ready to stop the song. While urging everyone to clap along later, he singled out a \"guy who bought tickets for his girlfriend but is really into metal.\" Darius Rucker scolds a fan Rucker pauses during \"Only Wanna Be With You\" to tell a fan to stop doing something. \nFollowing an acoustic ballad, he went off-script with a laugh and a quick shake of his head to people shooting cell phone videos. \n\"I love technology,\" he said. \"But the one thing that sucks for me...you're singing a heartfelt love song and you're looking at a girl and she's already taken 47 pictures and she goes like this [pretends to put a phone in front of his face]. That s*** sucks.\" \nIt's that honesty, though, that makes him such a lovable performer. He's a seasoned pro who's been at this for more than 30 years. He knows how to deal with the guy throwing a t-shirt onstage (repeatedly) and how to balance songs with stories. But he's just unpredictable enough to keep the show exciting and fresh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:43:16.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
