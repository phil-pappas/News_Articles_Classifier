A twang that comes right from the city   New York \nAs the Bronx middle schoolers harmonized in their auditorium and plucked out basic chords on ukuleles and guitars, in walked their music instructor, Liz Rose â€” a Grammy-award winning country songwriter from Nashville.\nRose has penned tracks for some of the biggest names in the business, including Taylor Swift . But on this recent fall day, she helped 19 students write an original tune called \"Everybody's Perfect.\"\n\"Y'all are awesome,\" Rose said as she approached the stage. \"Y'all made me cry.\"\nCountry music and New York City don't go hand in glove; the city has only one country radio station, which came on the air two years ago after a 17-year drought. Nonetheless, Music City musicians are partnering with a nonprofit that is providing music education in New York City schools to help boost it as a core subject.\nThe students at Pelham Gardens Middle School in the Bronx are among 500 students in 15 schools around the city to participate; they receive 10 lessons on how to write lyrics, and one class in each school has a videoconference session with a musician in Nashville.\nThe Nashville-NYC connection is made through the Country Music Association Foundation , which began in 2006 to help fund music programs in Nashville and is branching out across the country.\nCorey Stuckey , 12, said he has been inspired to write songs in the past by hip-hop and R&B artists such as R. Kelly and Ludacris. But now he is opening up to country, too.\n\"I like country music because of the tone of it,\" the seventh-grader said. \"It's kind of like reggae, but it's different because it's more calming.\"\nUltimately they wrote: \"Everybody's Perfect,\" an homage to the difficulties of life at a new school.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:04:54.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
