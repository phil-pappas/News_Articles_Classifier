While the Sydney artist's psychedelic, marbled, resin paintings have at times tended towards a kind of hotel chic over the past decade, this body of work places Frank firmly back in a rich, aesthetically lurid and conceptually complex terrain. The works assume various guises. The huge mirror-like \"paintings\" that line the walls take the form of distorted, high-gloss Perspex, punctuated with various material interventions and additions (swirls of varnish, lighter fluid, shattered car windscreen glass and Taiwanese wind charms, to name a few). There is an underlying tension between high-end superfluousness and lowbrow materiality. One painting sees Hitler's retreat in the Bavarian Alps rendered in strawberry bubblegum atop varnish and silver on anodised Perspex; another, glowing in a searing, gaudy orange, features mink coats hung from the edge of the frame. Frank's sculptures deal with similar thematic and aesthetic threads. A bottle of passionfruit soft drink encased in Perspex atop a plinth becomes a sculpture, as does a liquefied white chocolate \"fountain\", while an opulent Zaha Hadid​ couch is turned on its end to become a non-functional, fin-like sculpture. The artist's hand is nowhere and everywhere here, and these slick, seductive objects are riddled with human, industrial and economic detritus.\nUntil December 12; Neon Parc, 15 Tinning Street, Brunswick, 9663 0911, neonparc.com.au  \nRichard Mosse at NGV. \nBROOK ANDREW: POSSESSED \nAdvertisement Brook Andrew's work has been accused of didacticism in some circles, especially in regard to its negotiation of socio-political and historical ground. While they look good, his formal treatments – which often see him re-present historical photographs and colonial gazes – are sometimes a little clunky, as if his gestures aren't quite enough on their own. His new show at Tolarno offers a reprieve. Mirroring and merging early photographs from the Tasmanian wilderness, shot by official Government photographers Stephen Spurling and John Watt Beattie, the images in Possessed are subtle and seductive. Images of towering landscapes, settlements, dense bushland and geological details are gently pressed together, their formal and tonal elements forging echoes and interventions. The original slides, now blown up to a significant scale, reveal clues and debris – fingerprints, smudges and etchings. In one image, a pod of dolphins appears to have been scratched onto the negative. With their mirrored effect, the images could be hung at 180 degrees and still be readable. It all points to a recognisable theme within Andrew's work – the historically and culturally loaded nature of gaze and the idea of different ways of seeing – but the manner by which he broaches it is delicate and elusive.    \nUntil November 7; Tolarno Galleries, level 4, 104 Exhibition Street, city, 9654 6000, tolarnogalleries.com \nRichard Mosse's images from his NGV show. \nRICHARD MOSSE: THE ENCLAVE \nIt's near impossible to put Irish artist Richard Mosse's six-screen video installation The Enclave into words, so profound and affecting is its outcome. Shot on 16mm infrared film in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, this remarkable work not only takes us to death's constant and brutal brink, but confirms the limitations of representation. We must move as Mosse's camera moves – loose and fluid through the jungles, villages, battlefields and rivers – the lush greens stained pink by the qualities of the film, in order to take in this grittily elaborate volley of images, bouncing askew from one screen to another. There is no respite. Sound and images swell and fracture and disperse, only for them to re-emerge. This is formidable, chilling, critically astute work. Mosse, a white outsider, takes us to the threshold – to the children fleeing gunfire, to the thunder of shells and grenades, to the throng of the refugee camps and hutches for the displaced – only to articulate that we can never even begin to understand. While we feel intense empathy and pain, we are as far from this lurid, pink fantasy as we ever were.\nUntil February 16; NGV International, 180 St Kilda Road, city, 8620 2222, ngv.vic.gov.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:21:21.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
