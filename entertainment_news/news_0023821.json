While Giuliana Rancic remains on the E! payroll, she has to be diplomatic about her time at the network. Her husband, Bill Rancic, on the other hand, has no such obligation.\nWhen we asked the “Fashion Police” host if Kathy Griffin had thrown the show under the bus when she made her haughty exit last year, Giuliana said, “I can’t comment on that,” then motioned at her hubby, adding, “I can’t say it. He can.”\nBill gave the universally recognized look that says, “Hell, yes!”\nGriffin ducked out of the show in March after only seven episodes, saying, “I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference.”\nGiuliana told us at the Pink Agenda gala for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and her own Fab-U-Wish charity that she has been focusing on her HSN line, G by Giuliana, since going part-time at E! in July.\nWhen we suggested that her more frequent appearances on the TV shopping network might be a breath of fresh air after hosting E!
