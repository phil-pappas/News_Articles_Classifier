And I got my karma. I earned it. I got my butt and heart kicked and it hurt me enough that I looked in the mirror and I didn't want it to happen again. If I wanted to be a happy guy and really fall in love, I would have to love myself... It's so cringy how I acted.\" \nBut Blunt insists she'll never be so revealing, telling Howard Stern on Wednesday, \"I never want to talk about it. I can't do it.\" \nThe actress did open up about her happy times with Buble, revealing the stars \"had a good time\" during their courtship, and although she is no longer in touch with the Canadian's family, she is still very fond of them. \n\"I love his family. I still do,\" she admitted. \nBoth stars have since moved on from the split - Emily married actor John Krasinski in 2010 and the couple became first-time parents to daughter Hazel last year. Michael has also started a family with Lopilato. The pair wed in 2011 and is expecting a sibling for two-year-old son Noah.
