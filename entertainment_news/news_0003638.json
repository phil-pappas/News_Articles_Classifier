Caracas Ave., Hershey, will screen two seasonal favorites: “Ghostbusters,’’ starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, will be shown at 7 p.m. \nAnd at 11:59 p.m. comes the cult classic, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.’’ \nThe film, starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O’Brien, and Meat Loaf, has inspired a following among faithful fans who dress up like their favorite characters, sing along to the songs and play with props dictated by the movie. \nThe Hershey Theatre’s midnight showing allows all of that, but outside props are prohibited. Guests can buy a prop bag there for $6. \nAdmission to each film is $8. Call 717-534-3405 or visit hersheytheatre.com . \nThose looking for a more creepy experience might want to take in the Ware Center’ s showing of the 1922 silent film “Nosferatu.’’ \nAccompanied by a live original score by Not So Silent Cinema, the film will be screened Monday, Oct. 26, at 7 p.m. at the center, 42 N. Prince St. \nThe film is based on the Bram Stoker novel, “Dracula,’’ but changes names and details. \nStoker’s widow sued the production company over the film saying that it did not have rights to the book. She won and the company went out of business and all copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed. \nBut that, as we know now, was never completed and the movie stands as one of the masterpieces in early horror. \nTickets are $10.
