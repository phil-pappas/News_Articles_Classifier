Their arrests came after a month-long investigation into a mail theft scheme that also involved identity theft, credit card fraud, check fraud, theft, and burglary, the news release said.\nSometime during the last month, deputies got a tip about a \"suspicious vehicle near a community mailbox\" in Rancho Cucamnonga. That tip led detectives to identity Moon as the primary suspect in a string of mail thefts.\nDeputies obtained a search warrant and served it at Moon's home Thursday, Oct. 8. Though Moon wasn't there, deputies located hundreds of pieces of stolen mail, homemade mailbox keys, computers and printers used to make fraudulent checks, and dozens of fraudulent checks made payable to Moon, the news release said. Deputies also found a loaded pistol at the home.\nDuring the search, Goede was contacted. She was arrested on a felony warrant for identity theft.\nThe next day, deputies tracked down Moon to a home in Ontario. He was found in the attic of the home and taken into custody. Two people were additionally arrested Friday on suspicion of obstructing Moon's arrest.\nThe investigation into the mail theft operation remained ongoing Tuesday.
