Shortly after being unshackled, the pair walked out of the courtroom into a throng of media, where Quaid, the 65-year-old star of \"Independence Day,\" jokingly asked if there were any prison movies filming in the area. \nRandy and Evi Quaid on the streets of St. Albans.

ABCNews Randy Quaid arrives in court in Vermont, Oct. 15, 2015. At first, Judge Alison Arms ruled that there was not enough probable cause to extradite the Quaids to California, where they are facing felony charges for vandalism. Instead, after a one-hour hearing, she set bond for the couple at $50,000 each and ordered them to remain in Vermont. But shortly after making her ruling, Arms called everyone back into court and order the couple to be freed without bail because of a lack of probable cause. However the Santa Barbara DA said it is pursuing a governor's warrant, which allows extradition. If the Quaids leave Vermont, the DA's office said it expects they will be taken into custody on the original arrest warrant. \nCourt quickly put back in session. The Quaids are released.
