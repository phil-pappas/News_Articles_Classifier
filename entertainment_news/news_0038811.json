Vaughn's client paid $250, but the cost \"really depends on the size and placement of the tattoo,\" she said. \n\"I can definitely make a more intricate version of that. I can make a simpler version of it.\" \nWith the Pizza Rat video under copyright by the LA-based viral video outfit Jukin Media , which acquired rights not long after comedian Matt Little posted it, will more New Yorkers come to Magic Cobra for a pizza rat they can truly call their own? \n\"Let's hope so,\" Vaughn said. \"Would you like a pizza rat tattoo, too?\" \nWe politely declined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:48:39.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
