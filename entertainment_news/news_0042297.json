Randy Taraborelli’s tell-all “Becoming Beyoncé: The Untold Story,” which — among other things — told how he fanned a rumor that Jay Z was cheating with RiRi to give her first single “Pon de Replay” a boost.\nThe cheating rumor is touched on in the tell-all biography 'Becoming Beyoncé.' Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Beyoncé was apparently so upset by the rumor that she split with Jay Z for a “lonely year” in 2005, Taraborelli wrote.

Hopefully this news hasn't ruined that relationship for me.”\nHay did not deny pushing what turned out to be a lie.\n“The pr stunt that I did was out of desperation to help break ‘Pon de Replay’,\" he wrote. “It was reckless and I didn't think it was going to work. I was just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what would stick.”\nBut stick it did. And Beyoncé was so upset she split with Jay Z for a “lonely year” in 2005, Taraborelli wrote.\nHay said he never met Taraborelli but spoke with his researcher.\n“I didn't think it would be this big story,” Hay wrote. “But now, seeing Beyoncé on the cover of this book and knowing that people are profiting from speculations and opinions about her really turns my stomach.”\n“I'm ashamed that I'm even talking about this. I just want to put this rumor to rest once and for all.”\nRihanna was just 17 and low on the Def Jam totem pole when Hay pulled the “stunt.”\nTaraborelli wrote that Jay Z’s had just one complaint when the bogus story about him bedding the Barbadian beauty was being spun out.\n“Dude, she’s a minor,” he reportedly said.\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Jay Z cheated on Beyoncé, Met Gala fight explained: New book", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:27:43.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
