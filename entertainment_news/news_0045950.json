Look away now Jon Snow fans, Arya Stark says he IS dead... \nPress Association 2014 / / National Entertainment News Share \nGame Of Thrones fans may not be very happy with Maisie Williams’s latest revelation about the show. \nMaisie, who plays Arya Stark, has revealed that Jon Snow is definitely dead, despite reports and speculation that the character will return. \nTalking to Absolute Radio’s Christian O’Connell on his breakfast show, she revealed: “All the time people are asking me if Jon Snow is alive and the answer is no! He’s dead! I promise.” Maisie Williams plays Arya Stark (HBO) \nThe last season ended with a few cliffhangers, but the most shocking storyline was Snow, played by Kit Harington, being “killed off”. \nSnow’s bloody demise was not well-received by fans, and his character’s fate has been much debated. \nRecent reports suggest there have been “sightings” of Harington on set while they film the sixth series. \nViewers saw Maisie’s character Arya blinded as punishment for murdering Ser Meryn Trant. \n— Maisie Williams (@Maisie_Williams) September 21, 2015 \n“In the new season my character is blind, which means I’ve been wearing contacts on set, which is a good laugh,” she said. Share article \nAs to what is in store for the rest of the cast, she said: “I’m aware of the other storylines – we’re given the full script at the beginning of each season so we can read ahead – I always flick through my story first, the suspense is too much. I have to see what I’m up to first and then what other people are up to but it’s never the same as seeing on screen – it’s nice to watch and get the full effect.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:56:43.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
