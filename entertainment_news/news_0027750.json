Night-time ablution was once topped and tailed by a show of pulsing atomic pointillism as people walked to and from the outhouse. But when our cities were plumbed these night-time journeys ended and the stars played to an empty theatre. \nElectricity came and light flowed down the streets into houses and up the tall buildings. It's no good trying to see the massed murmuring of the night sky from inside the disco ball of Melbourne. The profligate incandescence of a city, its beams and neons, its squandered rays, its echoing lustre, its prodigally refracted light, all suck splendour from the stars. The Southern Cross wheels around the Nylex sign in the guise of a vagrant, a slumming god circumnavigating Notre Dame. You have to go bush to see the kaleidoscope of space. \nAn old man, an old friend, I was sitting next to on a riverbank one night said to me, \"No better view than that.\" He pointed up at the sky where the truant moon had freed the stars into their thermonuclear pomp. \"No beach, no mountain range compares.\" It's true. People pay crazily for water views. Or for a run of land reaching long off their verandahs into distance. But at night you can see beyond the walls of our global village into endless space with its pirouetting panorama.\nLudwig Leichhardt, when sailing to Australia, watched the familiar northern constellations disappear, to be replaced by brighter unknown stars. Upon arrival in Sydney in 1842 he wrote: \"If only I could find words to tell you how deeply I was stirred.\" Exploring in tropical Queensland three years later, he woke his men at  4am   and pointed out the Big Dipper, a constellation from their northern hemisphere childhoods. The sight of northern stars \"touches us like magic\" he wrote. How many of us today would know the southern night sky from the northern, let alone be moved by the sudden sighting of a constellation as if by a chance meeting with a friend thought lost forever?\nAdvertisement \"The southern hemisphere holds all the good stuff,\" the astronomer Bart Bok used to say. A Milky Way bright enough to cast shadow, the largest dark nebula, the best globular clusters, the biggest, brightest galaxies. Giving a lecture to the Royal Astronomical Society in London he told his audience: \"Gentlemen, you live under the wrong half of the sky!\" Maybe so, but Leichhardt's diary tells us there was a time when the stars of your home were essential familiars, part of every day, part of the family.\nI've been reading Geoffrey Blainey on what the night and the stars and moon meant to our forebears. We no longer lie outside in darkness staring out in the direction defined by gravity as \"up\", and probably only  one in 10 people know when the moon is full now. But the Indigenous peoples and the pioneers were intimate with its phases. Blainey observes that John Glover and S.T. Gill's paintings of corroborees normally show a full moon.\nNewsagents sold almanacs that set out the movements of the moon to the minute, and each diary had a lunar almanac at the front. People planning trips or balls consulted the almanac and, like the blackfellas before them, used the full moon. With no industry here, and little moisture in the air, the southern moon was recognised  as one of the world's noble sights. Mary Gilmore recalled that in her later life, in an era of good roads and streetlights and railways, the moon \"lost her high throne in the heavens\". That is, it wasn't as essential for travel.\nNed Kelly conscripted a big moon as accomplice. His bank robberies in Euroa in 1878 and Jerilderie the following year were made when the moon was full. From Jerilderie the four gang members had to cover  200 kilometres on horse across the open plains back into Victoria to their mountain hideout. This could be done in neither darkness nor daylight; it needed a big moon. Even the Kellys' demise at Glenrowan happened under a big moon, suggesting the night of the train derailment was chosen for escape.\nFitzgerald ended Gatsby by writing that \"â€¦for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder\".\nRefocus that startling sentence away from America toward the night sky.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:06:06.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
