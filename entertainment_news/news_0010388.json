I'm not going to give his ghost the satisfaction of giving me the day off.\" She insists on going to work to protest, but says, \"I'm not going to like, do work. I'm just going to check my email, turn the lights on and off, print some s***.\"\nShe promises Abbi she'll print her things as well, in order to really stick it to Columbus.\nIlana continues: \"I'd like to scalp him and show him and say, 'Gotcha b***h!'\"\nAs for the Christopher Columbus who directed \"Home Alone\"? Abbi and Ilana regard him as the \"real Christopher Columbus,\" and decide to celebrate him instead on Columbus Day.\nGo here for the NSFW video.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlrK5ihx1zM"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:36:50.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
