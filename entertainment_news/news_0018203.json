On Sept. 9, the former Partridge Family star was driving a 2014 Kia Sportage in Florida when he swerved and sideswiped a vehicle, the Daily Mail reports. According to eyewitnesses, he jumped out of his car -- which had sustained a lot of body damage as well as a flat tire -- and attempted to cover up his license plate before getting back into the car and driving off. Cassidy's license had been suspended stemming from three prior DUIs. Here's what's coming to (and leaving) Netflix in October Police found him at a local hospital, where he claimed he was at a scheduled appointment. They did not test him for drugs or alcohol. He has been charged with leaving the scene of an accident, having expired tags on his vehicle, making an improper lane change, and driving on a suspended license. The vehicle he struck had $12,000 in damages, and his own car was towed by AAA due to the extent of the damage to it. The man driving the other car was treated by paramedics at the scene and then transported to the hospital. The charges carry a maximum of 60 days in jail, six months' probation, and a $500 fine. In addition to his DUIs in 2010, 2013, and 2014, Cassidy filed for bankruptcy earlier this year , claiming $10 million in assets and debts. After his third DUI, his wife filed for divorce and he was sentenced to three months of live-in rehab.
