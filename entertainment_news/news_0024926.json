When he delivered a pizza to Chugach Covenant Church on Sunday, the pastor asked him what was his best-ever tip.\nWhen he replied $100, pastor Dan Krause asked him, \"How does a tip of $1,900 sound?\"\nFelber was very mindful of his heavenly surroundings and replied: \"Oh, heck no!\" He says it's the coolest thing that's ever happened to him.\nKrause says this was an opportunity to do something small that would really have a big impact on somebody's life.\nFelber has no plans to splurge since he needs new snow tires and has medical expenses. But he does plan to take his wife out for a good spaghetti dinner.\n ", "external_links": ["http://is.gd/9Fr43j"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:41:33.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
