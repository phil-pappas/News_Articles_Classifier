With this reformation the organization is redirecting its efforts to focus on \"the gamer with a life;\" those gamers who love playing games, but also have higher priorities in life -- such as a family or career -- that preclude them from playing games multiple hours every single day.\nLegion of Myth provides gaming reviews, blogs, and videos from the perspective of players who do not always have the ability or desire to spend a large amount of time researching a game as opposed to playing it. The organization also broadcasts a weekly live stream where the hosts talk about the games and gaming news important to its community.\nLegion of Myth's owner, John \"MaxLiao\" Schloe, states that the organization \"has had a couple of shaky years, but the new stakeholders have a sincere focus on the community and to the core values of the organization.\"\nAlex \"Garthon\" Marsh, a core stakeholder and primary host of the Legion of Myth weekly live stream tell us, \"Over the years Legion of Myth has always been there for me, with great people to go on raids or just chat with about games.\"\nLegion of Myth seeks to grow its both its passive and active community membership who have access to community events, commentary, and forums. Additionally, Its leadership is always looking for creative and respectful people who love gaming; who have the desire and capability to blog, write reviews, or create videos; and who would like to share knowledge and excitement to the weekly live stream.\nLearn more about Legion of Myth at http://legionofmyth.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:19:37.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
