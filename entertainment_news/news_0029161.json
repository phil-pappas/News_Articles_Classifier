(Dominic Lipinski/PA) \n“Even though we only stayed there for three weeks, that was our home, it was the place where we felt safe, it was the biggest event of our whole lives. It’s a bigger connection than just a hotel or whatever. It was amazing to go back and re-live everything.” \nBut the former Olympian says it didn’t make her regret her decision to retire in 2013, at the age of 23. We are all ready to go in our house! Summer is excited!

She’s only three months old, so she’s starting to come into her own and play with toys, hold herself a bit better, she’s more nosey and wants to interact and she likes it when she sees you, so it’s nice to engage bit more with her.” A great stay in @eastvillageLDN last night, can’t believe how much has changed since the London 2012 Olympics #MyE20 pic.twitter.com/QSDlvd1wdE \n— Becky Adlington (@BeckAdlington) September 16, 2015 \nShe said her and Harry also definitely want more children. \n“My husband is an only child and I’ve got sisters, and because Harry was an o⁮nly child he’s always wanted a big family. So we definitely want more, Harry wants four and I’m like, no babe.. .we’ll see how two goes!” \nRebecca Adlington returned to East Village, the former Athletes’ Village, three years on to see how the neighbourhood has changed.
