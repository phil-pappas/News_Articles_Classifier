I've been practising all the time but I can't do it. You've either got a knack for it or you haven't, and I can't!\"I do definitely think it's a new start and a new wardrobe for Whitney at the moment. She's also in a new house full of different characters. I think Linda Carter is going to be a huge influence on Whitney to be a strong woman. So Whitney's growing in front of everyone.\"Upcoming EastEnders episodes will also see Whitney continue her efforts to support Lee (Danny-Boy Hatchard) as he battles depression.Lee has been battling with his own private struggles for a while, but he's about to suffer a whole new setback when he inadvertently causes a terrible accident on the Square. © BBC When Lee is asked to fix a faulty fuse at Stacey Branning's flat and fails to do the job properly, it leads to Stacey suffering a nasty electric shock and being rushed to hospital.The shock incident takes place as Stacey (Lacey Turner) hosts an eventful Halloween party. Her loved ones will be frantic as they wait to hear whether she and her unborn baby will be okay.Discussing the future of the storyline, McGarty explained: \"Whitney is there to support Lee, so that's what I'm playing at the moment. Danny-Boy has done a lot of research and I've done some too. He's brilliant and he's taking it really seriously.\"You'll see that Whitney is just trying everything she can to get Lee through this. Depression isn't something that comes and goes, so she's just trying to be there for him really. She doesn't want to get Mick involved too much because Lee feels that he wants to be a strong son in the family. © BBC \"I would like Whitney and Lee to have a wedding, but as Shona I feel that it could be a bit like when you film Christmas and Halloween - when it then actually happens in real life it's a bit weird! \"But I think it'd be great for Whitney. She really likes Lee and she wants him to be the one, but at the moment it's a question of whether he can be, especially because of his depression.\"Discussing her future hopes for Whitney, McGarty explained that she'd like to see her confide in Linda over her 2011 sexual exploitation ordeal - believing that it could bring them closer after Linda's rape trauma. © BBC McGarty said: \"I have thought about that and I've always felt it would be quite nice for Whitney and Linda to talk about it. I don't think Linda knows what Whitney has gone through and I'd definitely like to work with Kellie Bright more. I think she's brilliant.\"I will be with the Carters this Christmas which will be nice. It's EastEnders and there's always a drama at Christmas. I think it'll be a good Christmas - we're in the process of getting ready to film it at the moment.\"EastEnders airs its dramatic hour-long Halloween episode on Friday, October 30 at 7.30pm on BBC One.EastEnders gets hour-long special as Halloween hits Albert SquareRead more EastEnders spoilers and newsDigital Spy Soap Scoop video - hit play below for gossip on more Gloved Hand Killer deaths in Hollyoaks, the reveal of Robert Sugden's shooter in Emmerdale, a drastic decision from Kathy Beale in EastEnders and Alya Nazir's guilt spiralling out of control in Coronation Street. function onTemplateLoaded(experienceID) { bcExp = brightcove.getExperience(experienceID); modVP = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.VIDEO_PLAYER); modExp = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.EXPERIENCE); modCon = bcExp.getModule(APIModules.CONTENT); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.BEGIN, onVideoStart); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.STOP, onVideoStop); modVP.addEventListener(BCMediaEvent.PROGRESS, onVideoProgress); } #_containermyExperience4551550723001 { height: 100%; } // InSkin integration parameters: InSkinParams['myInSkin14551550723001'] = { 'srv_SectionID': '', 'srv_SectionIDPlay': '123757', 'srv_Keywords': '', 'plr_ContentID': 'myExperience4551550723001', 'plr_ContentType': 'BRIGHTCOVE3', 'plr_ContentW': 558, 'plr_ContentH': 314, 'plr_NoSkinContentResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinContentW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinContentH': 348, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinResize': true, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinW': 618, 'plr_NoSkinInSkinH': 348, 'plr_ResizeOnHideSkin': true, 'plr_HideSkinOnExternalAd': 'all', 'plr_ShowSkinAfterExternalAd': true, 'cnt_SmartPlayer': true }; // create the InSkin object: var InSkinObject4551550723001 = new InSkin.Base('myInSkin14551550723001'); brightcove.createExperiences(); if (!navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) { InSkinObject4551550723001.init(); ai_type=\"video\"; } Get the Inside Soap magazine on your iPhone or iPad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:19:55.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
