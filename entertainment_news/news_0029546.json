I thought it was a really insensitive thing to say.\" \nDays after the episode aired, Damon issued an apology for offending people with his comments. \nMore recently, Damon made headlines for an interview with The Guardian in which he stated, \"Whether you’re straight or gay, people shouldn’t know anything about your sexuality because that’s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.\" \nHe clarified his stance on Tuesday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show : \"I was just trying to say actors are more effective when they’re a mystery, right? And somebody picked it up and said I said gay actors should get back in the closet. Which is like, I mean it’s stupid, but it is painful when things get said that you don’t believe.\" \nIn The Hollywood Reporter article, Damon also defends his friend Ben Affleck, whom he calls \"misunderstood.\" \"Ten years ago, the public image of him could not have been farther apart from who he actually is,\" he says. \"It was like he was being cast in a role, that he was a talentless kind of meathead, with his whole relationship with Jennifer Lopez. He just got cast as this person that he wasn't. \n\"It was just really painful. It was painful to be his friend, because it wasn't fair, you know?\" Damon continued. \"To my mind, nobody really got him at all. And through his work, he climbed from the bottom of the mountain all the way back up to the top and past where either of us had ever been.\" \nDamon's new space drama, The Martian, opens Friday. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:36:26.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
