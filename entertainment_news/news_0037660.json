He appears this year at number six. \nThe list was topped last year by Tate boss Sir Nicholas Serota, who has dropped to number five. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ai Weiwei topped the list in 2011 \nThe 16-member international jury placed Ai Weiwei at number two on the list. \nThe Chinese dissident artist, who was in London last month for the launch of a retrospective of his work at the Royal Academy , had topped the list in 2011. \nOther artists on the list include Hito Steyerl (at number 18), Theaster Gates (38) and Rick Lowe (89). \nThe Wirths, the co-presidents of Hauser & Wirth, have galleries in Zurich, London and New York and, last year, opened Hauser & Wirth Somerset , near the town of Bruton, which describes itself as a \"multi-purpose arts centre\". \nNext March, the Wirths are to open a new gallery space, led by museum curator Paul Schimmel, in Los Angeles. \n\"The Wirths' increased influence stems in part from what they have done to change the model of selling and promoting art,\" ArtReview said. \n\"As big art dealers are becoming ever better at selling art for high prices, and as collectors want to see themselves as more than just anonymous purchasers, the husband-and-wife-team understand that selling art objects isn't the whole story - the well-off want to be sold a lifestyle.\" \nThe ArtReview top 10 is: 1.
