Just how local residents would react to Lord Mayor Robert Doyle wearing a biscuit-tin medallion with Dame Edna's cheery face beaming from it is hard to imagine. But then Anna Davern's design is as much about the nature of jewellery as it is respecting local government authority. \nSince the mid-19th century the mayoral chain has been an emblem of the city's authority and the vestiges of power wielded by its mayor. \"These beautifully conceived and crafted objects represent power and prestige beyond the designated wearer, providing a connection to the past in ways contemporary society rarely reflects upon,\" says Jane Scott, co-curator of a new jewellery exhibition Mayoral Chain . \"This exhibition allows contemporary artists to explore the ideas and aesthetics of the mayoral chain as modern adornment.\"\nAlso known as a \"collar\", the City of Melbourne's extravagant chain carries two rows of 72 oval medallions. Each 18-carat gold medallion depicts Melbourne's crest, framed by the engraved name of successive mayors. From the chain hangs a detachable pendant that also bears the coat of arms in polychrome enamels. All that pomp depends on the circumstance. It's worn when functions require official regalia. The ornate jewellery is a variant on \"livery collars\", the grandest of the various forms of regalia dating back to the Middle Ages, according to Scott.\nPennie Jagiello's hand-carved pendant. Collected materials found along the Victorian coast. \n \"We gather strength as we go\" may be Melbourne's motto, but sometime around 1982 the mayors gave up. They didn't have the strength to carry their heavy mayoral chain with its rousing Aeneid quote. Under the growing strain of the chain, the council commissioned Kozminsky jewellers to produce a lightweight replica in gold-plated silver. But is it appropriate for the 21st century? How might we redesign it?\nAdvertisement \"The mayoral chain is quite an ugly thing,\" says Anna Davern of this embarrassment of riches. \"It's gauche and blingy and almost camp. I thought Edna was the perfect representation for camp Melbourne and my love of Melbourne.\"\nIn Davern's work Dame Edna floats above a 1950s Melbourne landscape on a found biscuit tin. Two rows of Styrofoam balls like fake pearls support the giant medallion. Like Barry Humphries himself, a figure with a keen sense of ritual and prestige, Davern affectionately punctures any lingering pomposity with her satiric kitsch ensemble. \nAnna Varendorff's folding block chain, brass and brass rivets.

After all, gold doesn't necessarily represent the values we cherish today around sustainability. Gold production not only requires risky toxic cyanide, it leaves ugly tailings which blight the landscape. On a practical level, gold is not financially feasible for a speculative exhibition. \nFor a certain kind of mayor, Marcos Guzman's signature material is both affordable and surprising – drinking straws. Remarkably the structure and form of his work most closely resembles the mayoral chain. \"He's not using gold, but he is using some of the same techniques one would use to build and manipulate gold in a seamless manner,\" co-curator Debbie Pryor says.\nGuzman's playful pop-coloured work question the ways of making, craftsmanship, the inherent value of a material, says Pryor. \"By using the mayoral chain as a starting point these craftspeople can explore materiality and ask why we value a piece of jewellery. Is it the material that's used, or the emotional attachment from the person that gives it to you; is it part of a ceremony?\"\nAlexi Freeman and Tessa Blazey's Dark Collar of Vees and Light Collar of Vees, acrylic, gold fill, jet, oxidised sterling silver, 50 cm H x 25cm W.

Then again, they are unlikely to have seen Kate Rohde's​ resin and wig-hair jewellery or Maree Clarke's kangaroo teeth necklaces. Pennie Jagiello​ recycles the discarded debris found on our beaches. Jagiello handcarves a broom handle to create her ornate interpretation of the mayor's medallion – from plastic. Chillingly, she says of her own brand of alchemy, \"while my work is not made of gold, it will last just as long\".\nMayoral Chain: Contemporary artists respond to the mayoral chain , Craft, 31 Flinders Lane, Melbourne, October 9 to November 28. craft.org.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:07:26.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
