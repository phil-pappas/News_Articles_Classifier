In a recent interview with E! News at Soul Cycle in Hollywood, the \"Cool for the Summer\" singer said that she didn't have guts to do nude photo shoot six months ago. \"I wouldn't have done that six months ago, because I didn't have the confidence that I do today,\" Demi confessed. \"I went from hating every inch of my body to showing every inch of my body to the entire world and without touching up anything.\" The 23-year-old singer then admitted that she wanted to deconstruct photoshop culture with her nude photo shoot. \"There was never a time in my career where I was completely stripped down, not just of makeup and not just of clothes, but no Photoshop either,\" Demi said. \"We live in a world where everything is touched up, even pictures that people post on Instagram now. So I wanted to put it out there, the opposite of what people are kind of expecting from me right now.\" Demi also revealed how terrible she felt when parts of her body had to be edited in the photos to conform to the ideal body standard. \"A lot of times I get frustrated because people will, without my consent, Photoshop my body and it doesn't look like my own body,\" she explained. \"Like, no no no, my thighs are bigger than that, can you put them back to the way they were? I've literally done that before where I'm like, 'No, put my legs back on me. Those aren't my legs.' \" Through her upcoming album \" Confident \" which will be released on Friday, October 16, Demi wanted to inspire people to be confident about their own body. \"I wanted to show people that with this album, I wanted to make a statement, and I want that statement to be empowering towards women. And I want to inspire other women,\" she explained. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:45:25.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
