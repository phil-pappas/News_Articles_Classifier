On the one hand we have the story of Thomas, Jonny and two Bens, college buddies who decide to tame some wild horses near the Mexican border and ride them all the way to Canada. It’s a survive-the-adventure doc. \nBut director Philip Baribeau also chooses to highlight the controversies surrounding the management of the country’s wild horse population, which numbers almost 50,000, plus another 10,000 burros. \nThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management is tasked with keeping the numbers manageable. Too many wild horses means ranchers can’t use the land for grazing. It also leaves the horses themselves at starvation levels, but killing the beasts is unpopular, and caging them is costly. \nBoth stories are interesting, but they don’t always sit comfortably in the same saddle. So we watch as the boys ride their mustangs through beautiful, dangerous landscapes and along trails that sometimes seem to exist only on their maps. And then we consider the competing needs of ranchers, their cattle, and the wild horses. \nThe men, as befits their cowboy image, are not the greatest talkers. They give a hearty “yee-haw” and an “adios” as they cross each state border on their way through Arizona, Utah, Wyoming and Montana and into Canada. Along the way they visit a rodeo and get drunk on Independence Day. And they try to keep their friendship alive through disagreements, setbacks and a five-month journey. \nThe film makes up for its subjects’ taciturn natures with gorgeous scenery and beautiful animals. It also pushes the mood a little too hard with a soundtrack that includes Roundup by Spindrift and Raise Some hell by the Dirt River Boys. \nBut Unbranded remains at its heart a paean to the western landscape. You can drive from Mexico to Canada in a Mustang, but you can’t really experience it fully without riding one. © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:01:55.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
