She talked about meeting Bradley Cooper at an event and being shocked when he happily engaged her in a thirty minute conversation. \nShe joked that she is pretty sure that this conversation means that the pair are now dating. \n“Am I dating Bradley Cooper? I don’t know how Hollywood works, but I’m pretty sure that I’m dating Bradley Cooper.” \nShe went on to say that she later changed her Facebook status, taking the joke to the next step to say that she is now engaged to Bradley Cooper. \nSo what does Bradley Cooper himself have to say about this? \nAccess Hollywood spoke with Bradley Cooper about his new engagement , jokingly congratulating him and asking him how he found out about his engagement. \n“Not on-air. I thought it was just going to be a secret, but then she decided to let the cat out of the bag.” \nBradley Cooper Opens Up About His Secret “Engagement” http://t.co/i0C1caa9lf pic.twitter.com/cuEH4Z8rQI \nBradley Cooper went on to confirm that he had seen Amy’s Saturday Night Live monologue, and that he had contacted her immediately afterwards. \n“I texted with her after. I was like, ‘That was hilarious.'” \nAs it turns out, this is not the first time that Amy has used Bradley Cooper as the butt of her jokes during comedy routines. \n“The truth is, I remember I met her and then she was on a talk show, and made up some story that I pretended to avoid her. And then I saw her on the red carpet and I was like ‘Hey man, you made up some bull**** story,’ and she was like, ‘oh, I’m sorry,’ so maybe she’s just making up for it now.” \nBradley Cooper is busy filming his latest movie co-starring Sienna Miller, Burnt , in which Bradley Cooper plays chef Adam Jones. \nThis is the second time that Bradley Cooper has starred against Sienna Miller, as the pair released American Sniper back in 2014. The latest is a world apart from the first collaboration, with Burnt being a comedy, in a real change of pace from the 2014 epic in which Bradley Cooper played an heroic Navy seal sniper. \nBradley Cooper has also recently been vocal regarding another of his former co-stars, Jennifer Lawrence, with whom he starred in American Hustle . \nSienna and Bradley support Jennifer Lawrence: http://t.co/QsbNLmzNxr pic.twitter.com/WPA28150rH \n— VOGUE.CO.UK (@BritishVogue) October 15, 2015 \nAccording to ABC News , Jennifer Lawrence recently wrote an essay on Hollywood’s gender pay gap , entitled “Why Do I Make Less Than My Co-Stars.” \nWeighing in on the issue, Bradley Cooper commended his former co-star for having the courage to speak out. \n“If you think that you only deserve a certain amount and that’s not correct, it’s about changing that mindset and sticking up for yourself the way that Sienna did.” \nThe gender pay gap issue in Hollywood is a hot topic at the moment for Bradley Cooper’s female co-stars, with Sienna Miller also recently opening up on the topic. \nThe Daily Mail reported that Sienna Miller recently turned down a role in a play because of the huge difference between the pay she was offered, and the pay offered to what would have been her male co-star. \n“I walked away from a play I wanted to do because I was offered less than half of what the other man was offered and it was just the two of us.” \nIt’s nice to know that Bradley Cooper freely supports his female colleagues: whether it’s being a good sport about being the brunt of Amy Schumer’s comedy routines, or supporting Sienna Miller and Jennifer Lawrence regarding Hollywood’s gender pay gap issues. \n[Photo: Larry French, Andrew Burton, Jason Merritt, John Phillips / Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:49:11.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
