(Magnolia Pictures) Tracy Swartz Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Olivia Wilde: Cast was \"hammered\" filming \"Drinking Buddies\" movie in Chicago \nOlivia Wilde had no problem finding drinking buddies on the Chicago set of \"Drinking Buddies.\" Wilde said she and cast members were \"hammered\" while filming the 2013 movie because beer on the set was cheaper than water. \nWilde, 31, starred with Anna Kendrick in the movie, directed by Chicago filmmaker Joe Swanberg, about co-workers at a brewery who share a mutual attraction. Wilde said Kendrick, 30, expressed confusion when she showed up to the set two weeks into the filming process. Some of the filming took place at Revolution Brewing's production facility in Avondale. \n\"She was like, 'What's happening? What are you guys doing?' and we were like, 'Oh, we forgot to tell you – the beer's all real and everyone's drunk. It's 10 a.m., welcome to 'Drinking Buddies,'\" Wilde said in a sneak peek of her \"Off Camera with Sam Jones\" interview posted online this week. \nWilde, who stars in \"Meadowland,\" which hit some theaters Friday, said her mother encouraged her growing up to sign up for improv classes at Second City. \n\"She said, 'Okay, you should study improv. You should work at Second City – and Second City's where a lot of these people trained – you have to work very hard and you have to learn from them. And then you audition and then maybe you get cast on the show and then you have to keep working hard,'\" said Wilde, who was raised in the Northeast. \"I remember this conversation now and I'm in awe of my mom for speaking to me like an adult, taking my dream seriously.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:19:45.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
