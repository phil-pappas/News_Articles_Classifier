The two had been inseparable since their kindergarten years. They attended the same schools while growing up and considered themselves to be more of sisters than friends. Their relationship epitomized true friendship; they saw each other through every phase of life from puberty, first crush, teenage troubles, bad dates, marriage, childbirth and raising their children to providing emotional support. \nNow in their late thirties, both women are enjoying fruitfulness in their marriage, finances as well as other aspects of their lives despite life’s challenges. One evening, Akosua received a call from Yaa’s eldest child prompting her to head to the hospital because Yaa was involved in a terrible accident. By the time Akosua arrived at the hospital, her best friend had died. It was surreal. Akosua had just spoken to her friend not long ago. \nDays passed and Akosua was left with a hurting heart and memories of her friend. As she sat with family at the funeral, amidst her sorrow, her heart suddenly began to absorb a sense of peace and calming joy evoked by Horatio Spafford’s song ‘It is Well With my Soul.’ In that moment Akosua knew God was speaking to her. She knew that she had to surrender everything to God and somehow felt assured that her friend was in a better place. \nIn our time of grief and difficulty, God speaks to us in so many ways. It could be through his word, your surroundings, a child, a reassuring feeling that he’s with you. God spoke to Akosua through a song. No matter what our situation, God is ever ready to comfort us and when his word comes we must learn how to recognize his voice and trust wholeheartedly that he’s got us.
