Members of his security detail were arrested and residents in surrounding areas were told to vacate the area. A large military and police presence remained outside the house.\nDhlakama's party, Renamo, waged a 16-year civil war against the ruling Frelimo party, which ended with a 1992 peace agreement. Tensions have resurfaced, however, in the last few years, including in the run-up to fractious national elections last October, which Renamo lost.\nThe government has given no reason for the arrest, although it said last month the shootout on September 25 began when Dhlakama's security detail opened fire on a civilian taxi. Renamo disputes that, saying Dhlakama's motorcade was ambushed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:37:17.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
