But before you start gleefully anticipating your Wild West/\"Beauty and the Beast\" crossover emoji fanfic opportunities, keep in mind that it can take a long time for an emoji proposal to actually make it on to a phone or computer.\nThe Unicode Consortium won't consider the current list until May of next year, for release in June. But even if it's approved, that doesn't mean that your Android or iPhone will immediately make the new emoji available.\nThe Unicode standard simply establishes a baseline so that, among other things, emoji across different platforms can remain compatible with each other. Beyond that, each company comes up with its own design for the emoji, choosing whether or not to support it on their individual platforms.\nThat can lead to a lot of variation, both visually and time-wise, in the rollout of new emoji.\nIt took more than a year for Microsoft to start supporting the middle finger emoji after Unicode approved it. And we were not very impressed with how Apple chose to render the taco emoji.\nIf some of the following proposed emoji sound familiar, that's because 38 members of the Unicode 9 candidate list were released earlier this year. And another list of 15 emoji included in October's proposals started circulating over the summer.\nAnyway, here they are. You can view sample images for each emoji at http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html , but keep in mind, as we explained, that these don't necessarily illustrate what the emoji would look like on your phone if approved and put into use:\nFACE WITH COWBOY HAT\nCLOWN FACE\nNAUSEATED FACE\nROLLING ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING\nDROOLING FACE\nLYING FACE\nSNEEZING FACE\nPRINCE\nMAN IN TUXEDO\nMOTHER CHRISTMAS\nFACE PALM\nSHRUG\nPREGNANT WOMAN\nSELFIE\nMAN DANCING\nCALL ME HAND\nRAISED BACK OF HAND\nLEFT-FACING FIST\nRIGHT-FACING FIST\nHANDSHAKE\nHAND WITH FIRST AND SECOND FINGERS CROSSED\nBLACK HEART\nEAGLE\nDUCK\nBAT\nSHARK\nOWL\nFOX FACE\nBUTTERFLY\nDEER\nGORILLA\nLIZARD\nRHINOCEROS\nWILTED FLOWER\nCROISSANT\nAVOCADO\nCUCUMBER\nBACON\nPOTATO\nCARROT\nBAGUETTE BREAD\nGREEN SALAD\nSHALLOW PAN OF FOOD\nSTUFFED FLATBREAD\nCLINKING GLASSES\nTUMBLER GLASS\nSPOON\nOCTAGONAL SIGN\nSHOPPING TROLLEY\nSCOOTER\nMOTOR SCOOTER\nCANOE\nPERSON DOING CARTWHEEL\nJUGGLING\nWRESTLERS\nBOXING GLOVE\nMARTIAL ARTS UNIFORM\nWATER POLO\nHANDBALL\nGOAL NET\nRIFLE\nMODERN PENTATHLON\nFENCER\nFIRST PLACE MEDAL\nSECOND PLACE MEDAL\nTHIRD PLACE MEDAL\nDRUM WITH DRUMSTICKS\n Business Technology Internet Washington Post", "external_links": ["http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html", "https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-17T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:10:17.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
