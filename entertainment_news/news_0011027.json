The film begins with Malala telling us the story of how she got her name, a tale that concludes with a Joan of Arc-like Afghan girl telling Afghan soldiers that it is “better to live like lion for one day than live like a slave for 100 years.” The girl in that story is later shot and killed.\nYes, her father named her Malala. The girl — who is from the Swat Valley in Pakistan, which she misses dearly in her forced exile — is the daughter of a teacher father and an ardent foe of the Taliban. When this modern-day Malala stood up to the Taliban and advocated sending Pakistani girls to school in direct opposition to Taliban policy, she was shot in the face in 2012 (other schoolgirls were also wounded). Malala and her father Ziauddin have been told she will be shot if she ever returns to Pakistan.\nIn the meantime, Malala has been on a world tour, appearing on such venues as “The Daily Show” and using social media to spread the gospel of education for girls in the hardest-pressed nations on the planet. It is noble work to be sure, and Malala is an admirable role model.\nBut the film, which features dubious “dramatic reconstructions” and emphatic musical cues, fails to address the resurgence of the Taliban in such endlessly war-torn areas as Pakistan and Afghanistan and instead focuses its attention narrowly on the uplifting and heroic tale of Malala, and I often found it a dull offshoot of the cult of celebrity.\n(“He Named Me Malala” contains scenes of anguish and sorrow.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:37:40.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
