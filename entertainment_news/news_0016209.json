Under a pilot program, Quicken, which makes loans and sells them to Freddie, will be adapting lending for unique circumstances, like extended families that pool resources and live in a single home together, said Chris Boyle, senior vice president for Freddie Mac.\n\"We will be spending time with Quicken on outreach and counseling,\" she said. Millennials may find it is less expensive to buy a home with a 3 percent down payment than to continue renting at today's high rents, she said.\nFurther, mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae announced changes of its own, including cutting out bureaucratic headaches like submitting pay stubs. In addition, it will broaden how credit is checked so people without traditional high credit scores may qualify for a mortgage.\nBoth changes were announced this week at the Mortgage Bankers Association conference in San Diego. Since the housing bust in 2007 and related financial crisis, getting a loan has been difficult â€” even for people with pristine credit backgrounds. After losing their old way of selling loans to investors, lenders have been reluctant to lend, and regulators have added more stringent requirements. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in lawsuits related to pre-mortgage crash practices remain.\nHome mortgage debt outstanding fell $19 billion yearly to bring the total to $9.4 trillion in the second quarter, according to Ben Garber, economist for Moody's Analytics. That is still \"well under the record high of $10.7 trillion in 2008,\" he said.\nWhile loans are likely to continue to be more difficult to get than in the pre-crisis days, the newly announced practices may ease conditions a bit. With credit scoring agencies like TransUnion, Fannie Mae will be accepting loans based on different credit scoring practices.\nTransUnion is using what's called \"trended credit data.\" It looks at the person's credit more broadly than simply a momentary snapshot. For example, credit traditionally is examined at a point in time, and if a person happens to have a lot charged on a credit card that day, they may not look worthy of a loan. But with trended data, the person is examined over a longer period. If they pay off the large amount of credit quickly, it could make them more worthy of a loan. If they simply make small payments, it could make them less worthy.\nChris Cartwright, TransUnion's president of U.S. Information Services, said, \"TransUnion research has found that approximately 26.5 million consumers who previously could not be scored can be effectively scored using trended credit data. The percentage of consumers in the super prime risk tier, who generally have the greatest access to new loans at the lowest pricing, would increase from 12 percent of the population to nearly 21 percent.\"\ngmarksjarvis@tribpub.com\nTwitter @gailmarksjarvis\n Fannie Mae Freddie Mac Moody's Corporation Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626ab2f/turbine/ct-freddie-mac-quicken-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:11:53.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
