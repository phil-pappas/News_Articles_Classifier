READ MORE: Daniel Craig 'Doesn't Give A Shit' Who Plays 007 In The Future \nThe presenter, and her fellow ‘Good Morning Britain’ hosts, are obviously getting right in the mood for ‘Spectre’ , as they've have undergone special 007 makeovers. \nIn a new photo-shoot, Susanna is seen posing in a string of Bond-like poses, while wearing a black tuxedo, inspired by the man himself. \nSusanna will take her morning coffee stirred... not shaken (no but seriously, don't shake it) \nSusanna isn’t the only one, though, as her co-hosts Charlotte Hawkins and Kate Garraway have also donned bow-ties for the new photos, which coincide with the release of the 24th ‘Bond’ film at the end of October, and a special series of 'Bond'-themed segments on 'GMB'. \nAMAZING \nBen Shephard and Sean Fletcher also look their usual suave selves, with Ben standing out by opting for a white tuxedo, while even ‘GMB’ entertainment reporter Richard Arnold is getting in on the act. \nCheck out all the photos below (story continues after the gallery): Close 'Good Morning Britain' Go 'Bond' of ✖ close Current Slide \nThankfully, we’re pleased to see that the photos were obviously taken before Piers Morgan ’s addition to the presenting team, as he’s notably absent from the line-up. \nWe can’t even pretend to hide our relief, the idea of Piers posing as ‘The Man With The Golden Gun’ is a little too much for us to handle. \nEarlier this week, it was confirmed that, following a guest stint on the show back in April, Piers would be joining ‘GMB’ for three days a week, beginning next month . \n‘Spectre’ - sadly minus Susanna and co. - arrives in UK cinemas on 26 October. Close 11 Moments Susanna Reid Won At Life of   When Susanna's dress came unfastened during a live broadcast, did you see her break a sweat? No, instead the always-calm-and-collected presenter simply shuffled off camera and slipped into another one. She'd probably have got away with it too, if Kate Garraway could have resisted telling the entire nation what was happening off-screen... Susanna in the final four with Natalie Gumede, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Abbey Clancy made for one of the most exciting 'Strictly Come Dancing' finales ever. Over the course of the competition, Susanna wowed us with a number of different routines, but this was definitely one of our favourites. What a woman. Interviewing 'Downton' star Dan Stevens on 'Good Morning Britain', Susanna innocently asked him if he'd had to \"beat off a lot of men\" to bag his latest film role, then clearly had no idea why the crew around her couldn't stop laughing. Oh, Susanna... Look at her go! Susanna ran the race in 5hr 12 mins, marathon fans, but a year later said she would never do it again. Not what you want to see when you're tucking into your cornflakes, is it? There's not much to not love about this photo, if we're being honest. Susanna Reid. In a pink jumpsuit. And high heels. Leaping around a flower garden. Beautiful stuff. Every celeb and their grannies - quite literally in some cases - tried the Ice Bucket Challenge in the summer of 2014, but did any of them brave it on live telly like Susanna did? Well... yes. A couple did. But none of them did it as well as her. Well you would, wouldn't you? Well you would, wouldn't you? Because who doesn't want a breathy exchange between a pop star and a breakfast telly presenter at 8.58 in the morning? For what it's worth, we know for a fact Susanna looks good on the dance floor, so Alex Turner is technically right. Flirting with David Cameron? Sorry but there are some things, Susanna, we just can't forgive. Even from you.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:45:44.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
