Austin returns to his St. Charles roots Sunday for a free, live performance at the Arcada Theatre.\nAustin is a graduate of St. Charles North High School where he participated in three of the school's vocal groups. He was also active in the theater productions at the school. He credits the music staff at Haines Middle School and St. Charles North with the discovery and development of his singing talents.\nPrior to his televised audition on \"The Voice,\" Austin had not performed live since a starring role in a school musical.\nTo celebrate those roots, several guests from the St. Charles area will join Austin and perform a number of popular cover songs.\nAmong those songs will be \"Lay Me Down,\" the Sam Smith hit Austin sang for his audition on \"The Voice.\" He was chosen by pop star Gwen Stefani during that audition for a spot on the show.\nThe performance is free and begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Arcada, 105 E.
