The second teaser trailer, which debuted in April, has more than 64 million views on YouTube to date. \nHigh demand has seen many fans complain of websites crashing as they tried to buy tickets for the film. (Disney/Lucasfilm Ltd/PA) \nThe trailer opens with Daisy Ridley’s character Rey and John Boyega’s Finn questioning their places in the galaxy, before new antagonist Kylo Ren, played by Girls star Adam Driver, promises to finish what Darth Vader started. \nThere are also glimpses of the stars of the original trilogy, with Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Peter Mayhew’s Chewbacca appearing, as well as a fleeting glimpse of Carrie Fisher as Leia. Missing from the footage is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker but there are sweeping shots of the Millennium Falcon, Storm Troopers and plenty of action accompanied by a soaring score to keep fans happy.

I think it looks absolutely awesome. So pumped for #StarWars ! Plus I'm down for anything with #OscarIsaac https://t.co/QKls0AEqhp \n— chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) October 20, 2015 Some lovely images in the new @StarWars trailer plus finally little bit of plot. And and and beautiful John Williams music. \n— lizo mzimba (@lizo_mzimba) October 20, 2015 \nThe trailer’s release coincides with the launch of ticket sales for the film and comes directly after the unveiling of the theatrical poster. \nHowever, fans in the UK were left frustrated after cinema websites struggled to cope with demand when the advance tickets went on sale on Monday morning at 8am. The Force is not strong with the Odeon website today. Took Yoda's advice too literally they did; load or do not, there is no try. #StarWars \n— Joel Tennant (@ThatTennantGuy) October 19, 2015 Is \"I'm sorry, I was trying to book Star Wars tickets but the Odeon site kept crashing\" a valid excuse for being late for work? \n— Ailsa Scott (@ailsas) October 19, 2015 \nCinema chains responded to fans’ annoyance. \nhttps://twitter.com/ODEONCinemas/status/656140505080795136 Our #StarWars tickets have been flying off the shelves at 5 past lightspeed. Dont miss out: http://t.co/GW5xqRoq6a https://t.co/YxCynYYwdK \n— Vue Cinemas (@vuecinemas) October 19, 2015 \nThe film is a continuation of the saga created by George Lucas and is set 30 years after Star Wars: Episode VI – Return Of The Jedi. It is directed by JJ Abrams and also stars Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels and Max von Sydow. \nGlimpses of the film have trickled out since the first teaser trailer was unveiled in November 2014. Other footage, including a behind-the-scenes reel shown at Comic-Con and a special Instagram scene, have left fans hungry for more and the full-length trailer is the most substantial insight into the finished movie so far.
