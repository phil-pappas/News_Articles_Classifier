Take for a example the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. Every time you hear this song played on the radio or television or sang at karaoke bars, you easily recall the golden days of rock and all there is to it, from fashion to Woodstock concerts to the lifestyle during that era. To some it flashes back special events in their life and it sort of became a soundtrack of a certain generation as well. \nWatching a concert wherein you hear your favorite songs gives you the same feeling of nostalgia. ADVERTISEMENT \nNow, if you’re into that kind of vibe and you expect songs to bring back memories of youthful years and reminisce the golden era of rock, you shouldn’t miss out One Night of Queen, a concert that pays homage to one of the greatest bands of all time. \nPerformed by Gary Mullen and The Works, One Night of Queen is a two-hour energy-filled concert that never fails to amaze their audience that had even toddlers and grandparents dancing inside the concert halls and venues around the world. \nGary’s spot-on imitation of the legendary frontman of the Queen, Freddie Mercury, has been well-reviewed by international critics which makes him the closest thing to seeing the iconic singer perform live. \nFor more than a decade now, Gary Mullen and The Works have been touring the world to bring to life the timeless rock anthems of Queen. And on October 24 and 25 at The Theater at Solaire, they’ll finally set their foot on Philippine concert stage. \nRe-live Queen’s most-lauded performances with songs such as “Radio Gaga”, “A Kind of Magic”, “Another One Bites the Dust”, “Love of My Life”, “We Are The Champions”, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “I Want to Break Free”, “We Will Rock You”, to name a few. \nMullen is excited to perform in Manila because he learned that Filipinos love the music of Queen. “We will definitely have a good time as we rock the night away,” says the best Freddie Mercury tribute artist. \nOne night of Queen is proudly presented by Solaire Resorts & Casino, MKFAE Productions and Royal Chimes Concerts and Events Inc. The New World Manila Bay Hotel is the official residence of Gary Mullen and The Works.
