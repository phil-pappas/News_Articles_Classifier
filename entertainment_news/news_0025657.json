The total number of cases of the mosquito-borne disease has reached 6,486. Officials said that mortality rates have been highest this season. In 2010, Delhi had reported eight deaths and 6,259 cases in the entire season.\n\"This is the worst dengue outbreak Delhi has witnessed in the past decade. Pre-dominance of dengue strains type-II and type-IV have caused this, but the failure of civic bodies to check mosquito breeding is responsible too,\" said a health official.\nData released by South Corporation on Thursday showed over 500 fresh cases and eight dengue deaths being reported in the last five days. The youngest to fall prey was seven-month-old Peeru of Rohini, while the oldest victim was identified as 70-year-old Munia of Sant Nagar.\nThe health ministry on Thursday held a meeting with senior officials to discuss the situation and asked them to mobilise community support to step up prevention efforts against dengue.\nSources said New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has issued notice to Sanskriti School for mosquito breeding in their premises. Earlier, a 16-year-old old student of the school had succumbed to the disease. \"We found larvae of dengue mosquitoes in a few vessels kept on the school gate so we issue a notice,\" a senior NDMC official said.\nAIIMS has also been issued multiple notices but no action has been taken by them to check breeding. \"The institute has been challaned nine times and 17 notices have been issued,\" the official said.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:27:23.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
