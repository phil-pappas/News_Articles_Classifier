Shalloway and Banny Galicia, 21, who was in a mobile home, were killed.\nWhether Shalloway was distracted, suffered a medical problem or encountered some other crisis may never be known. The four-seat plane burst into fire and was so badly burned that investigators were unable to read the cockpit instruments.\nHowever, they were able to ascertain that the plane's control surfaces, including ailerons and rudders, appeared to be in working order prior to the crash. Also, there were no obvious problems with the engine, according to the report.\nMaintenance records indicated the plane received a thorough annual inspection on May 25. The plane was owned by Flyers Inc. of Boynton Beach.\nOn the day of the accident, Shalloway took off from the Lantana airport and flew to the Kissimmee Gateway Airport, near Orlando. He had the plane refueled with 20 gallons of aviation gasoline.\nHe took off seven hours later. Although no flight plan was filed, air traffic controllers communicated with him and monitored his progress via radar.\nWhile approaching Lantana, Shalloway announced to other planes on a common radio frequency that he was three miles east of the airport and planning to land on Runway 15, which runs to the southeast.\nShalloway made one more radio call, to advise other pilots he was perpendicular to the runway and close to final approach. \"No other communications were received from the pilot,\" Boggs wrote in the report.\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, Shalloway was issued a private pilot license on May 4, 2012, and passed a required medical exam on Sept. 23. At the time of that exam, Shalloway reported he had a total of 250 hours of flight experience.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742030", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742030&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-1742030&h=Report%3A+Plane+that+crashed+into+Florida+mobile+home+park+had+no+obvious+malfunction"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:04:50.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
