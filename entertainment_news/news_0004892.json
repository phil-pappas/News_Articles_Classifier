The team hasn't won that title since 1908 and hasn't even played in a World Series since 1945.\n\"We're all waiting for it to happen,\" Kuss said. \"I always wanted them to win, and I think it's going to happen now. I have confidence in the Cubs, and I love the Cubs; they're good, nice guys.\"\nWhile Kuss said she doesn't have specific memories of the 1945 World Series, fellow Birches resident Shirley Petersen, 84, does.\n\"I went to a game in 1945, but they lost,\" she said. \"I've been a real big Cubs fan since I was 12. My dad used to take me to the game, and when he stopped taking me I went by myself.\"\nPetersen said a friend's brother was able to get tickets for the 1945 World Series game.\n\"I was very exciting, just being able to go and see the game like that,\" she said. \"It's pretty exciting now, too.

Her current favorite is Anthony Rizzo.\n\"Yeah, I really like him,\" she said. \"He hits a nice ball.\"\nEdna Mae Campbell, 93, is another Birches resident who has been enjoying watching the Cubs success this year.\n\"I've been a Cubs fan forever,\" she said. \"Win or lose, I'm always a Cubs fan, and I always watch, even when they were losing.\"\nWhile she watches the Cubs on TV, win or lose, Campbell is especially enjoying the success of the 2015 Cubs.\n\"It's been very exciting, and I think they're going to win the World Series,\" she said. \"I think they'll win it because I want them to.\"\nWrigley illustrated: The crazy stuff Cubs fans do to help the team win Nausheen Husain and Rick Tuma Euphoria swept across the North Side and beyond after the Cubs eliminated the Cardinals 8-6 Tuesday, winning a playoff series at Wrigley Field for the first time ever.
