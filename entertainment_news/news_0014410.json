ISTOCK PHOTO Should parents be worried about \"super lice\" that are resistant to treatment? Should parents be worried about \"super lice\" that are resistant to treatment? (ISTOCK PHOTO) Jennifer Sheehan Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Expert: Most kids get lice through head to head contact. \nTrips to the school nurse's office are common during elementary school. \nHeight and weight are checked, eyesight is tested ... and scalps are searched for lice. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 6 to 12 million head-lice infestations take place each year in the United States. \nThis year there's concern about the growing problem of \"super lice,\" or drug-resistant lice that fend off the regular over-the-counter as well as prescription treatments. \nWhat's the best way to prevent your kids from getting lice? We talk with Sue Madeja, nursing director with the Bethlehem Health Bureau. \nQ: What are lice and how are they transmitted? \nA: Head lice are tiny parasites, grayish to reddish brown in color, which depend on human blood for survival. Lice feed every three to four hours and therefore are unlikely to leave their food supply. \nThe female lice lay eggs called \"nits,\" which attach to the hair shaft, making them difficult to remove. These eggs hatch in seven to 10 days. Lice can live about 30 days. They cannot jump or fly based on their body type, but they can travel very fast ... so they run to their feeding sources. They have strong survival skills, running to the most desirable environment. \nLice have hair preferences, preferring straight, clean hair, more often avoiding very curly hair and hair with different textures. Long hair styles and more displays of physical affection make lice more common in girls. A louse (one lice) rarely survives longer than 24 hours off a human host. \nBecause of the method of travel \"head to head (hair to hair),\" direct contact is the major way lice are transmitted to another child/person. Less than 2 percent of the time, lice are transmitted via other objects (hats, combs, brushes, etc.) \nQ: There's been a lot of talk about \"super lice.\" Should parents be concerned? \nA: It has been thought that the over-treatment and misuse of lice treatment products with the same insecticides (pediculicides) have resulted in lice developing resistance to some lice treatment products (pyrethrins). The lice develop strong survival skills and adapt to a new environment. Some studies by Harvard University have shown evidence of developing resistance in some lice. \nThe apparent annual and seasonal \"increases'' in lice prevalence are most likely attributable to peculiarities in monitoring activities. Concentrating screenings at the beginning of the school year will result in identification of children with head lice. The increased screening and discussion of the issue make the problem seem bigger. Having regular head checks during the school year and, if live lice are seen, treating adequately and appropriately, checking all family members, treating only those identified with live lice, and notifying necessary contacts including school personnel would reduce the incidence of lice. This would make back-to-school lice episodes just a nuisance and nothing more. \nQ: What are some of the ways children can prevent getting lice? \nA: Avoid sharing objects used on the head (combs/brushes/hats), reduce physical head-to-head contact, avoid sleeping together (common at sleep-over parties with children). \nQ: Should parents check their children for lice? \nA: Yes, routine head checks for head lice are recommended to identify the problem early, especially once schools starts. If there is any evidence of repeated head scratching, often seen as the first sign of head lice infestation, head checks should be done. Unfortunately, itching might not start until 10 to 14 days following the lice arrival, thus the need for regular head checks. The itching is caused by an allergic reaction to the saliva of the lice excreted during feeding. If there are few lice, the itching may not be apparent until days later. Occasionally, someone may not be allergic to the saliva and no itching will be noted. In this case, there would be no symptoms of head lice unless a head check is conducted. \nHead checks need to be done by separating segments of hair in paper-thin segments using a comb or pick of good quality, looking for live lice (crawling insects), nits (unmovable eggs) and nymphs (small, slow-moving baby lice). Nymphs often resemble specks of pepper on the head but if touched will scatter. The best place to start a head check is at the back of the neck, around the ears and under the bangs where lice like to hide. Often this is where most of the nits (eggs) will be found, indicating the possibility of live lice. \nQ: Is it true that if your child practices poor hygiene, they are more likely to get lice? \nA: No. Lice have no preference but feeding on human blood. In reality, clean, non-oily hair makes it easier for the glue used to attach eggs to secure nits to the hair shaft and for the lice to move easily on the head. \nQ: If your child comes home with lice, what are the best treatments? \nA: Most lice treatments sold or prescribed have some amount of pesticides, insecticides or chemicals. These products must be used according to the package directions or they can be harmful. These products can be especially toxic in young children. Home remedies have been used with varying results but are generally messy and time-intensive, with varying success. The need to remove nits strand by strand is still necessary to reduce potential reinfection. \nQ: Some parents don't want to use chemical treatments. Are there any natural treatments available? \nA: Natural ways to control lice include use of a good lice comb with daily regular combing of the head. This process must be done in conjunction with regular head checks of all family members. \"Nitpicking\" also will ensure new lice do not hatch, creating a new generation. \nUse of mayonnaise, olive oil and other food products have shown minimal results in killing lice and are messy to clean up. The use of essential oils has no data supporting claims of efficacy. \nStrand-by-strand removal of lice and nits, daily combing with a good-quality lice comb (not the small plastic ones) and treatment with a pediculicide will need to occur if evidence of live lice exists in seven days. \nQ: If a child has lice, should the parents destroy bedding and coats? \nA: It is thought now that the environment has less to do with transmission of head lice than before. Thinking about the last 24 hours and what exposure took place is the first place to start. Any items having direct contact with an individual having head lice should be washed in hot water (as hot as can be tolerated) or placed in a hot dryer. If this is not possible, bedding, stuffed animals, coats and hats should be placed in plastic bags, and left secured and unopened for seven to 14 days. Brushes, combs, hair accessories can be soaked in hot soapy water for 15 minutes or longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:50:52.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
