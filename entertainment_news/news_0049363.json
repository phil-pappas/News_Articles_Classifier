Fans took the initiative of organising several audio launches going with the concept of the film. Now, Chiranjeevi Sarja's new film Ramleela is making such things official.\nThere will be six audio launch programmes for the film. There will be an audio launch programme for each of the five songs, and then a finale where all the songs will be released together! The first of the five songs was released by Dhruva Sarja, brother of Chiru, on Tuesday. The film team felicitated Dhruva on his birthday and made it a double occassion.\nThe song, Teri Beautiful Ankhen is sung by Puneeth Rajkumar. Explaining the reason for the multiple audio launch functions, producer Soundarya Jagadish said, \"Each song in the film has its own importance and specialty. We thought we cannot provide justice in promoting them in just one big programme.\nThe idea behind releasing each song individually is to show audience that each song is special. This particular song was shot in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. This is the first Kannada film shot there. Chiranjeevi Sarja is seen in 12 different getups in this song. There are some special computer graphics too. Moreover Puneeth Rajkumar has sung the song. Raghavendra Rajkumar praised the meaning in the lyrics during recording and predicted it will be a big hit. Each week we will release one song and reveal the uniqueness of each of them. In the end, we will have a regular audio launch function as well.\" The film is directed by Vijay Kiran and pairs Chiranjeevi Sarja and Amulya for the first time.
