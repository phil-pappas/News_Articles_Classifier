A lot. Drake's 'Hotline Bling' video gets the 'Cosby Show' treatment and more Drake showed us his dance moves in his \"Hotline Bling\" music video. Apple Music screenshot Travel Deals Layla A. Jones Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015, 11:49 AM \nMonday night Drake, the actor-turned-rapper from Toronto, released his “Hotline Bling” music video through Apple Music. The song is about a woman that got away from Drizzy, and his internal grappling with the fact that she has, indeed, moved on quite well. So what would the video look like? Would it show said woman traveling around the world and “running out of pages in [her] passport?” Would it show Drake following said woman around as she begins “wearing less and going out more?” \nNo. \n“Hotline Bling” shows Drake dancing. A lot. \nNaturally, the Internet took hold of Drake’s dad dance moves and turned them into a huge meme, creating the #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat hashtag showing down to everything from Wii Tennis tracks to Latin dance music. \nThe web didn’t miss the chance to exploit Drake’s sitcom-intro-themed music video set. Sorry, Cos. It's the \"Aubrey Show\" now. — drake dancing to (@DRAKEDANClNG) October 20, 2015 \nMaybe not the new \"Star Wars,\" but still out of this world.

Make Drake dance to it. — drake dancing to (@DRAKEDANClNG) October 20, 2015 \n\"Hotline Bling\" sampled D.R.A.M.'s Latin-inspired \"Cha Cha\" melody. This mashup shows Drake can do more than just cha-cha. \"Mambo No. 5,\" anyone? How has nobody done this one yet? #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat #HotlineBling pic.twitter.com/8CO3f6tmlW — Brandon Alexander (@brandocalreezy) October 20, 2015 \nIt's almost as if Drake hit his \"Hotline Bling\" moves with this parody video in mind. He moves to the left and right just as the singer says the words in Spanish. This one is my favorite so far. #DrakeAlwaysOnBeat pic.twitter.com/lOaltKoYme — Kristin Klingshirn (@KrisKling) October 20, 2015 \nTwitter would be amiss if there wasn't some type of Serena Williams-inspired Drake meme. (He's rumored to be dating the superstar athlete). The Wii Tennis setting was a very nice touch.

But one thing is clear from this apparent behind the scenes take. The on set audience loved Drizzy’s dance moves and the rapper just had fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:20:57.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
