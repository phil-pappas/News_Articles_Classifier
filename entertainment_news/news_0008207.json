Ryan Doncsecz plays Frank Abagnale Jr. in the Munopco production of the Tony Award-winning musical comedy 'Catch Me If You Can.' It runs Friday through Sunday at the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Allentown. (EMILY PAINE / THE MORNING CALL) Kathy Lauer-Williams Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call 'It's not your father's Munopco anymore' \nAllentown's oldest community theater, Munopco Theatre Company, is hoping to forge a new beginning with the Valley premiere of the 2011 Terrence McNally Broadway musical \"Catch Me If You Can.\" \nMunopco lost its long-time director Larry Williams and his wife Terri Williams, Munopco president, in June when they moved to Florida. The company hopes to make a statement that it's better than ever with the Tony-nominated musical. \nDirector Dan Petrovich says after Williams left, the board rallied people to step up and produce a show for the fall. \n\"We knew if we stayed dark for a year the company would close and we didn't want to see that happen,\" Petrovich says. \nHe says he asked Frank Anonia and Kelly Jean Graham to come on board as music director and choreographer. \nHe says Munopco is known for old-fashioned musicals with large casts, but they decided to do something different and take a risk. \n\"We had to step outside the box and see what happens,\" he says. \"We needed to go big or go home.\" \nPetrovich had seen the show on Broadway and loved it. \n\"It was colorful and action-packed music,\" he says. \nAnonia says the music and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman, who also did \"Hairspray,\" is brassy, high energy and catchy. There are lots of big production numbers. \nPetrovich says there was a lot of interest in the show, and 50 people, from teens to seniors, auditioned for 30 roles. \n\"We feel this show is a turning point for us,\" he says. \"It's not your father's Munopco anymore. We respect the past but we also embrace the future. We needed to make a statement that things have changed.\" \nThe musical tells the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a con man who, from ages 16-21, posed as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor and a lawyer while writing millions of dollars of bad checks, as FBI agent Carl Hanratty relentlessly pursued him. Today, Abagnale is a respected authority on forgery, embezzlement and secure documents, and has been associated with the FBI for more than four decades. \nPetrovich says he was inspired by Vegas floor shows and 1960s-era TV shows such as \"The Lawrence Welk Show,\" for the big production numbers. \nThe ensemble includes students and graduates from Dieruff, Northwestern Lehigh, Parkland and Whitehall High Schools. Petrovich describes Graham's choreography as \"fresh, new and exciting.\" \n\"We've really assembled a little bit of the old with a little bit of the new,\" Anonia says. \"The young people bring a lot of enthusiasm to the theater that hasn't been around for a long time. It's a very different kind of show and we're hoping it attracts a different type of crowd and demonstrates that Munopco does all kinds of shows.\" \nThe musical is based on Dreamworks' major motion picture of the same name, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. The Broadway musical was nominated for four Tony Awards, with Norbert Leo Butz winning for his role as Hanratty. \nRyan Doncsecz plays Frank Abagnale Jr. and Kerry McGuire is Hanratty. The cast also includes Beth Sucra as Paula Abagnale, Ted Williams as Frank Abagnale Sr., Jillian Rossi as Brenda Strong, Geri Kery as Carol Strong and Robert Calder as Roger Strong. \nAnonia leads a pit orchestra of 12, who play the jazzy '60s score live on stage clad in white tuxedo jackets. \nPetrovich says Scottish Rite Cathedral has been supportive of the company's transition. \n\"They have been wonderful as we are learning the ropes,\" he says. \"We are very respectful of them.\" \nHe says as part of Munopco \"reinventing itself,\" the board will add two high school age people to its board to learn the governance of the organization and eventually assume leadership roles. \n\"We want to see Munopco survive for a long time,\" Petrovich says. \n•\"Catch Me If You Can,\" 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday; 2 p.m. Sunday, Scottish Rite Cathedral, 1533 Hamilton St., Allentown. Tickets: $25; $22, seniors; $10, students.

Now her father, Gomez, must do something he's never done before — keep a secret from his beloved wife Morticia as the Addams prepare to meet the normal family at an unforgettable dinner. \nThe cast of 23 includes Jarrod Yuskauskas as Gomez, Mariah Dalton as Morticia, Emilie Leynes as Wednesday, Jordan King as Cousin Itt, Logan McCabe as Lurch, Christian Clausnitzer as Pugsley, Andrea Cartagena as Fester and Marie Ann Sutera as Grandmama.

By cutting through the numbers and political arguments, we will help discover ways to make things better for our children and communities.\" \n\"School Play\" is timely as the more than three-month-old budget standoff continues in Harrisburg, with new funding for education at the top of the agenda. \nThe documentary-based live theater production was commissioned by Public Citizens for Children and Youth. It uses the real voices of more than 100 Pennsylvanians to dramatize funding inequities among school districts across the state. \n\"Allentown has one of the most diverse and under-funded school districts in the state,\" says Cathy Kim of the education department at Muhlenberg College. \"Every student deserves access to the same quality education no matter where they live, and this performance brings the students' needs to life.\" \n•\"School Play\" 7 p.m. Monday. Civic Theatre 514, 514 N. 19th St., Allentown. Free.

Salinger's coming-of-age novel \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" The play is named for Holden Caulfield, the book's fictional teenage protagonist. \nIn the play, some obsessive fans with shady pasts have taken up residence in Salinger's private writing bunker in Cornish, N.H. Unbeknownst to the reclusive author, their mission is to get Salinger to publish once more. \nAnisa says the play is about several famous assassinations in the 1980s that were linked to the book, including that of John Lennon and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. She says the play explores Salinger's post-traumatic stress disorder from World War II as well as the psychosis of the people obsessed with his work. \nAnisa leads George & Co., a Philadelphia theater company that performs original, ensemble-created works. \n\"Holden\" is recommended for mature audiences. \n•\"Holden,\" 8 p.m. Thursday through Sunday, and Oct. 15-17, FringeArts,140 N.
