Meanwhile, Lucious was inspired to create a record in jail. Thanks to his crafty new lawyer and some lax guards, Lucious and a few inmates created the track, \"Snitch B****.\" Across town, Andre was miserable working at the new label. He begged Cookie to let him go back to Empire. \"My heart is not in this, Mom....Let me go, Mom,\" he told her. But when Andre tried to get back on Empire's staff -- by visiting Lucious in jail -- the music mogul refused to let Andre back on the team. Andre told Lucious he didn't understand why he couldn't forgive him. \nA flashback, featuring Kelly Rowland as Lucious' mother, explained why. Andre reminded Lucious of his mom, who also suffered from a mental illness. \nLater, when Lucious released his single from jail, he was later released on bond. It looks like Lucious is back on his throne. \n  Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:30AM by", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:04.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
