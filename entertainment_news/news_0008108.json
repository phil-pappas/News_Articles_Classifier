Louca creates the kind of grooves that can trigger inadvisable shape-throwing and awkward feet-shifting but your reviewer wisely kept thoughts of movement in his head. It’s easy to hear how dancefloors have been filling to Louca’s sounds though.\nHe has forebears in Joe Zawinul and even Terry Riley, the former especially coming to mind as someone who brought the sounds of the streets, be they Asian, African or South American, and propelled them with beats both electronically created and drums and percussion-derived.\nSome of Louca’s ideas, which carried the sampled hubbub of markets and the joyfulness of praise singing, might actually have benefited from further compositional development or the presence of an improvising melody instrument to give them extra lift, but the tension he and his rhythm team created between electronic and conventional rhythms and between sampled lines and those created in the moment made for an enjoyable series of pieces that never overstayed their welcome.\nShare article Louca alternated between a mixing desk and a keyboard, adding rich colourisation and attractively dense harmony as bass guitarist Ashar Farran held down the groove and drummer Tomasso Cappellato variously sat out completely or whipped up a percussive ferment in tandem with and against almost industrial beats.\nThe effectiveness of Cappellato’s playing was particularly emphasised in the final piece as he created a locomotive-like momentum underneath Louca’s keyboard work, sustaining and building it before seeing the engine analogy through to its conclusion with a gradual, highly dramatic, beautifully controlled slowing down to a satisfying halt.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:15:26.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
