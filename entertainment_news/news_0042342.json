A variety of women's health booths are available at the expo, which returns to the Four Seasons Arena Oct. 9 and 10. (Photo: TRIBUNE PHOTO/RION SANDERS) Oct. 9 from noon to 7 p.m. and Oct.10 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific Steel & Recycling Four Seasons Arena Cost: $5 for both days or $25 for both days and comedy night CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMore than 200 vendors with demonstrations, information, edible goodies and great shopping deals descend on Montana ExpoPark’s Four Seasons Arena Oct. 9 and 10 for the 2015 What Women Want Expo. From jeans and t-shirt gals to primped and pampered ladies, there’s something for every kind of girl at this year’s event, including a night of laughs with two nationally known comedians and a fun run to support a local organization that helps women with breast cancer. \nWhat Women Want has grown from a small event focusing on women’s health issues to the largest exposition of its kind in Montana, drawing more than 8,000 visitors. \nNot a girly girl? Not a problem. The Expo’s vendors include products and services to spiff up your home, car and wallet. Decorators can visit Mr. Miniblind, Valley Furniture or Chem-Dry carpet cleaners for indoor revamps or ABC Seamless, Advanced Home Services and Great Falls Ace Hardware to get those big projects done. \nLadies who love their cars have several booths to choose from, including Expo sponsor City Motor Company, just in case a new ride is what they’re after. \nIf you’re more concerned with saving money than spending it, Prudential, RBC Wealth Management, Farm Bureau Insurance and Montana Federal Credit Union are on hand to show you how to plan for the future. \nBrush Crazy will appeal to your creativity, while Bumble Bee Kettle Corn pops up some delicious snacks to satisfy your sweet tooth and Golden Triangle Mixes offer pancake, waffle and muffin mixes for those lazy Sunday breakfasts. \nFor your more feminine side, the Expo has more than 10 booths with a variety of beauty products. Shopping opportunities abound, as well, with everything from candles and essential oils to boutique clothing, handbags, handmade jewelry and one-of-a-kind home décor. \nCarol Day, owner of the Walk In Closet in Great Falls, has attended What Women Want in the past, but this year is her first time having a booth since she opened her boutique 17 months ago. \n“The type of items that I have are different from what I saw there in prior years,” she said. “It’s definitely boutique items. I do not necessarily cater to Western ideals like you find around here. It’s really more trendy fashion and accessories.” \nDay carries everything from scarves and locally-made jewelry to fashion jeans and prom dresses. She says the response to her store from customers has been amazing. \n“They like kind of the quaint feeling about it,” she said. “I’m always changing up and bringing in new things. I cater to plus sizes now, and that’s been a smash hit.” \nDay adds that she likes that the Expo is specifically for women, and she plans to hand out flyers with information about her store to gain exposure and new customers. \nMontana ExpoPark provides concessions throughout the event in addition to the sweet treats found at the vendor booths. \nWhile you’re shopping, look for demonstrations and presentations on the What Women Want Interactive Stage during both days of the Expo. The stage events change every half hour to keep things fresh for Expo visitors.
