Earlier this year, Hawking joined tech luminaries Elon Musk and Bill Gates to sign an open letter imploring researchers to balance the benefits of artificial intelligence with the risks. While Hawking himself is an early adopter of communications technology—a primitive form of AI—he fears that intelligent machines could overtake the human race if left unchecked.\nThe AMA was announced in July and within days had become the  third-largest AMA in Reddit's history . Over nine thousand comments were submitted to the open AMA thread, with Hawking selecting and responding to questions at his own pace.   \nPlease see below for highlights from Hawking's answers, and you can check out the full AMA now at   reddit.com/r/science  ( http://bit.ly/1hon0VU ). \nFor more information on #maketechhuman, visit  WIRED.com/maketechhuman . Nokia and WIRED Brand Lab first launched the initiative back in March, with an AMA hosted by World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee , and have continued the conversation at TED in Vancouver and in a recently launched podcast series hosted by Matt Mira and featuring Monica Lewinsky, Sir Martin Rees, Hossein Moiin, Jon Ronson, and Stuart Russell .\nAbout #maketechhuman\n#make tech human is a global debate on how we want technology to shape our world, our societies, and our lives. Nokia and WIRED kick-started the conversation last March, encouraging a move toward a human era and away from a machine one. The goal is to ensure the exponential influence of technology serves each of us individually and society as a whole. Through #maketechhuman, Nokia wants to change the way people make decisions about technology. They want to help technology help people everywhere. The conversation is centered on the  WIRED.com/maketechhuman hub and runs in articles, podcasts, videos, AMAs, social media, and at events across the world.\nAbout Nokia\nBy focusing on the human possibilities of technology, Nokia embraces the connected world to help people thrive. Our three businesses are leaders in their fields. Nokia Networks provides broadband infrastructure software and services, HERE provides mapping, navigation and location intelligence, and Nokia Technologies provides advanced technology development and licensing.  www.nokia.com \nAbout WIRED\nWIRED is where tomorrow is realized. It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation. The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives—from culture to business, science to design. The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking, new connections, and new industries. WIRED reaches more than 48 million people each month through  WIRED.com , our digital edition, the magazine, social media, and live events. \nExcerpts from Stephen Hawking's Reddit AMA: \nYOUR VIEWPOINTS ARE OFTEN PRESENTED BY THE MEDIA AS A BELIEF IN TERMINATOR-STYLE \"EVIL A.I.\" HOW WOULD YOU PRESENT YOUR BELIEFS? \nHAWKING: You're right: media often misrepresent what is actually said.  The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence.  A super intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble.  You're probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you're in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there's an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants.  Let's not place humanity in the position of those ants. \nIS IT POSSIBLE FOR MACHINES TO BECOME SMARTER THAN THEIR CREATORS? \nHAWKING: It's clearly possible for a something to acquire higher intelligence than its ancestors: we evolved to be smarter than our ape-like ancestors, and Einstein was smarter than his parents.  \nWHAT IF MACHINES BECOME BETTER AT DESIGNING THEMSELVES THAN HUMANS ARE? \nHAWKING: If this happens, we may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in  machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails. \nARE WE FACING IMMINENT THREAT FROM INTELLIGENT MACHINES, OR SHOULD WE JUST BE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE? \nHAWKING:  There's no consensus among AI researchers about how long it will take to build human-level AI and beyond, so please don't trust anyone who claims to know for sure that it will happen in your lifetime or that it won't happen in your lifetime. \nWhen it eventually does occur,  it's likely to be either the best or worst thing ever to happen to humanity, so there's huge value in getting it right.  We should shift the goal of AI from creating pure undirected artificial intelligence to creating beneficial intelligence. It might take decades to figure out how to do this, so let's start researching this today rather than the night before the first strong AI is switched on. \nDO YOU THINK WE RUN THE RISK OF \"TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT\" WHERE MACHINES TAKE ALL OF OUR JOBS? \nHAWKING:  The outcome will depend on how things are distributed.  Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most  people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution . So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with  technology driving ever-increasing inequality. \nWHAT MYSTERY DO YOU FIND MOST INTRIGUING, AND WHY? \nHAWKING:  Women. My PA reminds me that although I have a PhD in physics, women should remain a mystery. \nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SONG EVER WRITTEN? \nHAWKING: \" Have I Told You Lately\" by Rod Stewart . \nWHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME? \nHAWKING:  Jules et Jim, 1962 \nWHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU SAW ONLINE THAT YOU FOUND HILARIOUS? \nHAWKING:  The Big Bang Theory \nPress Contact:\nCorey Wilson \nSenior Director, Communications\nWIRED\n212 286 2419\ncorey_wilson@condenast.com \n\nSOURCE WIRED\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.wired.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:20:56.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
