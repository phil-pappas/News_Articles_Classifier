(Universal Pictures) Derrik J. Lang Associated Press \nThe future is today — if \"Back to the Future\" is to be believed. \nThe celebration of the so-called \"Back to the Future\" Day on Wednesday marks the date — Oct. 21, 2015 — that the characters Marty McFly, Emmett \"Doc\" Brown and Jennifer Parker famously journeyed from 1985 to 2015 in the sci-fi film trilogy's second installment in 1989. \n\"Back to The Future Part II\" envisioned a colorful 2015 with flying cars, hoverboards and self-tying shoelaces. While those doodads are hardly prevalent today, the film did accurately tease the rise of such technology as flatscreen televisions, biometric scanning and hands-free gaming. It also predicted the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series — an actual possibility with the Cubs contenders in the real-world playoffs, although maybe not for long. \n\"Back to the Future\" Day is being celebrated Wednesday with an appearance by the original cast at a Lincoln Center screening in New York, as well as several fan-centric events and more than 1,700 theaters hosting screenings across the country. \n\"Back to the Future\" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis' trilogy has left a lasting impression on pop culture in the 30 years since the original film debuted, spawning a theme park attraction, video game and animated series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:36:36.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
