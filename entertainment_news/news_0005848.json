He was 66. \n\"Steve was a classic '60s American guy, full of generosity and love for anyone he met,\" Iggy Pop said in a statement. \"Every time he put his sax to his lips and honked, he lightened my road and brightened the whole world. He was a credit to his group and his generation. To know him was to love him.\" \nAfter recording with The Stooges on their 1970 LP, bolstering such tracks as \"Fun House\" and \"1970,\" Mackay went on to tour briefly with the band. He would return to touring with The Stooges when the group reunited in 2003, performing his tenor saxophone with them in the years that followed. \nMackay, who was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., was also featured on The Stooges' 2007 album \"The Weirdness\" and 2013's \"Ready to Die.\" \nIt was revealed last month that Mackay was in critical condition in his battle with sepsis at a California hospital. In a statement at the time, Stooges guitarist James Williamson said, \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to Steve and [his wife] Patti for the best possible outcome.\" \nStooges guitarist Ron Asheton died in 2009, and drummer Scott Asheton died last year.
