He spent years trying to identify the man he believes made the bomb that took down Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988. Ken Dornstein poses for a photo Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015, in Boston. A long investigation by Dornstein, a documentary filmmaker whose brother died in the attack, identified Libyan Abu Agila Mas'ud as the possible maker of the bomb that shattered the New York-bound Boeing 747 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988. Mas'ud has not been named by U.S. or Scottish officials as a suspect. All 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground were killed.

Some had been killed before the revolution that led to the ouster of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Some were killed during the revolution while others appeared to have been killed on orders from Gadhafi himself. \n\"By my count there were three people left alive who I believe played a role in it and who I was focused on trying to identify and find,\" Dornstein said. \nOf those the most intriguing was a mysterious figure who Dornstein said had been traveling with Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the only person convicted in the attack, including on the day of the bombing.

There was no photo of him. The FBI and Scottish police — nobody had a photo of him. There were suspicions that he didn't even exist,\" Dornstein said. \"The Libyans always denied his existence.\" \nDornstein said he was able to track down Mas'ud to a jail in Libya where he says he was serving a 10-plus year sentence on bomb-making charges for booby-trapping the cars of those opposed to Gadhafi. \n\"I wish I had come face to face to him,\" said Dornstein, who only dealt with Mas'ud indirectly. \n\"I would have liked to have been there for the moment when someone tapped him on the shoulder and said 'Hey, here's this incident that happened all these years ago and there's someone in America — someone's brother — who said you connected the wires that maybe blew up that plane and killed some 270 people,\" Dornstein said. \"I would have loved to have been there to see his reaction and hear his answer.\" \nProsecutors haven't named the two Libyans, in keeping with the British practice of not identifying suspects until they're charged. Dornstein said he doesn't have any direct knowledge of the identity of the two, although he said he's convinced Mas'ud is one. \nBritish officials previously asked to interview a second man, Abdullah al-Senoussi, Gadhafi's former spymaster, about the bombing. Abdullah al-Senoussi also was on Dornstein's list. A third individual is still at large, he said. \nDornstein ultimately turned his search for the Pan Am Flight 103 bombers into a three-part investigation for the PBS \"Frontline\" documentary series. \nThe last of the three parts aired this week ahead of Thursday's announcement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:07:17.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
