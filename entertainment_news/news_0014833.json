And now I'm like, 'Yeah, I gained weight for this role.' But really I just sat in my bed, watched 'Friday Night Lights' and, like, ate,\" Dunst said on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" \nSounds pretty great to us. But Dunst wasn't the only one gaining weight for the second season of FX's \"Fargo.\" \nJesse Plemons, who plays Dunst's on-screen husband, and Jeffrey Donovan, who had a more minor role in the show, both packed on a few pounds . \nBut since the 10-episode series is set in Luverne, Minnesota — a city that can get up to an average 10 inches of snow in just one month — we understand a bit of weight gain to keep warm.
