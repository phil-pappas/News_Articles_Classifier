Photo: Anna Kucera \n \nOutside Young Henry's brewery in Newtown, the Rolling Records truck settles in for a Saturday afternoon of vinyl-seeking and tune-chatting. Anyone who sells hard-copy music in an MP3 world has to run their business on passion and owner George Pizer has plenty of it, with a record player and three rows of vinyl on the sides of a former delivery truck. The vintage effect is delightful.\nThe 270-degree setup is browser-friendly as you can flick through records without knocking elbows with other visitors (although the blues section did get a little crowded). The records range mostly from $6 to $35, including Bruce Springsteen's Tunnel of Love ($10) and a vinyl-only exclusive from The Flaming Lips ($30). The joy in Rolling Records is finding something affordable you're into without the hassle of bin-diving and wading through rejects. Pizer has done the curation for his mobile service.\nThe well-known inner-west record vendor was half of the business duo behind Pidgeon Ground Records and Clothing in Camperdown. Although his Young Henrys spot was meant to be a one-off, the reception has been so good he plans to return semi-regularly. It's best to check Facebook for the truck's locations each week. It attracts the kind of customer who takes the time to browse through the vintage collection, ask for recommendations and take them for a spin on the built-in record player. \"I hope you enjoy it,\" Pizer says as I walk away with my Nina Simone record, and suddenly my MP3 purchases seem second-rate.\nAdvertisement ROLLING RECORDS \n0425 298 437, see rollingrecords.com.au for location updates\nOctober 4 at Young Henrys brewery, 76 Wilford Street, Newtown\nOctober 22-25 at MoVement Festival, various Sydney locations", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:23:42.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
