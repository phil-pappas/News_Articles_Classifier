The route you take to work, the sandwich you have for lunch, the greetings that you offer by rote are all part of the \"same ol'-same ol'\" routines of our lives without conscious thought.\nThen something happens to bring our heads awake. It might be a casual comment that gets you thinking. It might be seeing a familiar billboard that suddenly appears to hold a different message. It might be something you saw on the iPod, a snippet just as you were changing screens. You are instantly wide awake and aware.\nYour immediate thought is \"what was that again?\" and your focus is a pin-point of accurate replay. If you think any more on the subject, that accuracy wanes before the onslaught of additional stimuli. But for a tiny instant time froze for you and you were centered in a fresh new idea.\nNow, what if suddenly you could freeze everything else around you and move freely into the matrix of that new idea, following the path of thought and choosing without haste when you arrived at the junctions? What if your mind was clear and unencumbered so that new, bright thoughts would spark again and again as you encountered specific triggers of your own choices? What if you could stay within that time freeze long enough to follow a new idea to see where it would take you? ...What if....?\nThe practice of mediation is one that creates an atmosphere of peace, separating you from the sounds and actions occurring all around you. The more you practice this centering feature, the easier and sooner you are able to focus on important choices in your life. You don't bring them into the center of peace with you - but you clear the clutter from your mind so that the focus simply lies before you. Each time you meditate, what you bring from the practice session is a clearer idea and the ability to actually remain with that idea longer, ignoring anything that may previously have been an intrusion to your thoughts.\nPaul wrote in Romans 12:12 that we could be transformed by the renewing of our minds\n\"so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.\"\nOne of the highlighted words in that passage is \"renewing\" - it indicates a process of moment by moment change, as the Buddha says. Putting meditation practice into a daily routine will make this renewing so much easier that the transformation will take place gradually and - permanently.\nThe other highlighted word is \"prove\" - and for the true meaning of that word within this passage we go to the ancient art of minting coins. \"A proof coin is a coin struck using a special, high-quality minting process, and made especially for collectors.\" (Susan Headley) This almost shouts the purpose of our desire to transform.\nWe are the proof coin that, through the will of God, we are good and acceptable and perfect - we become our True Authentic Selves through this transformation. And in our process of gradually changing and re-becoming that proof coin, we might want to \"fake it 'til you make it\" as Rev. Jim Lee (Renaissance Unity) used to say. You might find it prudent to pretend that you are more compassionate and understanding, patient and kind in certain situations - until you can actually feel them becoming a part of your true attitude.\nThe thing is - God created us already proofed: whole and perfect, good and acceptable. We arrived on this earth in that exact form - but somewhere along the road with our human right to choose and our human will to want, our focus and mind-set were taken off-track. We are blessed that we have recognized that detour and know the steps to be taken to bring us back to our Truth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:52:26.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
