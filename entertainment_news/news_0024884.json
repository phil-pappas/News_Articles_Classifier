The sequel to the blockbuster sci-fi action directed by Shankar which released five years ago has been in the works, and the makers confirmed the same recently. We have heard that Rajinikanth, who is currently busy shooting for Kabali, will join the film by next year. There have been several rumours doing the rounds with respect to the casting of the movie — names of Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone, etc were heard as the female lead of this movie, which is tipped as Kollywood’s highest budget film. The grapevine has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger who flew down to Chennai to attend the audio launch of Vikram-starrer I has been approached for the film. However, we hear that the Terminator star is yet to revert and his inclusion hasn’t been confirmed. Meanwhile, there are also speculations that the film will be made in 3D. Earlier, Rajini’s first film with Shankar, Sivaji, a 2007 release flick, was released in 3D in 2012, on the eve of the star’s 60th birthday. Seems like the makers of Enthiran 2 are leaving no stone unturned to make it a mammoth project. AR Rahman has been roped again to score music for the film while Nirav Shah will crank the camera. entertainment Kollywood Enthiran 2 Superstar Rajinikanth Also Read Sona’s films to avoid box office clash Katrina Kaif celebrates Christmas with family in London Actors with the hottest 'Heavage' Debutant Bellamkonda Srinivas to direct Srinivas", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151008/entertainment-kollywood/article/enthiran-2-be-3d", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ENDHIRAN-CUTOUT.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/ENDHIRAN-CUTOUT.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151008/entertainment-kollywood/article/enthiran-2-be-3d", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:20:33.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
