Shortlisted for Bowness Prize. \n\nBOWNESS PHOTOGRAPHY PRIZE \nPrize exhibitions always represent something of a slippery slope, especially when the prize is specific to contemporary photography. In the current context, an exhibition like the Bowness Prize can feel a tad anachronistic. That's not to suggest that there aren't some stunning works here. There's a lot of landscape photography this year, led by Devika Bilimoria's towering Arctic mountainside, Silvi Glattauer's cragged desert landscape and Rebecca Dagnall's lush, nocturnal pool. Of the portraits, Ward Roberts' pale, androgynous figure, set against the passive spectrum of the morning sky, is wonderfully compelling, while Brook Andrew's Possessed II is one of the few works dealing with found, repurposed or appropriated imagery. Works utilising imagery from the online environment – the richest source of photographic images we've ever known – are also conspicuous in their absence. A couple of unlikely and decidedly quiet works are perhaps the strongest. Rudi Williams' photograph of an empty Greater Union theatre prior to demolition is loaded in its evocative detail, while Amanda Williams' diptych of an ancient cave complex and key example of modernist architecture is hushed in its formal and historical resonance.\nUntil November 22; Monash Gallery of Art, 860 Ferntree Gully Road, Wheelers Hill, 8544 0500, mga.org.au \nWard Roberts', Sam 2012-14, from the series O, pigment ink-jet print, 80.0 x 58.0 cm. Courtesy of the artist. \nSUZANNE ARCHER: BENEATH THE SKIN \nAdvertisement Though death's ever-increasing proximity forms the unavoidable nub of senior painter Suzanne Archer's new exhibition of towering, texture-stuttered oils and smaller watercolour and acrylic paintings, her gaggle of dancing, twirling, boogying skeletons (several of them resplendent in wide-brimmed hats and all of them complete with puppeteers' strings) seem to cackle in the face of the ultimate end. There's something very Peter Booth about these paintings, both in subject matter and application. Archer's masterful use of dense layers of paint is certainly reminiscent of Booth's handling of the palette knife, while her work's existentialist crux frees itself from hopelessness with its playful humanism. While a painting like the vast and somewhat self-explanatory Two Skeletons Messing with my Head – which sees two marauding bone bros playing a rugby-like game of catch with a decapitated cranium – might be a little dark in a different context, Archer's treatment is decidedly frisky and humorous. Maybe she knows something that we don't, but her skeletal choreographies seem to defy the threat of the end. While the skeleton's symbolism has forever been connected to grim realities, she mocks her lanky actors as much as they mock her.\nUntil October 18; Nicholas Thompson Gallery, 155 Langridge Street, Collingwood, 9415 7882, nicholasthompsongallery.com.au \nUntitled #5, 2012, Warnambool by Paul Batt, showing at Counihan Gallery in Brunswick. \nOTHER SIDE \nThis somewhat dissonant group show, in its last days at Counihan Gallery in Brunswick, features sculptural installations, photography and painting. There are some interesting works here. Aaron Martin utilises pragmatic objects, tools and devices (car jacks, picture frames and plaster sheets) to create sculptures, while Michael Brennan's suite of small paintings subvert the usual dynamic of positive and negative space by leaving the subject blank against a rendered representation of the sky. Nicholas Ives blacks out pages of a French-Italian comic – except for selected dialogue and fragments of figuration – in an apparent riff on privacy, while Fabrizio Biviano's photographic typology of discarded cigarette butts becomes something of a romantic ode to a fleeting moment's passing. Paul Batt, who co-curated the show with the aforementioned Brennan, presents a series of large-scale photographs, which are interesting for their formalism and geometry, despite their portrayal of otherwise nondescript suburban spaces.\nLast day tomorrow; Counihan Gallery, Brunswick Town Hall, 233 Sydney Road, Brunswick, 9389 8622, moreland.vic.gov.au/gallery", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:09.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
