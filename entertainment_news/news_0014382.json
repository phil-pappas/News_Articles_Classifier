And you would always see him around with young girls,” Jones told BBC Radio. \n“When you see someone like that, you would never think he was a paedophile because of the way he handled himself. \n“You always think of paedophiles as being like creepy people — well maybe to some people he did look a bit creepy — but he was a bit of a Jack The Lad with young girls.” British entertainer ... Tom Jones said Jimmy Savile helped his career.

Following his death in 2011, hundreds of people stepped forward claiming he had sexually abused them . The reported allegations cover a 50-year period. \nIn his broad-ranging interview, Jones said Savile was “instrumental” in launching his pop music career, revealing he gave him “great advice” about how to break into the music industry. \nSavile, who worked at Decca Records at the time, told a young Jones how to approach record companies and cut “hot” demos. \n“He promised to take (the demo) into Decca and then he said, ‘Look it’s up to you.’ He told me to make sure the first track was a hot one and I did Breathless ,” the Welsh crooner said. \n“And from that I got a recording contract with Decca, so it was thanks to Jimmy Savile.” Legendary career ... Tom Jones credits Jimmy Savile for launching his career.

I don’t look like I did either, but I try my best. She’s lost her spark,” he told Sunday Times Magazine. \nHe revealed that, despite his well-publicised infidelity, his wife of 58 years snapped only once, after discovering his affair with former Miss World Marjorie Wallace in 1976. \n“I stood there and took it. She chinned me. When she let fly, Dai [his then minder] just left. I said, ‘Go ahead.’ She punched and shouted,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:20:54.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
