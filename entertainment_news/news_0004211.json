No, we are not talking about a movie project here, the father-daughter duo intend to be part of commercial endorsements and will be seen in TV commercials in the coming days.\nThe word is out in the advertisement world that two of the biggest names in south cinema want to be part of joint product endorsements in the future. \"All these days, we tried convincing Kamal sir and Shruti to endorse products jointly, but they were somehow not convinced. Now, we hear that they are open to the idea,\" a source from Mumbai told Bangalore Mirror.\nThis development comes in the wake of Shruti making a splash in Bollywood with back-to-back Hindi movies. She has also bagged important projects in Tamil. Shruti has already established herself as a pan-Indian actress while Kamal has restricted his work to the south.\n\"Earlier, Shruti was popular only in south films. Now, with her Bollywood movies doing well, she has her own fan base outside of South India. This works out well for national brands. Soon, we could see the father-daughter duo together, if everything works out well,\" said S Shetty, who works for a leading advertisement production firm.\nKamal Haasan is not known for aggressively endorsing products, but Shruti has been a brand ambassador for several lifestyle products and jewelry brands. So far, only the big families of Bollywood and a few in the south have been successful in positioning themselves in the advertisement world. It is to be seen whether Kamal and Shruti will be able to replicate the success.\n\"If at all they are seen endorsing products together, they have to be careful about the category. Of late, celebrities are facing unwanted problems whenever brands have issues with the public and the regulatory bodies. Kamal, in particular, with his approach, cannot afford risks. But they will be a fantastic combination for the TV world,\" remarked ad filmmaker C Chaudhury. Shruti Haasan is currently busy shooting for her Hindi movie Rocky Handsome and will be part of Singam 3 in Tamil. Meanwhile, Kamal is busy preparing for the release of his Tamil venture Thoongavanam. Shooting for TV commercials, if any, is expected only by year end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:58:23.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
