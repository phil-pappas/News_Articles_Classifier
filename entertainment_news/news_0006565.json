We need to play with enjoyment.” \nThe Selecao will meet Venezuela at Fortaleza’s Castelao Arena on Tuesday, five days after their 0-2 loss to Chile in Santiago. Dunga played down criticism of the team’s performance against Chile, their first competitive outing since losing to Paraguay on penalties in the Copa America quarterfinals in June.

We have to learn to live with the criticism, but we are doing all we can to win.”Venezuela also started their qualifying campaign with a loss, stumbling 0-1 at home to Paraguay. \nThe last time Brazil and Venezuela met was in the Copa America group stage, when Dunga’s team secured an unconvincing 2-1 victory. Brazil will be without defender David Luiz, who suffered a knee injury against Chile, and captain Neymar, who is serving the last match of a four-game ban. \n  8:47 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:52:20.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
