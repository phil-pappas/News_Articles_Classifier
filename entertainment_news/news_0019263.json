By India.com Entertainment Desk on October 21, 2015 at 1:42 AM Comments \nBigg Boss 9 is getting interesting with every passing episode. Unbelievable twists and turns are cropping their ugly heads, with every passing episode. And just when we thought that all was well in the house, the last episode witnessed a roller coaster slide of sorts. Just when we thought that Keith was tilting a lot towards Mandana and conveniently keeping Rocelle Rao out of his ever blossoming equation with Miss Karmi, there broke an ugly spat between two ‘good friends’.

Their differences were put on display. Mandana even threatened to disown Keith. She unleashed the belt–a sign of bondage between her Keith. She was also ready to break all ties with Keith. Naturally the good looking lad could not take any more either. Even he vocalised his feelings and went on to say that in Mandana’s presence he feels like a dog. \nKeith then accused that Mandana treats him badly and he feels like her dog who has to follow here wherver she goes. This comment was enough to set Mandana off. And then all hell break loose. It reached to a point that the two said that they would like to break the tie and would rather opt for a new partner. After this tiff all hell broke lose. Had Suyash and Yuvika not intervened in time the situation would have gone out of hand. \nNow if you think this incident must have made Keith’s girlfriend Rochelle happy, you are wrong! Rao is busy nursing her own injuries after fighting with Vikas Bhalla? What’s more? She is even eyeing captaincy when adverse conditions are right there in her face. Such is the irony of staying in Bigg Boss house! \nModified Date: October 21, 2015 1:55 AM Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:37:58.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
