Campbell couldn’t, either.\n“It’s hard to say,” was the answer he gave me. “We just got outplayed tonight.”\nYes, after the opening four minutes of Appalachian State’s 31-13 beatdown of rival Georgia Southern on Thursday night, that was absolutely the case. App State unleashed a year’s worth of energy that had been stored up in the minds and hearts of the Mountaineers. They had the home game against the Eagles circled on their calendars ever since Georgia Southern embarrassed them 34-14 last season in Statesboro.\nBut that still doesn’t explain how a team went from overpowering to helpless at the flip of a switch. You would have thought by the Eagles’ opening drive that it didn’t matter to them how much the Mountaineers had prepared to stop that running game, or how much emotion they would play with, or how much noise and vituperation came from the crowd.\n“Give credit to (Appalachian State),” GSU coach Willie Fritz said.\nI guess you have to. The Mountaineers withstood the early punch, then delivered a blow the Eagles never got up from.\nSouthern popped runs of 23, 21, 11 and the 12-yard touchdown run by Kevin Ellison, then wound up with a season-low 188 rushing yards and just 252 yards of total offense for the game.\nThe Mountaineers took away what the Eagles wanted to do on first down and forced them into passing situations, which is not ideal for a team that averages 65.9 yards through the air. Ellison and backup quarterback Favian Upshaw each threw an interception in the second half.\nUntil LA Ramsby’s 19-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter, the Eagles averaged just 1.46 yards on first-down rushing plays.\n“They were just prepared for whatever we threw at them,” Campbell said. “We’re just going to have to move on from this. There’s nothing we can do about it now.”\nAll they can do is try to win the remainder of their games and hope, because the Mountaineers now control their own destiny in the race for the Sun Belt title. And it’s not a two-team race, either. Arkansas State, along with App State, is 3-0 in the conference. Those two teams meet Nov. 5, and even if the Red Wolves win, the outlook still doesn’t look good for the Eagles in their quest to claim a second straight conference title.\nSouthern’s first conference loss since joining the Sun Belt last season was a crippling one, but the Eagles can take the first step toward recovering this Thursday night at home against Texas State. It starts with becoming bowl eligible, one of the team’s primary goals for the season. The Eagles (5-1, 3-1 Sun Belt) need just one more win to get there.\nBut the loss to App State also raises some questions that will have to be answered against Texas State. Is there any way for this team to put up numbers outside of its running game? Is it possible for GSU to have success in the passing game with its personnel, which is already without top receiver BJ Johnson?\nNathan Deen covers Georgia Southern sports for the Savannah Morning News.
