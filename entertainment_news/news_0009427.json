The sentiment was echoed by Philip Broughton, who worked at the South Pole station in 2003.\n\"The beakers have a license to kill,\" Broughton told Wired. There is little consequence for what they do down there.\nThe Office of the Inspector General recommended officials increase the use of breathalyzers in alcohol-related incidents.\n\"Since alcohol abuse does occur in the USAP program, workplace safety could be enhanced if breathalyzer tests were administered to all USAP participants endangering themselves or others due to the influence of alcohol. We recommend that NSF review the legality of a requirement for breathalyzer for all USAP participants and establish and enforce a requirement to the extent it is legal,\" the audit states.\nA National Science Foundation spokesman said officials are seeking to decrease alcohol-related problems, but such issues are not as prevalent as the report indicates.\n\"Alcohol-related misconduct is not disproportionately represented at the Antarctic stations,\" spokesman Peter West said.\nCopyright 2015 by United Press International Share Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734145&h=Audit%3A+Scientists+in+Antarctica+prone+to+alcohol%2Dfueled+fights%2C+indecent+exposure", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734145", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/entertainment/weirdnews/s-1734145&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:15:57.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
