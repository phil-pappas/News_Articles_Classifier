Elijah stars as Dolan 37th, a young priest who advises Vin Diesel’s immortal Witch Hunter character, Kaulder, as they take on the witches who live among us. \n“Oh god, the mine,” he recalled. “The mine was kind of torturous.” Rose Leslie, Vin Diesel and Elijah Wood in The Last Witch Hunter (Entertainment One) \nThe actor, 34, explained: “Part of it was because we were only supposed to shoot in the mine for about a week, and for a variety of reasons, we ended up having to extend the schedule and shoot an additional week in the mine. \n“It was cold, it was inhospitable, we got real sick of the mine. But that’s part of making movies. It was fun at first, but six days in it was like: I’m ready to get out of here!” \nThe actor is also currently starring in Cooties, a horror-comedy based on a re-imagining of the children’s playground game. In it, his character Clint – alongside Rainn Wilson’s Wade – has to take on the zombie-like infected children. \nOn killing the kids, he said: “The thing about the movie that we always knew is that we had to deliver on a certain promise. The set-up is that there are these zombie children as the result of a food-borne virus, so in order to get out of the school, the kids had to be brutalised and probably killed. \n“And that’s a difficult thing, because it’s sort of the last taboo in film. But it was something we knew we had to deliver on. \n“Trying to figure out how we could get away with that in a way that was justified and also fun for the audience. We wanted it to be fun, and not controversial, and ultimately it was through comedy and a certain degree not believing they are kids any more. By the time we are killing them, they are zombies.” Share article \nCooties is now out on DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital. The Last Witch Hunter is in cinemas now.
