More than 55,000 health system employees will have access to a mobile app called myNorthwell on their Apple and Android devices. It will serve as a one-stop mobile hub that addresses many of the communications challenges common to enterprise organizations, including:\nIncreasing engagement and a connection within the organization, especially since the vast majority of employees are caregivers who are not sitting behind a desk with computer access; Understanding the company's new brand and ensuring that employees understand the health system's mission to provide the highest quality care to patients and customers; Providing easy and instantaneous access to important company information on-the-go; Providing access to the organization's new Wellness platform as well as connectivity to workplace portals; and Exclusive perks and employee discounts that drive the employee experience. Joseph Moscola, PA, chief human resources officer at North Shore-LIJ, said, \"We continuously look for innovative ways to enhance not only our patients' experience, but also our employees. The healthcare industry is experiencing extraordinary change and the need for effective, consistent, frequent and affordable communication tools has never been greater. This mobile app will be a critical component to ensure that our employees have all the information they need while on- and off-shift.\"\nThe mobile strategy is part of an overall employee communications and engagement effort that will continue into 2017. In addition to the mobile app, the health system's communications platform includes a revamped employee Intranet, social media, multi-media campaigns and in-person experiences.\n\"Our mobile strategy is a critical element to our broader communications approach to connect with our employees 'anytime, anywhere' using innovative technology,\" said Ally Bunin , assistant vice president of organizational communications at North Shore-LIJ. \"Our workforce is extremely diverse. Nearly 80 percent of our new hires are millennials who expect easy and instantaneous access to information through their mobile devices. The app was designed to appeal to this group as well as the thousands of frontline professionals who depend on their mobile devices and care for millions of people every year. We chose theEMPLOYEEapp as our partner for their flexibility, security and turnkey implementation abilities.\"\nTo ensure a seamless user experience, the myNorthwell mobile app draws on the look and feel of most frequently used apps. News items will immediately populate on the top of a News Feed similar to the Facebook app. Photographs, videos and images will appear throughout the app. To ensure that the health system's employees can easily find and access important information, an \"Explore\" function will provide an organized, mobile intranet styled repository for human resource information, corporate communications and company portals as well as workplace tools, such as PeopleSoft.\nAbout North Shore-LIJ Health System, soon to be Northwell Health\nThe nation's 14th-largest health system, North Shore-LIJ delivers world-class clinical care throughout the New York metropolitan area, pioneering research at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, a visionary approach to medical education highlighted by the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, and healthcare coverage to individuals, families and businesses through the CareConnect Insurance Co.
