On Thursday, October 15, the 25-year-old pop diva surprised her fans when she alerted her Instagram followers that the DJ's remix of her latest \" 1989 \" hit had hit iTunes. \"Check it out on iTunes, @r3hab,\" Swift wrote alongside the song's cover art. On the remix, her vocals can be heard over R3hab's club-friendly and danceable beat that replaces the original produced by Max Martin and Shellback. A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Oct 14, 2015 at 11:10pm PDT \"Wildest Dreams\" has so far peaked at No. 8 on Billboard Hot 100. It serves as the fifth single off \"1989\" which is currently spending its 50th consecutive week inside the top 10 of Billboard 200. It has never left the region since its arrival last year. R3hab isn't the first in the recent weeks to have reworked a Taylor Swift song. Last month, Ryan Adams dropped an album filled with his covers of her \"1989\" tracks. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:21:39.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
