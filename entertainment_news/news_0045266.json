This boy had never heard of Stanley Kubrick, but he knew filth when he saw it – even if it was just a plastic table in the form of a naked woman. This was a Catholic boarding school run by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC). The Annals was a monthly publication about their work in various schools and missions. The writer, Father Peter Malone, was the first film critic I ever read.\nI remember thinking at the time that his views on movies were interesting – not at all like the ones I had been hearing from other priests. This was 1972, but it was 1952 in some of their minds. Earlier this year, 42 years later, I met Peter Malone for the first time. We had been asked to record a conversation for a magazine published by our old school, Chevalier College in Bowral. Malone went there 20 years before me.\nPeter Malone: \"My argument was: don't look at films and ask what is presented, but how is it presented.\" \nHe was born in Maroubra, Sydney, in 1939. His mother died in 1947, so in February 1948, he and his younger brother Philip went to Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, a school run by nuns, down the road from Chevalier. Peter was already a keen film-goer. He doesn't quite say so in his just published memoir, An Ever-Widening Screen (Connor Court Publishing), but the habit developed partly in an attempt to shield the boys from their mother's illness. Mrs Addams, employed by their father, would take them to the pictures twice a week. He remembers the powerful emotions he felt watching Vivien Leigh standing in front of a train in Anna Karenina , in 1948. Having just lost his mother, it is not hard to imagine that cinema became a sort of consoling refuge.\nAdvertisement At OLSH, the boys had movies every week. The projectionist, Sister Mary Philomena, would put her hand in front of the lens when anything objectionable came on – such as a kiss. After the first reel, if it was deemed suitable, she sent word to the elderly nuns in the nursing home. Once they arrived, she started the film again from the beginning. This was Peter Malone's first encounter with censorship – but far from the last.\nAt Chevalier, Father Gerry Kelly, the projectionist, invited Peter to help choose the weekly films. The rector, Father Burford, had but one guiding stipulation – he loved Greer Garson. The censoring became more sophisticated. At first they cut scenes, then replaced them before the films were sent back. Then Peter had a better idea. During Million Dollar Baby , Esther Williams as Annette Kellerman walks along a beach in a one-piece bathing suit. Peter doused the projector lamp but left the film running. Father Kelly hit the house lights for the required time, then turned them off as Peter switched the lamp back on. No one knew what they had missed, and the film was undamaged.\nFilm director Stanley Kubrick (right) on the set of A Clockwork Orange with actor Malcolm McDowell. \nAfter eight years in the seminary and further studies in Rome, Peter Malone, MSC, returned to Australia to teach theology in Canberra. He was by now a knowledgeable and supple writer on films, with a liberal sense of the dangers and responsibilities of censorship, honed by the winds of change in Rome. He began reviewing films in The Annals , under the editorship of Paul Stenhouse. \"I started in '68 … First one was To Sir with Love , then Far From the Madding Crowd ,\" Malone says. \"That year I did 2001: A Space Odyssey , The Graduate , The Green Berets .\"\nAt the time, Australian censors did not classify films. They cut them, without letting audiences know. The Minister for Customs and Excise, Don Chipp, wanted to bring in a classification system – which he did in 1971. Father Malone was one of those consulted by his office on how that system should work. That is how he ended up attending the National Library for what became known as the \"Parliamentary blue movie night\".\n\"It was clips of stuff they had excised, and then we saw a silly soft-core thing called The Babysitter , which you wouldn't look at twice now, but it was 1970,\" Malone says. \"We saw kicks to the groins and rapes, all kinds of things. It was just to show everybody what they had been cutting. I think Don Chipp's idea was to show people that they're not so bad, and if we had a restricted certificate, what is wrong with passing them uncut?\"\nMalone has always been liberal on censorship, not always comfortably. For eight years, he headed OCIC, the International Catholic Office of Film, based in London. When it became SIGNIS, the World Catholic Association for Communication, he was its first head. He has always argued for a more open policy within the church, often controversially. \"My argument was: don't look at films and ask what is presented, but how is it presented,\" he says. \"I have lived my life on that. In terms of the what, anything is legitimate. There is no subject that can't be depicted, anything in human experience. It is the how, and that is where you have to do your work.\"\nAt 76, living in Melbourne, Malone still goes to previews every week. His website (Google \"Peter Malone's website\") has about 15,000 reviews from 45 years as a critic. His influence went further than he ever knew. I eventually found out who Kubrick was.\nTwitter: @ptbyrnes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:50:24.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
