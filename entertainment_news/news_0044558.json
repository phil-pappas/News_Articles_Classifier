Viewers were waiting with anticipation to once again see their old familiar friends, the Kilchers. Watching the episode, the scenes with the jovial Jane Kilcher, Atz Lee's wife, remind us just why viewers love Jane so very much: we are seeing the homestead in remote Alaska through Jane's eyes. She was not raised like this, so all of the activities are somewhat new or strange to her, too. As she learns about life on the homestead, we do, too.\nJane has a sometimes dark sense of humor that adds a bit of spice to her views on what is going on, too. Just guessing, a sense of humor would probably be as necessary as bear spray up there. It was touching as she talked about how Otto stresses out very easily and the two choices that afforded for those nearby. You can either get away from him or try “to cheer him up,” as Jane said.\nThe events of the past few months on the Kilcher homestead in Homer, Alaska, have surely tested the strength of Jane’s good disposition, however. Atz Lee, her husband, had a serious accident while hiking in Otter Creek with friends and had to be airlifted out of there. He suffered a “broken arm, a broken shoulder, broken ankle, a broken hip, crushed ribs and two punctured lungs.”\nIn a Facebook Q & A Session on the “ Alaska: The Last Frontier ” Facebook page prior to the premiere, it appeared that Atz Lee’s condition was on everyone’s mind. Eiven, Otto and Charlotte were answering questions, and they indicated that Atz Lee was doing well in his recovery. As these Q & A sessions on Facebook tend to do, the questions were so very repetitive. From the previews, it seems like the accident is going to be in next week’s epsode.", "external_links": ["http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/alaska-the-last-frontier/", "https://www.facebook.com/AlaskaTLF"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:41:21.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
