These are the folks that host pretty much all of the great specuial events in the village all year long. This autumn is no exception. The annual Trick or Treat Trail returns on Saturday October 31 (I love that Halloween is on a Saturday this year!) A costume contest kicks off the trail at 11:30 in Village Hall on Main Street, with prizes awarded in several different categories. The treating begins at noon along Main Street and North Ave., and wraps up around 3 pm, in time for you to take the little ones home for a nap before they head out into the neighborhood for the evening's Trick or Treating festivities.\nOn Friday Nov 6 from 6-9 pm, the BID will host its final Wine Walk for 2015. This \"Get in the Spirit\" finale is sponsored by Dr. Stan Drabik's dental office, 1110 Crosspointe Lane, so you'll be picking up your glasses there. Tickets are $15 and are available by clicking here .\nFor more information about either of these events, visit the BID website .\n* * *\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com\n\"Like\" this blog on Facebook and follow me on Twitter\nMORE FROM WebsterBlog Incredible community support a hallmark of Webster Blood Drive Missy Rosenberry - Webster, Rochester | 8:55 PM Oct 1, 2015 Local duo Rain and Leaves to hold CD release party Missy Rosenberry - Webster, Rochester | 5:18 PM Sep 30, 2015 Webster Tuesday Mailbag Missy Rosenberry - Webster, Rochester | 8:34 PM Sep 28, 2015 See all posts from Blogs Extra", "external_links": ["http://www.eventbrite.com/e/websters-get-in-the-spirit-wine-walk-tickets-18834160481?aff=erelexpsim", "http://bit.ly/dluMG1", "https://twitter.com/Missyblog", "http://websterbid.com/"], "published": "2015-10-04T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:09:33.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
