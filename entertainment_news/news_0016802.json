He has come a long way from his first nervous debate performance during a US Senate run more than 40 years ago, when microphones picked up the sound of his shaking knees knocking against the table.\nThe Vermont senator faces the biggest test of his campaign when he steps firmly into the national spotlight at the first Democratic debate with Clinton, a former first lady and secretary of state who is one of the party's most experienced debaters.\nA win over Clinton, who has been bleeding support, would be a major coup for Sanders and his insurgent campaign, giving him more momentum and boosting fundraising efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:03:37.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
