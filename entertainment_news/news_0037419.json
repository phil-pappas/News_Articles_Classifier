By William Kerns A-J MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \nLubbock has been lucky to an extent, in that documentarian Charlie Minn has shown several of his films on a big screen at Premiere Cinemas — including new 2015 documentary “43,” which is not to be confused with the poor American comedy “Movie 43.” \nNo, there’s nothing at all amusing about “43.” \nMinn already has opened many Americans’ eyes to the stomach-turning, almost unbelievable rising numbers of, daily and yearly deaths just across the border in Mexico, thanks to warring cartels. \nHe has focused his camera more than once on unsolved murders, unwilling to let deaths of innocents be forgotten, and his interviews with Mexican citizens introduced viewers to new uses of the word “disappear.” \nAs in, for example, citizens fearing, “They will either kill us or disappear us.” \nWhether or not viewers believe every statement made about corruption running rampant in Mexico ... and whether they believe Minn’s sources, who explain why blood is on the hands of the United States for providing Mexico not only with aid, but also weapons ... the filmmaker provides fodder for discussion and debate. \nMinn is not the most skillful documentarian. His are not slick, well-financed films. In many ways, his is guerrilla filmmaking, and no, he cannot provide final answers for all of questions asked. \nBut he reveals the questions being asked, he makes viewers accept him as someone who cares, and most viewers probably leave theaters at least feeling better informed. \n“43,” 80 minutes in length, shines a spotlight on 43 male student teachers from the Ayotsinapa Rural Teachers College who all went missing on Sept. 26, 2014, in Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico — and also on the parents, relatives and friends who refused to stop believing that those taken might be alive somewhere. \nParents were told that these young men, who had hoped to help educate younger citizens, had been grabbed by the police and handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) crime syndicate and killed. Stories vary as to whether they were shot, drowned or hidden away. \nThe mass kidnapping became a national scandal, with many fingers pointing to the town’s mayor and police chief. Even the governor, Angel Rivero, would be forced by consistent protests to resign, and still answers have not been found. \nMinn opens his movie with one of those protests. It will be one of many. \nAt gatherings in which photos of the 43 missing are revealed, the people count loudly from 1 to 43 while marching, and grieving mothers and other relatives talk about the missing young men and what they wanted from life. All this negates one military conclusion that all 43 must have been criminals. \nDave McClain, while writing about “43” on the film’s website, quoted Minn as saying years ago, “Something has to be done to answer the cries of the innocent Mexican people.’” \nPrior to the limited opening of “43,” McClain again quotes Minn: “You can’t solve a problem unless you talk about it intelligently, and so that’s what I’m trying to do with these films.” \nMind you, Minn thinks nothing of inserting himself into his documentary. Viewers hear his narration, which is expected — and yet viewers also watch him hugging the saddened, distraught relatives of victims, which is not. But it is consistent with his style. \nBefore the film ends, Minn also will share opinions expressed by:* Demian Bichir, Mexican actor nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor for his work in 2011 film “A Better Life.” (Jean Dujardin would win that year for “The Artist.”) \n* Anabel Hernandez, an award-winning Mexican journalist. \n* Howard Campbell, anthropology professor at University of Texas at El Paso. \nWhether some express as much knowledge as emotion about the case could be questioned. \nMinn at times seems to dart back and forth, avoiding a time line which would let us know precisely when each protest or interview happened. Nevertheless, he shares many sobering facts. \nConsider: Thus far, at least 80 suspects have been arrested in this case — and 44 of them are police officers. \nAnd although parents have been told, repeatedly, that their missing sons had been killed, DNA evidence has proven only two of the 43 dead, their remains identified by visiting scientists with an Austrian-based university. \nWith that evidence, or the alarming lack there-of, no doubt any parent watching “43” can understand why, even after a year, grieving mothers and fathers of “the disappeared” continue to march, protest, and demand either DNA proof or their sons returned. \nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:28:08.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
