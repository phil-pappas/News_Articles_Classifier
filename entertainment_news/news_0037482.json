Nicolas Anelka’s men have terrorized defenses at times but have utterly wasteful up front. Sony Norde has easily been one of the best players to watch in these early parts of ISL 2015. For the ease at which the Haitian striker takes the ball past defenses, he does very little to get his name on the board in the goals tally. It was the same story in Mumbai’s previous encounter, which was a 0-2 loss against Chennaiyin FC.

Nicolas Aneka has been restricted to barking out instructions from the touchline so far as he is nursing an injury. Mumbai though, will be galvanized by Sunil Chettri bolstering their ranks. The Indian skipper’s debut was a match to forget but showed glimpses of his class in the early stages of the game. Mumbai can learn a thing or two from Delhi to devise a winning formula.
