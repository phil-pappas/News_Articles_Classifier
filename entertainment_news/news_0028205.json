And quite a few of these touched on companies grabbing agricultural land to set up some project or the other. \nThe hero a happy-go-lucky guy in the earlier phase would soon turn up like a messiah to thwart the nefarious activities of the greedy and unscrupulous companies. Kathukutty has one such plot. But the debutante director has managed to maintain a steady pace and kept the narration breezy and light hearted with a thread of humour running throughout. \nFor Narein who returns to Tamil screen after a brief break, the role of Arivu is quite different from the serious characters he had essayed in his earlier films. The actor gets to discover the lighter side of his persona, and tackles humour with surprising ease. His new unkempt look, with the ruffled hair and stubble sits well on him. Arivu despite being an MSc gold medalist had refused lucrative jobs, as he wanted to farm his land. But some of his actions in the earlier part do not quite go with his noble motive. The early scenes depict him leading a carefree life with buddy 'Ginger’ (Soory), the duo whiling away time boozing. \nAlso, when a corporate firm wants to set up a cellphone tower in the village, it’s Arivu who initially lends it support. And rightly gets rebuked by Bhuvana a neighbour truly loved the land. The initial tiffs between the two characters leads to the inevitable scenario at a later stage. \nBhuvana is shown mostly clad in comfortable shirt-skirt as she works passionately in her nursery-garden which she had set up with a loan. Srushti gets to do activities more substantial, than be just an ornamental piece here. Soory’s comic antics work out well, the constant banter between him and Narein amusing. Humour is worked out within the plot and never overdone. With elections round the corner and Arivu as the opposition candidate, the narration picks up momentum. \nYouth empowerment is touched on and dynasty politics gets a dig here. Though it’s a predictable finale, it doesn't stop one from rooting for the underdog. Fairly neatly crafted, simple in its style of story- telling, and with a message to boot, Kathukutty is a fairly engaging entertainer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:26:11.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
