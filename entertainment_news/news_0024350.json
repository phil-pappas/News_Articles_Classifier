Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing is one of the most prominent fashion designers in the industry, but even he was nervous about announcing Balmain’s forthcoming collaboration with H&M.\nLuckily for the French designer, he had models Jourdan Dunn and Kendall Jenner by his side as he made the announcement at May’s Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas.\n“I really wanted to announce it in Vegas, so I wanted to be there with Jourdan and Kendall,\" he said at a press conference in New York on Tuesday. \"It was a really amazing moment.\n\"It was also good to be there with friends because I could grab their arms and say, 'I'm so nervous!'\" he added.\nThe Billboard Music Awards was a fitting venue for the announcement, as Rousteing considers music to be a major inspiration for fashion.\nThibault Camus/AP Olivier Rousteing (center), seen here with Kendall Jenner (right) and Kim Kardashian. The creative director even acknowledged at the press conference that the black jacket he was wearing could’ve been right out of Michael Jackson’s closet.\n\"Michael Jackson sounds right,\" he said. \"I love the intersection of music and fashion. There was a reason he was called the King of Pop, and yes, I love Michael Jackson.\"\nAlso fitting at the announcement was the fact that Jenner and Dunn were on hand, as the two high-end models have teamed up with fellow jaw-dropper Gigi Hadid to lead the new clothing collaboration’s campaign.\n\"I think we wanted diversity and to show the Balmain world, so it was important to include Kendall and Gigi and Jourdan,\" Rousteing said. \"I love supermodels because they are talking to many women and I think it's important to include those types in the campaign now.\"\nBalmain/via Twitter Kendall Jenner, Jourdan Dunn and Gigi Hadid were all featured in the campaign's behind-the-scenes look Monday. The designer certainly knows a thing or two about clothing, but may know just as much about being in the buff.\nHe posed naked for the cover of French magazine Tetu earlier this year — an experience that he said made him feel “strong and powerful.”\n\"I felt so good!\" he said. \"To tell you the truth, doing a cover naked for a magazine is also a good way to feel powerful.\nThe H&M, Balmain collection released a behind-the-scenes look at its campaign with a video featuring Kendall Jenner twerking on Monday, and it kicked of its runway show on Periscope on Tuesday evening.\nWith PETER SBLENDORIO\nRelated Stories Kendall Jenner's new H&M commericial", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:53:22.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
