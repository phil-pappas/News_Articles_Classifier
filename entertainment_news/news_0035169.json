Crowe was nominated for an Oscar for best actor, and Jennifer Connelly, who played his wife, won the Oscar for best supporting actress.\nThe Nashes were returning home from Oslo, Norway , where he had received the 2015 Abel Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, one of the most prestigious honors in mathematics, when the traffic accident occurred. The prize recognized his seminal work in partial differential equations, which are used to describe the basic laws of scientific phenomena.\nAfter the fatal crash, Crowe tweeted, \"An amazing partnership. Beautiful minds, beautiful hearts.\" Connelly called the couple \"an inspiration,\" and the film's director, Ron Howard, tweeted \"it was an honor telling part of their story.\"\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Crowe was nominated for the Oscar but didn't win.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:44:50.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
