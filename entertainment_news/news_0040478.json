Other nominees include Steve Miller, Deep Purple , Chaka Khan , The Spinners, Chicago , Cheap Trick, Los Lobos , CHIC, The Smiths , Yes , The J.B.'s and The Cars . Eight of these 15 acts enter the race for the first time but none of them have passed the next stage of eligibility. In order to be eligible for this year's ballot, the artists and bands must have released their first recording at least 25 years ago. That means, their first single or album was released in 1990 or earlier. Nine Inch Nails, which made the shortlist last year, is the \"youngest\" act to be nominated this year. CHIC is the most vintage act in the list after being nominated nine times before and never making it to the next level. No other acts in the hall of fame history have been nominated as many. N.W.A. had been nominated three times before but has a good shot this year after brought back to fame through film \" Straight Outta Compton \". If chosen, Jackson would preserve her family's tradition of being Hall of Fame inductee. Jackson 5 was inducted in 1997 while her late brother Michael Jackson got the honor in 2001. Votes are officially open for public to choose the artists or bands deserving to enter \"fan's ballot,\" which will be counted. The votes will be tallied with other votes by artists, historians and music industry insiders of the Rock Hall voting body. Voting for the Top 5 performers will be closed on December 9 and the induction will be held in April in New York. Venue and date are expected to be announced later. \nÂ© AceShowbiz.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:35:22.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
