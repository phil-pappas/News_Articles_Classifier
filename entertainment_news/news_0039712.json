Experiencing a mix of excitement and disillusionment, a struggle follows against NYSC authorities by corps members and punishment meted out by the military. The play exposes how the actions and misdeeds of leaders can offend common humanity and destroy peace.\nThis stunning contemporary African drama connects the past to the present, showing how memory can yield something about life in ways that touch everyone, either as the oppressors or the oppressed. The play mirrors how the oppressed get entangled in the very misdeeds of their oppressors. Pervading the text are the universal themes of oppression and suppression, molestation, abuse, corruption, and wickedness.\nThe play represents a cumulative response to the failed Nigerian state, a country riddled with malfeasance and stealing. It also acts as a warning to the unjust world as a whole. The narrative portrays the African tragedy in a hilarious way, yet still provides a sobering portrait of the abiding problems facing the planet. \"Dead Wood\" is a reminder of which rules to follow in life and which to avoid, especially mistreating others as dead wood.\nWatch the video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjA-HX32RcA&feature=youtu.be\nAbout the Author: Joshua Agbo, author of How Africans Underdeveloped Africa: A Forgotten Truth in History, teaches at Benue State University in Nigeria.
