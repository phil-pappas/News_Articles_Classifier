The refreshed brand reflects the company’s position as an expert in bringing business process management tools and techniques to healthcare organizations who want to improve productivity and maintain a competitive edge.\n“Thirteen years ago, we launched as a technology company focused on helping providers go paperless in service of increasing efficiency. We’ve grown tremendously, adding new products and services and enhancing our core offerings every few months. Frankly, we’d been so focused on investing in our technology, our brand and marketing had been neglected,” said Esther Apter, Medforce’s Founder and CEO. “Now, our identity accurately reflects our sophistication, our broad suite of offerings, and our ability to improve productivity in all areas and departments within a healthcare organization.”\nIn addition to a new identity, the company has updated its core product names to reflect how a Medforce system can be used as a hub to connect disparate business applications through a centralized resource for workflow management and data storage. CommandCenter is the new name of the company’s business process management solution. ContentCenter is a robust document and data management system. RemitCenter is a denial management tool focused on ERN analysis and improving the quality of future claims. FormsCenter is an electronic data capture instrument used to standardize information gathering and reporting and enhance collaboration among teams. ZipMit, the company’s esMD solution, is the only core product to retain its original name due to the unique nature of the HIH partnership with CMS. In addition to software solutions, Medforce offers complementary services including electronic faxing, productivity consulting and custom programming.\n“Our new tagline ‘The Power of Productivity’ really captures it all. Our solutions act as the framework and engine for running the most efficient healthcare organization possible. Our clients are able to focus their attention on customer service and strategic endeavors because they know we have the details covered,” Apter added. “We’ve always been extremely proud of our products and our team. Now our outside appearance reflects the inside and sets a strong foundation for our continued growth.”\nTo see the new branding and learn more about Medforce, visit http://www.medforcetech.com .\nAbout Medforce Technologies\nMedforce Technologies provides productivity-enhancing software and services to help healthcare organizations adapt quickly to change and do more with less.
