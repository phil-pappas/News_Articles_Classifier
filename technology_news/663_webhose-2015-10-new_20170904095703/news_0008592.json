They included, for example, a case against a UBS AG unit, which agreed to pay more than $14.4 million to settle charges over regulatory failures in its private U.S. trading platform, known as a \"dark pool,\" that gave some of customers an advantage over others.\nThe UBS unit neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations.\nThe SEC's annual enforcement results came under scrutiny in September when a draft study by an Emory University law professor of 15 years of data critiqued the SEC's metrics for computing its annual enforcement statistics as \"deeply flawed.\"\nLaw professor Urska Velikonja found that a host of problems, including double-counting cases, has enabled the SEC to \"mask the fact that core enforcement has remained steady since 2002.\" The study is slated to be published in the Cornell Law Review.\nSEC Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney said at the time that agency disagrees with a number of Velikonja's observations.
