Now data will let them know for sure. \nDogStar Life has created the world’s first dog emotion tracker . Launched on Indiegogo today, the tracker, TailTalk, draws on the latest canine behavioral research to document dogs’ emotional state based on the complex signals delivered through their tails. The wearable tracker reveals the peaks and valleys of your dog’s happiness throughout the day, reported through a companion app available for iOS and Android. \n“Tail wagging doesn’t automatically imply that a dog is happy,” said Dr. Pamela Perry, Ph.D., DVM, Veterinary Behavior Resident at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “The tail is a dog’s social interface, signaling behavioral nuances that other dogs recognize, but which humans do not always understand. Fortunately, there are ways to monitor and record dogs’ body language, and ongoing research offers a more detailed understanding of how our pets express themselves. The goal of the DogStar Life’s tracker is to measure tail position and movements as indicators of dogs' behavior and mood, thereby allowing owners to ensure their dogs' behavioral health and wellbeing.” \nWorn on a dog’s tail, the lightweight, chew-resistant, water-resistant tracker collects actionable data on its happiness throughout the day, passing insights to the companion app via Bluetooth. Owners can survey aggregate data to annotate patterns and determine which environments, people, and toys most excite their dog and avoid the ones that cause stress. The tracker will be especially useful for new pet parents or children, who can clearly see how a dog responds to different actions and experiences. \n“A dog’s tail is like a human’s smile, conveying complex emotional signals. More than 60 percent of dog owners identify themselves as pet parents, yet until now, no one has tried to demystify our relationship with our pets,” said Yannis Tsampalis, CEO and co-founder at DogStar Life. “DogStar Life’s tracker reveals the subtle cues in every tail wag, giving you a direct window into the emotional life of your pet. The data our tracker collects could offer a Yelp-like rating for dog walkers and kennels, clearly showing which ones make dogs happiest.” \nLearn more about DogStar Life’s TailTalk dog emotion tracker and back the project at http://igg.me/at/dogstarlife . \nAbout DogStar Life \nDogStar Life is the creator of the world’s first dog emotion tracker.
