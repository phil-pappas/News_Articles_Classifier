Proposals are welcomed in all of the core scientific program areas supported by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.Proposals may be submitted to the two tracks described in this solicitation.All investigator-initiated proposals submitted to the Core track of this solicitation must now be invited based on merit review of preliminary proposals.There is a single submission deadline with a limit of 2 preliminary proposals per investigator per year as PI or Co-PI in response to the Core track of this solicitation. Please see the GPG for definition of roles for PI and Co-PI. There are no limits on the number of proposals you can participate on as collaborator.These PI/Co-PI limits do not apply to full proposals submitted to the EDGE track of this solicitation, which has no PI or Co-PI limits on number of proposals submitted.The PI/Co-PI limits apply only to the preliminary proposals submitted to the Core track of this solicitation and do not pertain to proposals submitted in response to other NSF solicitations. Unsolicited full research proposals are no longer accepted into the IOS Core Programs.Full proposals submitted on a single deadline to the EDGE track of this solicitation do not require prior submission of a preliminary proposal.A Letter of Intent is required before submission of a full proposal to the EDGE track of this solicitation.
