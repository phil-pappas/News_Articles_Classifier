In the photo above, dark, narrow streaks called recurring slope lineae are seen flowing downhill on Mars. Scientists have inferred that they were formed by contemporary flowing water.

Hide Caption 3 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars \"The existence of liquid water, even if it is super salty briny water, gives the possibility that if there's life on Mars, that we have a way to describe how it might survive,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA. Hide Caption 4 of 5 5 photos: NASA: Liquid water exists on Mars It remains to be seen whether the new discovery improves the odds of life on Mars, but researcher Mary Beth Wilhelm said the results suggest \"more habitable conditions on the near surface of Mars than previously thought.\" Hide Caption 5 of 5 Story highlights Gene Seymour: Pop culture abuzz about Mars, a planet growing in importance, popularity in scientific community and beyond Seymour: Mars' week in the spotlight could make us wonder what life would be like on the red planet Editor's Note: Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music, movies and culture for The New York Times, Newsday, Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. (CNN) Mars has had its moments in the half-century or so since the Mariner 4 satellite began sending the first photos from its surface. It's now having something far bigger and brighter than a moment. It is having a very hot week. Gene Seymour And by \"hot,\" we don't mean anything to do with surface temperature or scientific stuff like that. We mean \"hot\" in the popular culture sense. The Red Planet, putting it plainly, is a big star. (Baby!) Mars' big week began Monday with confirmation from NASA that there is evidence of what its scientists characterized as \"liquid water\" activity on Mars. To be clear, as Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science, reminded an audience at Philadelphia's Franklin Institute Wednesday, what scientists found wasn't actual flowing water so much as traces of \"precipitate salt\" that would be left behind by water after it evaporates. And on Friday came the nationwide premiere of \"The Martian,\" a Hollywood feature adapted from the best-selling Andy Weir novel and directed by Ridley Scott (\"Alien,\" \"Prometheus,\" \"Blade Runner\"). 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge When is a rock more than just a rock? When it's an iguana, of course. Conspiracy theorists have been trawling through photos taken by NASA's Curiosity rover and pointing out mysterious objects that they say are proof of life on Mars.

Hide Caption 2 of 11 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge The Squirrel: Observers spotted a squirrel crouched between two rocks in this Curiosity photo. NASA says rodents would be \"further up the food chain\" than Martian life, if it existed, ever made it to. Hide Caption 3 of 11 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge The Strange Lady: This ghost-like \"woman\" seems to peering down at Curiosity from a cliff. NASA says it's probably just an oddly shaped drift of sand. Hide Caption 4 of 11 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge The Pyramid: Alien hunters say this pyramid is roughly the size of a small car, and believe it may be the tip of a much larger pyramid buried underground.

You be the judge The Dinosaur Spine: To the uninitiated, it looks like series of rocks protruding from the ground. But alien hunters say it's a fossilized dinosaur spine. Hide Caption 10 of 11 11 photos: Life on Mars? You be the judge The Mermaid: Before there was Curiosity, there was the Spirit rover, which captured this image of a \"mermaid\" in 2008. Hide Caption 11 of 11 NASA's Green, whose knowledge of the planet is vast enough to have earned him the nickname, \"Doctor Mars,\" served as consultant on the film and appeared at the Franklin Institute at an event on the movie's behalf. He says he is as pleased with the results as, apparently, are most critics who've seen the movie already. Slate.com's Dana Stevens calls it \"a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place.\" Meanwhile, Matt Damon is already getting Oscar buzz for the starring role of Mark Watney, an astronaut marooned on Mars and somehow making a life for himself there while waiting many, many moons for rescue. Speaking of moons, NASA's announcement coincided with Monday's \"blood moon\" -- a partially eclipsed full moon whose red tincture is so rare that it won't be seen again for another 18 years . Was it coincidence that the moon was impersonating Mars at about the time all this stuff was happening? Likely it was. But this being an age that likes to poke holes in collective astonishment, there are spoilsports everywhere looking for signs of conspiracy. Rush Limbaugh weighed in with suspicions that the scientists finding water on Mars were part of an Obama administration plan to \"advance the leftist agenda.\" Still others wondered if the space agency's disclosures were somehow timed to intersect as close as possible with \"The Martian's\" premiere. To prove that degree of collusion, one would have to believe that Martian author Weir, a computer programmer who digitally self-published his original novel in 2011, would have known far enough in advance of NASA's disclosures to make them useful to Mark Watney, who never mentions either in the novel or the movie that there might be traces of water residue on the planet's surface.
