The results are in (Yawn)! Let’s be honest, we all work in a very conservative field. We do not accept or implement change very quickly. So why would we expect salaries to change much from year to year? Like previous years, the average salary of automation professionals realized only a modest increase -about 1.9% over last year. \nSince not much changes year over year, I decided to take a look back at historical data. We have been conducting a salary survey fairly consistently over the last eleven years. We did not conduct the survey in 2006 nor 2009, so there is a gap in the data for those years. You can see the trend line for the average U.S. salary of an automation professionals in the bar chart below. \nBetween 2005 and 2010, there was a relatively significant increase in the average salary. Over a five-year period the average salary increased by more than $22,400. That is a 29% increase, and certainly something to get excited about! Unfortunately, over the same length of time, from 2010 to 2015, the average salary only increased by about $8,000, an 8.1% increase. \nSince one specific job function, Automation/Control Engineering, represents exactly a third of our responses this year, I decided to look at that specific average salary trend also. It’s no surprise that the trend (below) matches very closely to the overall average salary trend (above). \nSo, what happened in the last five years? Is the demand for automation professionals not as great? Is the value they bring to a company not as great? Was the cost of living increase not as great? I’m fairly confident that the answers to all those questions is “No.” \nFor years, I’ve been preaching that automation professionals are underpaid when you consider the value they can (or could) bring to a company. Many facilities are operating on old technology and therefore are not reaping the true benefits of a full integrated automation/business enterprise. More and more seasoned professionals are retiring, and we are not attracting enough new graduates into the automation field. What new grad wants to work for a company that is using 20-30-year-old technology? \nThe demand for automation professionals will remain high for the long term. As a result, salaries should continue to increase more quickly. I’m looking for (and expecting) a step-change increase in salaries in the near future. \nMy message to employers is this…It’s time to make investments in new technology. It’s time to enable your automation staff to add more value to your entire enterprise with those investments. It’s time to act…now! If you don’t make the investments, one or more of your competitors will. Your business growth and survival depends on it. \nSalary determining factors \nAfter years of conducting this salary survey, we have identified the five major factors that determine salary: Geographic Region", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:54:16.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
