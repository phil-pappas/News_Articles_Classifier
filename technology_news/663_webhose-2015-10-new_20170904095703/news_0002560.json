But what he loved most was talking to people on the corner in a small town as he waited for his dad.\nFor a Kansas native, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has spent a lot of time in Texas.\nAs they say, it’s not his first rodeo.\n“I’ve been to just about every small town in this state traveling with my father,” Kaplan said.\nThat experience will serve him well as a regional banker in the Federal Reserve System, where he will help determine the nation’s monetary and economic policy by keeping his eye on the economies of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. He’s been on the job for six weeks.\nKaplan has big shoes to fill. His predecessor, Richard Fisher, was one of the most outspoken and colorful policymakers in his decade at the Dallas Fed.\nSimilar to Fisher, Kaplan is a former investment banker, and neither has a doctorate in economics as many Fed bankers do. Kaplan also brings academic experience to his role.\nThe 58-year-old Kaplan was born and raised in a Kansas City suburb, but back then it was a rural area. He attended public high school and played sports. He only ever wanted to go to one college, the University of Kansas, and he did.\nAfter graduating in 1979, Kaplan worked as a certified public accountant at Peat Marwick. He also worked at Trammell Crow Co., shadowing real estate tycoon Harlan Crow during the summer of 1982.\nThen it was off to Harvard Business School. After graduating, Kaplan spent 23 years at Goldman Sachs. He was vice chairman in charge of global investment banking but also led the corporate finance department, high-yield investment banking and Asia-Pacific investment banking. He worked at Harvard Business School for the last nine years as a management practice professor and senior associate dean.\nKaplan’s office is full of autographed mementos from students and gifts like pecan pralines and hot sauce that he’s received since coming to Dallas.\nA bachelor and single father of a 13-month-old son, Kaplan can see his downtown Dallas high-rise apartment from the windows of his corner office. He declined to elaborate on his personal life and fatherhood.\nFriends include many Texans, such as San Antonio Spurs general manager R.C. Buford, Tenet Healthcare CEO Trevor Fetter and former J.C. Penney CEO Mike Ullman, all of whom he met during his investment banking days or while teaching at Harvard.\nIn his first public interview since joining the Dallas Fed on Sept. 8, Kaplan talked about his plans and how he sees his role. Here are the highlights of that interview:\nHow are you refamiliarizing yourself with Texas?\nSince the beginning of September, I’ve tried to be all over the state, meeting business leaders every day. You’ll see me actively going all through this district — Texas as well as parts of Louisiana and New Mexico — meeting business leaders, civic leaders and nonprofit leaders. Another part of the job is to meet people throughout the Federal Reserve System — all of the Fed presidents and the board of governors. The third part is monetary policy and developing my own views in representing this district and the country on the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLast month was your first FOMC meeting, where policy decisions are made. Was it what you expected?\nI’m probably going to be careful what I say, but I’ll be speaking in the next few months about my views on monetary policy. I just thought it would make sense to get through a couple of FOMC meetings before I start doing this.\nSo far, meeting the Federal Reserve employees in Texas as well as other Federal Reserve people, I’ve been impressed with the professionalism, the quality, the dedication to the mission and the lack of politics. Everyone around that [FOMC] table, including me, has a speaking role. You play an important role, and there’s a great amount of mutual respect and learning from each other.\nDid I expect that? You hope for it, but it exceeded my expectations.\nWhat do you see as your role in leading the Dallas Fed?\nOne of the objectives is to make sure we have great people. We have about 65 or 70 economists here who are experts on energy, the region, the national economy and international economy. We need to be world-class in terms of our insight and monetary policy. It’s not enough to understand the district and even the country; you’ve got to understand the world.\nSecond, we need to do an outstanding job in supervising banks in the district. The health of financial institutions in this district is critical to business formation and a vibrant economy.\nWe have a great ability as a Fed to convene groups, advise leaders here, play a constructive role in the community and even help with burning issues in the district.\nWhat do you bring to the Federal Reserve System?\nI spent my career working with CEOs and business leaders around the world. And I come from a market perspective. I’m used to working with economists and I’m used to working with academics.\nCan you describe your leadership style?\nRichard Fisher did a tremendous job. My communication style, my leadership style won’t be the same as his, but I tend to be direct, outspoken.\nMy most important purpose in this job is to help have influence on making sure we make decisions that are in the best interest of the United States. I’ve never been accused of being shy or afraid to state my views.\nI also have over the years, in order to get something done, worked behind the scenes and let others get the attention.\nDo you see yourself as a policy dove, someone who is more concerned about employment than inflation, or hawk?\nI’m not going to talk about that. We’ll see what you call me a year from now. I’ve been trained to diagnose the situation, figure out what to do, figure out how to do it.\nLeaders do not have all the answers. It’s about asking the right questions and it’s being willing to listen, to admit when you are wrong and being willing to change your mind. The most important thing in being a successful leader is being willing to learn. My views will be driven by the analysis I do.\nThe Dallas Fed increased its research over the last decade. Do you plan to continue or expand that?\nYes. The big issue that Richard pioneered was globalization. I agree with that initiative completely, and we’re already talking about beefing that up.\nWith Goldman Sachs, I lived for five years in Asia, so globalization fits right in. There are other things I have a passion for where I believe we can play a unique role and we need to have insight on. You’ll see those emerge as we go.\nThere are some big macro trends in the world that are very important, such as demographic changes/aging and the implications of that for debt-to-GDP ratio, the welfare society, meeting future obligations. Why is gross national product growth more sluggish than it’s been historically? Why is the inflation rate lower than it’s been at this stage in other recoveries? You’ll see us go much deeper in economic research.\nTwitter: @SJeanDallas\nROB KAPLAN Birthplace: Prairie Village, Kan.\nFirst job: Summer camp counselor at 12\nEducation: University of Kansas, bachelor’s degree in business administration, 1979; Harvard Business School, master’s degree in business administration, 1983\nExperience: President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2015-present; co-chairman of the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, an incubator for nonprofit ventures in Boston and Silicon Valley, Calif., 2009-present; senior associate dean, Harvard Business School, 2006-15; vice chairman, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 1983-2006\nOther: Author of several books on leadership and strategy, including What You Really Need to Lead: The Power of Thinking and Acting Like an Owner (2015); What You’re Really Meant To Do: A Road Map for Reaching Your Unique Potential (2013); What to Ask the Person in the Mirror: Critical Questions for Becoming a More Effective Leader and Reaching Your Potential (2011)\nHobbies: Playing pickup basketball and football, running, watching movies and spending time with his son\nFun facts: The cover of his 2013 book, What You’re Really Meant to Do: A Road Map for Reaching Your Unique Potential, has a map of Texas on it.
