This approval represents another major milestone in the planned separation of Synchrony Financial from GE. \n\"We are pleased that Synchrony has received this key approval from the Federal Reserve Board, which brings us another step closer to completing the planned separation of Synchrony through an exchange offering that works for GE, its shareholders and Synchrony Financial,\" said GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. \"GE Capital is continuing to reduce the size and complexity of the business and is becoming less systematically important. Through the Synchrony separation and asset sales related to the GE Capital Exit Plan, we are making great progress on our portfolio transformation to enhance value for GE shareholders.\" \nAs previously announced, the separation of Synchrony is consistent with GE's stated strategy of focusing on its high-return industrial businesses and reducing the size of GE's financial businesses. GE believes that the split off is an important step in providing Synchrony with the ability to pursue its long-term strategy as a fully independent, standalone public company. GE will discuss details of the proposed Exchange Offer on its earnings call Friday, October 16, 2015 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. \nAbout GE \nGE (NYSE:GE) is the world's Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive.
