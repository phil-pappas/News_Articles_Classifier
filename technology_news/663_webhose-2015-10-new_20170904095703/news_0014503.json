Specializing in tuition management services, Smart Tuition takes the hassle out of collecting payments from parents, and even includes follow-up for past due payments. Sycamore’s PreK-12th grade school information system, Sycamore School, is now integrated with Smart Tuition, allowing parents in schools and educational organizations using the system to be able to make online payments using the well-known payment processor. Parents can access Smart Tuition from within the parent portal of Sycamore School to view information about upcoming and previous payments, and to print family tuition statements.\n“Sycamore is very excited to be working with Smart Tuition and to offer this integration to our users. Smart Tuition is a great solution that accepts many different payment options, and directly syncs with QuickBooks, which will be a huge asset for many of our schools,” says Glen Ellis, CEO of Sycamore Education.\nAn added benefit to this new integration is that once a parent has logged into their school’s Sycamore School site successfully, and has initiated access to the Smart Tuition portal, they will be authenticated via Smart Tuition’s single sign-on process. This will allow parents to login to Sycamore and get to their Smart Tuition account without having to re-authenticate every time, giving them quicker and simpler access with less log-in information to maintain.\nConnecting Sycamore and Smart Tuition streamlines the online payment process for parents by providing them the financial information they need regarding school charges, and the ability to easily make payments, together in one place. For schools, this gives them the ability to utilize a widely-known financial solution to accept online payments through Sycamore.\nEllis continues, “Schools are seeking solutions that deliver as much efficiency and ease-of-use as possible. Partnering with Smart Tuition, a leader in their industry, demonstrates Sycamore’s commitment to providing schools with a superior system and smart integrations.”\nAbout Sycamore Education\nSycamore Education is a 100% web-based school information system.
