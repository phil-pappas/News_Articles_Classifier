Referring to the defendants, he said, \"they just want to work to improve the lives of ordinary people and the state of the country\". \nAbout a dozen supporters of the two men were barred from entering the court and instead gathered outside behind police cordons, Radio Free Asia reported. \nChen was previously jailed in 2007 for four years for \"inciting state subversion,\" based on articles he had written on overseas websites criticising the government and advocating democracy. \nLu was sentenced to four years for the same crime in 2008. \nChina's ruling Communist Party under President Xi Jinping has in recent years tightened a crackdown on intellectuals, lawyers and activists critical of the government, with scores detained and dozens jailed. \nThe court has yet to announce a verdict, Fu said. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:23:06.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
