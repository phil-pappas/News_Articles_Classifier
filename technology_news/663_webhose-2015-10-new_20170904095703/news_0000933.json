Among these hands-free technologies, Google Now achieved the best rating, meaning it was the least distracting.\nAmong vehicles tested, the least level of distraction was seen in General Motors' ( GM.N ) Chevy Equinox while the highest was in Mazda Motor Corp's ( 7261.T ) Mazda 6.\nAutomakers and technology companies such as Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Google Now maker Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) and LG Corp ( 003550.KS ) are counting on demand for complex vehicle communications and entertainment systems to help boost growth.\nHowever, road safety concerns could result in greater regulatory scrutiny of such systems.\nThe research was carried out by Dr. David Strayer and Dr. Joel Cooper of the University of Utah.\nA total of 257 drivers aged 21-70 participated in the study of 2015 model-year vehicles, while 65 additional drivers ages 21-68 tested Siri, Cortana and Google Now.\n(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:12:01.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
