Officials are also considering charging financial institutions more to deposit excess funds at the central bank, Mr. Draghi said.\nMr. Draghi's language and explicit reference to December was more direct than many had expected, sending stocks and eurozone bonds higher as the euro sank against the dollar. Lower borrowing costs and a weaker euro have supported equities in recent years.\nMarkets in Asia joined the rally on Friday. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 2.1% as the ECB's stance and comments from an adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe added to speculation about further monetary easing from the Bank of Japan.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.3% and the Shanghai Composite Index closed up 1.3%, after data showed improvement in China's house prices and sales.\nFriday's gains followed a strong session in the U.S., where corporate earnings and the prospect of fresh ECB stimulus sent the Dow to its highest level in over two months.\n\"Equity markets remain addicted to the rush of continued central bank policy stimulus,\" said Ian Williams, economist and strategist at brokerage Peel Hunt.\n\"Few expected the message following the ECB meeting to be even more dovish than in September, but that is how it turned out.\"\nSome upbeat economic data in the eurozone, which could discourage the ECB from acting, did little to dent the rally. Growth in eurozone private sector activity picked up pace in October, against expectations for a slight slowdown, data showed Friday.\nThe data helped the euro stage a modest rebound from its heavy losses on Thursday. The common currency rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.1120.\nIn the U.S., several large technology companies posted results after markets closed. Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. soared in after-hours trading after it reported higher quarterly revenue and profit. Shares of Amazon.com Inc. also rose sharply in after-hours trading after it notched a surprise profit, while Microsoft Corp. gained on better-than-expected net and cloud-services revenue.\nThe earnings season will also continue with reports from Procter & Gamble Co., American Airlines Group Inc., and Thomson Reuters Corp.\nIn commodities, Brent crude was 0.2% higher at $48.18 a barrel. Gold was up 0.6% at $1,173.40 a troy ounce.\nWrite to Tommy Stubbington at tommy.stubbington@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com\n 23, 2015 04:05 ET (08:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:11:32.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
