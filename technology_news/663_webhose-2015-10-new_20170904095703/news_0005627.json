According to Salesforce’s 2015 State of Marketing report , 89 percent of marketers found social media listening to be effective to some degree, but only 37 percent of the 5,000 marketers surveyed actively practiced social media listening. If marketers would only listen, they would discover that a treasure trove of data and insights awaits them.\n“Listening is more important than it’s ever been,” Jay Baer explains in the e-book. “Feedback is manifested publicly, where it has historically been private and brands that listen now have an enormous opportunity to improve business and fix problems for the future.”\nThe e-book explores how marketers can:\nListen to prospects to generate business leads from social conversations Listen to customers to find opportunities for improvement through complaints Listen to competitors to stay ahead and discover their secrets to innovate and stand out in the market Listen to influencers to extend their reach by aligning with influencers to ignite their content Listen to employees to boost brand reputation by positioning them as brand advocates\n“Listening is marketing’s moneyball tactic,” said Cision CEO Peter Granat. “The brands that seize this opportunity to listen and better understand their prospects, customers, competitors, influencers and employees will flourish, and those who ignore it or delay entry will eventually fold.”\nTo learn more about the power of social media listening, download the full e-book for free here . In addition, Jay Baer, along with the other participating authors, will host a free webinar outlining the importance of social listening and how to leverage the data gathered to drive real results on Tuesday, October 20 at 2 p.m. ET.
