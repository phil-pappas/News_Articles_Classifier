These newer offerings are just some of them,” said Philips’ Country Marketing Manager for Lighting, Christine Villanueva.\nThe new line of LED-based products seeks to address practical lighting concerns, which are in turn affected by the aesthetic qualities of light as well. Studies compiled by the Illumination and Engineering Society (IES) show that lighting plays a crucial role in cycles of both productivity and relaxation in human beings. LED lighting also spells efficiency and low electric consumption.\nPhilips’ new range of LED solutions combine the practical and the visually appealing, providing perfect lighting to suit different activities carried out in various parts of a home or building. Scene Switch goes between cool white light and warm yellow daylight without any additional switch installation or re-wiring. Deco Classic takes design cues from mid-century light bulbs, but are exponentially more efficient.
