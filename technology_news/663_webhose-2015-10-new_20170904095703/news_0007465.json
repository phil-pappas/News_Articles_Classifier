The university selected Videotel's VP71 Industrial Digital Media Player to create an impressive 40'x40' display at the three-day Southern Baptist Convention in Columbus, Ohio. Chad Jackson, director of marketing at Cedarville University, praised the high-quality output and ease of use of Videotel's VP71 display. According to Jackson, the eye-catching display \"made us stand out in the crowd. I love how I never have to turn the videos on. Our TVs automatically turn back on after power loss, so we could flip the power strip switch in the morning and our videos and TVs were instantly up and running.\"\nCedarville's use of Videotel's VP71 did not end with the close of the convention. These days, Jackson says he can \"confidently send our reps on the road with Videotel’s VP70 or VP71 without a need for tech support or instructions. It's so easy. I drop the videos I want to loop on the SD card and plug it into the TV. It just works. It's literally plug-and-play.\"\nJackson and the university expect their Videotel Industrial Digital Media Players to be part of their interactive signage for years to come. Both the VP70 and VP71 are designed for heavy commercial use. The players can be expected to auto-loop any type of media from an SD card or USB and run nonstop, around the clock for at least four years. The players are adaptable for use in interactive displays, as well, with the addition of a computer to trigger timed content, LED push buttons, or motion and proximity sensors. The player's compact size only adds to its versatility, and it is easily incorporated into any visual display.\nJackson says he is looking forward \"to exploring new ways to incorporate Videotel products in our displays\" in the future.\nAbout Videotel Inc.\nVideotel Inc. is an award-winning manufacturer of industrial digital signage media players, industrial looping DVD players and interactive technology.
