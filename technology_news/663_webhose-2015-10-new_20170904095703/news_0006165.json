In the Asia-Europe trade, reliability improved by 4.3 points against the previous month to a second-best monthly performance of 81.2%. Year-on-year Asia-Europe reliability is up by a huge margin of 21.3 points. \nThe only negative for the month was the performance of services in the Transatlantic route, which slipped by 2.3 points month-on-month to 72% in September, 2015. The annual comparison for the trade is also unfavourable, down by 6.9 points. \nAfter a two-month break Maersk Line returned to the top of the carrier reliability rankings in September, 2015 with an on-time average across the three trades of 86.9%. The Danish mega-carrier has claimed top spot in 15 out of the last 17 months. \nA further sign of the overall improvement in reliability spreading across the industry is that eight of the 19 carriers tracked achieved a reliability rating of over 80%. \nSimon Heaney, Senior Manager of Supply Chain Research at Drewry, said: “The steady improvement in reliability seen through 2015 is very welcome news for shippers, who at the same time are the beneficiaries of very low freight rates. \n“Operational changes to services for the traditionally slower-volume Q4 has the potential to disrupt the improving reliability trend, but we expect results over the next few months to only be marginally down on September’s peak.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:06:32.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
