A classic from the Original PlayStation \nMediEvil \nWhat’s not to love about a reincarnated skeleton knight battling an evil sorcerer and his battalions of undead monsters? \nWhen Sir Dan wasn’t using his arsenal of medieval weapons for combat, he would be trying to solve the unique puzzles offered throughout the game. \nWhile seeming terrifying in concept, the game was far from scary with its bright and colourful graphics making it suitable for all ages. Sweet night vision goggles, tasers and a whole lot of murder. \nSyphon Filter \nIt was the game that almost never saw the light of day, but thankfully it did. \nSyphon Filter was a third-person shooter that combined stealth, action and puzzle solving. \nWhen it was released in 1999, the game was met with positive praise from critics for its complex storyline, which centred on US special agents sent to Nepal to apprehend an international terrorist. \nThe game boasted to offer a new “super-spy” genre that offered gameplay consisting of violence and stealth, and it didn’t dissapoint. This disconcerting cover is a reflection of the game. Source: Supplied \nDino Crisis \nThe same team behind Capcom’s Resident Evil games helped create a new breed of survival horror with this little gem. \nWhen a female special operations agent is sent to investigate a mysterious island facility, she discovers it has become overrun with vicious dinosaurs. \nMuch more action-oriented than the Resident Evil franchise, Dino Crisis offers hours of suspenseful play with gamers sitting on the edge of their seat as they attempt to escape a Velociraptor-filled facility with their lives. One of the first open world driving games of its kind. \nDriver \nSet in Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, this game mimics the feel of 1960s and 1970 car chase films. \nThe game follows the story of an undercover NYPD detective aiming to infiltrate organised crime organisations by impressing them with his skills behind the wheel. \nThrough a series of driving missions, the player completes the story mode, while also unlocked the ability to drive freely around each of the cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:12:27.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
