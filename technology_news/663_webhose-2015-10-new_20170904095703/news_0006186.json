First off, it will combine the valuation features from all of their three portals – Homequant, TownAnalyst and LocValu. Therefore, in addition to valuing individual subject properties, subscribers of the Apps will be able to analyze sales, assessment and location values by Towns and Zip Codes, meaning having access to the macro analysis tools on-the-go as well.\nIn order to make the Apps truly mobile-friendly, many new and “convenience” features will be made available; for example, once users enter the subject’s Zip, the median Land, Bldg and Bldg Age pertaining to the Zip will automatically appear, thus allowing them the flexibility to accept (or override) those values without having to re-enter values that are in close proximity. Addresses of the final comps contributing to the subject’s value will contain live connections to the GPS. Apps will also allow users the opportunity to email out a PDF-based report for outside storage.\nIn order to accommodate professionals and non-professionals alike, subscription forms will range from one market, to five markets, to unlimited versions having access to all of their markets (they currently cover 60 major markets with plans for 100 in the near future). The iPhone version will be self-optimized for iPads as well.\nHomequant is looking to raise $55K for the project to pay for development, marketing, project hosting, employee costs (including paid interns in Orlando) and patenting.\nIn return for the pledge, Homequant is offering the following rewards to the backers: one year of free unlimited subscription for $25 pledge; six months for $15 and three months for $10. Since Kickstarter is an all-or-none host, the minimum threshold must be met for the campaign to come to fruition.\nHaving launched this campaign on Kickstarter, Homequant’s President said, “Unlike other crowd-funding companies, Kickstarter vets its projects before accepting so we are truly honored to be selected. This campaign allows us to accommodate our patrons to be involved in our organic growth. A cross-section of our backers will be involved in beta testing so their inputs would be reflected in our Apps. If this funding process becomes successful, we will open up some of our future projects the same way, hopefully leading to equity funding part of our company.”\nURL to their Kickstarter campaign\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homequant/mobile-apps-for-subcription-based-homequant-style", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/homequant/mobile-apps-for-subcription-based-homequant-style"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:55:59.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
