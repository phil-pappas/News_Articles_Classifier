From the dawn of the modern civilizations, the lower classes, when feeling hard done by, shout and scream their way to change. The other classes look on with disdain because, well, they have nothing to feel hard done by.\nThese current student protests are a personal turning point for me. Even though I have graduated from private education with the help of my mothers credit card, in hindsight it is a bitter taste to have knowing that paying exorbitant fees to enable me to follow my dreams and make a life for myself is the threshold that needed to be crossed. This wasn't in the distant past, this was last year. 2014. A year which marked the fact that my mother would be reminded by Standard Bank, monthly, that her son's education cost her a small fortune.\nEducation is the backbone of every generation. It is not a luxury. It is a need. It is the catalyst for an entire generation to improve their standard of living. There is no more viable way to climb out of the depths of poverty than for one to gain and education and become skilled in one field or another. However, the system, or to put it slightly more totalitarian, \"big brother\" has created this system where the oppressed do not have the right to fight to become unoppressed.\nUnder the current system, a child born on the street, will live his or her life on the street. Under the proposed system, a child born on the street has a chance to become educated up to a level which will enable him or her to become a functioning member of society. A chance to become proud. A chance to climb above the poverty line. How can children dream of creating a better life when there is essentially no hope?\nIf we are to stake a step back and look at it from an objective point of view, we are not fighting for personal gain, individual achievement or an idiosyncratic ideal. The students of South Africa are fighting for a basic human right. If it is plain to see that free education will improve our country beyond any shadow of a doubt, why is this even a debate? The opposition is the government.\nThe same bureaucratic government that now has to put up its hand and take responsibility for failure yet again. The opposition is the banking system. The same financial system who is now at risk for losing billions of rands in student loan interest. The opposition is the passive. The same passive population who like things the way they are. South Africans are effectively trying to take capitalism out of a basic human right. And so far succeeding.\nThe direction these protests have taken, to challenge the institution of education, instead of the individual institutions themselves, will be a turning point in our country's future. Far more effective than budget speeches, cabinet reshuffles or foreign policy debates. The right to free education. This is the key to economic growth. This is the key to social advancement. This is the key to a positive future.\nYou can't put a price on education.\nIn summary, I pity the suit who tries to claim otherwise. Because in 10, 20 or even after our life times, this revolution in South Africa will be remembered in the same breath as Hector Peterson, Steve Biko, and Nelson Mandela. Not as an individual, but as a moment when the status-quo of inequality was challenged by not only the oppressed, but by a nation; United.\nAddendum: I personally hope these protests last until education from Grade R to University reach absolute zero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:24:12.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
