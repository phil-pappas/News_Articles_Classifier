Oneill Photographics Share on twitter by Agnes King Accounting software maker MYOB is moving its data storage facilities from Singapore back to Australia to soothe customer paranoia about cyber security and data sovereignty.\n\"We're moving it back here purely because of perception,\" MYOB chief executive Tim Reed told a Smithink Accountants' Technology Showcase in Sydney.\n\"It's not a legal issue [or] a security issue.\"\nMYOB is not switching suppliers. It will continue to use both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure but will move its data from the Azure data centre in Singapore to Sydney, and once this move is complete all MYOB online products will use a local data centre.\nReckon's Accountants Group managing director Sam Allert said housing its data in Australia came at a greater cost. Rob Homer MYOB's bid to manage perceptions could result in some nasty realities. Its data storage costs could surge if competitor Reckon's experience is anything to go by.\nCostly move Reckon has kept its data housed in Australia to manage perceived data sovereignty risks, but its accountants group managing director Sam Allert said the decision came \"at a greater cost to us\".\nFears that foreign authorities can force technology companies to hand over data housed in their jurisdiction is driving a lot of this behaviour. For example, United States regulations granting regulators access to foreign entities' information.\n But Mr Reed said having data hosted in Australia may not protect businesses from the long arm of US data laws.\n\"The way US legislation is written, if you do business with a US company, the US government has the right to access your data,\" he said.\nFears about cyber security are seen as the biggest inhibitor to the uptake of internet and digital solutions by the nation's 10,000 small and medium accounting firms, according to a poll by management consultancy Smithink.\nThe needle on that barometer hasn't changed for four years.\nIn reality, it hasn't blocked adoption. Consumer demand, cost and productivity gains are too great an incentive.\n\"Actual take-up of cloud technology has consistently beaten predictions,\" Smithink founder David Smith.\nMost credible software suppliers agree that small businesses automatically increase their security by moving to cloud-based technologies.\nDiminishing security concerns \"These guys are spending billion of dollars a year in security, far more than any of us could possibly ever spend defending the data centre itself,\" said Ron Lesh, managing director of superannuation administration software maker BGL, which uses Amazon to host client data.\nMr Lesh said he is getting \"a lot less questions about security today than we've had in the past\".\nBut he's concerned about vulnerabilities created by a plethora of add-on applications popping up with questionable security credentials.\nThe diversity in advisory tools is one of the most exciting trends in the professional services sector.\n\"The investment in the category is bigger than any one company could bring to bear,\" said Mr Reed.\nBut poorly written software that clients use and try to integrate with existing information technology systems are now the most common source of breaches, according to Mr Lesh.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Agi_King"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:24:12.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
