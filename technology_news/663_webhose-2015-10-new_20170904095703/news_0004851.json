The discussion focuses on overcoming patient financial barriers, maximizing programs through effective execution, and avoiding common mistakes that compromise successful outcomes. Panelists include Robert Polans, Vice President, MCO and Trade, Cempra Inc. and Rich Wartel, President, Two Labs Marketing, LLC. In one of the meeting's keynote presentations, \" Transformation of Healthcare-The Power of Pharmacy and Mobile \" Stacey Irving, Vice President, Strategic Channel Solution, MPRS, and Lara Loveman, Director of Business Strategy, Mscripts, will offer their perspective on the changing landscape of pharmacy and how mobile solutions in this channel help brands engage patients to better manage their health. This highly anticipated session will give attendees the knowledge they need to leverage HCPs to delivr patient education, adherence support and financial assistance; utilize mHealth in the pharmacy channel to improve patient outcomes while reducing abandonment; empower their brands with collaboration and personalization and evaluate the current capabilities of e-prescribing. MPRS closes the Conference with the Stakeholder Panel, \" Improve Patient Adherence Through Enhanced Patient Outcomes and Reduction in Behavioral Barriers .\" Amanda Rhodes, M.P.H.,Director, Client Strategy & Solutions for MPRS, will lead a panel of stakeholders including pharmacists, HCPs and manufacturers focused on the importance of providing patients holistic support through coaching and innovation.
