International callers can access the conference call at 1-913-981-5526. \nA replay of the call will be available from 5:00 p.m. PT on Wednesday, October 21, 2015, until 9:00 p.m. PT on Wednesday, October 28, 2015, by dialing 1-877-870-5176 (international callers can access the replay by dialing 1-858-384-5517) and entering the confirmation code 950586.

These measures are adjusted to exclude amounts related to stock-based compensation, expense associated with dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, the amortization of intangibles from business combinations, restructuring charges, and the related tax impact of these items. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, our non-GAAP results exclude a one-time gain on the sale of real estate. Dolby presents non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Dolby's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Dolby's management believes to be its ongoing business operations. Dolby's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Dolby's business for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Dolby's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Whenever Dolby uses non-GAAP financial measures, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as detailed above. Investors are also encouraged to review Dolby's GAAP financial statements as reported in its US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of this press release and on Dolby's investor relations website at http://investor.dolby.com . \nForward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements in this press release, including, but not limited to, statements relating to Dolby's expected financial results for Q1 2016 and fiscal 2016, our ability to advance our long-term objectives, and future quarterly dividend payments, are \"forward-looking statements\" that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
