COLLINS, Colo.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- CasaTunes ®, the leader in streaming multi-room music solutions , today unveiled the CasaTunes module for URC®’s Total Control® home automation system to coincide with the start of CEDIA where demos can be seen in booth #5028. CasaTunes created a driver for the URC Total Control system that allows dealers to integrate CasaTunes into a complete URC automated home and control it all seamlessly using URC systems. URC can now control CasaTunes music streams alongside URC's powerful control for TVs, AV Receivers, DVD players, lighting, thermostats, AV, security and other equipment in every major category. \n“As a leading force in whole-house control, URC is dedicated to providing superior control products for homes including multi-room music systems which are forever growing in popularity,” said Cat Toomey, Director of Marketing with URC. “Using the free CasaTunes two-way software module with our Total Control line of products makes it fast and easy for dealers to integrate whole house audio using our highly-efficient Accelerator configuration program.” \nThe new CasaTunes URC Total Control module allows the URC dealer to add up to 9 streams of audio using the CasaTunes CT-3S , CT-4S and CT-8S Streamers with URC Total Control systems. The driver supports both one- and two-way commands and supplies metadata and cover art for each stream. Each stream is totally independent and supplies up to 192kHz, 24bit music from built in music services like Pandora, Spotify, Tidal and many others. In addition, the customer can use the CasaTunes streams to listen to iTunes and Windows Media music along with AirPlay streams from iOS devices and other AirPlay sources. A simple to use browsing scheme lets the customer easily and quickly find the music to play. CasaTunes Streamers include up to 1000GB of storage for local music. The new solution is targeted for public release shortly after CEDIA EXPO 2015. \n“It was a pleasure working with URC to integrate CasaTunes’ Streaming products into the URC world. We believe URC dealers are in for a new experience of excellent support and flexibility in streaming audio products,” Kim Knapp, VP of engineering and design with CasaTunes stated. \nAbout CasaTunes \nCasaTunes designs music distribution systems for well-connected homes.
