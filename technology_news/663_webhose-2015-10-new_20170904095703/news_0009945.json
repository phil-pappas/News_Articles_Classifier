The new Commvault solutions portfolio, the eleventh major release of the company's renowned data protection offering, delivers a broad spectrum of innovation designed to help customers address the increasing challenges of managing data and information in highly disrupted, fast-paced global business environments. Customers, partners and influencers offering support include: \"Any way that companies can gain more leverage out of their existing assets, they should,\" said Steve Duplessie , Founder and Senior Analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. \"Their data might be their most valuable asset of all – so getting more out of the data they have is an obvious win. The Commvault platform enables businesses of all sizes to get far more value out of what normally are dormant assets, and no one can argue the benefit of that.\" \"We all know data conversations are changing,\" said Phil Goodwin , Research Director – Data Protection, Business Continuance and Disaster Recovery, IDC . \"IT leaders are challenged not only with keeping up with a constantly changing technology world, but also doing that within strict budget and resource constraints. In fact, IDC research shows that initiatives related to data protection and managing data are among the top priorities for customers today. In order to keep pace, it's imperative for customers to be able to leverage their existing data assets to drive more business value out of that data. With its next generation platform, Commvault is positioning itself to help customers utilize their existing data stores and unlock business insight to drive new value from their technology investments.\" \"As new technologies surface in the market, and point solutions offer quick fixes for real-time challenges, customers are looking to meet their data protection goals with an open approach that promotes a heterogeneous environment,\" said Henry Baltazar , Research Director for the Storage Research Channel at 451 Research . \"Commvault is emerging as a vendor that can enable customers to activate their data and drive additional value from their technology investments. By enabling third parties to leverage its management and storage platforms, Commvault is showing that it recognizes that customers require the management and agility to deliver more business insight, while ensuring its customers have the flexibility necessary to achieve unique recovery and agility requirements.\" \"While careful vetting of vendors to address the challenges that end users face today around data protection and availability is key to any purchasing decision, it is not enough,\" Sean Pike , Program Director, eDiscovery and Information Governance at IDC . \"Customers must have a forward vision of the market, work with their vendors to ensure that such technologies move through a predictable evolution of investment and plot where those technologies are in their life cycle. We share the Commvault view point that providing end users with a checklist of requirements to achieve optimal data protection may help ensure customers are prepared to address the IT challenges of both today and tomorrow.\" \"When you modernize production, you have to modernize protection too! And nowhere is that more important than for organizations embracing emerging and disruptive new IT delivery models, such as hyper-converged infrastructures and public clouds,\" said Jason Buffington , Data Protection Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group . \"Between ever-heightening availability requirements and new mandates for compliance and data governance, organizations need smarter and more comprehensive data protection and management solutions. Real, sustainable business and IT value and actionable insight comes from a holistic approach to data management that delivers flexibility, agility and data‑governance throughout the data lifecycle; wherever it is stored, consumed or shared. Commvault's vision makes a lot of sense for customers looking for that next generation data management solution that must address a range of requirements that firmly put folks on a path to meeting their data needs today and in the future.\" \"Commvault has given us the assurance to seamlessly take the next step to embrace disruptive technologies while reducing cost and risk for the business,\" said Richard Cohen , Chief Information Officer, PFD Food Services . \"Food distribution is a fast and often unforgiving business; there is a narrow window to match supply and demand, while the market is fiercely competitive. Information plays a strategic role in ensuring we maintain our competitive edge and with Commvault we have the ability to continue to modernise and streamline the management of our critical information assets.\" \"In government, we need a lot of flexibility to adapt to change,\" said Jon Walton , CIO of County of San Mateo, California . \"The business requirements are fluid, procurement and funding timelines are long, and we want the taxpayer to feel as though their money's being well spent. Commvault's broad integration with key infrastructure partners like VMware, Microsoft and Nutanix gives us the agility we need to leverage interrelated technologies, maximize our investment and provide a cost-effective solution to our end users while achieving the business outcomes we want.\" \"As a manufacturing company, we simply cannot afford any downtime; the entire supply chain is dependent on information being available, protected and reliable so having a rock-solid data management solution is essential to the business,\" said Dr. Vineet Bansal , CIO at Greenply Industries Limited . \"We've had a wonderful experience working with Commvault and we are excited to continue to evolve our strategy as the next generation platform develops. I'm looking forward to working with their expert team to deliver further efficiencies and enablement for the business that is well beyond data protection and recovery.\" \"We're excited about Commvault's ability to develop solutions which anticipate the business trends and technology challenges we expect to face just around the corner, and look forward to the enhancements in this latest release which will help my team continue to drive value back to the organization,\" said Craig Fletcher , CTO, CH2M Hill . \"The reliable cadence of leading innovation we've come to expect from Commvault gives us a good feeling about our partnership and real confidence that we have the right technology platform in place to meet future business requirements.\" \"Line of business owners demand a reliable, flexible and resilient infrastructure for their business-critical applications,\" said Michael Sotnick , VP of Global Channels and Alliances, Pure Storage . \"The combination of Pure Storage all-flash arrays with Commvault IntelliSnap software ensures predictable high-performance and reliability across a wide spectrum of applications and operating systems, with minimal administration required by IT staff.\" \"Commvault delivers industry-recognized data protection and recovery solutions for Nutanix customers,\" said Venugopal Pai , Vice President, Strategic Alliances and Business Development at Nutanix . \"Our relationship with Commvault is another clear example of our track record of working with strategic partners to deliver innovative solutions that solve customer problems to the market.\" \"As a leading provider of integrated information technology solutions, CDW appreciates the ability to leverage Commvault's unified platform as a core data center solution that we can offer to our customers spanning all major segments and verticals,\" said Shea Hart , Director of Product & Partner Management, Data Center Solutions, CDW . \"Given the partnered success we've experienced thus far in working with Commvault, we are extremely excited to explore the joint opportunities that the next generation of the Commvault solution platform will open for us.\" \"Through Commvault's new software and next generation platform, our customers can now leverage industry leading data management capabilities that were not previously available anywhere,\" said Cam Bulanda , Vice President of Data Center Specialty Sales, Insight. \"These innovations from Commvault give us a strategic advantage and bolster our existing portfolio of offerings while driving new efficiencies and speed in IT operations for our customers and accelerating their overall time to value.\" \"Nimble Storage and Commvault have a strong partnership that is built on the desire to help our joint customers deploy innovative data protection solutions,\" said Radhika Krishnan , VP of Solutions Marketing and Alliances . \"Nimble's integration of snapshots with Commvault IntelliSnap provides customers efficient and simple backup as well as application-aware rapid recovery. We are excited about continuing the partnership with the release of Commvault's next generation software and open management platform.\" \"With the continued, rapid growth of data, some customers struggle with meeting service level agreements,\" said Tim Butchart , Vice President Data Protection Sales at Hitachi Data Systems . \"The integration of Hitachi replication technology with Commvault's Data Platform enables us to provide our customers with fast access and recovery not just for data loss events, but also to drive development, test, and analytical queries in their storage arrays. We're excited for this extended partnership and the snapshot and replication management benefits our customers will continue to reap.\" \"We expect Commvault's new software and data platform to be very well received by our customers, who are dealing with a storm of emerging challenges, including rapidly changing technologies, vendor lockin and tightening resource requirements,\" said Mark Melvin , Chief Technology Officer, ePlus . \"Commvault's new software addresses these issues by unveiling a new open, standards-based data management architecture, enabling customers to choose where they store their data.\" \"We're excited to bring the next generation of Commvault software into our suite of integrated solution offerings to customers,\" said Jay Waggoner , VP Sales, VeriStor . \"A key component to our BaaS offering, Commvault's new solution builds off the success of previous versions to provide increased functionality depth to our customers, while addressing real business challenges resulting from rapidly changing technology, tightening resource requirements, and ever-expanding volumes of data.\" \"Commvault's next generation software will continue to be our secret weapon,\" said Wayne Kiphart , President, OnX Managed Services . \"With our focus on outcome-based data protection services, with secure and reliable managed backup and recovery, we're confident the new software and data platform will provide our customers with unmatched support as they manage the influx of data across multiple environments.\" \"ACA Pacific are very excited about Commvault's next generation solution portfolio, and we believe it will definitely help to solve customers' data management challenges in the cloud computing environment,\" said Mark Gill , Managing Director, ACA Pacific Technology . \"In return, we can leverage and deliver a much stronger value proposition to our customers and help them to meet both their IT and business objectives.\" \"We are excited by the new announcements Commvault is making,\" said Prashanth GJ, CEO, Technobind . \"The Next Generation solution is a natural evolution of their best-in-class data platform, it's aligned with what we are seeing in our India market at the moment which is customers looking at modernizing their back-up strategy. This launch helps take Commvault to another level in terms of addressing this market opportunity. I am really looking forward to taking this out to the field and generating more opportunities for our partners and hence grow our business together.\" \"Commvault's Data Platform continues to leap further ahead in Cloud functionality, allowing us to provide a seamless solution from Legacy to Virtual to Cloud, with all the rock-solid stability Commvault's unified code base has been well known for,\" said Carl Dipane , technical director, CD-DataHouse . \"Commvault's openness and breadth of support means our customers have unbounded flexibility in their choice of hardware platform, hypervisor, SAN technology or cloud providers, meaning we can get on with deploying world-class data protection systems, without restricting our customers' future choices.\" \"Today's announcement from Commvault has a double bonus for us,\" Joe Arcuri , Enterprise Sales Manager, UXC Connect . \"Firstly, the next generation solution allows us to be even more competitive than before when positioning against our rivals.
