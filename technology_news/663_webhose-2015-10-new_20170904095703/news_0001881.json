The E-Bullet features a Bluetooth headset that syncs to any smartphone as well as a charger and a safety hammer to allow users to quickly escape from a car in an emergency situation.\nThe E-Bullet is an easy-to-use Bluetooth headset that, once set up to sync with a vehicle, automatically boots and connects to a mobile phone whenever the engine is started. The driver can easily answer and end phone calls without being distracted by a handset, making it safer to drive and engage in cell phone calls.\nThe device also includes an automatic charger. When connected to the vehicle, charging is automatic, so the headset is always ready to use. Further, it has a dual USB so that two devices can be connected in the car for on-the-go charging capability. Finally, the device features a metal safety hammer. This allows anyone trapped in a car to quickly and safely break a window or other glass and exit from the vehicle. Many experts recommend that everyone keep a safety hammer in his or her car in order to have a reliable way to exit the vehicle under any circumstances in which it may be difficult to open or roll down a window, such as when the car goes into water.\nAs seen at http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/e-bullet-multi-function-blutooth-headset , the IndieGoGo campaign offers pledge levels of $31 for the first 500 donors, who will receive an E-Bullet device. The next 1000 donors will receive the E-Bullet for $34, and all donors after that will receive the E-Bullet for $40. For more information, see the IndieGoGo page.\nAbout E-Bullet Multi-Function Bluetooth Headset:\nThe E-Bullet Multi-Function Bluetooth Headset is a unique device that features Bluetooth capability, a charger and a safety hammer.
