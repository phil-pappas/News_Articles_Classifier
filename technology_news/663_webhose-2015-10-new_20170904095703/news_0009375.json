(\"DraftKings\" or the \"Company\") today released a report summarizing the findings of an independent investigation conducted by Greenberg Traurig, LLP into the allegations that DraftKings employee Ethan Haskell used non-public information for his own advantage in playing a daily fantasy sports game on the FanDuel web site. The Greenberg Traurig investigation was led by John Pappalardo, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and confirmed the Company's conclusions based on its own internal review of the matter, namely that: \n1. Mr. Haskell did not utilize non-public information regarding aggregate player ownership percentages in fantasy lineups in DraftKings daily fantasy sports games when the September 27(th), 2015 FanDuel lineup was entered. \n2. Moreover, it would have been impossible for Mr. Haskell to have used such non-public information because he only gained access to internal DraftKings data a full forty minutes after the lineup was locked. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150923/269777LOGO \nJason Robins, CEO of DraftKings, said: \"We are very pleased that the independent investigation by Greenberg Traurig has confirmed the findings of our internal review of this matter and our conclusion that there was no improper use of information by our employee. In fact, as the investigation also concluded, it was not even possible for non-public information to have been used improperly.\" \nDespite the fact that Mr. Haskell did not improperly utilize non-public information, the Company promptly expanded its existing policy prohibiting its employees from participating in games run on its own web site to all other daily fantasy sports web sites. \n\"DraftKings is fully committed to operating our daily fantasy sports games in a manner that is completely transparent and fair for all players,\" said Mr. Robins. \"We will also continue to work with all relevant authorities to ensure that sports fans can continue to enjoy the daily fantasy sports experience they love.\" \nA copy of DraftKings' report on the findings of the Greenberg Traurig investigation is available on the DraftKings website at the following link . \nAbout DraftKings \nDraftKings, Inc. is a leading skill-based Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) game platform that allows fans in North America to compete in single-day, online games for cash and prizes across the largest variety of professional sports.
