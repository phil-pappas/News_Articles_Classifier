The satellite is expected to be launched into space in 2016 by the Falcon 9 rocket developed by Elon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX .\nForeign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game Facebook committed two years ago to bring the Internet to the three-fifths of the world without it. According to today’s announcement, the social network has helped one billion people in 19 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America get online.\nMr. Zuckerberg unveiled in July a giant drone, which will one day, along with its fleet, be able “ to beam Internet to people from the sky ,” as Zuckerberg explained of the company’s mission in a Facebook post.\nAnd though a United Nations commission recently pointed to \"stubbornly persistent\" gap between the Internet-rich and poor, Facebook thinks it can close it. The social media giant reports that there are 100 million people every month accessing Facebook across Africa, upwards of 80 percent of them doing it through their mobile phones.\nNot only does Facebook plan to take advantage of the mobile revolution in the developing world to democratize information, it also aims to bring more consumers into the Internet fold for companies to advertise to.\nOn the Facebook for Business site, where the company notes the benefits to businesses of connecting more people in Africa and other “high-growth regions” to Facebook through their mobile phones: “For brands, the ability to interact with people on their terms, on mobile, translates to a new opportunity to bring value to both people and advertisers.”\nOther tech companies are also working to get the developing world online. Just last week, The Christian Science Monitor reported that Google will begin rolling out free Wi-Fi service to 400 railway stations across India.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101322049893211", "https://www.facebook.com/business/news/connecting-100-million-people-in-africa", "http://news.eutelsat.com/pressreleases/eutelsat-and-facebook-to-partner-on-satellite-initiative-to-get-more-africans-online-1228638", "http://www.amos-spacecom.com/content.cfm?page=about-us", "https://internet.org/about"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:58:21.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
