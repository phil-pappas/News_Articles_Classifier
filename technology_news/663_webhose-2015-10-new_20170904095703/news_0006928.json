(NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that Verdipapirsentralen ASA (VPS), Norway's national Central Securities Depository, has deployed a private, on premise Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution based on OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat. With OpenShift Enterprise, VPS aims to accelerate the development and delivery processes within the organization's existing IT infrastructure and enable a higher level of operational efficiency across their development, test and production environments. \nAs the only centralized securities depository in Norway, VPS provides and manages the critical infrastructure and services for securities transactions and ownership registration for shares, bonds, equity certificates, and funds. VPS delivers these services through a network of investment banks, brokers, banks and fund management companies who operate the individual accounts and regulate day-to-day access. \nVPS evaluated multiple PaaS solutions to help break-down productivity barriers and deliver application services faster. They ultimately chose OpenShift Enterprise to provide access to a cloud-based application platform, enhancing its ability to build the applications it needs and run them in a hybrid cloud architecture, both in their own datacenter and the public cloud. It automates much of the provisioning and management of the application platform stack in a way that enables VPS's IT operations team to more easily meet growing business demands for new application services. OpenShift Enterprise also provides an on-demand, elastic, scalable and fully configured application deployment and runtime environment for application developers, so that they can focus on building these new application services. \nWith Openshift Enterprise, VPS can design, install, configure and integrate the private PaaS with its existing open source server infrastructure, offering benefits from a stable, efficient platform built on open standards. In addition to enabling VPS' developers to speed application delivery with its pre-defined tools, frameworks and self-service deployment environment, OpenShift Enterprise enables VPS to scale-up on demand, while handling peaks through automated processes to minimize downtime. With a stack built on open source technologies, OpenShift Enterprise offers freedom of choice, enabling application portability both to and from the platform. \nSupporting Quotes \nJarl L.
