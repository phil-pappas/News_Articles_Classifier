Currently serving more than 110,000 users worldwide, NAV is Microsoft's cloud-based ERP offering for the SMB market. Lexmark ICS can be activated on a subscription or pay-per-use basis by users, and offers an initial \"freemium\" model for processing up to 75 invoices per month without charge, helping customers validate their invoice automation goals before committing to its use. NAV users wishing to access ICS can do so from within the NAV interface and at the online store . Lexmark ICS delivers invoice capture and processing capabilities on demand, with minimal setup requirements and the scalability needed for all invoice volumes. The solution captures and validates invoice data, replacing manual data entry, to speed invoice cycle times, reduce costs, improve financial visibility, and make content accessible and manageable any time, from any location. According to Gartner, nearly half of all businesses plan to adopt some form of cloud-based ERP within the next five years. Forbes reports that SMBs are significantly increasing their investments in cloud solutions , with invoice automation providing a key avenue for immediate process optimization. Offering this via the cloud makes automation-enabled efficiency, visibility and productivity available without the labor and capital commitments associated with on-premise implementations and ongoing maintenance. Microsoft Dynamics NAV users will gain immediate benefits from Lexmark ICS, including: Improved data accuracy, as it automatically \"learns\" to read invoices in numerous formats and eliminates error-prone manual data entry. Better supplier relationships, as faster processing eliminates late payments and facilitates early payment discounts. Enhanced financial controls, as increased visibility minimizes duplicate, erroneous and misplaced payments and allows for better cash management. Consistent user experience, as the solution works within the framework of a familiar ERP interface. Easy setup, as the service is installed and configured within 10 minutesâ€”delivering immediate invoice processing efficiency. Microsoft and Lexmark will present the combined solution at Microsoft Directions North America, Oct. 25-28 in Orlando, Fla., and at Microsoft Convergence EMEA, Nov. 30-Dec. 2 in Barcelona, Spain.
