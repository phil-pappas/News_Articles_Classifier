They no doubt thought long and hard and such an such and then the trouble of not just buying a chair but a weapon tool. Then their is all the maintenance and the constant cost of bullets as practicing is a must.\nContingency is important, you need to weigh down on the values both ways. Should it be such a value to lose guns, one must then have a truer value of having earned a gun and as such not lose it in a snatch later in the day.\nThere are many trophies, many hard earned dollars which can never be unspent nor would be for practically all.\nI know what my value to weapons is and almost all of my licenses are being used by other people. I am the only person I know in this country I live in South Africa, that has qualified for a Automatic Carbine license and the little shit of a politician thinks its a good Idea to forge the Politicians signature and hand them around like candy, fake copies. What is the worth of a lifetime, if it is never seen as lived?? For many an army Veteran State side I'm sure this value sits strongly.\nAnd as I've been told, its something of a mercy to be able to shoot someone dead vs. the multitude of slow painful options left to the creative yet sinister mind of a murderer.

To think that not having a gun is safer when most walk around with my license it seems.\nThink of a Heavy Promotion for people who do keep their guns, for they know they are more likely to get shot than lose their license.
