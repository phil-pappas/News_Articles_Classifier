When did they get so popular? \nSegways used to be seen as a bit of a joke but the \"hoverboard\" or \"swegway\" is now a pretty common sight in parks and around cities, with sales rocketing in the run-up to Christmas. \nThe smaller hands-free version evolved from the bulkier two-wheeled devices you sometimes see knocking over top sports stars (read on). \nThe first ones, made by Segway Inc, arrived back in 2001 but themselves were developed from \"personal transporters\" first tested before you were born. Image caption The C5 became the laughing stock of the 1980s but it led to the \"swegway\" - offspring of the Segway Image caption This fictional hoverboard, ridden by Marty McFly in 1985's Back to the Future, is perhaps the true source of our 2015 hovering obsession Celebrities love hoverboards \nBrooklyn Beckham is certainly on board with the 2015 version, which on average costs between £100 and £300. \nHe posted this clip of himself doing a \"double spin\" on Instagram and swiftly got more than 300,000 likes. \nChris Brown loves cruising round hotel corridors on his. \nJustin Bieber likes to take his on planes. \nMeanwhile Wiz Khalifa segwayed onto stage at a gig in August. \nAnd there are claims Harry Styles recently rode his two wheels while completely naked. We can't confirm, sadly. \nIt doesn't always go well when celebrities and Segways get together. \nKaty Perry was captured failing to control hers at the Burning Man festival a few weeks ago. \nHere she is gently falling off. \nThen Toddla T posted this confused sweg scenario. \nMaybe they should have taken some lessons from this next lot. \nThis video, set to Justin Bieber's What Do You Mean, claims to be the \"world's first premium conceptual mini-Segway dance YouTube video\". \nMeanwhile, let's not forget that time Usain Bolt was knocked off his feet seconds after winning gold at the World Athletics Championships. Image caption Um, that man is the fastest runner on earth and those are his legs you are PLOUGHING INTO Image caption As usual, Bolt styled it out Showing off on social media \nOn Instagram right now, there are nearly 100,000 posts tagged #hoverboard and close to 200,000 tagged #segway. \nThere are some pretty flash ways of using your board. \nLike these speed freaks. Seems like Bieber is the hoverboarder's choice. \nOr you could flip things around and do a hand stand. \nOr you could just keep relatively still and do a dance. Meanwhile in Russia... \nThey're big in Russia but we definitely don't think heels and hoverboards will pass any safety rules. \nAnd in Prague, in the Czech Republic, they have already created designated no-Segway zones. \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:39:51.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
