This is similar to the control mechanisms of non-democratic countries such as China and North Korea.\"\nThe junta has ruled Thailand since overthrowing Yingluck's government in May 2014.\nThai politics has been agitated for a decade by a confrontation between the Shinawatras, in particular Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist premier who was himself ousted in a 2006 coup, and the royalist-military establishment, which sees him as a threat.\nThe military has ruled strictly since taking over, banning protests and not tolerating dissent, and has shut down thousands of websites.\nThailand has 10 Internet gateways run by both private and state-owned companies. The plan would apparently entail merging traffic through one state-run firm.\nPrasong Ruangsirikulchai, executive director of the Telecommunications Association of Thailand, said the government would meet fierce opposition from the private companies that would be forced to suspend their lines.\n\"If the government is not so strong they cannot do that,\" Prasong said during a talk at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand on Wednesday.\n\"They would have a tough time to convince private companies to cut their lines.\"\nThe military has said the plan is necessary for national security but Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters on Thursday it would not go ahead if it violated rights.\n\"If it violates rights we can't do it,\" he said.\nCritics say the plan goes against a digital-economy master plan to encourage online business by attracting investment from companies like Facebook Inc, which opened its first Thai office last month.\nThe government played down a coordinated attack last week on several state websites in a protest against the plan.\n(Additional reporting by Aukkarapon Niyomyat; Editing by Robert Birsel )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:05:37.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
