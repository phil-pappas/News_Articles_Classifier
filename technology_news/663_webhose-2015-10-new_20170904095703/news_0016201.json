California State Department of Justice\nCalifornia is ramping up its war on revenge porn by giving victims new tools for fighting back.\nState Attorney General Kamala Harris announced Wednesday that her office has partnered with tech companies and law enforcement agencies to create an online resources hub to help people remove unauthorized explicit photographs or videos from the Internet. The hub will also help tech companies develop policies to prevent posting of exploitive images, as well as educate local law enforcement on how to investigate and prosecute revenge porn cases.\n\"Posting intimate images online without consent is a cowardly crime that humiliates and belittles victims,\" Harris said in a statement. \"These new tools will assist law enforcement in combating cyber exploitation and support victims in seeking justice. I would like to thank our partners from our task force, whose work will have a global impact in combating this heinous crime.\"\nThe hub is designed to give recourse to victims of revenge porn, the malicious practice of the posting other people's intimate images and personal information online, typically by vindictive former partners, for the purpose of public humiliation or even extortion. Once on the Internet, images can spread quickly and can be difficult to remove due to vague laws and inconsistent concepts of free speech across international borders. Further complicating the trauma is sites that specialize in displaying revenge porn photos that charge the victim hefty fees to remove them .\nHarris said the hub is the culmination of a task force convened in January that consisted of 50 major technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Twitter, as well as law enforcement officials and victims' advocates.\nTech companies have also taken it upon themselves to ramp up the fight against cyber exploitation, making it easier for victims to navigate the process of having intimate content removed. Microsoft opened a dedicated reporting website in July that helps revenge porn victims report offending links, after Google said it would begin removing links to revenge porn in its search engine.\nThe search giant followed in the footsteps of Twitter, which in March set up new rules that prohibit the posting of images of nudity or sexual acts without the subject's permission. A month before that, Reddit updated its privacy policy to forbid \"involuntary pornography.\" Facebook, meanwhile, has a team of people dedicated to handling user complaints about sexually explicit images, as well as hate speech and other forms of harassment.\nCalifornia has been at the forefront of the war on revenge porn, passing a law in 2013 that imposes sentences of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for people \"convicted of illegally distributing private images with the intent to harass or annoy.\"\nHarris cited research conducted by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative that found more than 90 percent of revenge porn victims are women or girl. Of those victims surveyed, 51 percent reported having suicidal thoughts, according to the CCRI, a partner in the initiative.\n\"Over the past 50 years, the Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, engage in commerce, and collaborate with friends and colleagues around the world,\" John Doherty, vice president of TechNet, a national trade group focused on public policy, said in a statement. \"Overwhelmingly, these changes have been a force for good. But, clearly there is a dark side, and we must remain vigilant in the effort to protect Internet users from this type of terrible and troubling cyber exploitation.\"\nThe site includes tips about what steps revenge porn victims can take, including information about major tech companies' privacy policies and links to help them report unauthorized images for removal from social networks and search engines.", "external_links": ["http://district12.cssrc.us/content/cannella-legislation-combat-revenge-porn-signed-governor-brown", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/02/22/53e7cfe4-f0ee-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/resize/570xauto/25d79a0594a2e6d789996b0eb87a396d/haris.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:23:37.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
