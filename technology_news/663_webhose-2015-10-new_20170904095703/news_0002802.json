Related Links Park district offering November classes for toddlers, line dancing \nDistrict officials laid out a multiyear technology plan Monday during the curriculum committee meeting, which included steps toward a one-to-one program, Superintendent Brian Coleman said. \n“The district does not currently have a 1:1 initiative in place,” Coleman wrote in an email. “We are excited to be able to begin the planning stages of a potential 1:1 initiative as technology becomes a catalyst for student-centered learning with instant access to information and the world.” \nA memo from district technology staff proposes a timeline that runs from the current school year through 2019-20. \nThe education technology department would pilot certain devices this school year; an education technology coach would be hired and a learning management system would be purchased in 2016; and devices would be piloted in classrooms and one-to-one would be purchased for sixth-graders in winter 2016 or spring 2017. \nSixth-graders in 2017-18 would be the first class to receive the devices, and they would take the devices with them into seventh grade. \n“New devices would be purchased for the incoming 2018-19 sixth-grade class,” according to the memo. \nIn the next few years, a device management system would be configured for all devices, a second education technology coach would be hired and students would continue to receive devices as they entered sixth grade. \nProfessional development to train teachers would take place throughout the whole process and laptop carts would be maintained in classrooms for other grade levels, the memo said. \nThe district’s intentions for the future of technology mirror those of many districts throughout McHenry County. \nSome, such as Huntley Consolidated School District 158, already have rolled out a one-to-one program. \nDistrict 158 this year expanded its program to add eighth-graders, making the technology available in kindergarten through eighth grade. \nOn the other hand, others, such as Johnsburg School District 12 and Fox River Grove School District 3, have not yet reached that point. \n“We’re a pretty small district, and the [parent-teacher organization] has assisted us in getting as many devices as we currently need,” District 3 Superintendent Tim Mahaffy said. \nCrystal Lake Elementary School District 47 still is working on proposals to bring to the school board, said Dave Jenkins, assistant superintendent of technology services. \nCurrently, the district has about 4,000 iPads for roughly 7,500 total students – or one device for every two students. \n“Every district is talking about one-to-one,” Jenkins said. “There are a lot of drivers to that, from curriculum driving it to instruction and assessment.” \nJenkins added some proposals have been brought to the board in past years, but the district just hasn’t had the funding. \nThe District 26 memo describes factors being considered for funding a one-to-one program: a device fee, district contribution and a buyout option after eighth grade. \nAccording to a chart that includes projected enrollment, the district could contribute anywhere from about $78,300 to $178,900 for the 2017-18 year depending on which device is chosen and the cost of the annual device fee. \nColeman said the plan is not yet ready to go to the board for approval and will continue to be fine-tuned with feedback from the board and the technology committee. \n“The goal is to provide equitable 21st century tools and resources necessary for all students to be successful and engaged learners,” he wrote, later adding, “We must keep in mind, though, that the device is not a replacement for quality instruction and a quality teacher. It is simply another tool that can be used by the teacher and student to gain access to information and the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:15:05.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
