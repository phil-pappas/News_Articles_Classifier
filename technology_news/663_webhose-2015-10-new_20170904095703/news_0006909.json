A tablet computer demonstrating YouTube Gaming is seen during the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California on June 17, 2015 \nTwitch already lets fans subscribe to content creators. \nUpdated YouTube Gaming applications for Apple and Android powered mobile devices were released on Thursday in Britain and the United States. \nThe rollout of YouTube Gaming at the end of August marked the public debut of an online venue where video game lovers can find commentary, live play , on-demand snippets and more. \nAn English-language website at gaming.youtube.com was rolled out in countries where YouTube is available. \nThe online arena for video game channels incorporates the search smarts of Google, which owns YouTube, to surface fresh or must-see content. \nUS online retail giant Amazon last year snatched up Twitch and its huge audience for live-streamed gaming. \nThe acquisition was one of the largest in Amazon's history—$970 million in cash for the three-year-old Internet company. \nTwitch Interactive streams games being played for non-playing viewers to watch, and hosts gaming events. \nIt allows viewers to chat with the players and others, lending it some of the qualities of social networking websites, and it also sells advertising to generate income. \nThe takeover came with a boom in online viewing of real-time video game or computer game play as \"e-sports\" attract growing crowds as spectator events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:23:49.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
