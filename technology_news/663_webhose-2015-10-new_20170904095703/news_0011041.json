Inquidia OverDrive, a specialized approach to Tableau implementations, was developed by Inquidia consultants as a response to growing customer demand for a more refined roadmap to successful deployments.\nThe methodology is being introduced at this year's Tableau Conference 2015 (TC15), opening today in Las Vegas. TC15 brings together more than 11,000 data enthusiasts to learn the latest innovations in data storytelling through visualization.\nWhile Tableau has the potential to drive a paradigm shift in analytical capabilities, not every organization is prepared to adopt the new capabilities. Recognizing the challenges, Tableau developed Tableau Drive, a best practices methodology for enterprise deployments.\nBut after numerous Tableau deployments, Inquidia found Tableau Drive to be helpful but not sufficient for some customers. In response, Inquidia developed OverDrive, an expanded and refined methodology designed to take Tableau's Drive to the next level. OverDrive provides enhanced techniques for companies to navigate through each phase of the traditional Tableau Drive development and deployment process: Discovery, Prototyping, Foundation Building, and Scale Out.\n“Working with so many companies who are eager to adopt Tableau, we’ve seen the complexities organizations of all sizes face with their implementations. We’ve embraced Tableau Drive, but there was still more detail our clients needed in order to achieve their best. This led us to create Inquidia OverDrive”, said Kevin Haas, Inquidia Consulting senior partner. “With OverDrive, organizations go beyond the basics to ensure their Tableau Implementation succeeds and thrives,” Haas continued.\nInquidia consultants will bring decades of analytic system design and self-service analytics deployment experience to this year’s conference. The team will be on-hand to provide insight to data-driven organizations who are ready to implement Tableau for the first time or take their initial deployment to the next level.\nTC15 attendees will be able to visit Inquidia’s booth #812, where Inquidia consultants will present the key components of the OverDrive methodology, and how to get started. Topics include:\nOverDrive Detect and OverDrive Identify, which starts with an organization’s current state and bridges the gap to their future state. OverDrive Detect is a process that uncovers current data, mines it for untapped potential, thoroughly vets it for Tableau-readiness, and creates the roadmap to a future data ecosystem. OverDrive Identify is a method that takes current analytical requirements and findings from OverDrive Detect, and clearly articulates future analytics environment, including insightful actionable dashboards.\nOverDrive Wingman and OverDrive Wrangle, which prepares data for Tableau, and uses collaborative development to achieve success. OverDrive Wrangle is a defined process that scrubs, integrates, aggregates, and optimizes data as laid out in OverDrive Detect. This step gets your data primed for Tableau. OverDrive Wingman leverages Inquidia’s wealth of Tableau experience to deliver impressive Dashboard prototypes created with data from Wrangle, and adds custom training for internal Tableau developers, and demos for stakeholders.\nOverDrive Assemble and OverDrive Elevate, which gets organizations technically and emotionally ready for the paradigm shift that is Tableau. OverDrive Assemble ensures all of the myriad technical pieces, including Security, Datasource performance, Data Extracts, Dashboards, and Mobile requirements are working in harmony with one another, ready for launch. OverDrive Elevate builds excitement for a new way of exploring data by spreading the gospel of Tableau with customized training, Dashboard Roadshows, and more.\nOverDrive Extend and OverDrive Boost, which ensures that a Tableau deployment is sustainable. OverDrive Extend helps manage success to allow organizations to grow, adapt, and extend capabilities as requirements grow and evolve. OverDrive Boost is a defined process to analyze a flagging launch and develop a strategy to boost it back towards success.\nFor more details about Inquidia OverDrive, visit Inquidia’s website at http://www.inquidia.com/overdrive .\nAbout Inquidia Consulting\nInquidia is an innovative consulting firm delivering full spectrum data engineering and analytics services that help our customers inquire, learn and take action with their data.
