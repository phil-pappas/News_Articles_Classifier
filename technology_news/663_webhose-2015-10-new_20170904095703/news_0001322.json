It's the international expansion, the global scale,\" DiClemente told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nRead More Netflix shares rebound as execs soothe investors\nNetflix will expand into Spain, Italy and Portugal in the second quarter and enter South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan in 2016. In regards to its international business, the company said it planned \"to run around break-even through 2016 and to deliver material profits thereafter.\"\nIn the United States, Netflix added 880,000 members, well below analysts' forecasts for growth of 1.19 million subscribers, according to StreetAccount. Its profit of 7 cents per share on $1.74 billion in revenue came in just below expectations.\nThe company blamed the shortfall on a wave of new credit card issuances, as vendors ran into a deadline to transition to chip-enabled cards in the quarter. That prevented some customers from renewing their memberships, Netflix said.\nDiClemente called that involuntary churn a temporary phenomenon, and said the long-term narrative remains in tact. He reiterated his price target of $125 before the start of trading on Thursday.\nRead More Analysts love the Netflix price hike\nAccording to surveys conducted by RBC Capital Markets, the number of Netflix users voluntarily canceling subscriptions is at a record low, Mark Mahaney, lead Internet analyst at RBC, told CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Thursday.\n\"For now we're taking the company at face value when they say they had an involuntary churn issue in the U.S. in the third quarter. That better correct in the third quarter, and we think it will,\" he said.\nNetflix slides after subscriber slump\nShares of Netflix are lower after the company reported weak U.S. subscription growth. Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets analyst, weighs in on light subscriptions for the quarter.\nAsked about the rising cost of content, DiClemente said Netflix's guidance that U.S. profit margins would reach 40 percent by 2020 deflects some of that concern.\nNetflix will be able to achieve that margin level in part by shifting its content mix toward more original series, DiClemente added. He noted the company has said this content generates more viewership per dollar spent than syndicated programming yields.\nThe streaming company has become known for series like \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\" Netflix said its new show based on the life of drug lord Pablo Escobar, \"Narcos,\" was a key driver of international subscriber growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:11:05.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
