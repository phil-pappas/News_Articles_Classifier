This support and the confidence the grant provided was instrumental in us securing significant additional working capital for the company”\nPaul Durrant, managing director of UK Games Talent and Finance CIC, said: “Funding for both prototype development and talent support can really make a difference in the early stages of creative and business development. This fund is a great boost for the sector and will help projects better attract significant private investment.”\nThe UK’s video games industry currently generates more than £4.5 million a day for the UK economy and directly employs more than 19,000 people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:46:51.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
