Ltd., the leading energy technology company, announces that it was awarded the Frost & Sullivan 2015 Best Practices Awards for Electric Drive Market for Machine Automation category. The award was presented at the official ceremony held in Singapore on October 15, 2015.Frost & Sullivan, a leading global market research and consulting firm, selected Fuji Electric for the effectiveness of its product strategy and execution, competitive differentiation, price/performance value and customer purchase experience. Johnny Chia, Senior Manager of Drive & Automation Division of Fuji Electric Asia Pacific highlighted, \"Fuji Electric, we are one of the first company who design and manufactures of the general purpose of Variable Speed Drives in the 70's. Since then Fuji Electric had committed to develop and produce innovative and high quality Variable Speed Drives that bring value added to our customers in the manufacturing industries till now. Fuji Electric will continue serving the evolving needs of the industries; with enhanced technology such as Silicon Carbide Semiconductor and also with unique engineering efficiency to further contributed to the reduction of greenhouses gases to the environment.\" Since the development of the first general purpose Variable Speed Drives in the 70s, Fuji Electric's portfolio has substantially widened as they penetrated the low and medium voltage markets. The newest addition to Fuji Electric's series of Low Voltage Variable Speed Drives, the FRENIC-VG Series was developed for expanding the large-capacity Variable Speed Drives line in 2014. The product is equipped with SiC power semiconductors that realize a higher withstand voltage and lower loss and commercializing power electronics devices equipped with them. Application of the SiC hybrid module has made it possible to reduce the loss in a power conversion circuit by 28% from our existing models, and contribute to significant energy saving at facilities. By applying the SiC hybrid module, we have successfully increased the single-unit capacity from the existing models' maximum of 315 kW to a maximum of 450 kW while maintaining the same product physical size. This makes it possible to reduce the number of variable speed drives installed, and thus save space at facilities. The FRENIC-VG Series are in use in production facilities of iron and steel, chemical, papermaking, mining, water, harbor cranes and other large plants which require greater capacities and precision. Award Citation Frost & Sullivan honored Fuji Electric in Asia with their latest accolade: The award recipient has been able to leverage its strong product line and investment into R&D to expand its market reach and is well-positioned to compete with other notable manufacturers.
