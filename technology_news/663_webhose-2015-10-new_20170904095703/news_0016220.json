This will be the world premiere of the anticipated additive manufacturing system and will take place at the international exhibition and conference on additive technologies on the 17 th November. \nAdditive Industries team has been working on the development and realisation of an integrated metal additive manufacturing solution for industrial series production, since 2012. The modular MetalFAB1 system uses metal powder bed fusion technology and has a broad range of new features like fully automated build plate and product handling, multiple full field lasers, continuous \nin process calibration and integrated heat treatment. Additive Industries promises an unrivalled productivity, reproducibility and flexibility. \nDaan Kersten, CEO of Additive Industries, commented: “Last year we exhibited in Frankfurt with a large wooden machine crate and promised to launch our industrial 3D metal printing system in Frankfurt this year. Now we are fulfilling our promise and we are planning to show how future additive manufacturing will look like and rock the show.” \nThe concept was initially teased in November last year and a name and key details about the machine were unveiled at RAPID 2015 . Additive Industries explained how the machine was a product of discussions with users from key markets the machine is set to address including the aerospace, medical and automotive sectors. \nVisitors to formnext will have the opportunity to get a first look at the machine on 17-20 th November 2015 in Hall 3, Frankfurt Exhibition Centre.
