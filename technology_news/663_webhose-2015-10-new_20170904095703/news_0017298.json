One way to establish the thermistor’s approximate % resistance tolerance at a specific temperature is to multiply the specified NTC value by the temperature tolerance at that particular temperature. \nIn the case of thermistors that have a specified tolerance at a single temperature point the tolerance at other temperature points is determined using the manufacturing tolerance. Generally, thermistors are specified at 25°C temperature. Also the manufacturing tolerance can be added to the given point matched tolerance to establish the resistance tolerance at a different temperature point. \nFor instance, a thermistor having a ± 5% resistance tolerance at 25°C temperature exhibits a ± 6.4% tolerance at 0°C temperature. Typically point matched thermistors should not continuously work over a temperature of 105°C. Chip-in-Glass Thermistor DC-4007 (T6) \nThe key specifications of the Chip-in-Glass Thermistor DC-4007 (T6) ( Dexter part number: DC-4007 (formerly MT06)) are as follows: Thermometrics P/N", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:08:43.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
