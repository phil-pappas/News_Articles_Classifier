Additional information will be forthcoming about this year's ozone hole in late October. Dobson units are a measurement of the concentration of atmospheric ozone . NASA Satellite Data Show Progress of 2009 Antarctic Ozone Hole (w/ Video) September 16, 2009 \n(PhysOrg.com) -- The annual ozone hole has started developing over the South Pole, and it appears that it will be comparable to ozone depletions over the past decade. This composite image from September 10 depicts ozone concentrations ... 2012 Antarctic ozone hole second smallest in 20 years October 24, 2012 \nThe average area covered by the Antarctic ozone hole this year was the second smallest in the last 20 years, according to data from NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. Scientists attribute ... Relationship between the ozone depletion and the extreme precipitation in austral summer August 29, 2013 \nThe new study by Prof. Sarah Kang from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), showed that the ozone depletion over the South Pole has affected the extreme daily precipitation in the austral summer, for ... 2014 Antarctic ozone hole holds steady October 30, 2014 \nThe Antarctic ozone hole reached its annual peak size on Sept. 11, according to scientists from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The size of this year's hole was 24.1 million square kilometers ... Ozone depletion is a major climate driver in the southern hemisphere December 1, 2014 \nWhen people hear about the dangers of the ozone hole, they often think of sunburns and associated health risks, but new research shows that ozone depletion changes atmospheric and oceanic circulation with potentially devastating ... Severe ozone depletion avoided May 26, 2015 \nWe are already reaping the rewards of the Montreal Protocol, with the ozone layer in much better shape than it would have been without the UN treaty, according to a new study in Nature Communications. Recommended for you New study indicates Earth's inner core was formed 1 - 1.5 billion years ago October 7, 2015 \nThere have been many estimates for when the earth's inner core was formed, but scientists from the University of Liverpool have used new data which indicates that the Earth's inner core was formed 1 - 1.5 billion years ago ... Predictable ecosystems may be more fragile October 7, 2015 \nWhen it comes to using our natural resources, human beings want to know what we're going to get. We expect clean water every time we turn on the tap; beaches free of algae and bacteria; and robust harvests of crops, fish ... History shows more big wildfires likely as climate warms October 5, 2015 \nThe history of wildfires over the past 2,000 years in a northern Colorado mountain range indicates that large fires will continue to increase as a result of a warming climate, according to new study led by a University of ... The warmer the higher: Sea-level rise from Filchner-Ronne ice in Antarctica October 5, 2015 \nThe more ice is melted of the Antarctic Filchner-Ronne shelf, the more ice flows into the ocean and the more the region contributes to global sea-level rise. While this might seem obvious, it is no matter of course for the ... Ancient rocks record first evidence for photosynthesis that made oxygen October 6, 2015 \nA new study shows that iron-bearing rocks that formed at the ocean floor 3.2 billion years ago carry unmistakable evidence of oxygen. The only logical source for that oxygen is the earliest known example of photosynthesis ... What is a forest? NASA/USGS mission helps answer the question October 6, 2015 \nExamining eight different satellite-derived maps of global forest cover, a team of scientists from NASA and other institutions noticed striking differences. The forested area on the maps differed by as much as 6 percent of ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:13:52.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
