I am not this to sell copies of my article and gather likes or shares on Facebook. I am writing this because I fear for my safety and with it my life as I live in this once beautiful proud country (which has now turned into a backwater hell-hole). In all the years that I grew up in Mzansi, I have never felt so insecure that every day was Armageddon. Every time I tune into Eyewitness news or viewing news websites, I see and hear the following: People being murdered Rand weakening to the point they will become as useless as the Zim dollars And some cadre from the ruling party brokering some scheme in order to steal from the taxpayer and deny this.\nWhen I saw the crime statistics, it was not pretty reading. It felt like we were civilians who were about to be bitten by the criminal zombies. The worse part is that the criminals are made to look like terminators as we witness policemen being killed one after the other.The weakening Rand is not because of the crime rate, it is a sign that our ruling party and government are dysfunctional. From our government giving the International Criminal Court the middle finger to Malusi Gigaba being hell bent on destroying tourism with the unpractical visa regulations, we are in for a ride. Of course, this all stems from one thing. Corruption. Talking about corruption, I still need to touch on that Hitachi deal with Chancellor house although I don't need to explain this as one of the News24 user (Made in the South) kept mentioning this whenever Eskom announced load shedding. Also, Hlaudi and his defiant increase is also a topic up for discussion.While an ordinary citizen with a degree and expertise is struggling to make ends meet, one defiant dictating COO with neither a brain nor a matric certificate is laughing his way to the bank with an increase. As you can see, our public protector is being abused by these thugs who think they are worth millions but in fact they are worth nothing. Yet , 90% of the programming is virtually obsolete. Mr. Motsoeneng, before you think of another increase, please can you improve the quality of programming and hurry up with the digital migration before rewarding yourself. And the Hitachi deal. Wow, the SEC has busted the ruling party. Well as the saying goes \" you can run but you can't hide\", the ruling party can clearly not hide even if they can deny all they want.With all this rubbish shenanigans going on a daily basis, we as South Africans have had enough. Let's all stand together and get rid of corruption once and for all since the ruling party aren't serious about anything.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:14:36.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
