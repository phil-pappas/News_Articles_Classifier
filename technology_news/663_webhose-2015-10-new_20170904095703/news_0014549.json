Speaking to an audience of food bank leaders at the Feeding America FTHR Learning Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, Voxware President and CEO Keith Phillips outlined Voxware's food bank program. The company will donate a set amount of funds for every pick completed by food bank customers using the Voxware Voice Management Suite (VMS). Donations will be distributed on a quarterly basis to help food banks serve more hungry families. \n\"This programme has been years in the making,\" said Phillips. \"In the past we have made contributions to both our local soup kitchen and, later, to the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma in the wake of devastating tornadoes. We are looking forward to giving back in a more substantial and sustainable way starting in 2016.\" \nVoxware currently provides voice technology for six food banks across the United States including the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, the Community FoodBank of New Jersey, the Greater Cleveland Food Bank, the Greater Boston Food Bank, the Houston Food Bank, and Harvesters Community Food Network in Kansas. Together, these food banks distribute nearly a quarter billion pounds of food to over 2.5 million hungry Americans every year. \nVoxware will also ask its over two dozen cold storage, beverage, and foodservice customers to match its donations with cash or food donations to their own local food banks. \n\"Voxware has already helped increase the rate at which food banks process and distribute donations and now we're going to help increase the volume they serve to the community,\" said Keith Phillips, President and CEO of Voxware. \"For every dollar a food bank receives in donations, they can supply the community with $10 in food. The goal is that Voxware's contributions will increase their ability to serve even more hungry families.\" \nVoxware's Voice Management Solution (VMS) helps companies across industries run a more accurate and efficient supply chain. Most customers report productivity increases of 30% as well as accuracy level improvements to 99% and above. Most recently, the Community FoodBank of New Jersey experienced a 30% reduction in pick time in their first few months since implementing voice. By improving operational efficiency, Voxware helps food banks use more of every dollar to serve hungry families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:19:01.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
