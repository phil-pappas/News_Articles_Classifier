Google is expected to use it to add video chat and other features to mobile messaging.\nNo terms were given for the acquisition, which the companies announced Wednesday on their websites. Jibe, founded in 2006, developed systems to help carriers use modern technology and offer expanded services to customers. The Mountain View company supported the rich communications service (RCS), a sophisticated data transfer system that could succeed the short message service (SMS) and is backed by the GSM association , which represents the interests of about 800 mobile operators around the world.\n“We’re excited to team up with mobile operators, device makers and the rest of the Android ecosystem to support RCS standards and help accelerate their deployment in a more consistent way,” Mike Dodd , Google’s “minister of messaging,” said in a blog post. “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.”\nJack Clark is a Bloomberg writer.
