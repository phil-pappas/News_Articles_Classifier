EMC has been considering a number of options since The Wall Street Journal reported it was doing a strategic review last year, and other options could still be on the table.\nAnalysts have said it would make sense for Dell, which was taken private in a landmark leveraged buyout in 2013, to buy EMC’s big data-storage operation, but there are various ways it could go about doing so, including a full takeover followed by a spin off.\nEMC has a market capitalization of $US50 billion, meaning that any such deal could rank as one of the largest tech-industry mergers. Chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd's pending $US37 billion agreement to buy Braodcom Corp. is the largest pure-tech takeover ever struck. There has been a raft of tech and other takeovers this year, and merger volume overall is running at a near-record pace. Still, market volatility could slow down the overall merger market and pose a threat to the EMC-Dell talks, one of the people cautioned.\nEMC has been under pressure to boost its lagging stock since last year, when activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. took a roughly two per cent stake in the company and urged it to spin off its VMware Inc. unit. EMC owns 80 per cent of VMware, which has a market value of $US34 billion. A standstill struck in January between Elliott and Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMC that had barred the fund from publicly pressuring EMC expired last month. Elliott has since stayed quiet.\nEMC reports its quarterly earnings on October 21, and some analysts have speculated that the company has until then to announce a deal or risk a proxy fight. An acquisition or other big deal for EMC could also solve another question that has been looming over the company: the fate of its chief executive, Joe Tucci . Mr Tucci indicated he may retire at the beginning of the year, though to date no succession plan has been announced.\nDell went private in a roughly $US25 billion buyout by its founder, Michael Dell , and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners. Out of the public spotlight, it has pivoted from personal computers, which are facing headwinds from tablets and smartphones, toward more-profitable areas like storage and security.\nA deal with EMC would cement its transition from a consumer-facing company to one focused on technology solutions for big companies—a far cry from the company Mr. Dell founded in 1984.\nDell still carries more than $11.7 billion in debt, according to FactSet. It was not immediately clear how it would finance a potential purchase of part or all of EMC, or what role, if any, Silver Lake would play.\nEMC held talks with Dell as early as last fall, the Journal reported at the time. EMC also had been in discussions about a merger with Hewlett-Packard Co., which ended before H-P announced plans to split itself in two in October 2014.\nEMC was once synonymous with data storage. The company was a darling of the tech boom—its shares were one of the best performers in the S&P 500 in the 1990s—but it has fallen on harder times since. The shares have fallen 13 per cent this year and are little changed from when Elliott began its campaign. In July, the company reported a 17 per cent drop in quarterly profits and lowered its full-year outlook.\nStorage has been a drag on earnings, a development attributed by EMC executive David Goulden on the company’s most-recent quarterly conference call to a “secular shift to the new digital age, defined by cloud, mobile, social and big data.”\nRevenue growth at EMC’s storage division has slowed from a 16% increase between 2010 and 2011 to a two per cent gain between 2013 and 2014, according to regulatory filings. It competes with companies including NetApp Inc., Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines Corp. A new competitor, Pure Storage, went public Wednesday, falling five per cent in its debut.\nEMC also owns software-development company Pivotal and network-security provider RSA. Its segments are run as separate businesses under a so-called “federation structure” that Elliott has criticised. It’s not clear which, if any, might be included in a buyout of EMC by Dell.\nA deal could amount to a win for Elliott, which has become one of the biggest activist investors focused on technology companies. Since disclosing its EMC stake in July 2014, it has launched campaigns and secured at least partial victories at companies including Informatica and Citrix Systems Inc.\n—David Benoit contributed to this article.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://topics.wsj.com/person/T/Joe-Tucci/1208", "http://topics.wsj.com/person/G/executive-David%20Goulden/5384", "http://quotes.wsj.com/HPQ", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/emc-weighs-merger-other-options-1411350234", "http://topics.wsj.com/person/D/Michael-Dell/425"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:42:26.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
