As a 13-time Microsoft Exchange Server MVP, Paul brings a wealth of industry knowledge to the thriving Microsoft ISV and Inc. 5000 recipient two years running.\n“I’m tremendously excited about the opportunity to work with such a talented and passionate group of people,” Paul said. “Together, I’m confident we will continue to deliver on ENow’s commitment to advance the Office 365 experience with monitoring and reporting solutions that are pivotal to preserving the integrity of Office 365 environments.”\nPaul entered the IT scene in 1978 as a programmer and currently serves as senior contributing editor for Windows IT Pro and principal architect for Summit 7 Systems. As a dedicated writer and consultant specializing in Exchange and Office 365, Paul has become a recognized name in the Office 365 space and continues to spearhead projects that empower MVPs and promote a supportive community. He has also authored and edited several books, including “Exam Ref 70-341 Core Solutions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 (MCSE)” and “Exchange Server 2013 Inside Out: Clients, Connectivity, and UM.”\nThe addition of Paul as CTO demonstrates ENow’s commitment to developing the most innovative cloud-based solutions. This news comes a year after ENow brought on Exchange Server MVP/MCM Michael Van Horenbeeck to oversee development of its signature solution Mailscape 365 and the recent hire of Steve Warwick from Dell Software as a cloud-focused software architect.\nENow’s innovation in the Office 365 sector is also evident through the success of clients such as BARBRI, the preeminent bar review course provider, and the Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS). ENow’s leading Office 365 monitoring and reporting solution, Mailscape 365, allowed BARBRI to continuously monitor thousands of Exchange mailboxes across enterprise, quickly locate issues and prevent them from transgressing into outages.\nServing nearly 85,000 students and employing more than 11,000 teachers and staff, BCPSS also benefitted from Mailscape 365’s One-Look dashboard, which delivers real-time status updates, enhances visibility into Office 365 and enables the organization to stop potential outages in their tracks. Through the acquisition of vetted industry talent, ENow strives to provide unmatched value to clients like BARBRI and BCPSS.\n“Paul is a renowned expert in the Exchange community, and his longstanding industry experience will catapult our objective to acquire the best resources possible, refine our proven monitoring and reporting solutions and solidify our standing as a leading Microsoft ISV in the Office 365 space,” said CEO Jay Gundotra.\nPaul will join a company riding the coattails of 203% growth over the past three years. Through constant iterations to its suite of monitoring and reporting solutions, the company expects to achieve an even more impressive growth rate in the coming years.\nAbout ENow\nENow is a Microsoft ISV focused on helping organizations implement the latest Microsoft technologies and building software tools that simplify the job of IT administrators.
