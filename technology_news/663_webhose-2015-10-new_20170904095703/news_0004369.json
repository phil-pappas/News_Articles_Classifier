My 87-year-old mother, who lives in an assisted-living situation, lives in my town and my husband and I are the ones who shop for her, handle her finances, accompany her to doctors and visit weekly. She has never offered to pay for gas or given us any financial “thank yous.” We have two adult children. Her only other child, my sister, who is single with no children, lives in another state and visits no more than two times a year and is sporadic in her calling.\nOur finances are different, too: We did receive an inheritance from my husband’s mother and she was very generous to us throughout her life as well. My sister works hard at a good-paying job, but she doesn’t have the savings that we do. With my encouragement, my mother has started to gift my sister and I the maximum amount allowable without paying tax and also a couple of thousand dollars to her grandchildren.\nMy mother and I agreed that her estate ($1.5 million) will be equally split between my sister and I. She has just decided though that it’s not fair to my sister to have more money going to “my side (through my children), so she will be adding on to my sister’s annual gifts the amount that she gives to her two grandchildren. I can have her declare that extra amount with the accountant, so it’s not the taxes I am concerned with.)\nI am very resentful about this. I give so much time and attention to my mother and feel slighted that now my sister will be getting more money. I also feel that the money she has given to my children (she has never paid for any of their schooling or made any financial gifts during their upbringing) are for them and does not benefit me (other than knowing that my kids appreciate the gift). It is especially hard since I am the one that helps my mother so much.\nAny thoughts on coping with this situation?\nSarah in Washington, D.C.\nDear Sarah,\nThis is not a Cinderella story.\nYour mother is giving your family and your sister equal amounts of money. She is upping the amount to take into account the money she gives your children. That seems fair (and thoughtful) to me. You’re correct: You don’t get to spend (or invest) the money your mother gave your children, because it’s not for you. And “the money” is your mother’s money. Why should she pay for your children’s education? Here’s the headline: This is NOT your money, it belongs to her. Your mother could give it all to the dogs and cats’ home, if she wanted to.\nThis is NOT your money. Your mother could give it all to the dogs and cats’ home, if she wanted to. I don’t doubt that you are taking care of your mother and doing more car runs to doctor’s appointments, and paying more bills, but you are her daughter and you are playing a losing game by calculating how much this costs, especially about someone who raised you. I’m pretty sure your mother isn’t subtracting those “financial thank yous” from your $1.5 million inheritance for everything she did for you growing up, and the years of her life she gave to raising you and your sister. Nor should you do the same.\nRead: I (secretly) charge an hourly rate for caring for my mom\nYour sister is not as financially secure as you are. Single people have enough surcharges in life , such as taking care of a mortgage or rent alone, no spouse with wealthy parents to shower them with gifts and inheritance and, let’s not forget, the single-supplement on hotel rooms, cruise lines, and two-for-one deals on deal sites. But this is not about being single or being married. It’s about letting go of the idea (or, as you put it, the resentment) of who is more deserving and who should get more because they’re a more caring or attentive person.\nThe old phrase, “If it’s hysterical, it’s historical” comes to mind. Some pop psychology: This is less about the money your mother chooses to give your sister and more about your relationship with your family, and your resentments about perceived preferential treatment, and a desire to be recognized and acknowledged for your good deeds. It’s no different from measuring the sizes of the pieces of cake you each receive on your birthday. Ask not what your mother can do for you (to paraphrase John F. Kennedy) — ask what you can do for your mother.\nYou are being very well taken care of. You are in the enviable position of having two sets of inheritance, one from your husband’s family and one from your mother. That $1.5 million inheritance will be split 50/50, as it should be. It would be a shame to have these final years with your mother marred by resentment over money. You’ve been a good daughter by spending time with your mother and making sure she has everything she needs. You have been gifted this time to spend with your mother. You can’t put a price on that.\nAlso see: My father excluded my siblings from his will\nDo you have questions about tipping, weddings, re-gifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?
