This will give the UK MOD the ability in the future to deploy part of the hospital by air to provide rapid deployment of an initial medical capability with the full capability following as the force build up develops. The modularity will also enable the UK to expand the facility, adapt layouts or change configurations as medical technology and needs develop in the future. \nMarshall's generic field hospital system architecture is flexible, modular and scalable using a mix of military off-the-shelf (MOTS) hard and soft shelters (containers and tents). The system uses common modules with standard interfaces allowing adaptable configurations to suit mission needs. \nMarshall has provided deployable medical facilities previously to the UK, Norway and France. These have included complete hospitals, CT Scanners and laboratory systems.
