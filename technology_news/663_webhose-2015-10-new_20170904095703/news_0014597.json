These include two youth from Mumbai outskirts Kalyan, an Australia-based Kashmiri, one youth from Telangana, one from Karnataka, one Oman-based Indian and another Singapore-based Indian.\nLast year, a youth from Kalyan had returned home after spending about six-months with ISIS.\nAmong the six Indians, who fought alongside the ISIS and got killed were three Indian Mujahideen terrorists, including Sultan Ajmer Shah and Bada Sajid, who had joined its ranks after being in Pakistan, two from Maharashtra and one from Telangana.\nOn September 15, UAE deported four Indians suspected to have links with ISIS and it is expected to send back the same number of people soon.\nAbout a fortnight ago, the UAE had sent back a 37-year- old woman, Afsha Jabeen alias Nicky Joseph, who was allegedly involving in recruiting youths for ISIS.\nEarlier in January, Salman Mohiuddin of Hyderabad was arrested at that airport when he was preparing to board a flight to Dubai on way to Syria via Turkey.\nSo far, 17 young men, mostly from Telangana, have been prevented from travelling to Syria, ostensibly to join ISIS.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:49:00.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
