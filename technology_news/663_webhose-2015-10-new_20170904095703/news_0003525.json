A new model in the SGI UV server line certified and supported with Oracle Linux, SGI UV 300RL provides up to 32 sockets and 24 terabytes (TBs) of shared memory. The solution enables enterprises that have standardized on Intel-based servers to run Oracle Database In-Memory on a single system to help achieve real-time operations and accelerate data analytics at unprecedented scale. \nUtilizing a unique scale-up, single system design and proven ultra-low latency SGI technology, the SGI UV 300RL enables mixing transactional and analytic workloads while maintaining high performance for mission-critical applications. SGI UV 300RL allows large and growing environments to implement Oracle's innovative 'dual-format' architecture at greater scale to identify business trends in real-time, make faster, smarter decisions, and gain competitive advantage. For pure high volume analytics, the in-memory speed and single-system simplicity of the SGI UV 300RL can also deliver business insight orders of magnitude faster than conventional disk-based clustered systems and without the administrative cost. \n\"The exceptional performance and scalability of the Intel® Xeon® processor E7 v3 product family combined with the blazing speed of Oracle Database In-Memory and the scale-up performance of SGI's new UV 300RL will provide business with game-changing capabilities,\" said Patrick Buddenbaum, GM Enterprise IT Solutions in Intel's Data Center Group. \"We are proud to work with our partners to deliver solutions that are enabling the real-time enterprise.\" \nThe SGI UV 300RL is an advanced symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system that utilizes Intel® Xeon® E7 v3 processors (up to 18 cores) coupled with seventh generation SGI NUMAlink® technology. The future-ready design scales up seamlessly from 4 to 32 sockets and 1 to 24TBs of cache-coherent shared memory. Highly robust RAS features make the SGI UV 300RL well equipped for mission-critical applications. Factory-installed with Oracle Linux 7 and rapidly deployed by SGI professional services, the system is ready for connection to enterprise storage and installation of Oracle Database 12c and Oracle Database In-Memory. The SGI UV 300L is available today under early access in select global locations. \n\"Our UV technology has enabled some of the largest Oracle TimesTen In-Memory Database deployments in the past few years. SGI is excited to extend its in-memory computing leadership with a UV solution for Oracle Database In-Memory on Oracle Linux,\" said Jorge Titinger, president and CEO, SGI. \"We are proud of our growing collaboration with Oracle to help customers fully leverage Oracle innovation at breakthrough scale.\" \nSGI at Oracle OpenWorld 2015 SGI will be exhibiting in the Oracle Linux, Oracle VM, and Oracle Openstack Showcase at Oracle OpenWorld, October 25-29 in San Francisco at Moscone South Booth 121, and presenting the new SGI UV 300RL. \nAbout SGI SGI is a global leader in high-performance solutions for compute, data analytics and data management that enable customers to accelerate time to discovery, innovation, and profitability.
