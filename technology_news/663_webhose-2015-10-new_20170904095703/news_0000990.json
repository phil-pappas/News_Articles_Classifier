These forward-looking statements include statements regarding the momentum in our business, potential growth of our business and market share gains. Although we attempt to be accurate in making forward-looking statements, it is possible that future circumstances might differ from the assumptions on which such statements are based. Important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the statements herein include the following: general economic risks; increasing competitiveness in the security market; the dynamic nature of the security market; specific economic risks in different geographies, and among different customer segments; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; uncertainty regarding increased business and renewals from existing customers; uncertainties around continued success in sales growth and market share gains; failure to convert sales pipeline into final sales; risks associated with successful implementation of multiple integrated software products and other product functionality risks; execution risks around new product development and introductions and innovation; sales execution risks; product defects; security breaches; litigation and disputes and the potential cost, distraction and damage to sales and reputation caused thereby; market acceptance of new products and services; the ability to attract and retain personnel; changes in strategy; risks associated with management of growth; lengthy sales and implementation cycles, particularly in larger organizations; risks associated with business acquisitions, including integration risks and assumption of unknown liabilities; technological changes that make our products and services less competitive; competition and pricing pressure; risks associated with increased international sales, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates; and the other risk factors set forth from time to time in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, copies of which are available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or upon request from our investor relations department. All forward-looking statements herein reflect our opinions only as of the date of this release, and we undertake no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation, to update forward-looking statements herein in light of new information or future events. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nWe have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. \nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. \nBillings. We define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period less any deferred revenue balances acquired from business combination(s) during the period, if any. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and viability of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of billings versus revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Second, we may calculate billings in a manner that is different from peer companies that report similar financial measures. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding GAAP revenue and evaluating billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nFree cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, repurchasing outstanding common stock, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating liquidity is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash, cash equivalents and investments balance for the period because free cash flow excludes cash used for capital expenditures and also excludes cash provided by or used for other investing and financing activities. Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures and other investing and financing activities on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nNon-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income or loss plus stock-based compensation, business acquisition-related charges, including inventory fair value adjustment amortization and other purchase accounting adjustments, impairment and amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, expenses associated with the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and, when applicable, any other significant non-recurring items in a given quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenue. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, business acquisition-related charges, including inventory fair value adjustment amortization and other purchase accounting adjustments, impairment and amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, expenses associated with the implementation of a new ERP system, and, when applicable, any other significant non-recurring items so that our management and investors can compare our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes stock-based compensation expense, business acquisition-related charges, including inventory fair value adjustment amortization and other purchase accounting adjustments, impairment and amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with the implementation of a new ERP system, and any other significant non-recurring items. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be, for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business. Second, stock-based compensation expense is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude from our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that other companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nNon-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share. We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus items noted above under non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, adjusted for the impact of the tax adjustment, if any required, resulting in an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which could differ from the GAAP effective tax rate. We define non-GAAP diluted net income per share as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that we use non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we include in non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, the tax adjustment required resulting in an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which could differ from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the effective tax rates we used are reasonable estimates of normalized tax rates for our current and prior fiscal years under our global operating structure. The same limitations described above regarding our use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share together with net income and diluted net income per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.
