(OTCBB: CHGT) is developing an enhancement to its highly successful new 3D printing site, 6d3d.com , that will enable designers and content creators to advertise and market their three-dimensional artwork directly on the CHGT portal. Eventually, this enhancement would grow to include an option to obtain a unique URL that will give users the ability to customize their page with their own specific look and feel. \n“With the added power of this virtual storefront, our portal will continue to solidify itself as the site of choice for users of all skill levels,” said CHGT CEO Marco Valenzuela. “People want a convenient, pain-free way to market and buy 3D products and we expect this feature to drive considerable additional traffic to the portal and revenues to CHGT. The marketplace has spoken and by the number of site visits, uploads and downloads we’ve seen in the weeks since launch, the 6d3D portal has proven quite popular throughout the global 3D printing community.” \n3D printing has been enjoying such explosive growth that market forecasts frequently become outdated as soon as they are published. However, the most recent estimates suggest 3D printing will expand at an impressive 16.8 percent compound annual growth rate through 2019. \nFor more information on CHGT, please visit www.changingtechno.com . \nFor more information on 6 th Dimension Technologies, visit http://www.6d3d.com . \nAbout Changing Technologies, Inc. \nChanging Technologies, Inc.
