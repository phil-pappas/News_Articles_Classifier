But train rides of five minutes will cost R5-00 for all.\nPension case up-date\nAdvocate Johan Alberts will be the main speaker at the event. He will give an update on the 60,000 Transnet Pensioners’ case and this could give all the attendees the opportunity to get a progress report and also ask questions in this regard.\nThe legal team acting on behalf of the pensioners was recently bolstered when Adv. Wim Trengove SC, a renowned and highly regarded litigation specialist, joined the team.\nBring and braai\nPlease note that this will be a ‘bring and braai’ day.
