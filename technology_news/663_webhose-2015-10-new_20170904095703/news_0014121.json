Having said that, it seems likely that by cutting lending rates again and easing the reserve requirement ratio further, the People’s Bank of China has explicitly signalled that it is less concerned about imbalances in the property sector. Sure, China still has a lot of debt, the story is well known, and it hasn’t gone away or anything. Total debt to GDP has risen sharply over recent years, which has sparked all sorts of fears over debt imbalances. Or even an eventual crash. On McKinsey figures, China’s debt burden has quadrupled since 2007, to something over 282 per cent of GDP. One of the fastest growth rates in the world and the fastest in the developing world. Viewed through that lens, recent rate cuts aren’t necessarily a positive development and they may even reignite concerns over the rapid growth in Chinese debt.\nThat’s especially true when the signs of an upswing in the property sector were already in place, even prior to this latest cut. In the so called Tier-1 cities (China’s four major centres) for instance, property price growth is already back to double digit rates -- 10 per cent annually on recent figures -- and that is already trickling down to the lower tiers. New home figures show that prices rose in 39 of the 70 major cities in September, up from 35 the month prior.\nOf more importance, perhaps, bank lending was already growing at a rapid clip, especially relative to nominal GDP growth. So prior to this latest bout of stimulus, bank lending was rising at an annual rate of 15 percent or so, more than 1.5 times nominal GDP growth. That’s an increase of almost 2 percentage points from the 2014 low.\nNot good for a country that already has a debt crisis right? It’d be fair to think that any further stimulus will simply add fuel to that fire.\nExcept that China never really had a debt crisis nor even a debt problem. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organisation that never really needs much of an excuse to be concerned about something, isn’t particularly concerned about a debt crisis developing. Oh, the risks of imbalances developing were noted sure, but even these were regarded as manageable.\nLargely, this is because of the concentrated nature of the debt ‘problem’. So, even when including the ‘off-balance-sheet items’ of local government, public debt was found to be very low. Ditto household debt. Corporate debt was the key concern. Yet even here, only among a small pocket of highly indebted firms in the property and construction sectors.\nThis is why the recent property rebound -- the bourgeoning lift in house prices -- is probably so important, in terms of mitigating some of the risks to those firms. You see the IMF found that the conditions under which these firms would slip into financial distress were largely contained to a big fall in profits or a spike in interest rates. With signs that the property market has stabilised, the risk of a big slump in profits (a boom-bust cycle) has been significantly reduced. Similarly, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan will ensure there is no global spike in interest rates.\nIn that context, the PBOC felt that it was in a position to continue ease the debt burden of companies in the property space -- and maybe even encourage further lending, without materially adding to the risks in the sector.\nYes, yes - growth at 7 per cent is ‘weak’, according to the script, and there is a real risk that growth in China’s $18 trillion economy, could even ‘collapse’ to 6 per cent or something like it. Heaven forbid, it would be a disaster! Albeit one secretly coveted by pretty much every one of the advanced world economies.\nViewed in that context, further rate cuts can only be seen as a positive development. If only -- at the very least and perhaps ironically -- for what it does to the perception of debt sustainability. It’s the perfect antidote to a weakening economy.\nSo, assuming you accept the weak growth story, then Friday’s action and any further cuts to rates and the reserve requirement make sense. It’s a logical move to buttress growth and shore up the government’s 7 per cent growth target in a low inflation world. In turn, if the government does begin to see imbalances developing once again in the property space, they will most likely resort to the favoured policy tool -- direct credit rationing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T13:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:06:07.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
