The program will kick off with a \"JV game\" on the home ice of the Philadelphia Flyers when children – some with autism – get a chance to do something most sports fans can only dream of: playing hockey in an NHL rink with Commvault customers and partners. A greater Philadelphia charity supporting autism, will receive all funds raised that day. Since it began in 2001, [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjeUxtTnZiVzEyWVhWc2RDNWpiMjB2YUc5amEyVjVMMXdpSUhKbGJEMWNJbTV2Wm05c2JHOTNYQ0lnZEdGeVoyVjBQVndpWDJKc1lXNXJYQ0krUTI5dGJYWmhkV3gwSjNNZ1NHOWphMlY1SUVobGJIQnBibWNnUzJsa2N6d3ZZVDQ9fA==]] program has raised money and awareness for a number of children's charities around the country. This year, the program will raise money for: Hendrickson's Foundation for Special Hockey and the Autism Society of Minnesota Canucks Autism Network ( Vancouver ) Coyotes Alumni Association for Youth Hockey ( Phoenix ) African Children's Choir ( Nashville ) Autism Society of Ohio (Columbus) Each of the events will occur on an NHL rink. Each event begins with a \"JV game,\" in which partners, customers, members of the charitable organization and frequently, former NHL and Olympic players, and children served by the local charity play hockey together on the ice. They all dine and watch the NHL game together, after which Commvault's Employee Hockey Team plays against another team, usually made up of veteran Olympic and ex-NHL players. Raffles and auctions throughout the day add to the contributions made by Commvault and its business partners. All proceeds go to the local children's charity that has been identified in each city. To date, the program has raised more than $1 million for charities that serve children. Sponsors this year include: Microsoft, Microsoft Azure, Windows Server, SHI, NetApp, RBA, and Harrington Search . \"With more than $1 million raised for children's charities through Commvault's Hockey Helping Kids, I couldn't be more proud of our employees' dedication to this program,\" said N. Robert Hammer , Chairman, President and CEO, Commvault. \"When this program started at Madison Square Garden 16 years ago, we couldn't have imagined how many children we could help and how much this program would impact our company culture and spirit.\" The 2015-2016 Hockey Helping Kids season schedule includes the following games: Wednesday, October 14 – Wells Fargo Center: Philadelphia Flyers vs. Chicago Blackhawks Thursday, December 17 – Xcel Energy Center: Minnesota Wild vs. New York Rangers Wednesday, January 6 – Rogers Arena: Vancouver Canucks vs. Carolina Hurricanes Wednesday, February 10 – Jobing.com Arena: Arizona Coyotes vs. Vancouver Canucks Monday, February 15 – Bridgestone Arena: Nashville Predators vs. New England Stars Monday, April 4 – Nationwide Arena: Columbus Blue Jackets vs. New York Rangers \"We're ecstatic that Commvault has chosen the World Theater of Children as its charity for this year's kick-off game,\" said Gorman Ruggiero , founder and executive director of World Theater of Children. \"Not only will the money raised from Hockey Helping Kids help us to continue helping Philadelphia -area people with autism, but it will give some of our members the once-in-a-lifetime chance to play hockey on NHL ice, and that's a memory they'll cherish forever.\" Media Opportunities Commvault would be pleased to provide opportunities for media coverage at each of the Hockey Helping Kids venues.
