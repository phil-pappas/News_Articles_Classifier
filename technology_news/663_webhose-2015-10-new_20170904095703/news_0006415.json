Bloomberg Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth Ireland's decision to cut its corporate tax rate underlines just how ugly the international tax war is about to become.\nIt's not so much tax policy â€“ more a high-stakes game of chicken.\nIreland's latest shot seems to have several targets. The first is UK Chancellor George Osborne, who announced three months ago that after slashing its company tax to 20 per cent over recent years Britain will be cutting its rate even further, to 18 per cent by 2020.\nIf there is a message to be sent here, it's Ireland telling the UK that it can always cut its rate beyond anything that a major economy like Britain can afford. You can't undercut tax havens. So why would you try?\nIreland's more significant target is the European Commission and its campaign against Base Erosion Profit Shifting. It's a dangerous game of one-upmanship that could backfire on Ireland.\nThe EC is close to finalising its investigation of Ireland's special tax deal with Apple, which channels almost all of its non-US profits through Irish companies that have no tax residence either in Ireland or the United States.\nIn 2012 alone, the US Senate subcommittee for investigation reported that Apple saved $US9 billion in tax by using the Tick the Box tax structure that prevents Irish earnings from being taxed in the US.\nLast year, after the EC stepped up its investigation of Apple's Irish arrangements, Ireland announced it was closing the tax residence loophole that Apple used, but only in 2020. That's a six-year delay, by which point Apple will have saved an additional $US54 billion in unpaid tax (actually probably a lot more than this, given that this is based on a 2012 earnings figure).\n The EC is expected to rule shortly on the Apple investigation, and in its SEC filings Apple has noted that it may be required to pay tax shortfalls going back 10 years. But while Apple has a statutory requirement to tell shareholders about potential risks, the odds seem to be against any major hit for Apple.\nEuropean Union anger What shouldn't be underestimated is the anger and dismay in European Union countries over the way tax revenues are being hollowed out by multinationals using Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg as a way to sidestep tax on profits made in other European countries.\nTax laws can restrict companies from repatriating profits to the Bahamas or the British Virgin Islands, but EU countries cannot tax profits that are sent to another EU country, like Ireland.\nThough the EU can't dictate how member countries set tax rates, the European Commission came up with a tricky variation on that: the investigation into Ireland's Apple deal was triggered because it was a secret deal for one company, and thus unfair to other companies.\nIreland, on the eve of the EC's ruling, has upped the stakes by announcing a public tax cut that carefully targets the patent structures that Apple, Ikea, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others all use to sidestep tax.\nIf everyone is offered the same 6.25 per cent tax rate, then the EC can't contest it.\nIn theory this gets Ireland off the hook. But it also overlooks the real cause of this friction.\nThe EC pursued the Apple deal in the way it did not just because it was suddenly concerned about competition law, but as a means to discourage Ireland from acting like a tax haven that enjoys the benefits of EU membership.\nIreland has called the EC's bluff. But the underlying anger that produced its isolation hasn't gone away.\nEU countries that see profits made in their borders squirrelled away to the Irish tax haven may want this revisited. This time without kid gloves.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:22:48.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
