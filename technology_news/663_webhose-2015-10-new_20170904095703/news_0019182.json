This time again the company failed to provide a specific date for the open sale, but says it will happen \"soon\". \nOpen sale means you don't need an invite, instead you can purchase the phone directly. But the sale window will be open for a limited period of time, said the company while providing details about OnePlus 2 invites status in October. \nCarl Pei has earlier said : \"Over the past few days, we've been discussing how we can make it up to our fans for the delay. One of the best ideas we have is to open sales up for an hour sometime later this month or early next, to make the entire process a bit more painless for would-be OnePlus 2 users. We will need to look into production and operations to determine when this is most feasible. We'll keep you posted.\" \nThe company further promises to finish rolling out invites for early supporters, active forum members and the reservation list soon. \"We focused on early supporters, active forum members and the reservation list,\" asserts OnePlus in a blog posting. \nThe shareable invites that started in September, will be rolled out even aggressively in October, the company firmly said. Those who have purchased the OnePlus 2 in recent past will receive three shareable invites to share with family and friends.
