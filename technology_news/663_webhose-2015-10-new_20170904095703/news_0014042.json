Increased flexibility. Its modular design allows customers to start smaller and incrementally scale from four to up to 16 servers based on business needs. CPS Standard is shipping now with Windows Azure Pack, System Center 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2012 R2 and is ready to install Microsoft Azure Stack when it becomes available. Dell and Microsoft also offer CPS Premium for large enterprises and service providers requiring a higher-capacity hybrid cloud solution.\nDell joins Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program to accelerate customers' cloud journey\nCustomers want cloud solution providers to help them realize the benefits of the cloud quickly.
