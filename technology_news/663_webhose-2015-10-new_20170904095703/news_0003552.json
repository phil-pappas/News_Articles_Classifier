Energy stocks were a sore spot, ending almost 2 percent lower as the price of crude oil took another tumble. Weight Watchers doubled in value after Oprah Winfrey said she was taking a stake in the company and would join its board. All told, the Dow climbed 14 points to 17,230. The S&P 500 edged up a fraction to 2,033. The Nasdaq rose 18 to 4,905. \nNEW YORK (AP) -- Morgan Stanley shares ended the day down five percent after the bank's third-quarter earnings fell well short of analyst estimates. Turbulence in global markets sent Morgan Stanley's earnings down 42 percent, to $940 million excluding payments to preferred shareholders, compared with $1.63 billion a year earlier. Most of that drop could be attributed to the bank's bond trading operations, which had net revenue of $583 million versus $997 million the year before. \nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration says China's currency remains undervalued in relation to the U.S. dollar but it does not cite the country for unfairly manipulating its currency to gain trade advantages. In a new Treasury Department report, the administration notes China sent global markets plunging in August with a surprise devaluation of the yuan. Since then, China's currency has fallen 2.3 percent against the dollar. Treasury says that, going forward, it'll be important for China to allow its currency to again rise in value against the dollar when market forces dictate such a move. \nARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Self-driving cars have faced what might be their most rigorous test yet: Interstate 95 in northern Virginia. The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute demonstrated its automated vehicle technology Monday on the I-95 Express Lanes. Officials say it's the first time driverless technology this advanced has been tested on an actual highway. Still, the demonstration was highly controlled: it happened when the Express Lanes were otherwise empty and the technology does not yet allow a driver to completely check out. \nNEW YORK (AP) -- United Continental says it expects to release more details about its plan of action following the hospitalization of CEO Oscar Munoz. On Friday, the company said Munoz was hospitalized, but did not provide further details. The 56-year-old Munoz was named CEO on Sept. 8 after the company made a stunning announcement that CEO Jeff Smisek had stepped down. In a statement, United Continental says it expects to release more details about its plan either late Monday or Tuesday. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
