That would make this the slowest monthlong period for IPOs for those industries since February 2013. The lull follows two of the highest-flying years in the past decade and a half: In 2013, a record $7.1 billion was raised from 50 biopharmaceutical IPOs, while the following year’s record 81 offerings brought in a total of about $6 billion. Yet a confluence of bad news for the sector has thrown cold water on the market during the tail end of this year, in which $4.6 billion has been raised from 48 IPOs.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton called for reforms in the drug industry last month, accusing Turing Pharmaceuticals of price-gouging for acquiring a drug and raising its price more than 5,000 percent. That has sent the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index down 14 percent through last Wednesday. Turing has said it will lower the price, though it hasn’t yet announced details.\nRecent high-profile stumbles in trials of biotech drugs have also underscored the riskiness of the drug business. For instance, Tetraphase Pharmaceutical’s late-stage trial failure of an antibiotic sent its shares down 79 percent in a single day last month, wiping out $1.3 billion in market value.\n“We’ve had an absolutely fantastic run for the last two years, and we all know it’ll end someday,” said Jay Lichter , a partner at Avalon Ventures in La Jolla. “That’s a risk right now.”\nThe window for biotech IPOs hasn’t completely closed under these conditions, but investors are favoring more proven products, according to people familiar with the offering process. Companies whose drugs and therapies are unproven have had less successful public offerings because investors see the stocks as riskier, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.\nOf the six biotech IPOs in the past month, five either slashed the share price offered to investors before trading, or priced the shares below the target range, indicating lower-than-expected demand for shares.\nThe only biotech firm to increase its IPO size in the past month was Regenxbio. The gene therapy company initially marketed 5.56 million shares at a range of $17 to $19 apiece — a price that was later increased to $22 per share.\nSome biotech companies have been able to raise money in private rounds, but a dwindling IPO market could signal trouble for those funding rounds as well, Lichter said.\nAlex Barinka and Caroline Chen are Bloomberg writers.
