(OTC:CTIG), a global provider of carrier-grade software solutions and services which empower organizations through communication analytics, announced today that they will be showcasing their Proteus® Enterprise Multi-Tenant call accounting solution for the Service Provider market. The application puts a particular focus on users of BroadSoft’s BroadWorks platform. Proteus® Enterprise interfaces with BroadWorks at two levels: call detail record (CDR) and Open Client Interface, Provisioning (OCI-P). CDR integration provides the method for logging call detail records from BroadWorks, processing them through Proteus’s CDR interface and storing the processed data in a highly optimised database for multiple BroadWorks tenants to securely analyse the data. OCI-P integration enables the Service Provider to easily provision the call accounting service to their customers by linking account details within BroadWorks to those within Proteus®. CTI Group’s Proteus® Enterprise is a highly scalable solution that supports high volumes of tenants and millions of daily CDRs. Its granular access policies can be defined by the service provider to ensure tenants are provided precisely with the features and reports they require, providing them the means to tailor the solution to individual customer requirements. Trevor Davis, Head of Products at CTI Group says, “As businesses migrate to hosted telephony solutions they expect their Service Provider to supply all the business tools that they used with their premise-based PBX. Our latest multi-tenant version of Proteus® Enterprise allows Service Providers to enhance their hosted voice portfolio with the important call accounting function. Their business customers will then benefit from detailed call analysis enabling decisions to be made on capacity planning, productivity improvements, telephony fraud prevention and cost allocation within their business.”\n“CTI Group shares our commitment to bringing innovative solutions to market that enable individuals and teams to create, collaborate and be productive in ways never before imagined,” said Taher Behbehani, chief marketing officer, BroadSoft. “We are thrilled that CTI Group has chosen to make this announcement at BroadSoft Connections, and to join us as we collectively define the future of work.”\nAbout CTI Group\nCTI Group (Holdings) Inc. is an international provider of electronic invoice processing and management, enterprise communications management software and services solutions, and carrier class voice over internet protocol (VoIP) management applications.
