HPH Trust is committed to the continuing success of Hong Kong Port as we set sail towards our next 200 million TEU. \n“Facing the recent challenges, our strategy is ‘be prepared’. Our company will not diminish its development; on the contrary, we have committed a US$232 million equipment investment plan to enhance our operational standards. \n“There is a sharp rise in transshipment volumes in recent years, which under the cabotage rules, Hong Kong remains as a port of choice for international shipping lines.
