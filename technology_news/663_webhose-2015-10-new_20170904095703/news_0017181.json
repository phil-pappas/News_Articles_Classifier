(PRWEB) October 01, 2015\nYamaha today introduced the RX-S601 slimline network AV receiver that offers robust audio and video performance. The receiver is just the latest product that supports Yamaha’s MusicCast wireless multiroom audio system.\nStanding at 4-3/8-inches, a mere two-thirds the height of the average AV receiver (between 6-1/2 and 7-1/2-inches), the RX-S601 is the ideal entertainment hub for small apartments, dens and offices, or any other limited space environment.\nMusicCast is the company’s wireless multiroom audio platform that works with existing Wi-Fi networks to stream all audio content from virtually any source throughout the home. This includes connected external components, such as TV set-top boxes, Blu-ray Disc players and turntables. The RX-S601 is one of 20 Yamaha MusicCast products across the AV receiver, wireless speaker, sound bar, Hi-Fi component and powered monitor speaker categories that will be available by the end of 2015.\n“With the RX-S601, confined spaces are no longer a barrier to having a serious audio system in any room for the enjoyment of audio content with superior audio quality,” said Bob Goedken, general manager, AV Division, Yamaha Corporation of America. “With our game-changing MusicCast platform, in addition to onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® input and output compatibility, this slimline AV receiver is a powerhouse that offers a new world of wireless freedom.”\nSlimline AV Receiver Packs Muscle of Full-Size Models\nAmong the wealth of features, the RX-S601 offers music and movie fans high-resolution audio playback of DSD, WAV, FLAC and AIFF files (up to 192 kHz/ 24-bit) and 4K Ultra HD pass-through with HDCP 2.2 support. With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the RX-S601 is compatible with Pandora® and Spotify music services, AirPlay®, Internet radio and can playback content stored on mobile devices and DLNA®-compatible components in the home.\nLike all Yamaha MusicCast products, the RX-S601 supports Bluetooth both as an input and an output — an industry first. Now, users can stream Bluetooth audio from a mobile phone or tablet to the RX-S601 and also simultaneously stream from the AV receiver to other Bluetooth devices, such as speakers in other rooms, portable devices and Bluetooth headphones. As a result, users can watch YouTube or Vevo content on their smartphones or tablets and listen to the audio over their home entertainment speakers, or catch every moment of the game even when leaving the TV room to get a snack in the kitchen or flip the burgers on their backyard grill. This wide Bluetooth access also enables visitors to share their music easily without their hosts needing to give out passwords and compromise their Wi-Fi network privacy.\nThe RX-S601 features Burr-Brown 192 kHz / 24-bit digital-to-analog converters and Yamaha CINEMA DSP 3D processing to deliver maximum audio performance for music, movies and TV viewing. It also offers HD Audio format decoding for Dolby® TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, as well as Yamaha’s own CINEMA DSP 3D with 17 DSP programs and Compressed Music Enhancer to deliver lifelike audio reproduction and surround sound that can be adjusted to users’ tastes. The Yamaha proprietary YPAO technology provides automatic speaker setup to calibrate and optimize the system for the best possible playback quality.\nThe RX-S601 can be controlled by Yamaha’s top-rated, intuitive and graphically appealing AV Controller App, as well as the easy to use MusicCast App, for Apple® and Android smartphones and tablets to browse and play content in one or multiple rooms throughout the home.\nFor more details on this slim, yet powerful RX-S601 network AV receiver, and how it can be the start of a MusicCast wireless multi-room audio system, please visit http://4wrd.it/YAMAHA_RX-S601 .\nPricing and Availability\nThe new slimline RX-S601 AV receiver will be available in September for an MSRP of $649.95.\nAbout Yamaha\nYamaha Corporation of America (YCA) is one of the largest subsidiaries of Yamaha Corporation, Japan and offers a full line of award-winning musical instruments, sound reinforcement and home entertainment products to the U.S. market.
