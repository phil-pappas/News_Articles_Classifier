GAAP revenue was $884 million and adjusted revenue increased to $886 million. GAAP operating profit increased 2% to $250 million, representing 28.3% of revenue.

EBITDA margins increased to a record 34.4% in the quarter. Our medical, software and toll and traffic businesses continued to grow organically.\" \nAcquisitions \nOn October 21, 2015, Roper completed the acquisition of Aderant Holdings, Inc. and on October 2, 2015, Roper completed the sale of ABEL Pumps LP to Hillenbrand, Inc. \n\"We have now deployed over $1.7 billion in acquisitions in 2015.

CliniSys expands Roper's suite of diagnostic-related software. Roper expects the acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, following the completion of customary merger control review. \n2015 Outlook and Guidance \nRoper is updating its full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $6.69 - $6.75, from its previous range of $6.61 - $6.75, and establishing fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.83 - $1.89. The company's guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures. \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information \nThe company supplements its consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with certain non-GAAP financial information to provide investors with greater insight, increase transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making.
