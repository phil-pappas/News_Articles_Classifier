The new curriculum was unveiled at the World Food Prize 2015 Borlaug Dialogue international symposium. \n\"'Bringing Biotechnology to Life' is a science-based classroom resource with applicable lessons related to agriculture,\" said Julie Tesch , executive director of the American Farm Bureau Foundation for Agriculture. \"This resource is fact- and research-based and has been reviewed by an array of scientists, so the science behind it is very sound.\" \n\"Many consumers do not understand the impact biotechnology makes on agriculture and our lives,\" Tesch said. \"Our goal is to have this resource provide students with the tools they need to make informed decisions about the practical uses of biotechnology.\" \nNoted Kimberly Reed , president of the IFIC Foundation, \"We are honored to debut this educational resource at the World Food Prize symposium, where the world's foremost experts are convened to discuss cutting-edge issues in food security. As we mark the 101 st anniversary of the birth of Dr. Norman Borlaug , father of the 'Green Revolution' and the man who saved a billion lives, we want to engage and inspire students as they consider future careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) to help us feed our growing planet.\" \nThe resource includes seven sequential lesson plans for educators which address national learning standards for 7th to 10th grade students. Lesson topics include: What is DNA? How can we examine DNA? What is Selective Breeding?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:20:01.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
