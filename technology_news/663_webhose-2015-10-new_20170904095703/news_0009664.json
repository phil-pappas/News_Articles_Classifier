You’re going to have to register it with the government by mid-December.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration today announced a new task force that will develop recommendations for a registration process for drones.\n“It’s really hard to follow the rules if you don’t know what the rules are and if the rules apply to you,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a news conference Monday . “People registering their drones will be exposed to rules and the reasons for those rules.”\nRegistering drones would force drone operators to go through basic education of drone safety, Foxx said. It would also help the government identify potentially irresponsible pilots.\n“If unmanned aircraft operators should break the rules, there should be consequences,” he said. “But there can be no accountability if the person breaking the rules cannot be identified.”\nThe rules come at a time when drones -- and drone crashes -- are becoming more commonplace.\nA drone made by Chinese company DJI crashed near the White House earlier this year . The owner of that drone, an off-duty government employee, turned himself in. San Bernardino County supervisors agreed to offer a $75,000 reward for information in tracking down drone operators who they say interfered with firefighters during three major wildfires in California this summer.\n“Finding the drone has not been as much of a problem as finding the person who is using that drone,” Foxx said. “The registration is designed to close that loophole.”\nAt first, registration would essentially operate on an honor system. And there’s no “drone police,” so it’s unclear how drone registration would be enforced in the future.\n“I think many, if not most, users will comply because of the attention we are giving to this issue,” Foxx said. “There are penalties associated with using these devices in the national airspace.”\nAs of now, local law enforcement don't have authority to penalize drone operators who fly a drone that is not registered. Foxx said that currently the U.S. Department of Justice would be the prosecuting agency.\nOne million people are expected to purchase a drone this holiday season , and there are already hundreds of thousands of drones estimated in the airspace right now. DJI, the world’s largest drone maker, sold about 400,000 units in 2014 alone, according to Forbes .\nIt’s also still unclear which types of drones will have to be registered and what the process will be like. Foxx said the task force will advise the government as to whether certain types of drones should be exempt from registration due to low safety risk, such as small drones or drones classified as toys . The task force is expected to deliver its report by Nov. 20, and he said he expects rules in place by the middle part of December.\n“We also want to ramp up enforcement and we will be able to instill accountability,” Foxx said. “There’s still a lot of work to do. This is not the whole solution, this is just a part of it.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-reward-drone-arrests-20150728-story.html", "http://qz.com/516790/the-faa-expects-over-1-million-drones-to-be-sold-at-christmas-but-hasnt-figured-out-how-legal-they-are/", "https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-anthony-foxx-announces-unmanned-aircraft-registration-0", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/05/06/dji-drones-frank-wang-china-billionaire/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:37:26.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
