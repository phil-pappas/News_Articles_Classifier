The Labor Department also trimmed its estimates for jobs growth in July and August.\nAnalysts lowered the odds the US Federal Reserve will imminently raise interest rates.\n\"These data help the case for the Fed to stay on hold in October,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.\nHowever London's benchmark FTSE 100 index of top companies bounced back to end the day on Friday with a gain of 0.95 per cent to 6,129.98 points.\nIn the eurozone, Paris' CAC 40 index rose 0.73 to 4,458.88 points and Frankfurt's DAX 30 won 0.46 per cent to 9,323.28.\nIn foreign exchange deals, the European single currency rose to $1.1274, up from $1.1187 late in New York on Thursday, shooting up as the prospect of an early rate hike had been propping up the US dollar.\nWall Street stocks had failed to recover by midday, however.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.49 per cent to 16,192.17 points, while the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.61 per cent to 1,912.13 and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.47 per cent to 4,605.44.\n\"Today's employment report has most likely removed even the last small chance for a rate hike as early as this month,\" said Harm Bandholz, chief US economist at UniCredit Research.\nThe US Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee next meets on October 28.\n\"But we continue to expect the first move at the mid-December meeting,\" he said.\nIn London, banking sector stocks shot up after the Financial Conduct Authority regulator unveiled plans to impose a two-year deadline on claims for mis-sold credit insurance.\nBritish banks have so far paid out about Â£25 billion ($A54.07bn) to customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).\nLloyds Banking Group shares surged 1.77 per cent to 76.55 pence and Royal Bank of Scotland added 0.50 per cent to 320.80 pence.\nBarclays climbed 0.57 per cent to 248.55 pence and HSBC rose 0.93 per cent to 507.70 pence.\n\"The financial sector has led the gains on the FTSE 100, with banks and insurers bolstered by a proposal by the FCA to put an end date on PPI claims,\" noted CMC Markets analyst Jasper Lawler.\nPPI provided insurance for consumers should they fail to meet repayments on a credit product such as consumer loans, mortgages or payment cards\nHowever, the insurance was mis-sold to millions of people who either had no idea what they were buying or had little chance of making a successful claim.\nMeanwhile, credit-checking company Experian slumped 3.81 per cent to 1,034 pence, after admitting that 15 million US customers had their personal data hacked.\nThe affected customers are clients of T-Mobile USA - the American unit of the German mobile phone giant.\nThe hacked data included names, dates of birth, addresses, social security numbers and other forms of identification like drivers' licence numbers, as well as additional information.
