It features a two pronged program. Sales prospects call you directly. Your staff answers the phone and books the service. The leads are not shared. These sales leads are priced at a low, flat rate. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277924 \nLimited Availability, Invitation Only \nThere is a limit as to how many plumbing and HVAC contractors can effectively participate in this lead generating system. Also, membership is by invitation only. Call now to see if you qualify. If the program is full, be sure to get on the waiting list. Contractor backgrounds will be checked and rechecked. \nThere are no long term commitments. Any program that requires a long term commitment could bring a small contractor down. It's a risk they can't afford. \nFinally, Exclusive Sales Leads, Calling You at Flat Rate Pricing \nContractors will benefit from having a fixed cost to make the phone ring. In Houston, there will be two price tiers. Call MicroManaged Media for details. Contractors may participate in both programs. \nAre You Priced Out of Google Adwords, Bing Ads, Yahoo Ads? \nMost contractors are, too. The big contractors suck all the oxygen out of the room. But now there's an alternative you can afford. And its perfect for a top rated, medium to small contractor. \nPay-Per-Click advertising has become the go to tool for contractors. Most small HVAC and plumbing contractors have tried it, but failed for many reasons. \nTwo Problems With Pay-Per-Click Advertising \nIt's expensive and time consuming. The average contractor can't devote the time to learn the system. Google changes it everyday. \nDone right, the contractor can make a profit. Done wrong, contractors get murdered. Pay per click advertising has gotten very complicated and expensive. \nSmall to medium sized contractors attempt to do Pay Per Click advertising only to fail miserably. Google / Bing / Yahoo have made Pay-Per-Click advertising so complicated that it requires your full attention and a great deal of experience. \nPay-Per-Click ads require constant maintenance. \"Set it and forget it\" is not going to work. Pay-Per-Click a battle every day and the battlelines change constantly. You need a team effort. \nHibu, Reachlocal, etc. will set up a pay per click program for you, but the results usually don't measure up. Their model is not transparent. The contractor never knows what was actually spent on the PPC (Pay-Per-Click) campaign. \nLarge electrical, HVAC, and plumbing contractors excel at Pay Per Click because they can afford to hire the experienced, full time specialists to manage their campaign. They can afford a call center. Now small contractors can, too! \nOur Team Approach \nThe small contractors at an incredible disadvantage. Small contractors cannot spend that much time and effort on a Pay Per Click campaign. After all, they have a business to run. Pay Per Call is the solution. \nWhat is Pay-Per-Call Advertising? \nWhen it comes to pay per call advertising, you don't pay for the clicks. You only pay for valid calls. All calls are tracked and recorded. They ring directly thru to your office and are answered by your staff. \nIf you don't have a staff to answer calls and book appointments, our Team concept will help you there, too. Call for details and prices. \nThere are very few companies out there that have a service like this because it is so difficult to do. That is why Micromanage Media is pleased to announce they are launching a Pay-Per-Call marketing program for the Houston plumbers http://www.plumbing-houston.com/ and Houston air conditioning repair http://www.airconditioning-houstontx.com/ contractors. So if you service the communities of the Houston Metro area: Baytown, League City, The Woodlands, Spring, Humble, Atascocita, Bellaire, Kingwood, etc. Call now. \nGet the Phone Ringing for a Fixed Price \nFlat rate pricing for leads are the answer for contractors of all sizes: \nLarger Contractors - Your company may have its own Pay-Per-Click program. This is a supplement to your marketing efforts. \nSmall Contractors - Pay-Per-Call advertising places a cap on the spend per lead that you will find affordable, returning an acceptable ROI. In some cases, this is the only advertising campaign of any type you'll ever need. \nAvailability in Houston is Limited \nMicroManaged Media, Inc., a plumbing and heating and air conditioning contractor marketing agency, has just launched a Pay-Per-Call program for the Houston, TX area.
