The move comes as Impartner strengthens its global presence to keep pace with the worldwide market demand for SaaS based solutions, which are growing five times faster than on-premise applications,* and demand for PRM technologies, which are critical to accelerating indirect sales. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150821/260238LOGO \n\"The combination of the growth in SaaS technologies and the demand for PRM is truly a one-two punch that's driving our rapid expansion,\" said Impartner Chief Marketing Officer Dave R Taylor. \"Nimble companies are realizing that SaaS applications allow them to snap on what they need to their IT infrastructure and move on, and both resellers and end-users are driving the demand for next generation PRM solutions, which are critical to accelerating indirect sales. There is truly disruption at all levels in the market, and this extension of our operations ensures we can take advantage of those opportunities and meet market demand where our customers are.\" \nIn EMEA, while Impartner does sell directly to end-users, their solutions are sold primarily through indirect partners. As the company expands, they are looking for highly qualified partners to help deliver their transformational software to companies who want to ignite their sales through indirect channels. Key highlights of working with Impartner include: -- Strong and increasing end user demand -- Highly scalable product, relevant to companies of all sizes -- Access to lucrative professional services -- Subscription model with generous recurring revenues -- Leads \nA recent article in CRN UK further emphasized how \"as a service\" technologies are driving the growth and focus of resellers in the UK and around the world. The publication cited an industry study listing No. 1 risk of obsolesce for value-added resellers (VARS): failure to diversify their portfolios to include as-a-service solutions.** \n\"The time is now for VARS to ensure their product portfolio is diversified and robust,\" stressed Impartner EMEA SVP Philippe Ortodoro. \"Continued economic growth in the UK means even greater opportunity for UK-based VARS to broaden their portfolio and ensure they take full advantage of the fast-growing SaaS market,\" he said, noting that Impartner PRM is the industry's ONLY solution that can be deployed in 30 days using the company's easy, three step Velocity process. \nEnd users and partners interested in Impartner's solutions should click here . \nAbout Impartner \nImpartner (formerly known as TreeHouse Interactive) delivers the industry's most advanced SaaS-based Partner Relationship Management solution, helping companies worldwide manage their partner relationships and accelerate revenue and profitability through indirect sales channels.
