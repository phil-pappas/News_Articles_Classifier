Israel-based designer Danit Peleg will present her 3D-printed, five-piece fashion collection at Gerber Technology's ideation2015, Oct. 29-30 in Las Vegas. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277481LOGO \n\"Gerber is providing the integrated software and digital solutions that fuel the imagination for new design and production approaches,\" said Karsten Newbury, Gerber vice president and general manager, Software Solutions. \"Danit's work is an excellent example of persistence and innovative thinking, and shows where the industry can go in the future. We are excited to have Danit tell her story as part of ideation2015.\" \nPeleg, 27, created the 3D-printed collection as part of her graduate collection for her fashion design degree at Shenkar College of Engineering and Design. The collection was created using home printers following nine months of research and development. Each outfit required 400 hours to print, and Peleg experimented with a wide range of CAD and printing systems, including Blender. Peleg has since begun working with Gerber's AccuMark(Â®) 3D visualization, animation and simulation technology. The collection was designed based on the work, Liberty Leading the People by Eugene Delacroix, and the textile designs were inspired by the soft elements of Andreas Bastian's Mesostructured Cellular Materials. \nideation2015 offers hands-on workshops, demonstrations, case studies and networking opportunities. In addition, Peleg will be participating in the ideation2015 Innovators' Panel, a discussion among the industry's thought leaders about trends and 'the next big thing.' \nThe conference will also feature a competition for students pursuing a degree in fashion design, using vintage dresses from The Darnell Collection as inspiration. Students will design their own fashions, which will be produced in 3D, physically created and modeled at the conference. Keynoting ideation2015 is Tim Gunn, Emmy-winning co-host and mentor for Lifetime's Project Runway , Fashion Dean at Fifth & Pacific and member of the administration and faculty at Parsons School of Design. \nWith the theme, \"Everything has changed. But one thing hasn't,\" ideation2015 will highlight the technology and new developments that have dramatically changed the fashion industry.
