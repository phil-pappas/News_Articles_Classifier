At the Panasonic Booth, the corporation is putting on full display its repertoire in two key areas: automated and connected vehicle technologies and ITS big data solutions. \n[Flash Video] Panasonic’s Automated & Connected Technologies @ #ITSWC15 http://news.panasonic.com/global/topics/2015/44285.html \nOffering automotive and device solutions for pedestrians and cars, infrastructure solutions for homes, roads and more, Panasonic is one of the few manufacturers capable of providing total solutions. Based on the concept of bringing together comfort, safety and the environment, Panasonic is using these strengths as part of the evolution of ITS. \nTrends in the Automotive Industry \nERTICO ーITS Europe, the organizer of ITS World Congress 2015, is highlighting industry aims to create safer, smarter and cleaner mobility. This vision aims also to result in people becoming fully informed, reducing the impact of vehicles on the environment and minimizing the amount of traffic accidents.In the report ' Analysis of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Market in Europe ', Frost & Sullivan Research Analyst Cathy Brown points out that vehicle safety and driver comfort are currently garnering immense interest within the automotive industry. \"Driven by legislation and cost effective vehicles, the ADAS market in Europe is entering a new phase of applications integrating both safety and comfort.\" as Brown notes, this have become focal points of assessment, and companies are using all means to meet the modern demands while also considering future technology. \nPanasonic's Business Strategy for the future of Automotive industry According to Masahisa Shibata, President of Panasonic Automotive and Industrial Systems Europe, Panasonic's global strategy focuses on three key business areas: Infotainment and e-cockpit solutions to provide more comfort and entertainment to the driver as well as co-passengers. Advanced driving assistance systems for maximum safety. Environmental solutions with more efficient electronics and best-in-class battery technology for EVs (Electric Vehicles). \nRegarding Panasonic's business strategy for Europe, Yoshitaka Teraoka, Vice President of Panasonic Automotive and Industrial Systems Europe GmbH says, \"What makes us unique is that we can cross-pollinate between various consumer and B2B areas by utilizing our comprehensive portfolio. Developing next generation solutions for these three areas and working closely with advanced companies, we aim to become a leading partner of our customers in Europe.\" \nPanasonic's technology development for ADAS \nPanasonic is developing ADAS technology by utilizing its strengths in cameras, sensors and image-processing technology. The Panasonic millimeter-wave radar system detects the position of other vehicles and pedestrians in less than 0.1 seconds and informs the driver through road-to-vehicle communication. \nPanasonic's 79GHz Infrastructure Radar for cooperative intersection safety is precise and covers a wide scope. It features high resolution for differentiating between pedestrians and other vehicles, a wide field of view for scanning, and high-level accuracy for detecting multiple targets with its robustness at night and under poor weather conditions (snow, fog, etc.).The V2X Communication for Driving Support System is a key technology for new driving support systems. Covering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), the V2X Communication for Driving Support System helps prevent traffic accidents by alerting the driver of impending hazardous situations.Recognizing the surrounding environment to provide support for the driver, the High-Performance Pedestrian Detection based on Deep Learning estimates pedestrian behaviors − providing a detection algorithm for on-vehicle cameras to predict accident risks. \nDeveloping ADAS business in Europe −Panasonic's business alliance with Ficosa The capital and business alliance with Ficosa will allow Panasonic to launch its electronic mirror business while also expanding its ADAS portfolio. Based in Spain, Ficosa is a tier 1 global provider for the automotive industry. Through their collaboration in electronic mirror systems, Ficosa and Panasonic are accelerating the continued evolution of automobile comfort and safety - both areas being at the core of next-generation cockpit systems. \n\"This partnership will not only bring complementary know-how and technologies but also regional synergies, says Javier Pujol, CEO of Ficosa International S.A. \"Our customers will truly benefit from the close collaboration of both of our companies − for instance, when it comes to next generation cockpit systems.\" \nAt the automated and connected vehicle technologies corner, Panasonic is presenting its Intelligent Rearview Monitor System , which is comprised of a camera and mirror display. When operating in Mirror Mode, the system makes images available to the driver as per Class I mirrors; when working in camera monitor system mode, it displays images coming from the rear camera, and a side-view camera makes visible what would otherwise be blindspots. \nKeeping a close eye on electric vehicle hackers Due to increased communications connectivity, vehicles have become more vulnerable to being attacked by hackers. Panasonic is leading the development of automotive security technologies to protect vehicle networks − its Security Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for Disabling Malicious Controller Area Network (CAN) Messages detecting unusual behavior such as unexpected acceleration and disables malicious commands. \nBig data utilization in the field of ITS In the corner of ITS Big Data Solutions, Panasonic is presenting the possibilities of ITS utilization to provide solutions for a wide range of issues. For B2B, Panasonic's Logistics Probe Solutions enables professionals such as logistic managers to better monitor vehicles and road managers to more easily acquire information about the status of roads by utilizing a Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) On-board Unit with GPS. \nFor B2C, Panasonic provides convenient and enjoyable travel experiences with greater safety and sense of security. Called the Wonder Trip System, it supports travelers in all destinations through personal authentication technology. Furthermore, Panasonic provides communication and content customization through transport information integration in smartphones and wearable devices. \nAs one of the few manufacturers capable of providing total solutions, Panasonic hopes that these solutions will contribute to a safer, greener and more comfortable world. In short, \"A Better Life, A Better World\". \nPanasonic Booth at ITS World Congress Period: 5th-9th October 2015Location: Rue Jean Samazeuilh BP 55 33030 Bordeaux Cedex France \nRelated Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:01:34.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
