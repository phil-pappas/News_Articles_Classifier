Matthew Stock reports.   \nThis remote controlled origami crane attracted much attention at Japan's biggest tech fair. The makers say it was built to demonstrate the potential of light-weight machines, but the quintessentially Japanese design struck a chord with many visitors. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) TORU TSURUTA, VISITOR, SAYING: \"I thought it flew very delicately, not using much power and felt it represented the attention to detail we Japanese love.\" At least 500 companies unveiled hi-tech gadgets at this year's Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies (CEATEC). Japan's electronics giant Panasonic showcased this 'magic mirror'. It monitors and displays the user's weight, while giving make-up tips and a 360 degree view so you can see yourself from all angles. (SOUNDBITE) (Japanese) SACHIKO KAWAGUCHI, CHIEF OF DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 5 OF HOME APPLIANCES DEVELOPMENT CENTER IN PANASONIC CORPORATION, SAYING: \"I hope people can get healthier and more beautiful just by sitting in front of the mirror without changing their daily way of movement. I think it will be useful.\" Also keeping tabs on people's health was this portable body fat detector, which drew many volunteer users. Using smartphone sensors to measure the circumference of the stomach, an algorithm calculates the user's body fat content. Dancing robots and table tennis-playing automatons also made an appearance at the annual fair, which takes place on the outskirts of Tokyo.  //reut.rs/1MndwTm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:06:12.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
