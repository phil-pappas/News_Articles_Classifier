This is accomplished by combining Stratasys flexible and rigid PolyJet dental materials, including VeroDent (MED670), VeroDentPlus (MED690), VeroGlaze (MED620) and \nClear Bio-compatible (MED610). Additional supported materials include VeroWhite, VeroMagenta, TangoPlus, TangoBlackPlus, a range of gum-like Digital Materials, and Digital Materials in a range of natural tooth shades. × Expand \n“Seven months ago, Stratasys transformed digital dentistry by enabling ultra-realistic dental models to be 3D printed in a single run. This new level of flexibility, precision and efficiency was aimed to allow labs to streamline their digital workflow while improving their competitive edge,” explained Steffen Mueller, General Manager, Dental Solutions, Stratasys. “Now with the launch of the Objet500 Dental Selection 3D Printer, we are adding increased throughput and productivity to this winning formula by featuring Stratasys game-changing, triple-jetting technology on a larger platform. We believe this is a ‘must have’ 3D printing solution for larger dental and orthodontic labs that want to provide a superior customer experience while maintaining profitable volume production.” \nThe machine offers a resolution of 600 dpi in the X-axis, 600 dpi in the Y-axis and 1600 dpi in the Z-axis. The system has accuracy levels of 20-85 µm for features below 50mm and accuracy levels up to 200 µm for full model size. It offers two build modes: high quality (16-micron) resolution, or high-speed (28-micron) resolution. The Objet500 Dental Selection system is compatible with all open format colour intra-oral scanners. \nThe Objet500 Dental Selection is an especially attractive solution for larger dental restorative and orthodontic labs that are interested in implementing digital dentistry end-to-end, from intra-oral scanners to realistic models, and which serve a wide range of dental applications in larger production volumes.
