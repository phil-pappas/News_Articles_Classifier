Shan Masood taking his coach's advice to \"use his head\" a tad too literally there #PAKvENG\n— England's Barmy Army (@TheBarmyArmy) October 13, 2015\nShan Masood bowled by Anderson. Excellent seam movement off the batsman's grille onto the stumps. But they all count.\n— mike selvey (@selvecricket) October 13, 2015\nShan Masood bowled off the grill of the helmet turning the head. Not high up there on the acceptable dismissal list for an opening batsman.\n— Simon Mann (@Cricket_Mann) October 13, 2015\nWatch the video at the top of the page.\n Video: Pakistan star’s headbutt wicket", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheBarmyArmy/status/653816983293702144", "https://twitter.com/selvecricket/status/653816847897362432", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PAKvENG?src=hash", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/pakistan-v-england-video-shan-masood-headbutts-james-anderson-delivery-onto-his-stumps-in-first-test/story-e6frf3g3-1227567892179", "https://twitter.com/Cricket_Mann/status/653819064880640000"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:47:27.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
