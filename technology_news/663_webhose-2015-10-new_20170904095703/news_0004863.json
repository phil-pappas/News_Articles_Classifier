(AP) — Artists from Michigan and New York each won $200,000 grand prizes Friday at the seventh annual ArtPrize, a competition that brought 1,550 entries to western Michigan.\nTextile artist Ann Loveless and her husband, photographer Steven Loveless, won the public vote for \"Northwood Awakening,\" a large photo print and quilt hybrid. It depicts a serene woodland panorama.\nAnn Loveless also won in 2013. The couple lives in Beulah, Michigan.\n\"Once again, reverence for technical skill in two-dimensional work — this time in a stunning combination of large-scale photography and intricate textile — has captured the imagination of the voting public,\" said Christian Gaines, ArtPrize executive director.\nGaines said he's \"stunned and delighted\" to have a repeat winner.\nSeparately, a jury of experts awarded a $200,000 grand prize to Kate Gilmore of New York for \"Higher Ground.\" She transformed a former Grand Rapids convent into performance art with women swinging on swings in open windows.\n\"Kate Gilmore's piece is really kind of magical in a way that we've maybe lost sight of,\" said juror Dan Cameron of New Orleans.\nThe event's total purse was $500,000. Other awards totaling $100,000 were given to winners in certain categories. There were 1,550 eligible works at ArtPrize from 48 countries and 42 U.S. states and territories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:29:15.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
