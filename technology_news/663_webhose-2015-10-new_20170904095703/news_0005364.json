The hike ranges from Rs. 4,000 for the entry-level Mac Mini to Rs. 30,000 for the top of the line Mac Pro. \nThe new prices of all Macs (except the Mac Pro) are now listed on Apple India's website. In addition, Gadgets 360 has learnt India pricing details of the Mac Pro, as well as the new iMac lineup that was unveiled earlier this week without any India-specific pricing or availability details. At the time of filing this report, Apple India's website still lists the iMac as \"Coming Soon\" without any price information. \nBut first, details of the price hikes. The prices of MacBook Air 11-inch and 13-inch models with 128GB SSD storage have been increased by Rs. 8,000 each, while the models with 256GB storage are now Rs. 10,000 costlier. The price of the MacBook Air was last updated in April 2014 , when it had received a small price cut. \nThe price increase for the MacBook Pro ranges from Rs. 11,000 for the non-Retina model to Rs. 20,000 for the top-end 15-inch MacBook Pro. Details of the price hike for individual MacBook Pro models and other Macs are available in the table below. It's worth pointing out that for some of the MacBook Pro models, the hike exactly matches the price drop they had received in July last year . Also worth noting is that the Macbook Air and some MacBook Pro models got a bump in specifications and features without a price increase earlier this year. \nThe 12-inch MacBook has received its first price change since it was launched earlier this year . The base model now starts at Rs. 1,06,900, an increase of Rs. 7,000, while the model with 512GB storage is now costlier by Rs. 10,000. \nThe Mac Mini sees its price go up by between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 10,000, while the Mac Pro will be costlier by Rs. 20,000 for the base model and Rs. 30,000 for the most expensive Mac in Apple's lineup. The 27-inch Thunderbolt display will now be available at a MRP of Rs. 88,900 compared to the earlier price of Rs. 74,900. \nWhile there's no official word on the rationale behind the price hike across the Mac lineup, given the fact that the new iPhone models were also introduced in the country carrying a price tag that's higher than their predecessors, it's safe to assume that Apple is bearish on the Indian rupee. \nIn addition to the price increase, we also have information about the India pricing of the new iMacs. Gadgets 360 has learnt that the 21.5-inch iMac with 1.6GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard disk, and Intel HD Graphics 6000 will be launched at Rs. 91,900. The 21.5-inch iMac with 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard disk, and Intel Iris Pro 6200 will be launched at Rs. 1,07,900. The new 4K Retina iMac with Intel Core i5 3.1GHz, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard disk, and Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics will be priced at Rs. 1,23,900. \nThe refreshed 27-inch 5K Retina iMac with 3.2GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard disk will be available at Rs. 1,48,990; 3.2GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB fusion drive will be available at Rs. 1,64,990; and 3.3GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 2TB fusion drive will be available at Rs. 1,88,990. \nThere's no word yet on the availability of the new iMacs. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:53:36.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
