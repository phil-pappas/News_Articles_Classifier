You will find zillions of games which are copies of either Candy Crush or Temple Run or Clash of Clans. But, I didn't bow down and dug deeper to find a game which was refreshingly new.\n\nDoes not commute, which is a wordplay on the phrase 'does not compute', was the fruit of my labour. Developed by Mediocre, this strategic driving game seems like child's play till you actually start playing it.\n\nThe objective is simple. You have to plan routes for different vehicles in a small town set in 1970s. You have to drive all vehicles and get them to their destination. But there's a catch: You have limited time. This is where it gets tricky and this is where you are most likely to 'rage quit'. If you crash your into anything, the vehicle slows down. If you don't think ahead, the vehicles might collide with each other, making your game go for a toss. And you have no one but yourself to blame. So, you need to plan ahead and be quick. With gritted teeth, I made it through the first checkpoint after about eight tries.\n\nThe game features different vehicles with different speeds, which means a school bus would be slower than a taxi. It also has the option of turbo speed which you get after you drive a certain amount of vehicles but the downside to it is that you might not be able to control it as efficiently.\n\nThe game has checkpoints, where the timer resets but the remaining time from the previous checkpoint is also carried over.\n\nThe most interesting feature of the game is that it is not a mindless driving game; it mixes strategy with a cleverly woven plot. As you drive around, you uncover secrets of the townspeople. For example, as you drive, you discover what secrets Dr Charles Schneider, a dentist, is hiding or whether Mr Mayfield's obsession with Yorkshire Terrier end in his doom.\n\nIt has only one optional premium upgrade. With a one-time payment, you will be able to continue from the checkpoints instead of starting over. The game hasn't garnered a lot of attention yet, but is sure to catch some eyeballs through word-of-mouth.\n\nIt is free-to-play and is small in size, so can be downloaded over mobile networks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:40:51.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
