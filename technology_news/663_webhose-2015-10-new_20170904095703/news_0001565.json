Picture: James Croucher Source: News Limited\nAustralia’s tech industry has finally eked out a seat at the government table, with the board directors of StartupAUS meeting with Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne ahead of the government’s policy hackathon this weekend.\nStartupAUS CEO Peter Bradd told The Australian he presented the minister with three key policy settings to help build the agile, technology-driven economy that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull seems intent on delivering.\n“We spent an hour with him and presented ideas that would have the biggest impact and would be the easiest to do,” Mr Bradd said.\nThe first of these is to create ­income and capital gains tax ­incentives for early stage start-up investments, a fix to what Mr Bradd said was a critical funding gap at the initial high risk “seed” stage of a company’s formation.\n“(Venture capitalist) Mark Carnegie said that investors ­already get these things, which is great for him, and the 13 firms that have obtained the early-stage capital limited partnership structure,” Mr Bradd said.\n“But that doesn’t help angel ­investors.”\nHe has also called for a doubling of R&D tax concessions for start-ups, suggesting that funds could be shifted away from larger established companies in favour of new entrants.\n“If we can give more to tech start-ups and less to larger companies, that money would have a much bigger impact,” he said. “Google’s Maile Carnegie has ­already gone on the record as ­saying she’d be happy to take some of the money Google gets in R&D tax incentives and shift it to start-ups.”\nMr Bradd has also urged the government to extend mining ­sector director liability exemptions to tech start-ups, arguing that Australian law makes it a high-risk proposition for prominent business leaders to sit on the board of companies that have a potential to fail.\nClare Hallam, director of Melbourne-based technology accelerator Pollenizer, said that if technology was to be the future of the Australian economy, the ­government must build a holistic national framework.\n“The government is certainly making improvements in certain areas already but they’re not in my opinion mapping that all together in one big framework; it still seems to be a case of he who shouts loud enough gets the most attention,” she said.\n“I want the departments to be talking to each other and looking at the knock-on effects of how one policy affects another.\n“Take the ESOP changes earlier this year, were they considered into the broader picture? Did the government think about all the things it will touch on? I don’t know.”\nPeter Bradd said that it was great news that Minister Pyne has been tasked with creating a national ­innovation agenda, and that so far the signs were positive that the government would follow through on its mantra of having “everything on the table”, including 457 visas, entrepreneur visas, and amending ASIC legislation.\nLike Bradd, Hallam called on the government to adopt best-practice strategies from other economies, namely Britain, which offers R&D corporation tax relief as part of a host of innovation ­incentives.\n“A couple of years ago Pollenizer witnessed an increase in early stage start-up investment but those investors have now backed off, due to receiving very little ­support,” she said.\n“These investors now prefer to invest at a later, safer stage. If there had been better tax breaks those investors may have continued to back early-stage ideas.”\nThe government is set to tackle innovation policy head on with its one-day policy hackathon, to be held at start-up accelerator BlueChilli this Saturday.\nMr Bradd said he was hopeful the event, to be hosted by Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy, would be the first step in delivering tangible technology policy outcomes.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227566/546316-2226ee24-707a-11e5-802e-00b850159bfd.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/innovation-tech-sector-grabs-a-seat-at-christopher-pynes-table/story-e6frgakx-1227566549115"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:15:28.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
