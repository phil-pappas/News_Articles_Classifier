He will also talk about how emerging technologies—such as thin, flexible electronics embedded in clothing and sensors that can monitor everything from a runner’s gait to a golfer’s swing—will be used to enhance the performance of tomorrow’s athlete. \n“At Molex, we work with customers to develop solutions that help professional athletes reach their full potential and inspire all health and fitness enthusiasts to challenge themselves,” said Brian Krause, vice president, global marketing and communications, Molex. “Expo visitors will see the Molex technology inside fitness wearables available today and be able to share their Chicago Marathon experience in a fun way.” \nIn addition to seeing the latest wearable technologies, visitors to the Molex booth will have the opportunity to experience an interactive run through Chicago.

Approximately 80 runners from around the world will represent Molex on race day, including entrants from Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. More than 150 employees will volunteer at the race, providing water at Aid Station 6, handing out heat sheets at the finish line, and supporting the runners in the Molex tent at the 27th mile post-race party. \nFor more information, please visit www.molex.com/marathon . \nAbout Molex, LLC \nProviding more than connectors, Molex delivers complete interconnect solutions for a number of markets including: data communications, telecommunications, consumer electronics, industrial, automotive, commercial vehicle, aerospace and defense, medical, and lighting.
