Photo: Virginia Star\nSt George customers will regain access to their accounts from Monday evening after a system outage left St George, Bank of Melbourne and Bank SA customers unable to access their savings over the long weekend.\nA simple task of turning the computer off and on while performing scheduled maintenance all went wrong in the early hours of Sunday morning, when data on the mainframe computer powering Westpac-owned St George Bank, Bank of Melbourne, and BankSA's core banking system became corrupt .\nThe outage was only meant to go from 11.30pm AEST Saturday night until 5am AEDT Sunday and was for routine maintenance and upgrades to the database hosting critical transactional data (data showing you purchased an item at A time, on B date, at C merchant, costing D amount of money).\nBut when the system came back up early Sunday morning, a major data corruption was found by IT experts in the IBM mainframe Information Management System (IMS) database hosting the data, so all systems were shut back down about midday Sunday, a source close to the bank told Fairfax Media.\nAdvertisement St George said problems around its online, mobile and telephone banking were being rectified and systems should be progressively restored on Monday evening. Customer transactions undertaken over the weekend should be processed overnight or tomorrow .\nIt was \"very sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused many customers\" and it would waive fees and other charges for those customers needing to access emergency funds through their credit card cash advance facilities.\nThe bank is also attempting to contact those customers who have been affected by the outage, but don't have access to an ATM, EFTPOS or credit card facilities. A number of St George branches will open at 8am on Tuesday.\n\"IBM IMS and CSC Hogan experts are trying to figure out how to restore the databases without losing any transactions that were done on Sunday morning,\" the source said on Monday afternoon, referring to IT outsourcers IBM and CSC being called in to assist, and Hogan, an integrated suite of core banking applications. \"That's clearly not an easy task and is taking a lot of time,\" the source said, adding: \"Customers deserve to know what's happening.\"\nA second source close to the outage said it was \"very, very rare\" for any bank's core system to go down.\nThey added that if Westpac could not recover the transactional files of its smaller banks, it faced the very real risk of losing potentially millions of dollars.\nAs the outage entered more than 28 hours on Monday afternoon, tens of thousands of customers from St George Bank, the Bank of Melbourne and BankSA were left to express their frustration on the banks' Facebook pages .\n\"Went out for lunch and couldn't transfer money to pay was extremely embarrassing!\" St George customer Jules Lewis wrote on the bank's Facebook page on Sunday afternoon.\n\"All plans now cancelled for this evening as we have no access to funds without internet or phone banking....cheers St George.\"\nAnother customer , Chris Quote: : \"Thanks St George, for the ruined long weekend. Thank you for confining my family to the house as our holiday plans require us to access our money ... This is an absolute joke.\n\"You will be losing a record amount of customers come Tuesday.\"\nAnother, Brianne Quote: : \"This is absolutely ridiculous!! It's a public holiday and we can't go anywhere or do anything! I can't put petrol in my car, can't buy nappies and I cannot do my food shopping so I have no idea what we will be eating for dinner.\n\"Hurry up and get it fixed. Your IT guys need a kick up the ass.\"\nTo add further salt to customers' wounds, the banks' branches were closed on Monday in NSW, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT due to the Labour Day public holiday.\nIn a statement to Fairfax Media, Westpac declined to comment on the reason behind the outage and said closed branches would not be opening.\nOne of the affected banks, St George, added on social media that customers affected would be reimbursed any fees or charges incurred as a result of the outage, which affected online, mobile, and telephone banking.\nSt George Bank first notified customers of the outage via Facebook at 5.13pm AEDT on Sunday, although many customers said they were unable to access their funds before then.\n\"The problem has arisen following a regular upgrade to the bank's computer systems over the weekend,\" St George's website stated when customers attempt to log in to internet banking .\n\"We are currently working to restore banking services as quickly as possible and apologise to customers for the inconvenience that this incident has caused.\"\nBank of Melbourne and BankSA issued a similar statement on their Facebook pages.\nWhile St George Bank said on its website that customers could still access funds using ATMs and EFTPOS, many customers complained they were unable to transfer funds from their savings accounts to an account accessible using their bank cards.\nSt George Bank's Facebook page was inundated with complaints; some customers pleaded with the bank to open branches on the public holiday so that they could access their funds.\nA Westpac spokeswoman said the bank was working to restore services \"as quickly as possible\" and apologised to customers for the inconvenience that the incident had caused.\nIn July, Fairfax Media reported that Westpac Banking Corp was losing over $1 million a day because its computer systems do not allow it to charge property investors and owner occupiers different interest rates .\nThe outage follows a widespread technology outage at the Commonwealth Bank that affected credit cards, net banking, mobile banking, phone banking ATM, Bpay and EFTPOS services on September 11.\nA further three-hour long outage in June affected Commonwealth Banks' EFTPOS machines and customers' access to some features in Netbank, its online banking system.\nKnow more?
