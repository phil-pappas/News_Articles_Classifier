The deal would make Western Digital the broadest supplier of data storage components — and likely fuel new pricing pressure in the storage market.\nEarlier, Lam Research proposed a $US10.6bn purchase of KLA-Tencor, a deal that would unite companies that provide machines that make and evaluate chips. The combination would become the No 2 supplier of chip production tools, after Applied Materials, and spur tougher rivalries among the industry’s key toolmakers.\nSemiconductor-related deals are already running at record highs. Data provider Dealogic last week tallied about $US100.6bn in such deals so far in 2015, exceeding the $US37.7bn total for 2014.\nBehind the ferocious activity, industry executives say, is a desire to carve larger positions in fast-growing market niches and to gain products and expertise for manufacturing more advanced chips.\n“Scale matters in today’s environment,” said Western Digital chief executive Steve Milligan. “Technology is becoming tougher.”\nIn some cases, the consolidation offers a chance to cut costs by offering a wider array of products through an existing sales force. That was a factor in Avago Technologies’ $US37bn purchase of Broadcom.\nIn other cases, a tie-up can give a chipmaker the technology it needs to squeeze new functions on to silicon. Intel said its planned $US16.7bn acquisition of Altera would let it create new kinds of custom processors to improve the computers typically used in data centres.\nFor Western Digital, a technology shift was a key driver. The company has edged past rival Seagate Technology to take the top spot in disk drives, the familiar medium for storing data in personal computers and server systems. Newer server and disk-storage systems are moving to chip-based flash storage technology.\nThat hurt its sales of the most expensive and profitable drives and storage systems.\nBut PC sales have slowed as consumers have shifted to products such as smartphones and tablets that use flash memory chips, a technology that uses less energy and is less prone to failures than spinning disks.\nWorldwide revenue this year for disk drive makers would decline 6 per cent over a year earlier to $US30.9bn, researcher Gartner estimated, while sales of flash memory chips would swell 9 per cent to $US31.3bn.\n“We recognised the fact that there was an element of the market that we were not able to participate in,” Mr Milligan said. “For quite a while we’ve been thinking about that.”\nWestern Digital already sells some storage devices that use flash memory chips in addition to disk drives. By adding SanDisk’s chip production capability — part of a joint venture with Japan’s Toshiba — Western Digital would gain an internal supply of the chips at attractive prices.\nJim Handy, an analyst at Objective Analysis, said many disk drive executives felt cost pressures in data storage made it important to supply all components internally. “This fits that mindset,” he said.\nThe Western Digital offer values SanDisk at $US86.50 a share, a 15 per cent premium to Tuesday’s close.\nSanDisk shares rose 2 per cent to $US76.78 on Wednesday following the announcement. SanDisk traded at less than $US60 earlier this month. Western Digital shares fell 4.6 per cent to $US71.44 in New York trading on Wednesday. The stock has lost about a third of its value so far this year.\nThe acquisition comes about three weeks after an arm of China’s Tsinghua Unigroup agreed to pay $US3.78 billion for a 15 per cent stake in Western Digital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:56:00.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
