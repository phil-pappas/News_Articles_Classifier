Kevin Mills , president and chief executive officer, commented, \"Our cordless scanning revenue continued to grow in both the third quarter and nine months compared to the prior year periods, representing 88 percent of our total revenue year-to-date. The reduction in our total third quarter and nine months revenue compared to the prior year is solely attributable to lower revenue from the SoMo handheld computer which has been in decline over the past several years. The growth in our cordless scanning business reflects the widespread adoption of our barcode scanning products by our software application partners, many of whom are focused on mobile point of sale and other mobile application areas. While today our growth is driven by mobile point of sale applications, we expect our business to broaden to include more inventory-centric and other mobile market areas in the next 12 months as more of these applications come to market. We expect to introduce additional products over the next several months to capitalize on the opportunities offered by these additional markets.\" \"From an operations standpoint, we have optimized our business model to support data capture requirements of mobile applications designed by businesses for use on mobile devices and marketed and distributed online. This model has enabled us to hold steady our operating costs while supporting worldwide growth in our sales. We've strengthened our balance sheet by over $2 million in capital over the past 18 months from a combination of profitable operations, stock option and warrant exercises as shareholder value has increased. We are thankful to our stakeholders for their continued support,\" Mills concluded.
