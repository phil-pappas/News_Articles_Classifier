And the tenacity has allowed him to be a huge entity,\" said Mr. Gelsinger, now chief executive of VMware Inc., a seller of data-center software that Mr. Dell would acquire as part of his proposed $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp.\nAlthough the deal envisions VMware remaining a publicly traded company, it would see closely held Dell Inc. become the largest shareholder, as EMC is today. Both companies will have work hard to maintain VMware's growth rate and achieve a projected $1 billion in annual revenue synergies.\nThat is no small thing. VMware's shares, which changed hands at $91.14 in early August, were hit hard in reaction to the Dell-EMC merger. The stock is off 15%, at $69.31, since a potential deal was first reported last week. The lower share price along with possible disruptions from the change in ownership could affect VMware's ability to retain top talent in the tight Silicon Valley labor market, say analysts.\nVMware investors were spooked on Monday when along with the deal's announcement the company disclosed preliminary third-quarter results, which showed a lower-than-expected 8% increase in bookings. They are also concerned that the merger, which awards EMC shareholders with a VMware tracking stock in addition to cash, will dilute demand for VMware shares.\n\"From an investor perspective, there is going to be a surge of stock that's going to come to the market,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets & Co.\nMr. Gelsinger, 54 years old, said he is relieved to be on firm corporate footing. EMC had sought to sell itself for several years as shareholders also pressed it to spin off VMware amid grim prospects for the Hopkinton, Mass., parent's data-storage business.\nDell, as a favored VMware partner after the merger, is expected to open $1 billion in new opportunities for VMware to sell its virtualization software, which makes computers more efficient by allowing them to run more than one operating system simultaneously. However, VMware can't appear to favor Dell in ways that would hurt its customers that buy servers from Hewlett-Packard Inc. or Lenovo Group Ltd.--Dell's arch rivals--or that could hurt it in the virtualization market, where VMware competes with Microsoft Corp., Red Hat Inc. and a variety of alternatives.\n\"There's a lot of concern about the synergies from the transaction,\" said Brent Thill, an analyst and managing director with brokerage UBS. \"Will Dell really be additive or will it really be a nuisance for VMware?\"\nMr. Gelsinger declined to say how long it would take VMware to realize the projected $1 billion in revenue synergies, but he said much of it would come from selling VMware software to Dell's small and medium-size customers.\nVMware is the biggest vendor for cloud system management software with 21.6% of the $2.3 billion market, according to research firm International Data Corp. It is also the top vendor in the $2 billion data center automation software market with a 24% share, estimates IDC.\nBut market changes could reshape its role. VMware is used in a majority of corporate data centers but risks being left behind as corporate information technology departments move to cloud-computing services such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure, which doesn't use its software.\nIn Mr. Gelsinger's view, the cloud giants don't loom so large. He sees Dell and VMware as arms merchants for other cloud-computing providers.\n\"We already have a growing proposition at many of the cloud vendors. And Dell has many assets. They're selling much of the hardware infrastructure into the cloud providers today,\" he said. \"All of those things just make us bigger and stronger.\"\n 13, 2015 18:16 ET (22:16 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:08:10.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
