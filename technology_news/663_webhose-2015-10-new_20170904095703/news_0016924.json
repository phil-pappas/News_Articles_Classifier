Andrew Meares Share on twitter by David Ramli The federal government's controversial policies on storing phone and internet records as well as blocking internet piracy websites will not be modified, despite the change in Coalition leadership, according to the new Communications Minister Senator Mitch Fifield.\nAs communications minister, the now-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull advocated on the telecommunications industry's behalf when drafting the data retention policy, which will force all telcos to record the metadata of all users.\nThis includes the call records, IP addresses and location data of users that can then be accessed by authorised agencies like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Australian Federal Police.\nBut in a wide-ranging interview Senator Fifield told Fairfax Media there wouldn't be changes in these policies despite Mr Turnbull poking fun at Attorney-General Senator George Brandis' handling of the data retention policy and the dumping of controversial policies in other portfolios like education .\n\"I'm comfortable with the arrangements as they are,\" he said. \"What's changed is that there's now a period that that data needs to be retained because of the changing habits of businesses mean that some of the data that was previously kept for periods isn't necessarily kept.\n\"So there hasn't really been a change in the circumstances in which law enforcement agencies can access data.\"\nMr Fifield also said he was not proposing any changes to or intervention in the ongoing negotiations between copyright owners and telecommunications companies over efforts to fight illegal downloads of movies and music.\nTelcos lodged an industry code with the Australian Communications and Media Authority earlier this year that would create a three-strikes system for alleged internet pirates . Under the scheme users who are caught illegally downloading copyright materials will have their details handed over to the relevant owners who can then lodge court action.\n Labor and the Coalition also teamed up to pass legislation forcing telcos to block some websites being used to facilitated pirated content .\nBut discussions between the parties have bogged down over how much either party must pay to facilitate the process. Movie and music studios claim telcos are partly responsible and should pay but this is rejected by internet providers.\n\"I'm not proposing a change from what has been put forward,\" he said. \"There are a range of commercial matters that are still to be worked out between the rights holders and the internet service providers.\n\"It's best to give time to allow the parties to try and reach agreement amongst themselves.\"\nIntervention being chased Communications Alliance chief executive John Stanton, whose body represents all of Australia's largest phone and internet providers, warned that talks with Hollywood studios were not getting much closer.\n\"We are not chasing government intervention at this point,\" he said. \"But reaching an agreement on cost apportionment is proving somewhat elusive.\"\nMr Stanton also made the point that the data retention legislation was asking for far more information than had ever been required by law enforcement agencies in the past, which in turn would cost a large amount of money to prepare.\n\"The data retention legislation does not enshrine the status quo as government has often claimed,\" he said. \"It requires service providers to retain data they have never retained and typically for periods longer than they have historically retained it.\n\"We are inching towards clarity on how the government's contribution to start-up costs will be apportioned but doing so way too late.\"\nAnother issue facing the new communications minister is the rise of infrastructure competition against the government-owned company building the $56 billion national broadband network.\nTPG Telecom is connecting homes and businesses directly with fibre optic cabling while Vocus Communications is exploring options to do the same following its $3 billion merger with M2 Group.\nThese moves could slash the profitability of the NBN and force the federal government to push the budget even further into deficit.\nThey have continued despite Mr Turnbull introducing new rules forcing network providers to separate their wholesale and retail divisions.\nBut Mr Fifield said the Coalition was \"for competition\" and would not introduce new legislation ahead of schedule to stop NBN's rivals.\n\"We had the intention of trying to simply [the laws] from 2017 and I'm not flagging anything different today,\" he said. \"Competition is a fact of life and â€¦ the main thing is to make sure it happens on a level playing field.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/tpg-found-david-teoh-has-warned-he-will-keep-building-his-nbn-rival-network-20150922-gjs7tr.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-skewers-coalition-colleagues-at-awards-night-20150716-giebdv.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/three-strikes-antipiracy-scheme-launched-in-wake-of-dallas-buyers-club-threat-20150408-1mgjyd.html#comments", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/vocus-to-merge-with-m2-to-create-3-billion-telecommunications-titan-20150927-gjw4jg.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/australian-senate-passes-controversial-antipiracy-websiteblocking-laws-20150622-ghuorh.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:23:58.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
