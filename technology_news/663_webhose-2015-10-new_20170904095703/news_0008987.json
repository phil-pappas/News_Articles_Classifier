The high-speed, multi-feed device represents the premier high-end solution for teller-window document scanning, as well as a competitive entry into the branch back-counter and vault capture market. \nThe TS500 acts as a countertop hub that consolidates multiple types of information capture, including checks and other branch documents, magnetic stripe cards and ID cards, into a single compact device. The network-enable scanner can also allow the connection of other desktop peripherals such as receipt printers, PIN-pads and more. \nThe TS500 ground-up design introduces several new features to make it simpler than ever to operate and maintain. Digital Check’s patented AccuTrac TM Plus feed system automatically aligns checks that are not sitting flat, in order to prevent misfeeds and paper jams, while a first of its kind cleaning system onboard the scanner helps keep the device in top condition with minimal operator intervention. Major design highlights include: Top speed of 200 documents per minute Patent-pending cleaning system Patented AccuTrac TM and AccuTrac TM Plus feed system “Smart” LED diagnostic lights Built-in card/ID scanner with optional magstripe reader Special polymer rollers for longer intervals between cleaning Silent drive belt for lowest noise levels Snap-in, snap-out parts for easy maintenance UV scanning \n“The TS500 scanner is the ideal solution for high-volume scanning applications in bank branches requiring reliable feeding, versatility, ease of operation, and trouble free upkeep,” said Alex Trombetta Digital Check’s Vice President of International Sales. “We are confident that users and channel partners will find it the most performant and user-friendly check scanner we’ve built to date, perfectly complementing our very successful CX30 and TS240 product lines.” \nCustomers of the TellerScan TS500 will have access to Digital Check’s unique API features, including the Best-Read ® intelligent thresholding and Special Documents Handling. The new device is compatible with all Remote Deposit, Teller, and Branch systems that use Digital Check’s API version 15.10 or higher. \nOther benefits of the TellerScan TS500 include a small desktop footprint, as well as 600 dpi cameras for scanning items other than checks in high resolution. An optional thermal transaction printer will be available in late 2015. \nFor more information about the TellerScan TS500, or to view an interactive demo, visit www.digitalcheck.com/tellerscan-ts500 . \nAbout Digital Check \nDigital Check is a worldwide technology leader in providing superior check and document scanner products for teller, branch automation, remote deposit capture, and remote lockbox applications.
