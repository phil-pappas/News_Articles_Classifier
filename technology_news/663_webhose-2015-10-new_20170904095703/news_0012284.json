Other popular masks in the Dynamite app include Kim Kardashian, John Cena, Jesus, and Sloths.\nLINKS TO VIDEOS MADE BY FANS:\nMets Fan Video October 19 Mr Met Video Oct 18 Mr Met Video Oct 19 About Dynamite Labs, Inc.\nDynamite is a free iPhone app, download in the App Store http://apple.co/1W34ky0\nDynamite Labs is on an important mission — to make it easy for everyone to share their personal, provocative, and funny stories on mobile video.
