Prominent downstream applications behind this trend include next-generation sequencing, molecular diagnostics testing, forensics, epigenetics, research on free-circulating nucleic acids, use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, exosome research, and pharmacogenomics. The uptake of these popular applications requiring NAPI on the front-end of the workflow is translating into growth for the market. \nNew analysis from Frost & Sullivan, US Nucleic Acid Purification and Isolation Markets ( http://www.frost.com/sublib/display-report.do?id=NF16-01-00-00-00&src=PR ), finds the market is estimated to reach $811 million in 2021 and is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7 percent. \nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://bit.ly/1MHOzqp . \n\"The overarching life sciences trend of laboratories moving from manual methods to automated workflows continues to drive the use of instruments capable of performing automated NAPI,\" said Frost & Sullivan Healthcare Senior Industry Analyst Christi Bird . \"The mounting installed base of automated NAPI instruments expands sample throughput capabilities and in turn fuels automated kit and reagent sales.\" \nAutomated NAPI technology fits in perfectly with laboratories' demand for more accurate data, desire to eliminate costly errors and need to maintain consistent standards across samples. In addition to boosting reliability and reproducibility, as well as reducing the need for multiple runs to verify results, automated sample preparation frees researchers from the lab bench, allowing them to focus on more important tasks. These benefits are now widely accessible to basic research labs due to the launch of affordable benchtop automated NAPI instruments. \nHowever, in the diversified U.S. NAPI automation market, the flexibility of platforms differs greatly between vendors and instruments. Flexibility is ascertained by considering whether a system is closed or open, modules can be added or not, the types of kits available, number and type of samples able to be processed, sample volume equipped for use, and varieties of chemistries capable of being employed, among other factors. \nMany NAPI instruments lack the needed combination of flexibility and attributes for some potential end-users. Hesitant to invest in an instrument missing the exact specifications, some end-users stick to manual methods where they can choose various vendors, tweak protocols and move freely between sample types. \n\"End-user needs vary tremendously within the NAPI market due to the wide range of laboratory budgets and sample throughputs of the customer base,\" noted Bird. \"While some customers view NAPI instruments as luxuries and have not adopted the technology, others treat automation as a necessity.\" \nGiven this scenario, some suppliers have begun to compete more aggressively on price to gain market share. Nevertheless, a few sub-segments of the reagents market, particularly plasmid purification, have become commoditized, stalling growth. \nUS Nucleic Acid Purification and Isolation Markets is part of the Life Sciences ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/healthcare/life-sciences ) Growth Partnership Service program.
