Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup ï»¿\nUber backs Labor's \"sensible approach\" to the regulation of the sharing economy but Divvy Parking says the industry has evolved beyond these guidelines. The opposition's principles are thin on detail, but show that the Labor Party is taking a \"light-touch\" approach to regulating the sector.\nDivvy chief executive Nick Austin, whose business opening up private car spaces has shifted from a peer-to-peer model to also working with commercial property owners, said the fact that both sides of government still saw the sharing economy as an \"emerging trend\" put regulators on the back foot.\n\"The share economy is already pushing into the next phase and by the time we catch up with regulation, consumers and players in this market will have moved on to the next development,\" he said.\nLabor's principles stated six main points: primary property is the individual's to share, new services must support good wages and working conditions, everyone in the sharing economy must pay tax, sharing economy businesses must have the right insurance, sharing economy services should be accessible to everyone, and there should be no tolerance of a company's breaking the regulations.\nThe announcement from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is another in a string of recent policy announcements targeting start-ups, as both major parties increase their focus on innovation.\nBut not all start-ups were critical of Labor's principles.\nAn Uber spokesperson said Labor was leading the way on devising sharing economy policies.\n \"This is a sensible approach to working with industry to develop appropriate policy and regulatory responses,\" the spokesperson said. \"It is encouraging to see national leadership on this issue, with both the Turnbull government and the opposition putting innovation and technology back on the national agenda.\"\nThe chief executive of listed peer-to-peer marketplaces business Collaborate Corp, Chris Noone, said the Labor Party needed to realise that \"consumer protections were already baked into sharing economy services\" and pushed for a focus on removing ineffective regulation.\n\"We look forward to a level playing field that no longer favours multinationals with sophisticated tax-shifting structure,\" he said.\nAirtasker chief executive Tim Fung said he was keen to hear the Liberal Party's response to Labor's announcement and start measuring the economic contribution of the sharing economy.\n\"Beyond a policy framework, the next step for this trend is to accurately gauge sharing economy growth in Australia,\" he said.\n\"We've taken steps to measure this growth ourselves . . . but we're keen to work with the government and sharing economy organisations to increase the scope of the research and awareness.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:22:39.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
