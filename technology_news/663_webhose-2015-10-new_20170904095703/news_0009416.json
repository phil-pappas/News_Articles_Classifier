FingerCheck360 is among the first solutions to bridge time tracking and payroll processing in one web-based platform, turning internal punch data into payroll data used to process employee payroll at the end of each pay period. The centralized system also includes a variety of automated features, including electronic forms for direct deposit, W-4s, and more, allowing employees to self-onboard. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151023/280153LOGO \n\"This product makes it possible to run all of your essential HR tasks through one system, which is incredible for anyone familiar with the challenges of integrating multiple products,\" says Sal Lemmer, Marketing Director at FingerCheck. \"Business owners are seeking a solution that can help them minimize the day-to-day burdens of employee management so they can concentrate on their business. While many HR platforms provide benefits and payroll, the most immediate needs for the basic, average business person, are time tracking and payroll.\" \nFingerCheck360's model for tracking time and running payroll is simple. Employees can punch in using a biometric time clock , online, via their smartphone with GPS capture, or pick from a variety of other options. Each time employees punch in or out, they automatically enter their own payroll information, which employers can view from any computer or using the mobile app. As the pay period progresses, FingerCheck360 automatically notifies employers of missing punches or errors to ensure inconsistencies are addressed, and employers can tweak and edit as needed. \nAt the close of each pay period, FingerCheck360 automatically calculates total pay and applicable taxes, and notifies employers of the cash required in the bank to pay employees. It even files and deposits state and federal payroll taxes on behalf of the employer. On payday, employees are notified of their pay, and can view their timecard and paystub online or within the mobile app. \n\"FingerCheck360 has employers covered for all their essential needs from clock in to cash out,\" says Lemmer. \"Before looking into offering benefits or health insurance, employers have to first take care of the most vital responsibility to their employees, which is accurately paying them for their time. With FingerCheck360 that promise is guaranteed.\" \nMore information regarding FingerCheck360 is available at FingerCheck360.com . Call 1-800-610-9501 to request a demonstration or free trial.
