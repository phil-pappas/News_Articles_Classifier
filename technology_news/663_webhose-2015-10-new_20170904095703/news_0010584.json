Daxus is portable, stackable and lightweight for standalone or networked data acquisition, offering up to 32 channels per unit and 200k samples/second/channel.\nAstoNova’s national sales manager Jon Lee, noted, “Daxus has a lot of power and capability for a very reasonable price. It also has a 500GB hard drive to save the data, which most boxes of a similar size do not – typically these systems will make the PC store the data. This means the box is more mobile as it can be picked up and carried around.”\nWireless connectivity offers real time data capture via any phone or tablet app. Networking and stacking enables the number of channels to be multiplied for synchronous recording.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:40:08.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
