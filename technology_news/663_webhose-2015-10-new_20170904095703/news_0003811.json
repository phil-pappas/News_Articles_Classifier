Consisting of zig-zagging rows of explosives that ignite consecutively, they fire an unpredictable collection of bangs, candles and stars into the sky, compounding their excitement with the element of surprise.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Darryl Fleming of Titanium Fireworks. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer \nDarryl Fleming, the director and co-founder of Titanium Fireworks , doesn’t generally deal in such simple tomfoolery, having worked as a pyrotechnician at London 2012, the Commonwealth Games and the last three New Year displays in London and Edinburgh. Nevertheless, the basic requirements are similar, he insists, while revealing a professional vocabulary as colourful as his creations: “A good firework display needs structure and variety to keep people interested, whether it be crackles, screeches, hummers, tourbillon spinning effects, bombettes, comets or mines.”\nTitanium’s gigantic “pyromusical” displays rely on computer-controlled ignition systems, timed to within a hundredth of a second. But even a humble, over-the-counter “cake” is a complex system of infinitesimal reactions. Each tube inside the barrage contains a single cardboard cylinder, plugged with clay at one end. As the fuse burns round the barrage, a firing charge ignites at the bottom of each tube, simultaneously ejecting the cylinder and lighting a second “delay fuse”, which goes off when the firework reaches its maximum height. The firework then explodes in mid-air, creating effects according to the design and chemistry of its contents. Different metal salts create colours, magnesium aids brightness, and noise is created by manipulating the gas escaping from the reaction.\n“People are more discerning now,” says Fleming, who has agreed to act as the expert in our fireworks trial. “I’ll be looking for definition, range of effects and hopefully something unique.”\nTaking time off from his intense preparation for the Rugby World Cup closing ceremony (“We have to make sure we don’t cover the pitch in debris”) Fleming surveys the line of seven cakes. “Wear stout boots, and light them at arm’s length with a gloved hand,” he warns. “But the golden rule is: make sure they can’t fall over.”\nThe Beijing Blitz: good value CELTIC– BEIJING BLITZ £7.99. Pocket-sized 36-shot cake. Safe at five metres fireworksshop.uk.com \n“For less than £10, that’s good quality and excellent value. The duration was 30 seconds, which is good for that number of shots and it had a little flurry at the end to give you a finale. There was a good range of colours and I liked the crackle effect every alternate lift. Because it’s small, it’s quite low-level – the larger ones will go a lot higher – but it’s still stunning. An excellent little cake.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Silver Crackling Rain: identical shots PEACOCK - SILVER CRACKLING RAIN \n£23.99. A family-friendly 25-shot cake brilliantfireworks.co.uk \n“There’s a longer tube-length, so the shots went higher than the Beijing Blitz, but otherwise it was very similar in duration and intensity. The limitation is that each shot was identical: a silver tail with a timed rain effect at the end, whereas the Blitz had alternating colours and each one had a crackle in between. But it’s still a good cake for a small back garden.”\nImperial in action: impressive effect BROTHERS PYROTECHNICS – IMPERIAL £25 (sold as part of four-pack) 16 bone-rattling bangs jordansfireworks.co.uk \n“The tube bore size is bigger here, so a larger cardboard casing is ejected which has a larger number of stars and a bigger quantity of bursting charge – what we call a ‘bombette’. This had clearly defined bursts, and I liked the screeches at the end - that’s the sort of thing that goes down well with kids. Fewer shots than the previous two, but they were bigger and higher, with more stars and more payload, which gives an impressive effect.”\nRagin Spiders in action: quite a novelty BRIGHT STAR - RAGING SPIDERS £44.99. Unusual circular cake, with three separate sections newsboxfireworks.co.uk . \n“This is an example of what a good firework display involves: a rotation of sequences. It starts at ground level with a fountain – I didn’t expect that and it was a nice touch. Then it started firing the aerial stuff at about 20 seconds, and then it had a lovely little flourish at the end in which a barrage of fanned mines went spinning off in quick succession - really quite a novelty. I’m not sure if it’s good value for money, but it’s a nice firework with an unusual structure.”\nStar Wars in action: hands down winner! COSMIC - STAR WARS £74.99. Big, heavy 220-shot barrage fireworksmine.co.uk \n“Duration-wise it was nice and long, it probably had the greatest variety of the seven, but what I liked most of all was the intensity – the speed at which the shots are fired and the energy it maintains. The volume is higher than its rivals – very impressive – and it has a solid sequence of whistles, not just one or two. It even had a little false-finale to wrong-foot the audience at the end. In terms of intensity, duration, range and quality of effects, this one wins hands down.”\nThunder Strike in action: long but repetitive ELITE - THUNDER STRIKE £30. 48-shots. Category 3, so keep 25 metres back simiawarehouse.com \n“It was about 1min 20sec long, which is a long duration. Generally that’s good. My criticism, though, is that it didn’t have any great variety. It was basically a unit that went up with a bombette burst in alternating primary colours – that’s it. It would have been nice if, after 20 seconds of that, we’d had some sort of development, even just a whistle, but nothing too exciting happened and it became a bit repetitive.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Accolade: a lot going on KIMBOLTON - ACCOLADE\n\n£59.99. New from prestigious UK company. 150 shots buykimboltonfireworks.com \n“The colours are lovely and bright, and it opens with a nice crossette effect – the stars breaking and splitting into four. Then some bombettes and crackles, not quite as big as what we’ve seen before, but lovely and clear. It’s nearly two minutes long, and I was starting to get a bit bored in the middle, but I certainly liked the clever sequence at the end: a flurry, with a pregnant pause between the effects. On the whole, a pretty good cake, and a lot going on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:43:09.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
