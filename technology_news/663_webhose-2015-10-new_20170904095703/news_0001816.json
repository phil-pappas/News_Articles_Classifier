This technology is being developed in the name of the Explorer project and the grant would fund the project for five years.\nA variety of diseases that includes cancer, are diagnosed and tracked by the widely used technology of positron emission tomography, or PET scans as the scans show how organs and tissues are functioning in the body. This is better than other scan methods like MRI or CT scans that mostly show anatomy.\nThe current scanning technology requires more time and exposes the patient to more radiation because scans are done in 20-centimeter segments are shortcomings of the existing scan technologies and the new research would attempt to address shortcomings.\nTwo fundamental limitations of PET as it exists in the present form would be attempted to be solved by the EXPLORER project.\nThe first attempt is to design a technology that would be able to see and scan the entire body all at once.\nThe second shortcoming that the project would address is the attempt to acquire the images much faster or at a much lower radiation dose which reduces the chances of harm to patients due to the prolonged exposure to radiation.\n Researchers hope that when these two aspects are solved, the end result would create profound implications for how the medical world uses PET scanning in medicine and medical science.\nThe new technology for nuclear imaging would the radiation dose by a factor of 40 or decrease scanning time from 20 minutes to just 30 seconds for the entire body at the same time. The incidence of images blurred by patient movement would also be reduced if the scan can be completed faster.\nDiagnostics , treatment and drug development would be impacted positively by the development of this technology.\nPhysicians could diagnose a disease with the whole-body PET and would then follow its trajectory in a way never before possible. This would change the way patients are treated. Development of systems-based treatments and more individualized care would be possible after the successful development of the technology and change the present trend.\nFor More Market Research Reports on Medical Imaging Market visit\nhttps://literated.com/industry/Medical-Imaging\nAbout Literated.com\nLiterated.com is a one stop market research and e-commerce platform catering to the needs of businesses and knowledge workers who are dependent on market research information for their work.\nVisit https://literated.com for more info.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nSachidanand Bhat\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
