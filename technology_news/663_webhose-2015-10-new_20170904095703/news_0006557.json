HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.—Santinelli International is introducing the Lex-1200 Lens Edger and Ice-1200 Blocker, two new finishing machines that incorporate functions that enable ECPs to process the latest lens and frame designs. At the heart of the two units is an advanced high-curve tracer, featuring a unique mechanical design which includes a variable fulcrum stylus, keeping its axis-angle perpendicular to any frame curve. The new tracer reduces stylus-pressure by 50 percent, thereby eliminating the potential for distortion on even the thinnest, most flexible frames, according to Santinelli. The Lex-1200 edger’s “2.0 software” boasts a faster processing speed than the previous version and offers multiple custom bevel pre-sets. New to this model series is a controlled high-curve bevel function which produces an asymmetrical lens bevel profile, permitting the lens to be perfectly fitted into such shaped sport frames. Additional functions include highly-specialized semi-step bevel which allow insertion of lenses into “non-Rx-able” eyewear. Operators will appreciate the all-new custom auto mode, an extremely user-friendly, one-step operation delivering a tailored mini-bevel which is ideal for thin metal eyewire with a perfectly matched frame-based profile (i.e.: RayBan frames). For those seeking to drill in-house, the edger interfaces seamlessly with the optional LexDrill “side car” unit, which can process complex drilling jobs automatically. The Ice-1200 blocker incorporates a multi-colored touchscreen with new, intuitive graphics for seamless operation. The unit also features an advantageous Auto Lens Meter (ALM) function with an easy-to-identify cross-hair target for spot-on accuracy. Santinelli’s Integrated Shape Imager (ISI) facilitates drill data capture and has been revised to include partial step lens measurements of “suspension-lens” style sport frames. The newly redesigned lens stage is highly adjustable accommodating any lens blank size, shape or type, all while keeping the front of the lens parallel to the blocking arm. The integrated lens clamp gently stabilizes the lens prior to blocking, eliminating any potential lens-shift. The blocker’s software has the ability to read QR codes which contain EMR data from linked diagnostic equipment, eliminating the need for redundant job data entry and thereby streamlining the entire blocking operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:46:39.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
