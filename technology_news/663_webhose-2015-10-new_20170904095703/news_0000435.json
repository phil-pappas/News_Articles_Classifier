Sligro is a B2B wholesale company for food professionals in the Benelux. Instead of sending mass mailings, Sligro banks on a targeted, individualized customer communications program via all on- and offline channels. This requires a different, data-driven approach. To put that into practice, ten years of customer data will be loaded into and managed by the Teradata database. In addition, Sligro will use Teradata's Omni-Channel Marketing Solution to analyze customer data, segment target groups, and generate real-time multi-channel dialogues over online and offline channels, to drive increased customer retention. This will enable Sligro's marketers to base their activity on known or predicted customer behavior. Maurice van Veghel , CIO Sligro Food Group, said, \"We have been looking at various leading vendors in the pre-selection. Teradata has proven to provide a stable, scalable infrastructure and state-of-the-art software that fits our new Sligro philosophy.\" Frank Beerlage, managing director, Teradata Benelux, added, \"Sligro is a very customer-centric company that recognizes the value of data-driven, individualized marketing. We are proud they have selected us to contribute to their success.\" About Teradata Teradata (NYSE: TDC ) helps companies get more value from data than any other company.
