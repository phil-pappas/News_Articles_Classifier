Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra, Singtel-Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia have all improved their mobile networks over the past 12 months as they spend billions of dollars to win over customers.\nOptus and Vodafone Australia both pledged to spend huge sums of money expanding and improving their mobile services to bring the fight to Telstra. The telecommunications incumbent fought back, pledging to invest $5 billion in the three years ending mid-2017 to maintain its lead .\nBut far from being hot air, the second annual P3 CommsDay Mobile Benchmark Australia report released on Wednesday morning shows that all three have genuinely put their money where their mouths are to improve voice call and data download performances.\nThe mobile market is one of the few telecommunications segments still reporting revenue growth as Australians use their smartphones to download more data. Rising competition among the three largest providers is threatening to lower profit margins across the board.\nThe benchmark tested mobile performances using specialised equipment and vehicles that travelled along a route that represents 70 per cent of the Australian population, along with some rural and regional locations.\nTelstra remained the dominant provider with an overall score of 84.6 per cent. Of all the various mobile issues tested, it recorded a lower score only in web browsing on highways and YouTube watching.\nBut Optus narrowed the gap and scored a 78 per cent mark, while Vodafone Australia achieved 72 per cent.\nVodafone biggest improver Vodafone Australia was the biggest improver with this year's score 40 per cent higher than last year's performance. However, its lack of regional coverage was made painfully clear.\nWhere Telstra scored 86.6 per cent in small cites and towns testing and Optus got 70 per cent, Vodafone Australia barely passed, with 51 per cent of the maximum potential points.\nVodafone Australia has promised to improve this score in part by building more towers in the bush as part of the federal government's mobile black spots project .\nIt also recently signed a deal with TPG Telecom to connect two-thirds of its mobile base stations with fibre optic cabling .\nOptus trailed its rivals in some urban mobile broadband speed tests. Its average peak upload speed was 9.5 megabits per second, compared with Telstra's 18.6 Mbps and Vodafone Australia's 19.9 Mbps.\nBut it recorded an average peak download speed of 38.3 Mbps compared with Telstra's 46.4 Mbps and Vodafone Australia's 31.7 Mbps. Optus chief executive Allen Lew had previously said it would spend $S1.9 billion ($1.88 billion) on capital expenditure over the next 12 months to further improve the network .\n\"The operators' respective network investments have really pulled through into clear improvements in this year's results,\" the P3 CommsDay report said. \"They're all pushing ahead with even more upgrades and enhancements - and have all committed to the capital expenditure they'll need to stay at the forefront of mobile technology.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-to-spend-5-billion-in-mobile-war-with-optus-20150706-gi5uq7.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/vodafone-hutchison-australia-announces-1-billion-15year-deal-with-tpg-telecom-20150929-gjxqa0.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mobile-towers-to-get-a-good-reception-from-rural-towns-20150624-ghwmlv.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:23:31.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
