In a franchise first, there are two lead characters. \n\"It's been an exciting journey combining the expansive universe of 'Assassin's Creed' with an engaging and pivotal moment in time,\" said game creative director Marc-Alexis Cote. \n\"Our London is a character, representing both the fantastic lives lived by the wealthy and the dreadful suffering among the poor.\" \nHardcore parkour \nPlayers can switch at any time from playing as smart and stealthy Evie Frye to her brash, confrontation-prone brother, Jacob. \nLead characters played in the preceding Assassin's games by French game developer Ubisoft were men. \n\"Assassin's Creed\" protagonists have included a Renaissance Italian, a 12th-Century Syrian, a pirate, and a Native American during the colonial period. Videogamers play on an alpha version of French video game developer Ubisoft's last installment of \"Assassin's Creed\", titled \"Assassin's Creed Syndicate\", during the Madrid Games Week 2015 in Madrid on October 1, 2015 \n\"Syndicate\" holds true to franchise trademarks including a variety of historically apt weapons and the ability to parkour over just about anything in a wide-open world. \nThe Frye twins harness the power of gangs to help wrest London from the grip of the assassins' arch-nemesis, the Templars. \nDuring play, they also encounter the likes of Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell, and Charles Darwin. \nTop-seller globally \nInitially launched in 2007, \"Assassin's Creed\" has sold more than 90 million units worldwide, making it one of the top-selling video game lines worldwide. \nIt is Ubisoft's most popular franchise, with a new installment released each year. \n\"Assassin's Creed\" is an powerhouse franchise with a large following. \nAdmittedly, putting out a new version of the game each year stretches the overarching storyline, which features modern-day descendants of assassins whose genetic memory is being mined to solve a bigger mystery. \nBlockbuster video game sequels, like movies, face the challenge of adding new excitement while remaining true to old aspects loved by fans. \n\"Assassin's Creed\" has been credited with inspiring other games, such as \"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,\" released last year by Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment. \nThe franchise has grown to include novels, comic books, mobile games and films. \n\"Assassin's Creed: Syndicate\" is tailored for play on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 or personal computers powered by Windows software and was priced at $60.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:37:09.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
