Seventy-nine Tanque Verde High School students’ final course grades did not match the grades and supporting documents of the online course provider, said Claire Place, the district’s spokeswoman. Those students were enrolled in online courses between summer 2013 and spring 2015 and are currently enrolled at the school. The district is not reviewing the records of students who have graduated or are not enrolled in the district. “They have their diplomas,” she said. “We don’t feel that it would be of benefit to them to go back.” A teacher associated with the discrepancies has been identified, she said. The teacher resigned at the beginning of the school year, and a report was filed last week with the state Board of Education.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:45.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
