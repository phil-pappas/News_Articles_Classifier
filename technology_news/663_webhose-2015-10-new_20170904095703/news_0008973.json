We have walking distance access to researchers along with a direct relationship with a lot of the surgeons that implant at Macquarie Private hospital.”\nResearch collaborations\nPart of the key to Rodrigues’ optimism is the relationship to academic institutions, one of the key parts to the successes of other technology clusters. “Macquarie University is a fantastic university,” Rodrigues says.\nRodrigues’ role at Cochlear is to manage the software development of the companies products, “I look at where we want to be from a software and firmware point of view.” Part of his role was to develop Cochlear Link, a cloud platform to help doctors managing their patients’ hearing devices.\nBeing a cloud application managing medical devices, Cochlear Link had to pass some important tests. “Foremost it has to be safe.” States Mr Rodrigues, “but we also want to make products that delight our users. While hearing restoration in the form of an implantable device is something that is our core, on the periphery and in the products we build around them are just as important.”\nPushing the use cases\nThose periphery applications and devices are key to the next generation of implants, Rodrigues believes and describes how in the future we may see medical products communicating to enhance patient welfare and aged care.\nOne example he cites is how with accelerometers now built into many devices it’s now possible to monitor whether someone has had a serious fall through their smart phone, fitness band or in the future a hearing implant. This could allow frail elderly people to remain in their own homes and out of expensive aged care until much later in life, for instance.\nWhen asked about the attitude of regulators to these development or the cloud applications currently being released ,Rodrigues was upbeat. “They haven’t said no.”\n“One thing regulators always look for is that you’re doing the right things, that you’re following the process, you’re following their regulations and you’re validating those systems to make sure they are safe, effective and do what you say they can do.” He states, “as long as you can show you are doing the right things, regulators don’t have a problem. They are quite open.”\nWorking together to build the mix\nCollaboration and openness are the keys to the success of companies like Cochlear and technology centres like Macquarie University’s Australian Hearing Hub. One of the most exciting parts in Rodrigues’ view are the companies the researchers, health professionals and businesses working together.\nWith the easily availability of cloud services and increasingly ubiquitous and affordable wireless and broadband internet, it’s not only easier to start a business but it’s increasingly easier\nThe main factor however remains people which has been the key to developing the Hearing Hub, “that was a vision of a few people including Chris Roberts our former CEO.” Rodrigues says. “I think it’s working fantastically well.”\nWhile tax breaks and subsidies may prove to be part of the way for Australia to rebuild its technological and entrepreneurial capacities, getting people from industry, academia and the investment community to build on existing strengths may well prove to be the best way to get the nation competing globally once more.\nPaul Wallbank travelled to Las Vegas as a guest of Amazon Web Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:02:18.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
