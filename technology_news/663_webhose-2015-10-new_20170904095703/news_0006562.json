The use of new copper to forge this is link is not surprising and Mr Morrow said that so far NBN Co has not had to replace the copper between the nodes and premises.\nHe added that the condition of Telstra’s existing copper is relatively robust but acknowledged that it’s still too early to make any conclusive assessment.\nFTTN technology was launched last month and with 5100 premises currently ready to receive a service, Mr Morrow said that there were currently 58 paying FTTN customers. As of October 8, 2015 there are 619,861 premises active across the entire NBN.\nIt’s still early days for FTTN and with 1400 nodes in action NBN Co is yet to install the multitude of nodes needed for a successful rollout. As the footprint expands NBN Co will need extra copper to connect the nodes to the pillars and there is a chance that some of it may be required to remediate the parts of the copper network that connect homes to the NBN nodes.\nThe senate estimates hearing last night was witness to some heated exchanges, especially between former Labor communications minister Senator Stephen Conroy and Mr Morrow.\nSenator Conroy’s efforts to table a version of the three-year rollout roadmap issued to the retail service providers led to a significant kerfuffle during the hearings, with NBN Co objecting strongly to the release of the information.\nAccording to Mr Conroy, the roadmap, highlighting estimated ready-for-service dates for different suburbs, presented to the RSPs pointed to significant delays between when the network will be rolled out in an area and when it would be made available to end users.\nMr Morrow said the confidential document was designed to streamline the build process and given the natural delay between when construction in an area translates to real service, a public release of official dates could lead to customer confusion.\nMr Conroy was also highly critical about Mr Morrow's past corporate history.\n\"People died last time you were in charge of something,\" he shouted at the CEO during a discussion about the rollout on the NSW Central Coast.\nMr Morrow previously oversaw an American company, which later had two of its pipelines explode, killing nine people.\nCommittee chair Linda Reynolds described the remark as unparliamentary, inflammatory and highly insulting, and asked Senator Conroy to apologise.\nHe initially refused, but did so after a short private meeting between committee members.\nMr Morrow also agreed to apologise to Labor's Deborah O'Neill, who had been asking questions about her region at the time.\n\"I withdraw. I would never speak down to a senator,\" he said.\nDuring the hearing Palmer United senator Zhenya Wang made a pitch to Mr Morrow to use more Australian companies and minds in deploying satellite technology.\nBut the CEO conceded the country doesn't have the expertise and experience that companies in the US do.\nHe nominated a company in California which has been building satellites for space exploration.\nSenator Wang replied it would be good to start somewhere.\n\"Maybe one day we can be launching satellites ourselves,\" he said.\nMr Morrow agreed, saying: \"I would hope so. Let's keep that ambition senator.\"\nOn October 1, NBN launched the first of two satellites - Sky Muster - with Australians in rural and regional areas to benefit in the first half of next year.\nWith AAP\nBill Morrow 2 NO ARCHIVING.jpg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:04:06.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
