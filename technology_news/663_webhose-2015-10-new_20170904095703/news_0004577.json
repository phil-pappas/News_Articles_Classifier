Integrated with Relativity, MultiMatter Management reduces the time, risk, and cost of document review by giving in-house counsel the ability to reuse work product across multiple matters. Organizations can now easily and defensibly reuse coding decisions, spot and manage coding inconsistencies, and minimize the risk of inadvertent production of privileged or protected content across all of their hosted matters.\n“The LDiscovery Companies are driven by our commitment to innovation and the use of technology to help clients improve quality and reduce costs at every stage of the eDiscovery process,” said Chris Weiler, CEO of LDiscovery. “MultiMatter Management was designed so corporations no longer have to pay to review the same documents from the same custodians in multiple matters. We are honored to be recognized by kCura for this solution.”\nkCura, developers of the e-discovery software Relativity, will recognize finalists and announce winners during a special ceremony at Relativity Fest, held October 11-14 in Chicago. This year, the annual user conference brings nearly 1,500 users together for a three-day event featuring engaging panel discussions, hands-on labs, breakout sessions, and insights from both kCura staff and Relativity end users.\nThe Relativity Innovation Awards celebrate and showcase the best custom solutions created by the Relativity community. Judges selected solutions that use various application integration points to display a full use of the Relativity APIs’ capabilities to streamline processes, solve complex workflow needs, and create an altogether new solution that positively impacts their business strategy.\n“We’re excited to honor LDiscovery as an Innovation Awards finalist,” said Andrew Sieja, president and CEO of kCura. “They’re building on Relativity to solve a huge litigation pain point for corporate customers—letting them reuse work product and maintain consistent coding decisions across matters.”\nRenewData, an LDiscovery Company, was also a finalist for the award in 2014 for its Language-Based Analytics review accelerator, Vestigate®.\nAbout LDiscovery\nEstablished in 2005 and headquartered in McLean, VA, LDiscovery provides a full range of legal and technology consulting services to law firms, corporations and government agencies.
