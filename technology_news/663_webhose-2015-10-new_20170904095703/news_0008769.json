AP Share on twitter by John Davidson Michael Dell has promised to explain exactly why he thought it would be a good idea for his company to spend $US67 billion purchasing the storage company EMC.\nSpeaking to the press here at Dell's annual user conference, the founder and now 75-per-cent owner of Dell Inc said he would lay out his reasoning for buying EMC, in depth, at a keynote address scheduled for Wednesday morning, Texas time.\nOn October 12, Dell Inc announced it would purchase EMC for $US67 billion, the largest technology acquisition in history.\nBut the acquisition, which is not expected to be completed until mid 2016, has met with criticism from some competitors and analysts, who have questioned whether Dell's expertise in supply chain management will be sufficient to cut EMC's costs enough to reverse a slowdown in EMC's storage sales, and whether Dell can even afford the interest on the roughly $US50 billion it will be borrowing to finance the deal.\n\"To pay back the interest on the $US50 billion of debt that the new combined company will have on their balance sheet, Dell will need to pay roughly $US2.5 billion a year in interest alone. That's $US2.5 billion that they will allocate away from R&D and other business critical activities, which will keep them from better serving their customers,\" HP boss Meg Whitman wrote in an email to her staff at the time of the Dell/EMC announcement.\n\"This will be a massive undertaking and an enormous distraction for employees and their management team as two very different cultures come together, leadership teams shift and an entirely new strategy is developed,\" she continued.\nHere at Dell World, Michael Dell responded by saying that Ms Whitman had her facts wrong, and by promising to go into the minutiae of the thinking that went behind the deal.\n\"This week I get explain what I'll call 'Version 1.0 of the Unifying Theory of the Universe'. We'll have Version 2.0 when the transaction closes, so you have that to look forward to.\n \"We have spent some time thinking about all of this and I think you'll get a very good sense of, strategically, where we're heading as a company, how we can deliver tremendous benefit to our customers, what it all means and how incredibly well positioned the new combined company will be,\" Mr Dell said.\nBut he gave some hints of that thinking, saying that being attached to a large PC company such as Dell would help EMC's business - \"When you look at this industry, the companies that have succeeded in the datacentre space have been attached to large PC businesses. Volumes really matter\", he said - and that customers would rather deal with fewer, larger suppliers.\nUltimately, though, we'll have to wait for a fuller explanation. \"This is complicated it doesn't lend itself to sound bites,\" he said.\nJohn Davidson is attending Dell World in Austin, Texas as a guest of Dell.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:23:25.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
