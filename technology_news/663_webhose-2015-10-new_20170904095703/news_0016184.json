They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the ‘Tesla Graveyard’. \n“If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple . I’m not kidding.”\nMusk, whose company last week unveiled the Model X, its first SUV , was speaking to German newspaper Handelsblatt . When asked whether or not he took Apple seriously as a competitor in the automotive market, Musk replied, laughing: “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?”\nHe added: “No, seriously: it’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You can’t just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: ‘Build me a car.’\n“But for Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation. A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough.”\nApple’s project to create its own self-driving car is fast becoming one of the worst-kept secrets in Silicon Valley. Although the company has never confirmed that it is working on a vehicle, documents uncovered by the Guardian in August showed that it was seeking space to test its cars in private , looking to secure a 2,100 acre former naval base near San Francisco for that purpose. In September, the company met with California officials to review the state’s autonomous vehicle regulations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:29:54.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
