He added it to his shopping cart and, to his surprise, the transaction went through.\n“I used to work at Google so I keep messing around with the product. I type in Google.com and to my surprise it showed it as available,” Ved told Business Insider . “I thought it was some error, but I could actually complete check out.”\nSanmay Ved’s ownership of Google.com lasted a mere minute. The company quickly emailed to say it had cancelled the order and Ved was refunded. Photograph: Sanmay Ved/LinkedIn Instead of receiving the normal confirmation emails from the company, Ved’s inbox and Google Webmaster Tools (also known as Google Search Console) was updated with sensitive information intended for the original owners of the domain – the webmasters of Google.\nVed’s ownership of Google.com lasted a mere minute. The company quickly emailed him to say it had cancelled the order because someone had registered the site before he could. Ved was refunded the $12 that had already been charged.\n“So for one minute I had access,” Ved said. “At least I can now say I’m the man who owned Google.com for a minute.”\nIt is unclear what happened to allow Ved to purchase the site. It could have been a bug in Google Domains or the company simply failed to renew its domain name when the time came.\nVed said he has reported the breach to Google’s security team, who are looking into the incident. “The scary part was I had access to the webmaster controls for a minute,” he said.\nA Google representative said the firm was looking into the issue, but had not noticed anything unusual.\nThe incident echoes a mishap by Microsoft in 2003, when it forgot to renew the well-known Hotmail.co.uk domain in time. The domain name was bought by a member of the public who immediately contacted Microsoft and arranged to hand it over.", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/2/1443791702080/98ddab31-55dd-455d-aa7b-5db9ce354ce3-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7b06c60ffcf40471cc9f83815f0aaca0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/2/1443791702080/98ddab31-55dd-455d-aa7b-5db9ce354ce3-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e1c49b84a02795aed105064707e2016f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/2/1443791702080/98ddab31-55dd-455d-aa7b-5db9ce354ce3-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f11734816a8e967442de041ad357f191", "http://www.techinsider.io/this-guy-bought-googlecom-from-google-for-one-minute-2015-9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/2/1443791702080/98ddab31-55dd-455d-aa7b-5db9ce354ce3-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=190d69aad141b23a898a48855a43f730", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/2/1443791702080/98ddab31-55dd-455d-aa7b-5db9ce354ce3-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=bc1549c13755ba7e91227da9484195b6"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:45:05.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
