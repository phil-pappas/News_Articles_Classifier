The CME trades several types of financial instruments including futures on interest rates, equity indexes, currencies, and commodities. \n“We continuously monitor and improve our performance in order to lead the latency race in pure FPGA market data processing,” said NovaSparks CEO, Luc Burgun. “Our feed handlers continue to provide exceptional speed and determinism while offering a rich set of features, which are usually found only in software solutions. By using NovaTick, banks and trading firms do not have to sacrifice speed for functionality or vice-versa.” \nNovaTick typically provides sub-microsecond processing time for major equity and futures feeds around the world, reaching an average of 750 nanoseconds (ns) on the CME, measured wire-to-wire. This is one to two orders of magnitude faster than traditional software solutions. NovaSparks was able to cut the overall latency by increasing the parallelism of the internal processing architecture and by reducing the Ethernet interface latency. All upcoming level-based market feed handlers will incorporate these enhancements. \nNovaTick supports four times the number of instruments and five times the input/output bandwidth compared to its predecessor. NovaTick’s pure FPGA matrix architecture is augmented with tightly integrated multi-core Intel processors to perform non-latency sensitive tasks such as exchange recovery functions. NovaSparks’ ticker plants all have a common output format across markets, consumed with a single application-programming interface (API), which allows for easy integration in any trading environment. \nAbout NovaSparks, Inc. \nNovaSparks is the leader in FPGA-based high performance and ultra-low latency market data solutions for the financial industry. NovaSparks unique FPGA centric approach delivers sub microsecond processing latency including book building, even during market peak periods. Available for over 38 feeds among the major Equity, Futures and Options venues across North America, Europe and Asia, the feed handlers are packaged in ‘easy-to-deploy’ appliances offering an extensive fan-out capability for market data distribution. Founded in 2008 and backed by well-established investors, NovaSparks’ offices are located in Paris, France and New York, USA.
