( ADS ) is pleased to announce that with almost one million ICD-10 claims submitted by its clients since October 1, their 99% success rate on first attempt clearinghouse claims prior to ICD-10 essentially remains constant, post-ICD-10. \nThis applies to ADS clients who use their Medics systems directly either as cloud / ASP or in client server format, and for those using ADS' MedicsRCM services. \nDavid Barzillai , President of ADS, said, \"ADS was ready for ICD-10 from its first deadline date of October, 2013. Now that ICD-10 is here, it has basically shown itself to be a non-event for our clients, which is excellent. \"This has no doubt been helped by the educational tools made available to our clients including webinars, videos, and live support on using their Medics systems for ICD-10, and by our systems' own built-in ICD-10 coding tools. We fully expect calendar year 2015 to end the same way for our clients as did 2014: with no less than a 99% success rate on their first attempt clearinghouse claims,\" Mr. Barzillai added. \nContact ADS at 800-899-4237 or by emailing info@adsc.com for more information on its ICD-10 compliant systems which include interesting capabilities designed to empower practices to obtain every dollar for every patient and service.
