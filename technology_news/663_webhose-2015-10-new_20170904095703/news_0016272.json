Since 2010, the EPA has required contractors whose work disturbs lead paint be trained and certified in proper safety techniques. \n“Of course do-it-yourself projects present the same dangers, so handy homeowners should be following best practices, too,” Hicks said. “This isn’t rocket science. It’s smart, common sense actions that anyone can do – and all of us who deal with older homes should want to do.” \nAngie’s List, an e-commerce marketplace and consumer review site, is helping share an EPA-sponsored outreach program to alert homeowners and remind professionals about lead paint. The materials and other outreach materials are available on Angie’s List and the EPA websites . The company will alert members to the initiative this week. Hicks will also discuss lead paint in one of her weekly local television news segments, which air this month. \nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said that her agency takes its mission to protect human health and the environment seriously and appreciates the opportunity to partner with citizens and corporations. \n“We’ve been working to make the country’s air, land and water safe for 45 years, but we can’t do that alone,” McCarthy said. “Angie’s List is setting a great example of leadership and consumer advocacy, and we’re thrilled to expand our lead safety outreach to their members and the companies they review.” \nHealth experts estimate about 500,000 U.S. children ages 1 to 5 have elevated lead levels in their blood. Older homes are considered to be the most hazardous source of lead for U.S. children. \nEven low levels of lead in the blood of children can result in behavior and learning problems, lower IQ and hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing problems, nervous system, kidney, hearing or other damage. Children age six and younger are at special risk because they lack the developed blood-brain barrier that protects older children and adults from more severe effects. \nAngie's List helps facilitate happy transactions between more than three million consumers nationwide and its collection of highly rated service providers in 720 categories of service, ranging from home improvement to health care . Built on a foundation of authentic reviews of local service, Angie's List connects consumers directly to its online marketplace of services from member-reviewed providers, and offers unique tools and support designed to improve the local service experience for both consumers and service professionals.
