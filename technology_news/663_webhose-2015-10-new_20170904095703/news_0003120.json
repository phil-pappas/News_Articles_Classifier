Image 13 of 13 Twitter purging up to 336 workers as new CEO slashes costs 1 / 13 Back to Gallery SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Twitter is laying off up to 336 employees, signaling CEO Jack Dorsey 's resolve to slash costs while the company struggles to make money. The cutbacks announced Tuesday could equate to about 8 percent of Twitter's workforce of 4,100 people. The purge comes two weeks after Twitter brought back one of its co-founders as permanent CEO in hopes that Dorsey would be able to resolve problems that have slowed user growth at the messaging service and compounded an uninterrupted cycle of financial losses. Cutting costs can boost profits but at Twitter, it has also raised uncertainty about the future and the company's desire for aggressive growth and the larger audience it has sought for so long.
