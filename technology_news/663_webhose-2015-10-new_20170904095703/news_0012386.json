Whether it’s automotive, communications, computing, medical, or military / aerospace applications, consumers and engineers alike are all looking for solutions that are smaller, yet more efficient, and outfitted with additional features beyond what was provided in the past.To address these demands, On Semiconductor has developed a portfolio of products called Compact Power Solutions, specially designed to address these challenges via high power density devices like Gallium Nitride Transistors and Trench Schottky Rectifiers, and devices that offer a high-level of integration, like Compact IPMs and PIMs.Read on for a better understanding: 600 V Gallium Nitride Cascode Transistors Main Features: • Pb, Halogen, and BFR Free• RoHS Compliant600 V GaN Cascode Transistors by On Semiconductor provides stellar performance in applications where power density and efficiency matter. Specifically, the NTP8G202N and NTP8G206N are designed to target compact power supplies and adapters ranging from 200W to 1000W, with typical on-resistances of 290 and 150 mΩ. Worth pointing out, the Gallium Nitride Technology featured in these transistors enables extremely fast switching which, in turn, helps reduce the size of passive components needed within a power supply. The 600 V GaN Cascode Transistors are available in optimized TO-220 packaging, a conscious decision on the part of On Semiconductor, as it provides the engineer with simplified integration for in-place manufacturing processes. Trench Schottky Rectifiers • Fast switching with exceptional temperature stability• Low power loss and lower operating temperature• Higher efficiency for achieving regulatory compliance• Low thermal resistance• High surge capability• Compact SO-8FL and SOD123-FL packagesBy making use of new low-forward voltage trench-based Schottky technology, On Seminconductor’s Trench Schottky Rectifiers enable low-forward voltage drop without the typical high-reverse leakage tradeoff that engineers experience when using planar schottky rectifiers. Along with several small package options, this platform also provides extremely stable switching characteristics over a wide temperature range, making it the perfect output rectifier for switching power supplies. Compact Intelligent Power Modules (IPMs) Main Features: • Reduces PCB space and peripheral components required • Under-voltage lockout for all channels• Upper/lower On prevention circuit• Over-current protection circuit• Thermistor for case temperature monitoringBoth the The STK5Q4U352J-E and STK5Q4U362J-E are outfitted with several components, including a HVIC, IGBTs, capacitors, resistors, diodes, and a thermistor, all in a compact DIP package so as to cover all the key functionality needed for high voltage 3-phase motor drive designs.What’s more, these compact intelligent power modules come with an internal bootstrap circuit for high-side gate drive. And their output stage employs sophisticated IGBT/FRD technology to elevate overall performance. Power Integrated Modules (PIMs) • Integrated high-performance IGBTs and rugged anti-parallel diodes• High power density• Short circuit capability• Q0PACK package with press-fit pinsLeveraging ON Semiconductor’s proprietary Trench Field Stop II technology along with ultrafast recovery diodes, the company’s NXH80T120L2Q0PG PIM module is configured in 1200V, 80A half-bridge and 600V, 50A neutral point clamp T-type topology, and feature efficiencies in excess of 98%. Additionally, the configurable package platform uses high-power direct-bonded-copper (DBC) substrate technology along with exclusive press-fit pins to provide the engineer with a superior performing, highly reliable power module solution. \nLearn more about ON Semiconductor Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:45:13.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
