The research differentiated the new Eastern Santa Cruz tortoise, given the scientific name Chelonoidis donfaustoi, from a larger population of about 2,000 tortoises living about 10 kilometres (6 miles) away on the western part of the island that belong to the species Chelonoidis porteri. (Washington Tapia) \n\"Its closest relative is not the species on the same island but a species from the neighboring island to the east, San Cristobal,\" Yale University evolutionary biologist Adalgisa Caccone said. \nThe researchers used two types of genetic data to determine that it merited being recognized as a separate species, bringing to 15 the number of Galapagos giant tortoise species. \nIn addition to genetic differences, the two Santa Cruz Island species also differ in the shape of their shell, with the Eastern Santa Cruz tortoise having one with a more compressed shape, Caccone said. The newly identified species lives in a drier part of the island, Caccone added. \nGiant tortoises, which can reach some 225 kilograms (500 pounds) are among the famous creatures of the Galapagos Islands closely studied by 19th century British naturalist Charles Darwin. \n\"It is part of the process of understanding the evolutionary history of this iconic group that inspired Charles Darwin when he visited the islands and certainly contributed to the development of his theory of evolution via natural selection,\" Caccone said. \nThe Galapagos Islands are one of only two locales inhabited by giant tortoises, along with the Indian Ocean's Aldabra Atoll. Galapagos tortoises graze on grasses, leaves, cactus and fruit but can survive up to a year without food or water. \nThe tortoises, classified as endangered, were hunted almost to oblivion by sailors who stashed them in the holds of ships as food during lengthy sea voyages. \nThe new species' scientific name honors a recently retired National Galapagos Park ranger named Fausto Llerena Sanchez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:09:32.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
