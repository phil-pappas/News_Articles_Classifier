In July, Microsoft reported that Surface revenue had increased 117 per cent to $US888m year-on-year, driven by Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3 sales.\nNow Microsoft has released its fourth-generation Surface Pro, along with a new device, Surface Book. It has been hailed as Microsoft’s first laptop but it’s ­really another tablet computer with a detachable keyboard, a four-in-one, with some quirky features.\nThe most notable feature is the dedicated graphics processing unit, an nVidia GeForce GPU, housed inside the keyboard.

The Surface Book keyboard also contains the device’s two USB3.0 ports, a glass trackpad, and boasts a high resolution display and fast processor.\nSurface Book is moderately priced in the US. An Intel Core i5 model with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage costs $US1499, but in Australia, with our lousy exchange rate, it will start at $2299, and the base model doesn’t have a dedicated GPU. That makes Surface Book expensive especially when the likes of Acer and Asus are selling detachable computers with Core i5 processors for under $1000.\nWith the tablet market generally in decline, large-screen tablets with detachable keyboards are shaping up as the next form factor of choice. No wonder both Apple, with its iPad Pro, and Microsoft, with the Surface Book, are migrating where growth is.

Last week at the company’s headquarters in Seattle, Tim O’Brien, Microsoft general manager, global communications, said devices were a big part of the Microsoft experience.\nA market with about 300 million Windows machines sold per year and a Windows install base of 1.2 billion, with a three to four-year refresh cycle, isn’t an opportunity to be passed up, even if the PC market is in decline.\nBut tech research firm Telsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said Microsoft risks inflaming tensions with the OEMs — the manufacturers that install Windows on their own devices.\n“We think there will be increased tension between Microsoft and its OEMs,” Fadaghi says.\n“Clearly it (Surface) is PC hardware and Microsoft is going after the PC market at a time it’s going into decline.” Microsoft's Tim O'Brien briefs journalists at the company's HQ in Seattle. Photo:Microsoft Source: Supplied\nFadaghi adds that it’s not just sales that is motivating Microsoft to make Surface devices. “The sceptic in me says it has to do with Apple, to be seen to be producing beautiful products with strong design. So the overall prestige of the organisation might be a factor. They want to have a hero product to showcase their innovation.”\nIf the Surface brand continues to gain acceptance, Fadaghi says he “wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft released a Surface phone in the future”.\nThe software giant has been exhibiting new lateral thinking in its activities externally and internally, such as its partnership with Apple to ready Office for iPad Pro, and its building of a launcher for Google’s Android operating system. It is all part of the big shift in internal culture ushered in by new chief executive Satya Nadella.
