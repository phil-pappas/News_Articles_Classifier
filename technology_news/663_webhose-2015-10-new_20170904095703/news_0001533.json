Yoni Heisler Fox News Email a friend \nFACEBOOK has revealed its new multi-pronged plan for online video domination. \nWhile YouTube remains the current and undisputed king of online video, the ubiquitous social network is making a number of important moves that should have folks at Google just a tad bit worried. \nBut first, it might be helpful to quickly recap what Facebook has been up to video-wise over the last few months. \nIn addition to rolling out support for interactive 360 degree videos last month, Facebook recently began testing a new feature called “Suggested Videos.” \nAs the name implies, the feature is designed to make it easier for users to discover and watch all sorts of video clips, with the ultimate goal, of course, being to keep users glued to the site for as long as possible. \n“While we’re still in the early days of testing,” Facebook said in a press release, “we’re pleased with initial results, which show that people who have suggested videos are discovering and watching more new videos.” \nNot a bad start, but that’s just the beginning of Facebook’s plan to give YouTube a run for its money. \nFacebook also unveiled how they’re working on a feature that will enable users to watch video in a floating window, thereby allowing users to watch clips while simultaneously perusing through Facebook. \nAs it stands now, watching an embedded Facebook video requires that users keep their newsfeed static so that the video remains in view. YouTube, for what it’s worth, already employs a similar feature on its mobile app. Facebook Gives Mobile Profile Pages a Facelift 1:36 \nFacebook is changing mobile profile pages to give users more aesthetic control with new features like profile videos and GIFs and room for short bios.

This new videos section helps people discover, watch and share videos on Facebook that are relevant to them. It can be accessed by tapping a ‘Videos’ icon at the bottom of the Facebook app on iPhone or in the ‘Favorites’ section on the left-hand side of News Feed on the web.” \nOnce this feature rolls out to all Facebook users, the impact may be enormous. \nWhile more and more people are spending time watching videos on Facebook, YouTube’s vast library of searchable videos is quite literally remains without rival. \nIf Facebook can successfully leverage its vast user base to quickly build up a vast and searchable video repository, the site will quickly become a viable threat to YouTube’s video kingdom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:38:17.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
