The piston rings are used in conjunction with carbon-graphite guide rings or carrier rings, which hold the piston centered on a cylinder bore. \nMetcar’s self-lubricating, carbon-graphite piston rings and guide rings are used extensively in reciprocating compressors, where oil-free gases, such as air, steam, refrigerants, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, chlorine, nitrogen and oxygen can be compressed to pressures greater than 800 pounds per square inch (psi.) \nGuide rings can be either solid rings or segmented rings with butt joints. Metcar’s segmented, carbon-graphite, piston rings with overlapped joints are placed in a radial groove in the reciprocating piston with little clearance between the width of the groove and the width of the piston ring. At least two rings with off-set segment joints are needed to seal to pressures of 100 psi. Extra sets of rings are needed to seal higher pressures. “Metcar self-lubricating carbon graphite materials are particularly suited for this application because of their excellent lubricating qualities and good resistance to wear,” said Matthew Brennan, Chief Operating Officer of Metcar. “Wear life up to 10,000 hours is possible when the compressor and piston rings are correctly designed.” \nMetallized Carbon Corporation, (914) 941-3738,www.metcar.com Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:38:16.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
