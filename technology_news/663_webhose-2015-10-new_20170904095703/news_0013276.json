The court's decision Friday came after Transport for London sought clarification as to whether the San Francisco-based company's app worked in the same way as meters used by the strictly regulated black cabs. The Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association argued the app — which records a car's location and travel time and feeds it back to servers in California — worked like a meter. But Justice Duncan Ouseley disagreed, ruling that the app relies on GPS signals and did not operate in the same way. Uber has come under fire in several European countries, including France, Italy and Spain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:41:56.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
