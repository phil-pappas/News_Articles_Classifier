What started as one of the most elegant Apple Watch charging stands on the market, it is now adaptable to multiple platforms. This list now includes the Pebble Time, Time Round, and Time Steel, as well as the Fitbit Surge with several more being developed currently. Now users can invest in a docking solution without worrying about premature obsolescence. The WAVE Smart+ is designed specifically with form and function in mind. Due to a large amount of feedback from testers and customers of both the WAVE and our competition’s products, we now include a unique coating process that prevents surface scratches on your watch. Plus, with three cord placement options, you can easily customize the WAVE to fit your placement needs and eliminate the clutter of unsightly cords.\nSome notable words from our customers:\n… “This stand is hands down the sturdiest, best looking, and highest quality stand I have ever seen.”\n– Dimitri, OR\n“The Wave shows off my new Apple Watch, looks stylish and reminds me to charge it every night”\n– Andy, TX\nOUR MANTRA AT ZURSKE IS THIS:\nMake products that invoke creative emotion and appeal to those who value function with form.\nRare to the industry, Zurske offers flexibility of service throughout the manufacturing process.
