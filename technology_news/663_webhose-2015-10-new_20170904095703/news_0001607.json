The international Wired Certification standard identifies and certifies buildings that feature best-in-class Internet connectivity. \n“Strong Internet connectivity is becoming increasingly critical to the day-to-day operations of any business,” said Arie Barendrecht, CEO & co-founder of WiredScore, in a statement. “T3’s Wired pre-certification ensures that tenants will have access to a well-planned, fully redundant and resilient technological infrastructure that will promote seamless connectivity from the moment they sign a lease and for many years to come.” \nAccording to Hines, T3 has received the certification due to the density and diversity of lines to the site, multiple points of entry for carriers, and multiple riser pathways to support IT security and future growth of building tenancy, among other features. \nDubbed T3 to reflect the key elements of timber, transit and technology, the office building at 316 Third Ave. N. was designed by Michael Green Architecture in collaboration with DLR Group . Upon completion in the fall of 2016, T3 will become the first commercial building in the U.S. to use engineered wood for both its structure and interior, as previously reported by Commercial Property Executive . \nRendering courtesy of Hines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:00:24.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
