The new facility is SolarCity's first operations center in the state, and the company expects to employ approximately 100 people at the center when fully staffed. SolarCity, which launched Vermont service in August, makes it possible for many Vermont homeowners to install solar with no upfront cost and pay as much as 20 percent less by going solar than they pay for utility power, with installation, production guarantee, monitoring and repair service included at no additional cost. The company's services are available to customers of Burlington Electric and Green Mountain Power. SolarCity's new operations center means new solar jobs for the state. SolarCity began hiring Vermont staff in August, but the launch of the new facility kicks-off a local hiring push for licensed electricians, site surveyors and installers.
