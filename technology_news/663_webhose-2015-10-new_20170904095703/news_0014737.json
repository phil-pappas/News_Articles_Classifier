Founded by advertising legend Alex Bogusky, Visibl www.getvisibl.com is a self-serve programmatic platform that allows small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to run hyper-targeted video ad campaigns across major sites such as Pandora, CNN, and The New York Times for as little as $50. Visibl's Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform has been in beta testing since late May and will go live to the public on October 15. \nThough American companies will spend $3.84 billion on programmatic video by 2016, most SMBs, brands and creative agencies have been mostly left out in the cold because the available tools were either too expensive or required too much technical expertise for them to operate. And while social-media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube developed their own user-friendly solutions, they only allowed SMBs to purchase inventory inside the \"walled gardens\" of their own networks. The result has been a public frustrated by being constantly bombarded by generic advertisements from a handful of large advertisers delivering little to no relevance. \n\"We democratized video advertising by providing everyone the technology, access and reach that giant advertisers have and gave them the ability to do it without million-dollar budgets or advanced math degrees,\" said Alex Bogusky, Visibl founder. \nVisibl solves all of these problems. Since the platform is integrated with dozens of highly trusted ad networks such as Google, Facebook, AppNexus and BrightRoll, Visibl gives its customers access to 98% of global programmatic audiences across both desktop and mobile devices. And with Visibl's easy-to-use web application, agencies, brands, and small-business owners can use information provided by top data-management companies such as Experian and BlueKai to serve ads to precise audience segments in just a matter of minutes. Then, customers can take advantage of an intuitive reporting dashboard with full transparency to track the success of their campaigns in engagement, clickthroughs and other metrics--all without them needing to have previous media-buying experience or the help of an outside agency. In short, Visibl makes the video-advertising world a place where the size of your idea matters more than size of your budget. \nAlready, premier creative shops like Barton F. Graf 9000 and noteworthy small businesses such as the startup accelerator Techstars have used the Visibl platform in beta testing to serve users hundreds of thousands of video ads. In the coming years, more and more SMBs and agencies will be looking to unleash the power of programmatic video, and Visibl will be the company helping them do it. \n\"Ensuring high viewability and placement transparency is incredibly important to our brand,\" said Sonya Hausafus, vice president of Marketing at Techstars. \"Visibl allowed us to create high-performing campaigns without the cost of highly specialized media vendors.\" \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/visibl-brings-the-power-of-programmatic-video-to-small-and-medium-sized-businesses-300160433.html \nSOURCE Visibl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:25:50.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
