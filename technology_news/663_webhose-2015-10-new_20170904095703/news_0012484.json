This award recognizes companies with the most impact on improving Wi-Fi service delivery within as well as outside the network. BandwidthX was chosen by a WBA selected panel of preeminent analysts and industry experts. The award was presented on October 14, 2015 at the Wi-Fi Global Congress in San Jose, CA.\nBandwidthX operates BxMarket, a cloud-based Wi-Fi market that makes accessing Wi-Fi from third parties as a part of a mobile network practical and economical. The business-to-business solution enables Mobile Operators to precisely meet data demand by buying unused Wi-Fi capacity from Wi-Fi and Internet Service Providers. By dynamically allocating capacity to meet demand, employing a market mechanism, and seamlessly making connections, BxMarket brings savings for mobile operators, new revenue streams for Wi-Fi providers, and better service for end-users.\n“Wi-Fi continues to evolve, and with the development of applications such as IoT, Smart Cities and Big Data – broadening the technology’s ubiquity and influence – the need for common goals is greater now than ever. In this busy and ever-changing ecosystem, what is important is that we celebrate the innovative ideas that drive us forward. In recognizing these companies for their achievements, we are not just congratulating them, but hoping also to inspire others to follow in their illustrious footsteps,” said Shrikant Shenwai, WBA CEO. “I would like to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate each of the winners.”\n“We are honored to win the WBA’s Best Wi-Fi Management Solution for a Service Provider 2015 Wi-Fi Industry Award. It is especially meaningful to us to be selected as the best Wi-Fi management solution as we are providing the benefits of BxMarket to a growing group of service providers to tens of millions mobile devices and access points,” said Pertti Visuri, BandwidthX CEO. “We would like to congratulate the other two companies that were shortlisted for this category and look forward to continuing our collaboration with key Wi-Fi ecosystem players.”\nFor further information about BandwidthX and its solution, visit http://bandwidthx.com or follow @BandwidthX on Twitter.
