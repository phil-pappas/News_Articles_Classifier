Fossils from this ancient environment were recently recovered from Jacksboro, Texas by Mark McKinzie and Robert Williams of the Dallas Paleontological Society. Among these were two fossil braincases from massive extinct relatives of modern-day sharks. \nPreviously, giant sharks had only been recovered from rock dating back 130 million years, during the age of the dinosaurs. The largest shark that ever lived, commonly called \"Megalodon\", is much younger, with an oldest occurrence at about 15 million years ago. This means the new fossils from Texas indicate giant sharks go much further back into the fossil record. \nAfter the generous donation of these fossils and careful study with Dr. John Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the team was able to estimate how big the entire sharks would have been by comparison with smaller and more complete fossils of closely related sharks. The results were very impressive. \nThe size range estimated for these two Texas 'supersharks' was between 18 and 26 feet in length (5.5 to 8 meters). The largest of these specimens was 25% bigger than today's largest predatory shark, the Great White. Although not nearly as large as Megalodon, which might have reached up to 67 feet in length (about 20 meters), the fossil sharks from Texas would have been by far the biggest sharks in the sea. \nThese fossil braincases may belong to an extinct species of shark called Glikmanius occidentalis, or they may represent a new and larger related species that is new to science. Closely related sharks are known from as far off as Scotland, showing this group of sharks was capable of dispersing across great distances. \nMaisey, McKinzie, and Williams timed their research results very well, being able to present their Texas 'supershark' at the annual meeting for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Dallas, Texas on October 16. According to Maisey, even 300 million years ago, \"everything is bigger in Texas!\" Preserved shark fossil adds evidence to great white's origins March 12, 2009 \nA new University of Florida study could help resolve a long-standing debate in shark paleontology: From which line of species did the modern great white shark evolve? New ancient shark species gives insight into origin of great white November 14, 2012 \n(Phys.org)—The great white shark is one of the largest living predatory animals and a magnet for media sensationalism, yet its evolutionary history is as misunderstood as its role as a menace. Ancient shark fossil reveals new insights into jaw evolution April 16, 2014 \nThe skull of a newly discovered 325-million-year-old shark-like species suggests that early cartilaginous and bony fishes have more to tell us about the early evolution of jawed vertebrates—including humans—than do modern ... Fossil ancestor shows sharks have a bony past May 29, 2015 \nMost people know that sharks have a distinctive, all-cartilage skeleton, but now a fossil from Western Australia has revealed a surprise 'missing link' to an earlier, more bony form of the fish. Fossil from 20-foot shark found in Texas June 11, 2015 \nPaleontologists literally stumbled upon fossils just outside Fort Worth that were vertebrae of a monster shark that trolled the shallow seas that covered Texas a hundred millennia ago. Researchers discover new lineage of prehistoric, plankton-eating sharks September 22, 2015 \nAn international team of scientists has discovered a new lineage of extinct plankton-feeding sharks, Pseudomegachasma, that lived in warm oceans during the age of the dinosaurs nearly 100 million years ago. The fossil sharks ... Recommended for you Dinosaurs used nasal passages to keep brains cool October 22, 2015 \nDinosaur nasal passages were certainly nothing to sneeze at. Possessing among the largest and most complex nasal passages seen in animals, their function has puzzled paleontologists. New research suggests that the size and ...
