The analysis uncovered a subset of companies including ThunderCat Technology, whose continued success is largely based on superior value creation for their customers, building an adaptive learning culture, and aggressive geographic expansion—making them the most dynamic firms in America today.\nAccording to research conducted by the Business Dynamics Research Consortium (BDRC), less than one percent of U.S. businesses expanded capacity three or more years out of the past five. On average, they grew by 41% over the period whereas all other surviving companies lost an average of 4%. Based on their analysis of 19.1 million for-profit US businesses, sustained growers are statistically more likely to survive and continue to grow over the next five years than any other group of businesses in the economy.\n“The companies identified in the E360 Index are sustained growers, and based on our research, have proven adept at navigating the changing challenges of their marketplace to win new business and grow their output capacity year after year,” says Gary Kunkle, senior research fellow at the Business Dynamics Research Consortium and research partner of the E360 Performance Index.\nTo learn more about ThunderCat Technology visit http://www.thundercattech.com\nFor additional details on the E360 Performance Index and the companies recognized, visit: http://entm.ag/E360Index\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038974.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://entm.ag/E360Index", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038974.htm"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:57:14.815+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
