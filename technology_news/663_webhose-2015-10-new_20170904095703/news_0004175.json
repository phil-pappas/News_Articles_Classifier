Many people in my department saw that as a great idea and a lot of them put their names on the list. At first there were many of us and big enough to challenge each other every Friday. Our fitness levels were very low as most of us could not finish even 30min on the pitch because of cramps and burning chest.\nA few months later we were so fit that even a substitution will lead to a heated argument because we just wanted to keep playing. It however became boring so to spice it up a little bit we decided to challenge other departments in the company. We got ourselves walkovers because a score of 10 to 15 nil became common. We went on to challenge other companies like banks, courier companies and other partners. Through all this experience what caught my eye was the performance of one guy Sugan from our finance department. He is Hindu. He is very agile and quick off the ball. He has a very important thing in him which can sometimes make or break oneâ€™s career in soccer which is positioning. He is very good in positioning himself in such a way that whenever you want pass him he is always unmarked and his speed makes him difficult to mark. With him talent he would have made it to the Premier Soccer League and even overseas.\nThe following day the topic with the guys was all about him and during our lunch we asked him why he never took soccer as a career as he is clearly talented because in Soweto with his talent you sometimes only need one game and next thing we see you on our TV. The subject itself looks uncomfortable for him and this is evident on his inability to give a clear answer. It is now too late for him to make a late breakthrough because at the age of 31 most players are contemplating retirement and what to do after retirement with their millions.\nThe above experience got me thinking. I took a look at the PSL and realised that there is nothing in soccer as a sport that is against any religion. It is just a wonderful and clean sport, very addictive at times. This is also evident in the large number of participants in strictly Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE. They regularly feature in the world cup and some other regional tournaments. Even though I tried searching I still could not get the reason why our brothers of ethnic Indian origin do not participate in this sport. If there is anyone out there with a possible answer that will be much appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:24:06.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
