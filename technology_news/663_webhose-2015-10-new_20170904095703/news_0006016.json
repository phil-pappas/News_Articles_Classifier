This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151005006226/en/ GE Transportation Evolution Series Tier 4 Locomotive (Photo: GE) \nThe company has delivered over 500 Evolution Series Tier 4 compliant locomotives to North American customers, and its Trip Optimizer, the leading auto-pilot controls system for railroads, has accumulated 100 million auto-control miles, delivering significant emissions reductions to customers. \nThe technology being developed by GE Transportation is connecting the entire rail ecosystem. The outcomes delivered through this connection are optimized networks, minimized downtime and reduced operating costs. \n“A more digital rail system means freight is delivered faster, more reliably and at lower cost,” said Seth Bodnar, General Manager, GE Transportation Cab Electronics. \nGE Transportation’s Evolution Series Tier 4 locomotive is the first freight locomotive to meet the strict Tier 4 emission regulations set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). GE’s smartest locomotive has more than 200 sensors onboard, processes over a billion instructions per second and provides about 10GB of data per locomotive year. \nTrip Optimizer, the autopilot software for railroads that builds an optimal operating plan based on data collected about the train’s characteristics, has reached 100 million auto-control miles. This solution has helped the rail industry decrease fuel costs, reduce emissions and improve bottom lines, since its production launch in 2009. \nThe 100 million auto-control miles equates to an estimated: 56 million gallons of fuel saved; $197 million (USD) in fuel cost saved; and 628 Kilotons of greenhouse gases reduced \nCustomers have seen fuel savings of 3-17% depending on the type of train service and rail topography, with average savings for the fleet estimated at 10%. Improved fuel efficiency brings related emissions savings, and customers experienced an average 10% reduction in emissions. It is certified by the EPA as an emissions savings energy-management system. \nToday, Trip Optimizer is installed in over 6,000 GE locomotives around the world. Global customers, including six of the seven Class 1 railroads, have ordered an additional 2,000 systems. Trip Optimizer will be available on non-GE locomotives at the beginning of 2016. In addition, GE has now released the SmartHPT (horsepower per ton) upgrade. This allows Trip Optimizer to idle select locomotives within a train to maintain track speed for additional fuel savings. \nGE Transportation \nAt GE Transportation, we are in the business of realizing potential. We are a global technology leader and supplier to the rail, mining, marine, stationary power and drilling industries. Our innovations help customers deliver goods and services with greater speed and greater savings using our advanced manufacturing techniques and connected machines.
