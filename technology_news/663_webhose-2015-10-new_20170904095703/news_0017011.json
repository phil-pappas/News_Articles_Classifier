The results are reported today, Oct. 23, 2015, in the journal Biomedical Physics & Engineering Express . \nThe device , developed primarily at Florida International University, uses a near-infrared laser diode source to produce an image of the breast tissues. \nOne advantage presented by the device is that it is more adaptable to breast shape and density, and that it allows imaging of the chest wall regions, which are harder to image with conventional techniques. \n\"The women scanned always commented on how comfortable it was to be scanned by our device - many of them said that they didn't feel anything\" explains Sarah Erickson-Bhatt, an author on the paper. \nThe device builds an image of the tissue by mapping the optical absorption, which is altered by the concentration of haemoglobin - the protein in red blood cells. Regions with higher concentrations of haemoglobin may indicate higher blood flow due to an abnormality such as a tumour. \nThe optical analysis developed offers several benefits over mammography, with no ionising radiation dose and fewer issues imaging dense tissues. \n\"Eventually, we hope that physicians will be able to use this for real-time imaging of breast tissues as part of regular visits by the patients\" adds Anu Godavarty, also an author of the paper. \"We're current working on the mathematical tools required to process the images and produce 3D tomographic images , in order to determine tumour size and depth.\" \nThe researchers' on-going efforts involve extensive clinical work to demonstrate the capability of the device to pre-screen for any breast abnormality, followed by seeking FDA approvals prior to clinical use. 9 hours ago 1 Imaging breast cancer with light: Researchers unveil 'photoacoustic mammoscope' October 23, 2013 \nBreast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer and cancer deaths among women worldwide. Routine screening can increase breast cancer survival by detecting the disease early and allowing doctors to address it at this ... New ultrasound sensors for improved breast cancer screening July 29, 2015 \nThe first prototype ultrasound sensors for a new improved breast screening technique have been developed as part of a collaboration between the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), University Hospitals Bristol (UHB), North ... New approach to mammograms could improve reliability September 16, 2015 \nDetecting breast cancer in women with dense mammary tissues could become more reliable with a new mammogram procedure that researchers have now tested in pre-clinical studies of mice. In their report in the journal ACS Nano, ... Recommended for you Researchers transform slow emitters into fast light sources October 22, 2015 \nResearchers from Brown University, in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, have developed a new way to control light from phosphorescent emitters at very high speeds. The technique provides a new approach to modulation ... The universe really is weird, and a landmark quantum experiment proves it October 22, 2015 \nOnly last year the world of physics celebrated the 50th anniversary of Bell's theorem, a mathematical proof that certain predictions of quantum mechanics are incompatible with local causality. Local causality is a very natural ... The ductility of magnesium explained October 22, 2015 \nZhaoxuan Wu and William Curtin of the Laboratory for Multiscale Mechanics Modeling (LAMMM) have solved the 40-year-old scientific riddle of the low ductility magnesium. After 100 years, Einstein's theory stands test of time October 20, 2015 \nAlbert Einstein's general theory of relativity is about to celebrate its 100th anniversary, and his revolutionary hypothesis has withstood the test of time, despite numerous expert attempts to find flaws. Historic Delft Experiments tests Einstein's 'God does not play dice' using quantum 'dice' October 21, 2015 \nRandom number generators developed at ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences, by the groups of ICREA Professors Morgan W. Mitchell and Valerio Pruneri, played a critical role in the historic experiment was published online ... To infinity and beyond: Light goes infinitely fast with new on-chip material October 19, 2015 \nElectrons are so 20th century. In the 21st century, photonic devices, which use light to transport large amounts of information quickly, will enhance or even replace the electronic devices that are ubiquitous in our lives ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:04:35.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
