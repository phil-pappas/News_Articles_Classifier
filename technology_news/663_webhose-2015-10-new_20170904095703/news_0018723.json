John Carlin, the Justice Department's top national security official, called the case \"the first of its kind.\"\nThe new post in Malaysia is occupied by Thomas Dougherty, who spent years as a Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor. He already has met with officials from Vietnam to discuss potential improvements to that country's penal code and has reviewed cases with Malaysian officials. He'll also be expected to serve as a point of contact for coordinating training on cyber investigations and prosecutions and a resource for questions about the use of electronic evidence and other topics, State Department officials said.\nThe new position is an acknowledgement that encouraging foreign countries to arrest hackers within their own borders can sometimes be a more efficient strategy than hauling them into U.S. courts. But U.S. officials say they'll continue seeking extradition of those captured overseas, and that improving laws in foreign countries is part of that process. The U.S. has extradited almost a dozen cyber criminals in the last year, Caldwell said Friday.\nThe initiative is similar to one undertaken by the FBI, which for several years has stationed specialized cyber agents at some of the dozens of legal attache offices the bureau maintains around the world. The FBI says on its website that it has 64 legal attache offices in different parts of the world and more than a dozen smaller sub-offices,\nThe FBI has cyber agents assigned to more than a half-dozen countries, including Estonia, Romania, Australia and Canada, and temporary positions in some other nations as well, said Gerald Bessette, an FBI cyber section chief.\n\"Every country has different legal investigative structures,\" Bessette said. \"So we want to know who our partners are if we have an investigation where we're going to ask a foreign country to take legal action\" such as seizing a computer server that's being used to commit crimes.\nHe said those partnerships paid off in an investigation last year into sophisticated malware known as BlackShades that infected more than a half-million computers worldwide and permitted cybercriminals to remotely hijack a computer and its webcam. Federal authorities charged about 100 people, with police throughout Europe involved in coordinating arrests.\nShawn Henry, a former FBI executive assistant director, said good relationships are crucial because the FBI generally can't work an international case successfully without a host government's cooperation.\n\"I don't care who arrests them, as long as they're bad guys and off the playing field,\" said Henry, president of CrowdStrike Services, a security technology company. \"If a foreign government can arrest them and charge them successfully, I'm happy.\"\n____\nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:18:11.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
