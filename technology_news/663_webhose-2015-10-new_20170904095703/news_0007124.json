KCPS (KDDI Cloud Platform Service) mBaaS by Kii is the first service in Japan to provide enterprise businesses with a mobile app and IoT platform via private network to intranet. \nKCPS consolidates KDDI Wide Area Virtual Switch, which integrates different virtual network layers, and Kii's software into one platform. This powerful combination will provide enterprise customers with the ability to access and connect to their intranet via KCPS -- a process that was previously unattainable. KCPS also provides a service environment for intranet-conscious customers who require high-security enterprise functionality rather than connecting to the Internet. As a result, both intranet and Internet services can work seamlessly with any mobile application developed on the KCPS platform. \nKCPS can be managed in association with users and the device. KDDI's application development support will allow developers to build high quality, low price applications in a short period of time. The platform offers user management functionality that is essential to application development, device management and data management, while also providing essential features like push notifications and geo-location information. Mobile apps on Android and iOS are compatible with KCPS. \n\"As the IoT continues to gain mass acceptance, we see tremendous value in working with a respected telecom industry leader like KDDI to help mobile app developers get more IoT devices into the hands of Japanese consumers,\" Masanari Arai, CEO of Kii. \"Our collaboration with KDDI will drive the next steps in IoT development and increase focus on the cloud in building the backend support of these apps in Japan.\" \nAbout Kii Kii is focused on addressing the high-performance demands of innovation in the connected world with an end-to-end backend platform optimized for enterprise applications and the Internet of Things (IoT).
