The audio streaming option debuted on Sunday.\n\"Audio is a big area of opportunity for us,\" says Hans Schroeder, the NFL's senior vice president of media strategy, business development and sales. \"We have great partnerships today already both across the club level and also at the league level. But as we see the explosion of digital and we see more fans gravitating to digital platforms, making sure we had a great audio offering there going forward was an important one.\"\nThe NFL already has partnerships with Westwood One and SiriusXM to deliver live audio broadcasts of games.\nTuneIn boasts 60 million monthly active users. The network recently launched a Premium subscription at $7.99 a month for access to hundreds of radio stations, audiobooks and Major League Baseball broadcasts. TuneIn CEO John Donham says its work with MLB helped sway the NFL to offer a similar package on TuneIn.\n\"Weâ€™re proving how well we can showcase the content and can provide such a good listener experience,\" says Donham.\nThe TuneIn deal is one of several recently unveiled by the NFL to widen its reach. Last month, the NFL revealed it was working with Snapchat on a social experience . The league also agreed to a multi-year deal with Twitter to offer more video such as top plays and game recaps.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n28 CONNECT 24 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RCuAJI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea2fe6a8e503a26b60596709028445a823fbca6f/c=259-0-4314-3049&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796843667228933-2015-10-05-NFL1.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCuAJI&text=NFL%20teams%20up%20with%20TuneIn%20on%20radio%20broadcasts&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCuAJI&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1RCuAJI", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796843667228933-2015-10-05-NFL1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796843667228933-2015-10-05-NFL1.jpg", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:05:23.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
