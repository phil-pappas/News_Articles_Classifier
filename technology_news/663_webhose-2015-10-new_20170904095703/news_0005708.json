The Austin, Texas, software provider's market value was $3.2 billion according to Thursday's closing price of $41.88.\nSolarWinds said there is no set timetable for the board's review, and it doesn't expect to make further public comment unless the board approves a specific action or ends its review.\nThe board has retained J.P. Morgan as its financial adviser and DLA Piper LLP as its legal adviser for the review.\nEven with Friday's stock bump, shares of SolarWinds are still down 5.5% so far this year.\nDaniel Ives, an FBR & Co. analyst, called the strategic review a \"potentially rosy scenario for investors that have stuck with the company through its rollercoaster ride, especially over the past year as SolarWinds has run into some execution speed bumps.\"\nHe said private equity would be the main bidder for the company's business, and that SolarWinds is starting to see a rebound from a soft second-quarter performance and should be poised to see some seasonal strength in the second half of the year.\nSolarWinds has posted consistent sales growth over the past several quarters. It announced Wednesday updates to its remote IT administration and support software, DameWare Remote Support, which extend its over-the-Internet remote-session capabilities.\nWrite to Anne Steele at anne.steele@wsj.com\n 09, 2015 13:25 ET (17:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:50:43.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
