The new Lubbock Canyon West store at 5016 Milwaukee Avenue is designed so they can explore and interact with the latest technology. \nCustomers can check out solutions, devices and accessories across three unique \"zones\" - the Connected Experience Zone, the Community Zone, and the Explore Zone. -- Connected Experience Zone: \"lifestyle vignettes\" show how products can be used every day. It highlights music, home security, entertainment and more. -- Community Zone: visitors can shop and play at interactive \"community tables.\" It displays apps, accessories and devices so customers can see how they can work together. -- Explore Zone: \"explore walls\" show a variety of AT&T's devices and accessories next to digital monitors explaining how they work. \n\"Customers visiting our Lubbock store will discover an interactive shopping experience built around their mobile lifestyle,\" said Hardmon Williams, vice president/general manager, AT&T-North Texas. \"Our goal is to be America's premier retailer by providing an exceptional experience in every interaction, and our customers will get that the minute they walk through the doors. This new shopping concept will exceed customer expectations by taking our stores and network to a new level here in Lubbock.\" \nA Better Experience \nCustomers will be able to have a mobile shopping experience. Instead of \"cash-register\" counters, they'll find round cafe-style \"learning tables.\" They can chat with an AT&T retail consultant there to ask questions or learn about a product or service. All retail consultants carry a tablet so they can help customers anywhere in the store. \nThe store uses digital signage, e-brochures and interactive video monitors to give customers the information they want at their fingertips. \n\"The Lubbock Chamber of Commerce is committed to bringing jobs and new solutions to our community. This new store is an example of what a positive business climate can result in as we continue to grow our local economy,\" said Eddie McBride, Chamber President. \"AT&T is an outstanding corporate citizen and we are delighted to celebrate the opening of a new store, especially one as fun and interactive as this one in Lubbock.\" \nThis is the latest example of the investment already made in the Lubbock area. AT&T invested more than $6.8 billion in its Texas wireless and wireline networks from 2012 through 2014. This new location serves the growing number of people using their wireless devices to manage their busy lives. \nThe store encourages discovery and curiosity, bringing AT&T's vision and personality to life. Many of the new elements came from the award-winning flagship store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. They are now coming to other company-owned retail stores in the U.S. \nStore information \nThe new Lubbock Canyon West store will be open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. \nAT&T has nearly 200 retail locations in Texas.
