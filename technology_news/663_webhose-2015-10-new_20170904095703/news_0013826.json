The rate on overnight deposits also remained at minus 0.2 per cent.\nWhile there are some indications that the ECB's bond-buying program has helped spawn lending to the economy, it has done next to nothing to lift inflation in the eurozone. The most recent data show consumer prices in September were 0.1 per cent below the level of one year ago, far off the ECB's medium-term target for the inflation rate of just below 2 per cent.\nCentral bankers worry that an environment of falling prices will induce consumers to put off purchases, waiting for prices to sink further and ultimately leading to cuts in wages and a shrinking economy. Deflation also weighs on borrowers by raising the cost of money in real terms.\nFor deflation to take hold, consumers and businesses would have to expect price falls to continue. Central bankers are therefore anxious to persuade households that, whatever its current reading, the inflation rate will be around their target over the medium term, in which case they describe inflation expectations as being \"anchored.\"\nBut Mr Draghi warned of a possible \"de-anchoring\" of expectations if the inflation rate remains low for a long time, and particularly if oil prices fall further.\n\"These risks have gone up and we want to be vigilant,\" he said.\nSome of Mr Draghi's colleagues have appeared reluctant to expand the quantitative easing program so soon after its launch, with a number of national central bank heads -- who sit on the ECB's governing council -- recently expressing a preference for waiting until the continuing purchases of government bonds have taken full effect.\nMeanwhile, the euro has appreciated over recent months as traders and investors have become less convinced that the US Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates this year. The ECB had expected a weaker euro to boost eurozone exports and raise prices of imported goods and services, thereby helping policy makers meet their inflation target.\nMr Draghi said the euro's appreciation over the last four months was one of a number developments threatening to weaken growth and inflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:02:40.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
