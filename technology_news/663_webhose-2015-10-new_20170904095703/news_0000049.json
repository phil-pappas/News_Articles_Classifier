Mr Ved is currently an MBA student at a US college. \nIn the early hours of 29 September he noticed a for sale sign next to the Google.com name while browsing sites on Google's own website-buying service. \nHe used a credit card to pay the $12 (Â£8) fee to grab google.com and got emails confirming he was the owner. Almost immediately he started getting messages intended for Google's own web administration team. \nThis was followed by a cancellation message sent by the website buying service which said he could not take over Google.com because someone else had already registered it and his $12 payment was refunded. \nNow it has emerged that Mr Ved has been given a \"bug bounty\" by Google's security team for revealing the weakness in the domain buying system. The internal emails Mr Ved received while in charge of google.com have been passed to this team. \nMr Ved decided to give the cash to an Indian educational foundation and in response, Google doubled the reward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:55.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
