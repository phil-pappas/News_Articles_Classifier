Sales were $2.15-billion in the same period a year earlier, excluding PayPal Holdings Inc. \nThe goal of July’s split was to make sure that each company could focus on their main businesses. EBay is facing especially fierce competition from Amazon.com Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other retailers ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season. The challenge for Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig is to catch up with industry’s growth rate; U.S. e-commerce sales are projected to hit $79.4-billion in November and December, up 14 per cent from a year earlier, according to EMarketer. \n“There’s an expectation that they will have turned the corner because the password breach and Google algorithm change were last year,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \nShares of EBay rose as much as 11 per cent in extended trading. The stock, which declined less than 1 per cent to $24.21 at the close in New York, is down 13 per cent since the split was completed July 20. \nEBay, which attracts 159 million buyers and had $19.6-billion in gross merchandise volume in the latest quarter, has been taking steps to streamline itself and boost its appeal to merchants. The company also killed its U.S. same-day delivery service EBay Now and struck a deal to sell its enterprise unit, which provided warehousing, delivery and customer support for web merchants, for $925-million to a private equity group. \nWenig is also implementing changes to EBay’s seller-rating system so that merchants aren’t penalized for late shipments beyond their control or routine returns and exchanges. This is aimed at growing EBay’s base of 25 million merchants and keep them from shifting inventory to competing sites such as Amazon and Etsy Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:34:55.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
