(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nHackers have stolen personal information belonging to about 15 million T-Mobile wireless customers and potential customers in the U.S., including Social Security numbers, home addresses, birthdates and other personal information. \nThe hackers got the information from credit reporting agency Experian, which T-Mobile uses to check the credit of consumers applying for phone plans and financing for devices. Experian said T-Mobile customers who applied between Sept. 1, 2013 and Sept. 16, 2015 may have had their information stolen. \nExperian said it immediately notified law enforcement authorities after discovering the hack and that \"there is no evidence to-date that the data has been used inappropriately.\" \nThe companies said that payment card and banking information was not affected. \nT-Mobile customers can sign up for two free years of credit monitoring services at www.protectmyID.com/securityincident , a service owned by Experian. The company said that affected customers should \"remain vigilant\" against identity theft and watch for phishing email scams that ask for sensitive information such as bank account and Social Security numbers. \nExperian said in a statement on its website that it doesn't know who was behind the hack and that it is taking \"necessary steps\" to prevent further breaches. \nThe hack happened on Experian's server and is still being investigated, said Annie Garrigan, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile. \nThere have been a string of high-profile hacks of businesses and other organizations in recent years affecting millions of people, including adultery website Ashley Madison, Sony Pictures, the insurer Anthem, retailers such as Home Depot and Target, eBay and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. \nNearly 800 data breaches were reported last year by U.S. organizations, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. \n\"I am incredibly angry about this data breach and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,\" said T-Mobile US Inc. CEO John Legere in a statement. \nT-Mobile is now the No. 3 wireless carrier in the U.S., having surpassed Sprint this year. The company refers to itself as an \"Un-carrier\" because it changed some of the wireless industry's practices, like replacing the two-year service contract with monthly installment plans. Verizon and AT&T are the country's largest wireless carriers.
