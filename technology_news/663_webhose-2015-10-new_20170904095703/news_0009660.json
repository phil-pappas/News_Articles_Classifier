The gap in the Sun's magnetic field lets out a stream of particles traveling at up to 800 kilometers per second, kindling a days-long geomagnetic storm upon hitting Earth.\nCoronal holes normally form over the Sun's poles and lower latitudes, more often when the Sun is at a less active point in its 11-year cycle.\nThey are areas within the Sun's outermost layer, called its corona, which are lower-density and cooler - that, plus the weakened magnetic field, lets the plasma and charged particles that make up the corona stream out more easily in a solar wind, 'Space.com' reported.\nIf aimed toward Earth, it could result in a geomagnetic storm, a phenomenon that can affect power and navigation for satellites orbiting the Earth as well as radio communication. Another side effect of a geomagnetic storm is enhanced northern lights.\nAs the coronal hole continues its slow march westward on the Sun's surface (to the right, from Earth's perspective), solar winds will stay strong, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) officials said.\n Science and Trends coronal hole sun Also Read WhatsApp kills voice-calling feature for UAE Windows 9 may get the Start Menu back after all NASA spacecraft discovers frozen plains in Pluto's 'heart' NASA offers USD 2.25 million for building 3D-printed space habitat", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/technology-science-and-trends/article/nasa-spacecraft-spots-giant-hole-sun", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sunny%202%20copy_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/sunny%202%20copy_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:55:23.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
