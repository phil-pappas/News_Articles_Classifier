Front Desk offers a suite of management services for small businesses that primarily interact with customers via mobile devices, such as marketing, registration, billing, scheduling and attendance tracking. \n\"Many of our customers are small, independent business owners and educators who do not have the technical capabilities or resources to streamline organization and the management tasks that are pivotal to their success,\" said Dallas Jasper, CEO of Connect2Classes, in a prepared statement. \"A community may have a robust population of lifelong learners, but education providers struggle to meet the needs of all potential students due to administrative headaches. With this partnership, they can leverage the combined power of our platform with Front Desk's software, enabling them to improve engagement with potential students, better market their offerings and drive growth.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:01:16.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
