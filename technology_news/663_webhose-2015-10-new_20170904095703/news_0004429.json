The addition of Big Data to iXInsight revolutionizes core iXTools functions for rating, routing and analytics and is poised to meet the demand of high volume real-time business optimization while minimizing costs and increasing revenue and margins. The evolving Telarix analytics portfolio offers carriers an advanced view into their business by transforming raw data, in real-time, into actionable intelligence. Telarix’s iXInsight is available either as a cloud-based solution or an on-premise deployment model.\n“Adding a Big Data platform that powers the core functions of rating, routing and reporting while supporting our growing analytics portfolio was a natural progression for us,” said Shoma Chakravarty, CTO of Telarix. “iXInsight’s scalable architecture optimizes high-volume processing while taking advantage of cluster-computing resources. Using technologies such as Hadoop™ and Spark™, we have created a powerful, yet cost-effective framework for carriers competing in the real-time BI-driven market.”\nFree of volume constraints and with unrivaled simplicity in use, iXInsight allows for all users to have proactive control while easily gaining valuable insight.\n“With new entrants continuing to emerge in the global retail telecommunications business, it has become imperative to swiftly analyze data, to recognize all sources of traffic, from initial entry to final destination,” said Glen Kazerman, Telarix CEO. “As Telarix is already the natural choice for many in providing this management, the importance of offering this additional functionality to our customer base became increasingly clear.”\nThis innovation results in fast and informed decisions that cover all aspects of a carriers business. The addition of the platform to iXInsight provides vital feedback to Telarix’s existing route optimization system, enabling business intelligence, analytics and data mining to solve an ever-evolving set of use cases in areas such as fraud and dispute management. It also allows the creation of new bundled revenue opportunities for retail and wholesale service providers.\n“At Telarix, we are vastly aware of the complexities of the CSP space. The purpose of iXInsight is to allow carriers a 360 degree view of their business operations, which is arguably one of the most critical steps necessary to understand their business, make informed decisions, control their success and stay competitive in the evolving market,” said Kazerman.\nAbout Telarix:\nWith a community of over 4,000 carriers, Telarix is the de-facto standard in telecom electronic information exchange.
