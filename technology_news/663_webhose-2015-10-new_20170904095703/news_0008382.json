The company makes so-called \"time-of-flight\" range image sensor technology which Sony said will be used to create a \"next generation\" range of image sensors for cameras.\nThe technology detects the time it takes for light to leave a light source, reflect off an object, and return to the image sensor. Sony expects it to be used in other applications too, such as medical devices.\nJohn MacDougall | AFP | Getty Images The move follows a restructuring of Sony's devices division - which currently houses Sony's image sensor business, battery and storage media arms. It is one of Sony's fastest-growing units. The business saw operating income hit 30.3 billion yen ($249 million) in the three months to June 30, a 163.8 percent year-on-year rise, primarily driven by image sensors.\nSony spun out the image sensor business on Tuesday into a separate unit in order to make it more transparent to investors and bring products to market faster. The acquisition of Softkinetic Systems highlights a continued focus on bolstering this profitable division.\n‘No plans’ to sell mobile unit The news comes after comments from chief executive Kazuo Hira that next year is make-or-break for the mobile business and could dictate the future of the unit.\n\"We will continue with the business as long as we are on track with the scenario of breaking even next year onwards,\" Hirai told a group of reporters on Wednesday, according to Reuters. \"Otherwise, we haven't eliminated the consideration of alternative options.\"\nIt was not clear what those options might be but a Sony spokesperson said the company had no plans to sell its mobile unit.\n\"We are on track with proceeding with the transformation to be completed in fiscal year 15 for the mobile business. At this point in time, there are no plans to sell the mobile business,\" a Sony spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\nWe want to make uniquely Sony smartphones: CEO\nSony's decision to lower a forecast for its smartphone sales in the fiscal year ending next March signals a shift away from the strategy of gaining market share at all costs, says CEO Kazuo Hirai.\nSony, like many other smartphone makers, has struggled in the face of continued dominance from Apple and Samsung and stiff competition from low-cost Chinese manufacturers. In the three months ending June 30, Sony booked a 22.9 billion yen ($188 million) operating loss on its mobile communications division.\nThe company has already spun off its embattled TV business and sold its PC arm. Earlier this year, it decided to spin off its audio and video business as part of Hirai's turnaround plan for the Japanese giant.\nSony may also sell its half of Sony/ATV Publishing - a music publishing company which owns the rights to songs by artists from the the Beatles to Taylor Swift - to the Michael Jackson estate, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:10:15.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
