Matthew Olivieri, Founder & CEO made the announcement. For the two weeks leading up to the 50th edition of the Big Game, you can advertise on 50 digital billboards all around the San Francisco Bay Area. \"The 50th edition of the Big Game, will be an opportunity for marketing teams across the world to connect themselves with an iconic, once in a lifetime event. This game does not only represent the sport of Football, it is an event that is sewn into the fabric of our American culture and brings together both hardcore fans and casual spectators alike. The fact that the 50th edition will be taking place down the street from where our company was founded was something we simply had to be a part of and could not ignore.\" Matthew went on to say, \"What we are ultimately hoping to achieve is to be able to provide an advertising option to those businesses who are seeking an alternative to spending the estimated $5M that is expected to be fetched for one :30 second spot during the broadcast of the game itself. For a fraction of that price, your ad can play 1X every minute, all-day across 50 high definition digital billboards as well as inside the San Jose and San Francisco International airports for the two weeks leading up to the Big Game on February 7th, 2016.\" This kind of opportunity is unique to AdSemble alone as they are the only marketplace that has enough highway digital billboard inventory to create the #50for50 offering for those two weeks.
