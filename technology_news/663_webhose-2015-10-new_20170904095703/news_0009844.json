Ferizi had allegedly communicated on Twitter with Islamic State leader Junaid Hussain, a British-born hacker who was killed in a U.S. air strike in August. Hussain, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Hussain Al-Britani, had posted a \"kill list\" in March purporting to contain personal information on 100 U.S. service members. \nOn Aug, 11, Hussain posted the new information on the web and tweeted: \"NEW: U.S. Military AND Government HACKED by the Islamic State Hacking Division!\" \nThe stolen data was intended to provide the group's supporters in the U.S. and elsewhere with background information for conducting terrorist attacks against those individuals, according to U.S. officials. \nThe company that owned the infiltrated data was not identified in the complaint. It is not clear whether the server was used by a government or military contractor. The complaint said the compromised server was located in Phoenix and leased exclusively by the company from a hosting service.
