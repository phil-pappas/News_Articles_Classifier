Through this, Staminus looks to show how Webair has successfully automated customer protection integration and alerts using custom API that runs through the data from the Staminus network, as well as highlight the benefits of working cooperatively to improve cybersecurity functionality on both sides. Webair is also leveraging its partnership with Staminus to offer DDoS-Protected IP Transit provided via BGP routing or a simple IP gateway. Webair’s DDoS-protected IP Transit offers world-class connectivity via multiple Tier-1 providers as well as direct peering with 100+ private peers.\n“DDoS mitigation technology has historically been seen as manual, complex, and cumbersome,” says Staminus CEO Matt Mahvi within the case study. “Webair's integration with the Staminus DDoS API is the next generation of automation in DDoS mitigation for providers and enterprises, allowing the operator to have full visibility and control into what has commonly been seen as a black box with other vendors.” The case study is available at Staminus' website with full details.\nAbout Staminus:\nStaminus is an international DDoS solutions provider that has been protecting enterprises and small businesses for the past 15 years.
