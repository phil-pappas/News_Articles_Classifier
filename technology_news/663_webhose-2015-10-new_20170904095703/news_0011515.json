Facebook is now letting users set a 7-second, looping video as their profile image.\nThats just one of several changes Facebook has in the works.

There is now a one-line bio field you can fill out; you can select which of your \"About\" fields, like work and eduction, are visible; and pick which one you gets highlighted the most prominently.
