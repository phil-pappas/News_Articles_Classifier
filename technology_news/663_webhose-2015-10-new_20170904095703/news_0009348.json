Additionally, 43 of the flights were made in NYC's highly restricted airspace and didn't receive clearance from air traffic control. \nThe FAA notified SkyPan of the penalties in a letter. After receiving notice, the company has 30 days to respond to the FAA's proposed fine. \nSkyPan told CNNMoney that it had not yet reviewed the case and could not comment on the fine. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
