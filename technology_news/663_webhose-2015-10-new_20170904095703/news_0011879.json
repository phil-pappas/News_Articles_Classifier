The radio frequency, electromagnetic compatibility and antenna test laboratory provides additional testing space required for larger and mobile vehicle-mounted projects.\nThis will enable it to test vehicles in a wide variety of radio frequency spectrum tests, enabling maximum function while maintaining accurate performance measurement.\nDr Mahbub Hoque, radio frequency communications division chief, space and terrestrial communications directorate, said, “There is a critical need for such a chamber and the important capabilities it will provide for CERDEC and the APG community.”\nThe chamber gives CERDEC the space and flexibility to drive in the largest army ground vehicle with test platforms aboard, then rotate it 360 degrees, all while remaining under testable conditions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:57:06.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
