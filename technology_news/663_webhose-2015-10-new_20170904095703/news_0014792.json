But it was New Zealand's early goal which helped them take the edge over India and allowed them to register the win.\nThe first quarter started with a brisk pace with both the team looking at dominating ball possession. It was the Kiwis who went ahead in the 5th minute when they were awarded a penalty corner and Nick Haig flicked the ball on the top right corner of the goal to give New Zealand the 1-0 lead.\nTeam India intensified the attack with Nikkin Thimmaih from right flank pushed the ball inside the opponent circle but a vigilant New Zealand defence denied any scoring chance. The score line remained 1-0 in favour of New Zealand at the end of first quarter.\nIndia held possession at the start of the second quarter and attacked the New Zealand circle from the right flank. Akashdeep Singh pushed the ball to Ramandeep Singh who failed to capitalise on the pass.\nIn the 27th minute, it was New Zealand's counter attack which helped Jared Panchia to score through a field effort, taking the score to 2-0 in their favour.\nWhile India trailed but they were seen attacking and looking at opening their score. Unable to add any goals, the second half ended with India trailing 0-2.\nThe third and fourth quarter saw both the teams trying to add to the scorecard but the defence of both the teams proved stronger in thwarting all attempts.\nThird quarter saw Nikkin Thimmaiah entering the D with a clear intent of finding the nets. But the Kiwi defence held him back and India were yet again denied a goal.\nThis was immediately followed by Birendra Lakra trying to cash in on an opportunity but was denied by the Kiwi goalie.\nIndia will now play the hosts in the second game of the tour at Nelson tomorrow.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:25:58.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
