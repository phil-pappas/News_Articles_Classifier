Quick Clicks 'Second Snowden' leaks info on 'drone wars' \nAccording to an FAA statement, the flights were made in New York City and Chicago -- areas with \"congested airspace.\" \nConcerns over an increased number of the inexpensive robots being operated near airports and other no-fly zones helped prompt the creation of the registry, according to a Washington Post report. \nThe SkyPan fine is the largest civil penalty ever proposed by the FAA against a drone operator. \nSkyPan provides clients with aerial photos of cityscapes that it collects using special mini-helicopters equipped with cameras. \n\"Flying unmanned aircraft in violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations is illegal and can be dangerous,\" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. \"We have the safest airspace in the world, and everyone who uses it must understand and observe our comprehensive set of rules and regulations.\" \nThe FAA also said the unmanned aircraft didn't have the proper certification and registration. Additionally, 43 of the flights were made in NYC's highly restricted airspace and didn't receive clearance from air traffic control. \nThe FAA notified SkyPan of the penalties in a letter. After receiving notice, the company has 30 days to respond to the FAA's proposed fine. \nSkyPan told CNNMoney that it had not yet reviewed the case and could not comment on the fine. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
