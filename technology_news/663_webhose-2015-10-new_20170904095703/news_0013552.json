It believes that the Reclassification will benefit Comcast’s shareholders by, among other things, eliminating investor confusion caused by having two classes of publicly traded stock and improving the trading liquidity of Comcast’s publicly traded stock. \nIn connection with the Reclassification, Comcast has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). After Comcast files a definitive proxy statement with the SEC, it will hold a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the Reclassification as soon as practicable. In order to become effective, the Reclassification must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Comcast’s Class A Common Stock and Class A Special Common Stock, in each case voting separately as a class, and its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class. Shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 20, 2015 are entitled to vote at the special meeting. \nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC have provided opinions to Comcast's Board of Directors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth in the respective opinion, the one-for-one reclassification ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Class A Common Stock and the Class A Special Common Stock, respectively. The opinions are included in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC. \nABOUT COMCAST CORPORATION \nComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK) is a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal.
