The audit examined the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's use of the database during the fiscal year ending June 30. \n\"We must take proactive measures to decrease the risk that personal information could be compromised,\" Galloway said in a statement after the audit report was released. \nDepartment spokeswoman Sarah Potter said in a statement that the agency has a \"good\" rating, the second highest on a four-tiered scale, and that the Office of Administration \"uses cutting-edge tools to defend against cyber-attacks\" on the database. \nIn a letter to the department and other state officials, Galloway said the review found \"no deficiencies in internal controls\" but that management policies should be improved and security and privacy controls established. \nKeeping personal information that's not \"necessary for business functions\" puts students at risk of a privacy breach, the report says. The audit cites the unnecessary collection of Social Security numbers, which students who participate in the state's A+ Scholarship program are no longer required to provide. \nThe Department of Elementary and Secondary Education responded by saying it would remove Social Security numbers from the database by June 30, 2016, and ensure the department is collecting only necessary student data. \nThe audit also recommends the state implement a more comprehensive data breach response policy than one that is already in place. The agency says it will adopt such a plan by the end of the year. \nIn September, the education agency ended shared accounts that allowed multiple users to access the database. The audit said that practice undermined individual accountability and could make it difficult to track who makes changes to the system.
