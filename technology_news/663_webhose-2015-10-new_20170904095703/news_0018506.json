At the time, now Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was vocally opposed to the idea, calling it a \"Rolls-Royce\" communications system.\n\"There's no question I was very critical of the proposal for government to build two satellites for the national broadband network,\" Turnbull told Fairfax Media in August after embracing the plan as the government's communications minister.\n\"[The] reason for my criticism was not that satellites are a bad idea; simply they — [the then Labor government] — would have been, in my view, better off contracting with the private sector to provide those services.\"\nIn a statement that has since been removed from his website, Turnbull had said: \"There is enough capacity on private satellites already in orbit or scheduled for launch for the NBN to deliver broadband to the 200,000 or so premises in remote Australia without building its own\".\nLabor's Jason Clare said Australians were \"very lucky\" contracts were signed before Labor lost power.\n\"I think the model we chose is the right one and in his heart of hearts Turnbull knows this is the right one too,\" Clare told Fairfax in August.\nwith Hannah Francis", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/karinakeisler/status/649389321145872384", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/satellite?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/nbn?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SkyMuster?src=hash", "http://t.co/pP7sZHyh6I"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:05:11.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
