Pacific Wave will provide this 100Gbps capability to the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded International Research Network Connections (IRNC) TransPAC4 project, led by Indiana University. Pacific Wave recently received a five-year NSF IRNC award to serve as the U.S. Pacific Rim’s open and distributed interconnection, peering, and exchange fabric, including Software-Defined Exchange (SDX), Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and research DMZ capabilities. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151022005436/en/ \nThis integrated 100Gbps trans-pacific layer 1, 2 and 3 TransPAC – Pacific Wave network fabric incorporates: A dedicated 100Gbps wavelength between the Pacific Wave national Research & Education (R&E) node in Seattle, U.S.A. and Tokyo, Japan 100Gbps peering and routing fabrics – using Brocade MLX routers - in Tokyo and Seattle Access and peering in Tokyo for Asian R&E networks at both the long-standing WIDE/T-REX/T-LEX Open Exchange Point, and at the newly-established Pacific Wave node at 3-8-21 Higashi-Shinagawa, Shinagawa-Ku. The 100Gbps connection in the U.S. using Pacific Wave’s existing 100Gbps open, distributed, wide-area peering and exchange fabric, which is based on a distributed mesh of Brocade MLX routers, across the Pacific Wave backbone, and has primary points of presence in Seattle, Sunnyvale, and Los Angeles, as well as additional 100Gbps access and peering at StarLight in Chicago On the U.S. side, the Pacific Wave fabric provides direct 100Gbps connectivity with multiple 100Gbps interfaces to Internet2’s Advanced Layer 2 and 3 Services (AL3S and AL2S), as well as 100Gbps connectivity to ESnet, and 100Gbps and/or 10Gbps connections to nearly all the major Asia Pacific R&E networks, U.S. Department of Energy’s ESnet, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration N-wave, and commercial cloud providers regularly used by national and international R&E communities. Interconnection of the U.S.-based Pacific Wave and the Japan-based WIDE/T-REX peering, exchange, interconnection and Science-DMZ facilities, creating the first intercontinental R&E open, distributed exchange and peering fabric Extension of the new Pacific Wave experimental SDN and SDX fabrics across the Pacific Ocean to Asia, enabling direct interconnection with Asian R&E SDN and SDX projects, including those supported by WIDE and others. GENI, OpenFlow, and related projects will also be supported Connectivity to Pacific Wave’s 100Gbps wide-area Inter-institutional Science DMZ network, which has primary points of presence within Los Angeles, Seattle, Sunnyvale, and which serves as the backplane for the new NSF-sponsored Pacific Research Platform \n“In the end, the purpose of advanced networking is to accelerate progress in research and education and to speed and broaden our impact on society,” said Dr. David Lassner, president of the University of Hawaii. “This major improvement in both the speed and sophistication in Trans-Pacific connectivity will help our global academic community do both.” \n“This milestone is great news. The world’s hardest problems can only be solved through global collaboration, and 10Gbps links will soon be insufficient to support large-scale science,” said Greg Bell, director of the Scientific Networking Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, and director of the Energy Science Network (ESnet). “Faster data almost always means faster discovery. More important than bandwidth, though, is a growing spirit of international cooperation in our community: multiple stakeholders are working together towards a common goal of open, fast, and safe research networking for the world.\" \nThe TransPAC – Pacific Wave network infrastructure will also specifically support and enable: The TransPAC4 project, including APAN, and other research and education network traffic across the Pacific Significant enhancement of the international GLIF (Global Lambda Integrated Facility) network fabric Direct interconnection of international “Science DMZ” fabrics, including those of Pacific Wave and StarLight with those in Asia and Europe thereby facilitating friction free 100Gbps interconnection of many of the world’s important production science and research data, instrument, and computational resources A broad range of scientific research efforts, including big data and remote instrument based projects that are currently limited by low capability connectivity across the Pacific Ocean Network R&D efforts including better support of big data flows, 8k, 4k, and 3D video distribution, as well as real-time interactive instrument control, virtual reality, and tele-presence applications Faster, more powerful and more flexible interconnections among Pacific Rim and major North American science resources – cloud, compute, storage, and other capabilities important to the research community Extension of the Pacific Wave open peering fabric to include a Tokyo point-of-presence, which directly interconnects with the WIDE/T-REX exchange in Tokyo, thus enabling direct R&E peering and exchange across the Pacific Improved connectivity between Asian collaborators and the international telescopes in Hawaii via the inter-related NSF IRNC project which has been awarded to the University of Hawaii (with CENIC and PNWGP as partners) to team with AARnet in upgrading the existing dual 40Gbps links to two 100Gbps links that terminate on Pacific Wave and provide dual access points in Hawaii \nThe 100Gbps link is presently in operation and the related advanced R&E network peering and other infrastructures are expected to be fully operational later this autumn. \n“This new trans-pacific 100Gbps network fabric, which includes built-in open-exchange and peering, as well as support for SDX, SDN and Research DMZ capabilities, is an important step forward in evolving an optimal, highly flexible global architecture for high-performance interconnection of research and education networks and, most importantly, the world’s researchers and their crucial instruments, data, and applications,” said Professor Jun Murai of Keio University and WIDE. \n“This project brings together some of the most remarkable scientists on both sides of the Pacific, along with an amazing group of technical experts. We are also grateful for the support of commercial partners like Brocade, who provided essential hardware to us and assisted us in quickly deploying this 100Gbps trans-pacific link,” said David Reese, Managing Director of Pacific Wave. \nPacific Wave Participants: \nAARNet, Allen Institute for Brain Science, Amazon, Asia Pacific Advanced Networks, California Community Colleges, California Institute of Technology, California K-12 System, California State University, CANAIRIE (Canada), Carnegie-Mellon University West, CENIC, Center for Infectious Disease Research, CenturyTel, CERNET (China), Chapman University, CineGrid, CISCO, City of Seattle, CSTNet (China), CUDI (Mexico), Defense Research and Engineering Network III, Energy Sciences Network, Exploratorium, Front Range Gigapop, NTT Research GEMnet (Japan), GLIF, GLORIAD, Gonzaga University, Google, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Idaho Regional Optical Network, Institute for Disease Modeling, Institute for Systems Biology, Internet2, JGN-X (Japan), KISTI/KREONet (Korea), Los Nettos, Microsoft Corporation, Microsoft Research, Montana State University, NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Research and Education Network, Naval Postgraduate School, New Mexico GigaPop, Nevada System of Higher Education, NICT (Japan), NII/SINET (Japan), NOAA N-Wave, NOAA PMEL, NORDUnet, North Dakota State University, Northern Wave, Northwest Access Exchange, NSF International Research Network Connections, NTT Research, National University of Singapore Gigapop (NUS-GP), Pacific Northwest Gigapop, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, California Public Libraries, Pepperdine University, PRAGMA, Providence Health & Services, Qatar Foundation (Qatar), ResearchChannel, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle Internet Exchange, Seattle Science Foundation, SF Jazz, Spokane Symphony, Stanford University, Starlight/Translight, Tata Communications, TransPAC (Asia), TWAREN (Taiwan), UltraLight, University of Alaska, University of California, University of Hawaii, University of Montana, University of New Mexico, University of Pennsylvania, Wharton West, University of San Diego, University of San Francisco, University of Southern California, University of Washington, Virginia Mason Medical Center, WA Dept. of Transportation, WA Dept. of Information Services, Washington K-20 Network, Washington State Libraries, Washington State University, Western Regional Network, Western Washington University \nAbout Pacific Wave • www.pacificwave.net \nPacific Wave is a joint project of the Pacific Northwest Gigpop (PNWGP) and CENIC (the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California) which is partially supported by NSF funding.
