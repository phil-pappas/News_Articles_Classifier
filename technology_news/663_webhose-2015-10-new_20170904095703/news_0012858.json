No, it does not actually time travel using a Mr. Fusion home energy reactor, but it is only one of four gold Back to the Future DeLorean’s in the world. 3M prepared their special edition DeLorean for the 30th anniversary of the Back to the Future movie, and they are sharing some movie videos showing off its features. \nIn a related report by the Inquisitr , sports fans should listened to the advice from the Back to the Future II movie and put some money on the Chicago Cubs since they’ve been closer to entering the World Series championship. Speaking of the movies, Christopher Lloyd, who played Doc Brown in the series, made some waves on the internet lately when he suggested that he was open to filming a Back to the Future sequel . \nWhen you stop and think about automobiles, 3M is probably not the first company to spring into your mind. In reality, 3M has been in the automotive industry for 100 years, and there are over 20 3M products that are used by other car manufacturers in their vehicles. They provide products for automotive manufacturers, dealers, auto body shops, NASCAR, and DIY projects. \nIn order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Back to the Future car, 3M wanted to join their iconic brand with an iconic car by turning a fourth DeLorean gold using their 1080 car wrapping product. They also created a Back to the Future parody video that mimics the special effects available during the 1980s. <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WmS0niy5ClA?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \nBesides the parody video, 3M also produced a video showing how they made the gold Back to the Future car. <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KF-acicxQwM?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \n3M also spent the time enhancing the standard DeLorean DMC-12 car. No, they did not add a functioning flux capacitor, which has now been recalled by the Canadian government. \n“On a certain DMC-12 car converted into a time machine, a defect in the flux capacitor could lead to inability to travel through time while travelling at 88 miles per hour (141.6 km/h) and may increase energy consumption beyond 1.21 gigawatts,” the press release says, referencing the speed at which the Back to the Future DeLorean could travel to the future. “This could have disastrous consequences.” \nSorry, no time travel for you. But 3M’s Wheel Weight System promises to balance the vehicle and provide a smoother ride, better gas mileage, and more even tire wear. They also added the 3M Automotive Window Film Crystalline Series, which allows up to 90 percent of the light in while rejecting heat and blocking 99.9 percent of UV rays. \nOf course, while the driver won’t have to worry about sunshine, the reflection off that gold wrap is likely to be blinding everyone else stuck in traffic with this Back to the Future car. But that glossy shine will only show off this rare car even more. The DeLorean Motor Company built less than 10,000 vehicles, and only three were gold-plated as part of a special factory project. \nAs noted by Popular Mechanics , the original advertisements for the gold Back to the Future car were looking into the future. \n“The car of the future—a sportscar so spectacular that it surpasses the imagination. From its dramatic gull wing doors and outer surface of glittering 24 karat gold to its Colin Chapman world championship automotive engineering, the DeLorean glides into the future with a grace and authority that is seldom seen. \n“The luxury is unbelievable. Specially commissioned by you alone—as conceived by the great Giorgetto Giugiaro—the DeLorean is a masterpiece of engineering and design. And, as befits its extraordinary character, the entire corrosion-free stainless steel outer body panels of this limited edition DeLorean will be electroplated with pure 24 karat gold.” \nBack in the day, the gold Back to the Future car sold for an amazing $85,000, which is about $250,000 USD in today’s money. Unfortunately, they only sold three out of the 100 planned gold editions, but now it’s possible to create your own gold DeLorean DMC-12 if you so desire. \n[Image via DMCTalk Forum]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:12:40.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
