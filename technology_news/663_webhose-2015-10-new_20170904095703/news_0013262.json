The provided controls within the standard confirm that DataBank adheres to some of the strictest requirements in the industry for infrastructure reliability and site security. In addition, the report also helps DataBank’s clients manage their IT controls, which improves their overall business performance.\n“The scope of conducting these audits across all our facilities can be an intensive undertaking,” said Kevin Ooley, CFO and EVP of DataBank. “The audit process provides our customers with confirmation we build, maintain and operate our facilities to the highest levels in the industry.”\nThe examinations were performed by a full-service audit and consulting firm that specializes in integrated compliance solutions, including conducting SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations. SSAE -16, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”), is the most widely recognized authoritative guidance that provides service organizations a uniform method for disclosing independently assessed information about the design and operation of internal controls related to their services. Companies who complete annual examinations are able to demonstrate a substantially higher level of assurance and operationally visibility than those companies who do not. The Service Auditors’ Report issued with an unqualified opinion, demonstrates that DataBank’s control activities were effectively designed and in operation throughout the reporting period.\nTo learn more about DataBank, the company facilities, compliance standards, and the company’s complete suite of service solutions, please visit the corporate website at http://www.databank.com .\nAbout DataBank\nDataBank is a leading provider of enterprise-class business solutions for Data Center, Managed Services, and Cloud.
