With just a touch, M.Y.S.T.I.C © lets you document, store, report and share real-time information when, where and how it’s required.\nOldsmar, FL (PRWEB) October 01, 2015\nBattlefield Clearance Team Licensing Company’s (BCTL) revolutionary and unique system for locating munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) debuts October 1, when it will first be available for hands-on demonstration.\nBCTL developed its M.Y.S.T.I.C. © (Munitions Yoking Software Technological Information Core) program to tackle the labor-intensive and time consuming task of clearing target ranges and munitions testing sites, of which there are some 3,500 in the U.S. alone and countless others around the world. In many cases, these are decommissioned bases which have been turned over to state governments. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations require these sites to be cleared of MEC prior to development for other uses, which range from new private industry facilities to golf courses. The agency cites such environmental issues as ground and water contamination, as well as threats to endangered plant or animal life.\nFor decades, MEC professionals have relied on pencil-and-paper methodologies for locating and clearing MEC. This frequently resulted in prolonged delays plagued by bad weather, errors, lost reports and inefficient tracking, among other issues. With the advent of M.Y.S.T.I.C. ©, this work can be completed more efficiently with digitized tracking and reporting and more accurate mapping, as well as provide better and more reporting options for all levels of management. The M.Y.S.T.I.C. © solution provides remote, near real-time oversight of field-level mapping and reporting operations to enhance accuracy, safety and transparency while reducing costs, resources and time at all levels and greatly reducing fraud, waste and abuse.\nM.Y.S.T.I.C. is an Android-based software program, but is easily adapted for Windows-based use. (The iOS application will be available very soon.) It can be integrated into any ruggedized tablet, such as the Harris RF-3590 or the Panasonic Toughpad. The system can operate in either a military-approved cloud-based server or on the customer’s own secure server.\nTo learn more about M.Y.S.T.I.C. © and its applications, visit http://www.bctluxo.com or call 727-787-2071.\nAbout Battlefield Clearance Team Licensing Company\nBCTL is globally engaged in support of our customer’s mission: safe geolocation of unexploded ordinance and other specified objects of concern, rendering the area of operations safe from serious injury or loss of life.
