Announces Commitment To Advance The Lives Of One Million Women Through Expansion Of Its Award-Winning, Signature Education Program \nBy sharing its proprietary P.A.C.E program with other organizations, company seeks to harness collective action for the advancement of women throughout the world \nArt Peck, chief executive officer of Gap Inc., announced recently a significant Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action to advance the lives of one million women by 2020 by expanding the company’s award-winning life-skills education program, Gap Inc. P.A.C.E. (Personal Advancement & Career Enhancement). \nTo achieve this ambitious goal, Peck outlined plans to continue scaling the P.A.C.E. program within Gap Inc.’s global supply chain and in communities around the world. Additionally, P.A.C.E. will broaden into a suite of learning programs with new curriculum to reach adolescent girls in their communities as well as a women’s leadership program for P.A.C.E. graduates or women in communities who have demonstrated leadership ability. And, for the first time, Gap Inc. will offer access to this signature proprietary program to global partners and other corporations to further broaden the program’s reach. \n“From Phnom Penh to Pittsburgh, women share in common an ambition to advance. What some lack are opportunities, particularly access to education,” said Peck. “We are committed to advancing the lives of one million women by expanding our P.A.C.E. program, and we hope others will join us. We know that with the right opportunities, women become powerful agents of change in their families and in their communities.” \nLaunched in 2007, P.A.C.E. delivers tangible change in women’s lives. Designed as an education program offering life-skills classes to female garment workers, the holistic curriculum includes up to 80 hours of classes in as many as nine subject areas, such as communication skills; financial literacy; time and stress management; and problem solving and decision-making. \nP.A.C.E.’s evaluation results have demonstrated that the program improves the lives of women and their families by developing women’s knowledge, skills and confidence. The program also has a strong business impact by reducing turnover and absenteeism. Among the awards P.A.C.E. has received is the 2014 Empowerment of Women Award by the Global CSR Summit & Awards. \nP.A.C.E. caught the attention of President Bill Clinton in 2012, at which time the former president encouraged Gap Inc. to consider expanding the footprint of P.A.C.E to benefit more women globally. It was therefore fitting that Peck delivered the company’s commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, held this week in New York. \nTo date, P.A.C.E. has reached more than 30,000 women in ten countries. Gap Inc. initially offered the program in factories manufacturing its products. In 2012 the company expanded the program into community settings. With this announcement, the curriculum can now be leveraged in a variety of settings with a broad set of partners. \nToday’s announcement will further expand P.A.C.E.’s reach by: \nCollaborating with new and existing partners, including others in the garment industry, corporations, development agencies, and NGOs, to reach one million women in both manufacturing and community settings. \nOpening the proprietary program to select partners, through a no-fee, franchise-type model. These new partners will receive extensive training on the P.A.C.E. curriculum in order to replicate the program’s success. \nExpanding the scope of the P.A.C.E. curriculum to create a suite of learning programs, including a new educational program for girls in the community, ages 13-18, and a new women’s leadership curriculum. \n“P.A.C.E.’s newly expanded life-skills education program is designed to meet the needs of women and girls wherever they are in their lives,” said Dotti Hatcher, Gap Inc. Executive Director, P.A.C.E. Global Programs. “The new curricula will give girls the skills, confidence and technical abilities they need to change the trajectory of their lives and empower women to lead their communities. We believe in advancing women to advance the world.” \nLongtime P.A.C.E partners Swasti Health Resource Centre, an international organization focused on public health outcomes for the poor; the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), a global institute dedicated to empowering women; and CARE, a leading global humanitarian organization, will continue to play pivotal roles in the program’s expansion. \nTo mark the call to action to educate one million women, hundreds of Gap Inc. employees will gather in Times Square on Wednesday, September 30 to build a pop-up artistic representation of just one of the incredible women who have graduated from the P.A.C.E. program. \nAbout Gap Inc.
