I am very excited about the prospects for OncoSec as we develop therapies that aim to harness the immune system to fight cancer and address a great unmet medical need in oncology: anti-PD-1 non-responders. OncoSec's talented and professional team has the experience, insight, and resources to advance our R&D and clinical efforts to capture the value in this opportunity.\" \nFINANCIAL RESULTS For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, OncoSec reported a net loss of $6.5 million and $21.2 million, or $0.48 per share and $1.67 per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $3.6 million and $12.0 million, or $0.30 per share and $1.26 per share, respectively, for the same period last year. The increase in net loss for the year ended July 31, 2015, compared with the same period in 2014, resulted primarily from (i) an increase in headcount as OncoSec continues to grow its discovery research and clinical teams, (ii) additional outside services costs to support its device development and clinical activities and (iii) corporate communication, financing and other administrative investments to expand investor awareness and list the Company on The Nasdaq Stock Market. There were no revenues for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2015 or July 31, 2014. \nResearch and development expenses were $3.8 million and $13.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $5.8 million for the same periods in 2014. General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million and $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, compared to $1.7 million and $6.2 million for the same period in 2014. \nAt July 31, 2015, OncoSec had $32.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $37.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 2014. OncoSec expects these funds to be sufficient to allow it to continue to operate its business for at least the next 12 months. \nAbout OncoSec Medical Incorporated OncoSec is a biotechnology company developing DNA-based intratumoral immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.
