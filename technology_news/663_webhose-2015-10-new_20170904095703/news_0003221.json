Every October, the Department of Homeland Security designates the entire month as National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM). \"Cyberthreats are increasing in their frequency, scale and sophistication,\" deputy secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said. \"Each American is a key part of our nation's first line of defense and in minimizing the impact of cyber attacks.\"\nThere are multiple ways people can be more secure online without having to become an expert in the field. Below are five suggestions for becoming a safer Internet user:\n1. Make cybersecurity fun \nSome schools are using the awareness month to educate students on keeping their online information safe while still keeping it fun. For example, the University of Alabama at Huntsville is offering multiple opportunities for students to celebrate NCSAM, including a fact-or-fiction game and a password-cracking challenge.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Pittenger: 'We're a lion with no teeth' \"Tracking this money is just an enormous challenge and this will just compound everything.\"\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/19/15 1:00 AM Although not everyone can take part in the college-sponsored activities, there are plenty of other avenues to learn about cybersecurity in a way that does not involve reading through large government PDFs. OnGuardOnline.gov offers free games and video tutorials that cover the gamut of opportunities for cybersecurity pitfalls, such as online shopping websites, mobile apps and phishing scams. Best of all, these games and tutorials are geared toward both adults and kids.\n2. Study up \nFor the past four years, the Department of Homeland Security has sponsored the \"Stop.Think.Connect.\" campaign as part of NCSAM. The purpose of the campaign is to educate communities about how to make smart online choices.\nThe campaign's website includes a three-point checklist of questions to ask yourself before doing anything online. Practicing these steps when using the Internet can help protect users from scammers.\nIn addition to general tips for Internet use, the Stop.Think.Connect. website also offers materials for specific groups, such as students, older people, small businesses and young professionals.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pass the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act now Bill to reduce suffering of people with untreated serious mental illness has not been brought up for a vote.\nBy Representative Tim Murphy • 10/19/15 12:01 AM If you want to go even deeper but do not have a computer science degree, the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team has a list of tips specifically geared toward people without technical knowledge of computers. The list covers everything from dealing with malware to file-sharing risks, all in language that the average person can understand and use.\n3. Talk about it \nFor those with questions or comments about cybersecurity and how it applies to their daily lives, NCSAM is offering a Twitter chat series throughout the month of October. Every Thursday from 3 to 4 p.m. EST, users can discuss cybersecurity with a variety of experts just by using the hashtag #ChatSTC.\nFeatured guests in this year's Twitter chat include the Identity Theft Resource Center, Norton by Symantec and the Federal Trade Commission.\nFor those who prefer face-to-face communication, the National Cyber Security Alliance is hosting multiple events around the country on a variety of cyber-related topics. On Oct. 20, the National Cybersecurity Institute in Washington, D.C. will hold its 2015 summit on cyber liability insurance as well as cyber risks. The half-day event will feature a keynote address followed by several smaller sessions and a Q&A opportunity.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner The Sanders-Clinton college cost-shifting plan Democrats like to frame their proposals as one for \"free college tuition,\" but there is no such thing.\nBy Washington Examiner • 10/19/15 12:01 AM 4. See something, say something \nPart of ensuring cybersecurity is by stopping cybercrime in its tracks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) helps people file complaints of online fraud against perpetrators. Those who file are asked to fill out specific questions regarding the person or organization that committed fraud, as well as details about how the reporting party was victimized.\nFor those who are not sure whether something online is a scam or not, IC3 also keeps a list of common scams and schemes , such as the well-known \"Nigerian letter\" or debt elimination scams.\nReporting cybercrime helps experts warn the public of new schemes that could pose a threat, as well as get justice for the victims.\n5. Become a local advocate \nOnce you have learned how to protect yourself from cybersecurity pitfalls, why not use that knowledge to help keep others safe?\n\"... We must recognize our shared responsibility to make cyberspace a more secure environment for ourselves and future generations,\" the Department of Homeland Security's webpage on advocacy reads. \"There are things you can do right now to protect Americans from online risks by becoming a cybersecurity advocate in your home, office, and community.\"\nYou don't have to work for a cybersecurity agency to enforce safe practices. Instead, the DHS encourages people to organize trainings for their workplaces, discuss Internet safety with family and friends, and advocate for teaching about cybersecurity in schools.\nC-SAVE is a program that empowers volunteers to teach students of all ages about how to stay safe online. Its website offers a 60-minute presentation along with take-home and in-class activities. Although it is not intended to be all-encompassing, C-SAVE's goal is to give students a basic toolkit to use for their online activities.\nThis article appears in the Oct. 19 edition of the Washington Examiner magazine. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:54:33.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
