The lowest level was in the Chevrolet Equinox, the highest in the Mazda 6. \nThe researchers found that a driver traveling at 25 miles (40 kilometers) per hour continues to be distracted for up to 27 seconds after disconnecting from \"highly distracting\" phone and car voice-command systems, and up to 15 seconds after disconnecting from the moderately distracting systems. \n\"Just because these systems are in the car doesn't mean it's a good idea to use them while you are driving,\" says University of Utah psychology professor David Strayer, who led the research. \n\"They are very distracting, very error prone and very frustrating to use. Far too many people are dying because of distraction on the roadway, and putting another source of distraction at the fingertips of drivers is not a good idea. It's better not to use them when you are driving.\" \n- Singling out technology - \nBut Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, said these technologies should not be singled out as the source of distracted driving. \n\"In-vehicle distractions arise from a variety of sources, from eating while driving to using paper maps,\" Shapiro said. \n\"The big overall goal is to reduce distracted driving, rather than ignore all controllable factors except for voice recognition,\" he said. \n\"Technology continues to reduce distractions. Voice controls are obviously safer than sitting with a paper map in your lap.\" \nShapiro argued that \"innovation holds the key to safety for drivers, and rapidly evolving technology can help make the driving experience even safer.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:36:42.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
