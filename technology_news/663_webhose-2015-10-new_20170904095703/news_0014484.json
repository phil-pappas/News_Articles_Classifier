Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $US14.83bn.\nThe semiconductor giant's shares, up 1.8 per cent over the past year, added 1 per cent in recent after-hours trading.\nThe company's biggest business remains chips that power PCs, a sector that continued to struggle in the latest quarter, with IDC and rival Gartner both reporting that shipments declined in the period and received little help from the release of Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system.\nBuyers also may be putting off purchases until the arrival of PCs built with Skylake, a long-awaited overhaul of Intel's flagship Core line of microprocessors, which aren't expected to reach many consumers until later this fall.\nIn the latest quarter, revenue in the company's client computing group, which includes PCs, fell 7.5 per cent to $US8.51bn. PC chip shipments declined 19 per cent, but the drop was partly offset by a 15 per cent increase in average selling prices, Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith disclosed in a written commentary.\nIntel continued to post sales growth in its data center group and Internet of Things unit, which includes chips for just about everything but computers.\nData center segment sales grew 12 per cent to $US4.14bn as shipment volume and average prices both increased 6 per cent.\nSales in the Internet of Things unit increased nearly 10 per cent to $US581m.\nOverall, Intel reported a profit of $US3.11bn, or US64c a share, down from $US3.32bn, or US66c a share, a year earlier. Revenue decreased 0.6 per cent to $US14.47bn from $US14.55bn.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of US59c and revenue of $US14.22bn. The semiconductor giant in July projected revenue of $US14.3bn, plus or minus $US500m.\nGross margin fell to 63 per cent from 65 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:09:18.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
