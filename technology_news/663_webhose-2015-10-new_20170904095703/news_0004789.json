While study after study document the serious side effects of osteoporosis drugs, one recent study shows significant success in reversing bone loss, without drugs.\nThe study, published in the Journal of Osteoporosis and Physical Activity, observed the efficacy of a breakthrough osteogenic loading system called bioDensity in building bone mass among postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteopenia. Over the course of 24 weeks using bioDensity once a week, the female test subjects were able to comfortably load up to seven times their body weight on their hips and lower extremities, and up to double their body weight on their spines – force production levels that correlated to an average of 14.9 percent increase in hip bone density, and 16.6 percent increase in spinal bone density, among a subset of subjects undergoing DXA scans.\nWhile consistent with the results of a large-scale, one-year study conducted by University of Wisconsin Stevens Point researchers in 2014, these results for a specifically defined target of postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis or osteopenia showed even more dramatic bone growth, in a shorter period of time, than that documented for the more general population studied previously.\nBased on the well-accepted scientific principles of Wolff’s law, osteogenic loading at multiples of body weight has long been recognized as the most effective means of building bone mass. But only with the invention of bioDensity have biomedical engineers figured out how to generate high enough levels of loading stimulus to accomplish significant bone growth, with minimal risk of injury.\n“I knew bone loss could be reversed just like muscle loss,” said bioDensity inventor John Jaquish, Ph.D., chief science and technology officer for Performance Health Systems. “But there was no existing ‘exercise’ for bone; I had to create it.”\nJaquish’s patented bioDensity system places users in optimal biomechanical positions to safely load multiples of their body weight for short periods of time. Resultantly, the intense compressive forces distort bone mass causing bone synthesizing cells, known as osteoblasts, to absorb minerals to reinforce the structure of the bone, making it harder and less porous. The recommended bioDensity regimen is one session a week, consisting of four brief load exposures that emulate impact loading, but without the risk of injury. Because load is self-created with bioDensity, it’s the user’s own comfort that ensures chance of injury is almost nonexistent.\nAn estimated 28 million people in the United States, alone, are affected by osteoporosis – a disease that leads to as many deaths annually, through bone fractures, as breast cancer.\nFor additional information on bioDensity, including a list of wellness centers and medical facilities around the world where the system can be found, visit biodensity.com.\nbioDensity is owned, manufactured and distributed by Northbrook, Ill.-based Performance Health Systems LLC, a global company specializing in the delivery of advanced technology solutions through its health and wellness equipment. In addition to bioDensity, Performance Health Systems is the parent company of Power Plate®, the world’s leading brand of whole-body vibration exercise equipment, for both home and professional use.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13019576.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13019576.htm"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:23:23.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
