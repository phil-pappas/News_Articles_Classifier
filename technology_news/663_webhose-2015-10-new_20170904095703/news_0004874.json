The OTT service will also add a multi-language option, with Spanish, Portuguese and English, in both audio and subtitles. \n“HBO's subscribers love TV entertainment and all our fans should have access to HBO GO ,\" added Rubio. “Our main goal is to increase the reach of HBO's brand as a valued offer and more people can participate in the social wonder our content creates.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:05:57.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
