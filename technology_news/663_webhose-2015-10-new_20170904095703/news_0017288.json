They asked them to respond to questions about why people would choose to cheat on a social media game. \nThe responses break down into two main categories. The first consists of players who define cheating in a social network game as breaking with the social behaviour that is expected of players. \nThe second group is made up of those who define cheating as simply playing outside of the formal game rules. \nResearcher Mia Consalvo said that for some participants, specific actions or practices did not determine what was cheating, instead, they defined cheating by the purposes or motives behind those actions or practices. \nThe majority of survey respondents reported at least some kind of cheating. They admitted to playing social network games to help friends or family members advance their scores, and to asking friends or family to play a social network game in order to advance their own scores, and to adding strangers to do the same. \nIn addition, a high number of participants admitted to purchasing currency to advance play, creating multiple accounts and logging into someone else's account. \nConsalvo said that players believed cheating might be different based on the platform on which play takes place, concluding players believed social network games were not real games, so they could not cheat at them. \nThe study is published in the Journal New Media and Society.
