Reuters/Damir Sagolj \nNEW YORK The University of Wisconsin-Madison's patent licensing body will not be able to extract triple damages from Apple as a jury weighs how much the iPhone maker must pay for using its microchip technology without permission, a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday. \nOn Tuesday, a federal jury in Madison, Wisconsin said Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) infringed a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) patent which helps improve the performance of computer processors. The foundation is claiming approximately $400 million in damages. \nWith a verdict on damages that could come as early as today, U.S. District Judge William Conley said in his ruling that WARF could not prove that Apple infringed its patent willfully. It is a welcome development for Apple, which no longer risks having the damage award increased by up to three times, which is allowed in federal law for recklessly infringing a patent. \nRelated Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:22:50.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
