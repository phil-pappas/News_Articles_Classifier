Their current IT environment caused huge downtimes and consisted of approx. 100 virtual machines based on three pools. It turned out that the company’s hardware and software were not compatible and did not integrate with each other very well. This caused many problems and a major decrease in performance.\nCOMPRION started looking for a new solution and assigned the project to Open-E Gold Partner Boston Server & Storage Solutions from Germany. Boston delivered new hardware and recommended testing the ZFS- and Linux-based Open-E JovianDSS software with a trial version. COMPRION was immediately convinced of the new solution as they were able to gain more capacity, significantly improve performance and reduce latency. Capacity was saved due to a new setup with two pools (1 x 600 SAS, 1 x 2TB SATA) instead of the previous three. Also, the protocol was switched from NFS to iSCSI.\nThe new software, Open-E JovianDSS, was installed on an Open-E Certified Storage Server from Boston Server & Storage Solutions which ensured seamless integration and didn’t cause any performance degradation. The Igloo 4U-24T-Stor consists of two Intel® Xeon® processors E5-2630 v3 2.40GHz as well as 12 certified 8GB DDR4 2133MHz ECC registered. The raw capacity is 22TB.\nSebastian Wegener, IT administrator at COMPRION about the new storage environment: “We are absolutely happy with our new Software Defined solution. The intuitive interface of Open-E JovianDSS is much easier to use than the previous one. The administrative effort could also be reduced significantly. Implementing the software was very easy as it was similar to our old storage environment. Moving the data during ongoing operations also worked very well by using vCenter and caused no downtime at all.”\nA detailed description of this customer case can be found on the Open-E website .\nAbout COMPRION\nCOMPRION is the worldwide leading manufacturer of test solutions for terminals and smart cards covering contact-based and contactless technologies.
