I had to read more about it. I came across a quotation that says, \"Any fool can despise what he cannot understand or comprehend.\"\nI reverted back to what Fanon said in Black Skin, White Masks when he said \"Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief.\"\nWhen Malik Al Shabaaz (Malcolm X) wrote in his autobiography, he said “You have to be very careful introducing the truth to the black man, who has never previously heard the truth about himself. The black brother is so brainwashed that he may reject the truth when he first hears it. You have to drop a little bit on him at a time, and wait a while to let that sink in before advancing to the next step.\" He understood and was in agreement with Fanon that we as African people suffers the most because we refuse to believe any alternative view to the one we hold even when facts are presented before us. Marketing and advertising have since conquered this behaviour by using words like 'scientifically proven’, 'well researched' or that it is endorsed by a famous person. In politics that has been somehow different.\nPolitical members seem to be stuck in their own fictional world of disbelief and refusing to see any alternative to what they hold dearest. Some maybe are even scared to be called 'political prostitutes' by changing their views whenever new views are presented. Some have no idea on which philosophy they are following and whatever their leader says is taken as the bible verse to never be questioned. Never question the morals or the thinking or lack-of thinking from their leaders, they would want to kill you even when you present to them the truth.\nTake for example the ANC under Jacob Zuma; its members would disagree with you vehemently if you were to say that they are in the decline. They believe that they will rule SA \"until Jesus comes\". Even when they know that their conditions since apartheid days are not over, they would not move beyond the fact that the ANC has failed and is failing to deliver the promises as stipulated in the \"People's Freedom Demands\" (As much as they were doctored by the COD). Their stand remains that the ANC is the only party that can bring them out of poverty.\nThis cognitive dissonance thinking needs to be administered carefully as if it prevails for longer, we will find ourselves in a position or no return. Furthermore, we need to have leaders who can teach self-consciousness to our people to realise the bonds that are holding them back.\nWe are yet to gain true Freedom. We are not yet to uhuru. We need self-discovery first and we shall reach our freedom goals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:43:48.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
