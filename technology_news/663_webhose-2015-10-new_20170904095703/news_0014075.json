Communities become more focused on these challenges when they are involved rather than being told from afar by a scientist or an official that there is a problem. Web-based technologies also make it easier to ensure data collection such as bird counts or water testing is done according to sound scientific methodology and to collate the data,\" Dr Smith says. \n\"Citizen Science helps groups to manage their local environments to the highest level, and supports scientists to better understand the cultural side of ecosystem restoration. The growth of the Citizen Science movement in New Zealand is part of a welcome international trend. \n\"The Government’s contribution towards this project will help fund a national inventory of monitoring tools and training, user-friendly Citizen Science resources, regional stakeholder working groups in Auckland, Palmerston North, Nelson and Christchurch and a national symposium to share resources and strategies over the next three years. \n\"I am encouraged by the joint commitment of so many community groups to Citizen Science in New Zealand, which will help promote Citizen Science activity and data use and ensure its ongoing success. \n\"This project is a good example of the type of initiative the Community Environment Fund was set up to support. It is a practical project which aims to protect and improve our environment, and increase community involvement and public awareness on some of New Zealand’s most important environmental issues,\" Dr Smith says. \nFurther information on the Fund is available at: www.mfe.govt.nz/more/funding/community-environment-fund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:14:14.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
