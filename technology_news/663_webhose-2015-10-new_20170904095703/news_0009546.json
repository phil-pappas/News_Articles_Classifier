The specialist provider of rotary-processing solutions, which offers the complete service for the manufacturing of special-purpose machinery, has been undergoing live testing. \nSuccessful trials have been completed with cold foil at 25m / min. IIJ's 142 Colour Print system – using Konica Minolta latest printheads – was first shown being used for the variable data for Spilker's system running at Labelexpo that finished on 2 October. Kurz provided the foil. \nLeopoldshöhe, Germany-based Spilker's cold foil solution uses Kurz's metallic foil to provide the highest quality finish, which also enables the use of security and decorative holographic images within the foil. Samples printed at Labelexpo were also shown to visitors on IIJ's own stand at the show. \nPaddy O'Hara, IIJ's Director of Technology, said: \"Results have been extremely impressive. Visitors saw the results themselves on our stand and really appreciated the incredible quality being produced. The process is giving a higher quality finish and enabling new applications such as the use of security and decorative holographic images within the foil.\" \nThe cooperation with Spilker was initiated by Jochen Renfordt, IIJ's representative in Germany. Labelexpo was also IIJ's launchpad for its super-fast 600dpi monochrome units, which included unique demonstrations such as 2pt fonts, barcodes and variability. Testing on 1.5mm high variable data was consistently achieved at 100 m / min. \nSaid O'Hara: \"The show was a great success for IIJ, which has a fast-growing reputation in the label markets as well as further afield. Visitors flocked to our stand and we've taken away many good quality leads. We're also expecting to confirm the sale of the actual machine we had on our stand to a UK customer who wants installation before Christmas.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:17:37.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
