When I look back, my only regret is not taking the plunge sooner.”\nAfter losing his job at Macquarie Bank, the 40-year-old programmer with a passion for surfing retreated back home to the central coast region of NSW where he set out to build Invoice2go.\n“As a contractor myself, I needed to send invoices every month to get paid. I looked online for a system to easily create and track all my billing but the only options out there were complex, expensive accounting software programs.”\nAfter 18 months of solid development Invoice2go was born and Strode knew from day one that he was on to something big. However, it wasn’t until Invoice2go went mobile, with the desktop application ported to the iPhone in 2009, that things really took off.\n“It presented a huge opportunity for us because most of our customers are contractors or tradespeople running their business from the road,” he says. “Going mobile meant small businesses could create and send professional invoices on the go and we knew that would be a game changer.”\nOnce the mobile app hit the App Store, word spread quickly and it wasn’t long before it was outselling the desktop version. By 2011, it was one of the top 10 apps in Apple’s App Store. It’s currently the highest grossing business app in 59 countries.\n“It’s all a bit of a blur, coding day and night to get there, but I put the success down to timing and finding that niche in the market for those small businesses that just don’t need a full-blown accounting software system,” Strode says.\nThe app quickly got the attention of US venture capital heavyweights, Accel Partners and Ribbit Capital, who Strode says “pursued us for a number of years”.\n“We were committed to holding off because we wanted to get the product right first. The business was bootstrapped and was profitable from the beginning,” he says.\nStrode adds that being a regional start-up has worked in Invoice2go’s favour. “While it was a lonely road, at times at least we avoided receiving an overload of advice,” he says.\nIt wasn’t until John Locke and Nate Niparko from Accel Partners flew halfway across the world and caught a taxi 92km from Sydney to the small town of Erina in rural NSW, to meet with Strode in person, that the conversation moved to the next level and delivered $35 million in funding for Invoice2go.\n“For the investors, they saw the potential to solve a real challenge shared by businesses globally,” Strode says. “For us, the investment was about bringing people in who had experience scaling a global company.”\nInvoice2go has since doubled its subscriber base and the employee count has grown from about 30 employees to just over 100 spread over four offices across the globe. The app is also now available in 11 languages. While pleased with the rapid expansion of the company, Strode still sees room for growth.\n“There is huge potential for us with 100 million small businesses around the world who all share the same pain points,” he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:52:53.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
