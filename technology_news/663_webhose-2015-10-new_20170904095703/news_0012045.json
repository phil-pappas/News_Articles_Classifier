As much as $100 billion in market value could be added to Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. alone based on after-hours trading.\nTechnology stocks have been the biggest contributor to the advance by far, rising 14 percent since the market bottomed and contributing 17.5 points to the S&P 500’s 184-point increase. Since the bottom and before Thursday’s report, Alphabet had risen 11 percent, Microsoft 19 percent and Amazon.com almost 21 percent.\n“It’s great news to have these gorillas beat estimates, anytime you have Google, Microsoft and Amazon up it will balance out some of the weaker and more lackluster numbers recently,” Vincent Delisle, portfolio strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said in an interview. “The market wants to feel good and it’s a cherry on top with these trademark companies beating estimates.”\nMicrosoft jumped 7.2 percent, Alphabet climbed 9.7 percent and Amazon surged 11 percent at 5:38 p.m. in New York after each reported sales and profits that exceeded analyst estimates. Facebook Inc. didn’t have any news and jumped almost 3 percent anyway. The results lifted futures on the S&P 500 index by about 0.5 percent after the index closed within three points of recording a 10 percent gain since Aug. 25.\nEven amid the most volatile year for U.S. equities since 2011, professional stock forecasters on Wall Street have held steady in their yearend calls. The median estimate in January was for the S&P 500 to reach 2,225 in a year, a target that barely budged until mid-August, when a six-day selloff that erased $2 trillion in market value sent the forecast to 2,150, where it stands today.\nRBC Capital Markets’ Jonathan Golub, whose forecast is 2,100, said in an interview Thursday that his target now has some “upside” again. “It’s frankly happening more than I’d expected or hoped for and I may have not been bullish enough about the resiliency of this market,” he said.\nAfter jumping as much as 1.8 percent Thursday, the benchmark gauge for American equities now sits at a level last seen on Aug. 19 and is 7 points below its Dec. 31, 2014 closing price, making its performance year-to-date just about flat. Slicing it differently: U.S shares have climbed back into the trading range that broke in August, heralding the selloff.\n“We had plenty of people question how we were going to maintain our target,” said John Stoltzfus, the New York-based chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. “Our confidence related to the target has been somewhat vindicated by the action since the end of September. It’s a matter of looking at the economics, and we have an expansion showing sustainability and transparency at the Fed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:45:04.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
