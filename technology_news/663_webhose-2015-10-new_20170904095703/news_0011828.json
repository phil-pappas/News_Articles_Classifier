The entrances have since been reopened.\n\"Council made the decision last week. We had five meetings about the fee increases specifically with student representatives and they were consulted for five months. It was a council decision and only counsel can overturn it,\" spokesperson Shirona Patel told News24.\n\"Some of the admin staff are being prevented from going to their offices but we have made alternative arrangements. The academic programme is continuing as usual.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:18:32.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
