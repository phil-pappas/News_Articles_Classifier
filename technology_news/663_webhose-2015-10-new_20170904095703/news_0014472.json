Graduates then sit for the vendor-neutral CompTIA A+ certification exam. Certified graduates are placed into on-the-job work experiences with local employers. \n\"The IT-Ready workers came in with some excellent technical training, as well as soft skills training that they need in order to quickly integrate into our company,\" said Becky Ryan , senior manager, Enterprise Support Centers, HealthPartners. \"After experiencing the success of IT-Ready graduates, it became clear that IT-Ready training was exactly what we are looking for in new entry-level hires. Not only are these employees technically trained, they have a woderful attitude and are totally engaged in their work environment.\" \nSince 2012, Creating IT Futures has placed more than 150 out-of-work Minnesotans into upwardly mobile IT occupations. Ninety-four percent pass the CompTIA A+ exam and 80 percent of the graduates get full-time IT work. Creating IT Futures secured a permanent office in Edina this spring and now runs four classes a year with 20-26 students per class. \n\"Even before President Obama launched the TechHire Initiative this year, Creating IT Futures recognized that Minneapolis /St. Paul was a great area to grow the IT industry but employers needed more qualified IT workers,\" said Sue Wallace , executive director, Minneapolis / St. Paul , Creating IT Futures Foundation. \"With the community leadership of partners like HealthPartners, IT-Ready is working with more than 60 employers in Minnesota , and is now a major part of Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges' plan to expand tech career opportunities under the TechHire Initiative. We're thrilled to present our Polaris Award to HealthPartners.\" \nDuring an IT-Ready breakfast this morning with speaker Erick Garcia Luna , economic development policy aide, Office of Mayor Betsy Hodges , City of Minneapolis , the Polaris Award was presented to HealthPartners. \nTo see what's required of IT-Ready participants and all that they receive, potential employers, mentors, students and community partners can learn more at www.ITReady.com . \nAbout the Creating IT Futures Foundation As the philanthropic arm of CompTIA, the Creating IT Futures Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charity with the mission of helping populations under-represented in the information technology industry and individuals who are lacking in opportunity to prepare for, secure and be successful in IT careers.
