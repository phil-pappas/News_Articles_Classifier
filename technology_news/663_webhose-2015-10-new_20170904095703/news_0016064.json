This milestone demonstrates the power of combining premier reagent providers with innovative protein analysis systems. The combination will enable scientists to easily transition to quantifying proteins with the Simple Western system from the tedious and semi-quantitative Western Blot method in use today. \n\"Antibody validation and reproducibility are a continuing concern in our industry,\" says Dr. Birte Aggeler , Director of Antibody Development at R&D Systems. \"The Simple Western platform from ProteinSimple ® takes the variability out of the Western blotting process while reducing the time to results and increasing the detection sensitivity. We embarked on a program to assay our most popular antibodies on the Simple Western platform that would provide our customers with a large number of certified reagents to choose from for their research.\" \nThere have been many forums and articles citing the time and cost of poorly validated, poorly performing antibodies to the life science research community. Adding the antibody certification program for Simple Western gives our customers a high level of confidence in the antibodies they purchase from Bio-Techne, saves time and resources in experiment optimization and allows customers to dedicate more time to data analysis. This is an on-going effort that we take very seriously. It shows our dedication to being a responsible and reliable reagent manufacturer. The Simple Western certification project is part of a continuous effort in providing more validation data on our antibodies. \nIn addition to the Simple Western validation data, the certified antibodies are cited in over 200 customer reviews, 6,600 citations in peer reviewed publications, and data from more than 3,000 application validations including Flow Cytometry, Immunocytochemistry, and Immunohistochemistry. \nMore information about the Simple Western certified antibodies and Simple Western is available at http://www.novusbio.com/proteinsimple . \nAbout Bio-Techne \nBio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ: TECH ) is a global life sciences company providing innovative tools and bioactive reagents for the research and clinical diagnostic communities.
