A new survey from global cybersecurity association ISACA suggests a major confidence gap about the security of connected devices between consumers and cybersecurity and information technology professionals. \nAccording to the consumer segment of ISACA’s 2015 IT Risk/Reward Barometer , 81 percent of Indian consumers surveyed are confident they can control the security on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices they own. Yet according to the 7,016 IT and cyber security professionals globally who responded to a parallel survey, only 22 percent feel this same confidence about controlling who has access to information collected by IoT devices in their homes, and 72 percent say manufacturers are not implementing sufficient security in IoT devices. \nIndian consumers say the average number of IoT devices in their home is seven. Smart TVs, smart watches and connected home alarm systems are the most wanted IoT devices to get in the next 12 months. \nHidden Internet of Things \nISACA’s survey of IT and cybersecurity professionals globally depicts an IoT that flies below the radar of many IT organizations – an invisible risk that is underestimated and under-secured: 73 percent estimate the likelihood of an organization, being hacked through an IoT device is medium or high 63 percent think that the increasing use of IoT devices in the workplace has decreased employee privacy 50 percent say their organization’s BYOD (bring your own device) policy does not address wearable tech \n“In the hidden Internet of Things, what is also invisible are the countless entry points that cyber attackers can use to access personal information and corporate data,” said Christos Dimitriadis, International President, ISACA . “The rapid spread of connected devices is outpacing an organization’s ability to manage and safeguard company and employee data.” \nAccording to the cybersecurity and IT professionals surveyed, device manufacturers are falling short. Seventy two percent say they do not believe that manufacturers are implementing sufficient security measures in IoT devices. \n“As the usage of IoT devices increases in India, it is important that device manufacturers adopt an industry-wide security standard that addresses IoT security. They need to install rigorous security governance and professional development for their cybersecurity employees. This move will further boost the acceptance of IoT in the country, as research shows there is a direct relation between positive customer sentiment and companies that can demonstrate credentials,” said Avinash Kadam, Advisor – ISACA India Cybersecurity Initiative . \nISACA established Cybersecurity Nexus (CSX) to help develop the cybersecurity workforce. Details on CSX 2015 conference and the new CSX Practitioner certification: https://cybersecurity.isaca.org . \nISACA’s annual IT Risk/Reward Barometer polls thousands of IT and cybersecurity professionals and consumers worldwide to uncover attitudes and behaviors, and the trade-offs to balance risk and reward. Results: www.isaca.org/risk-reward-barometer . \nISACA ® ( isaca.org ) is a global nonprofit association of 140,000 professionals in 180 countries.
