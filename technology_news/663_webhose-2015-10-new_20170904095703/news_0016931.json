Joins IBM Bluemix, Sendero Health Plans, City of Austin Innovation Office, The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, Design Institute for Health, Latino HealthCare Forum Community HealthCare Workers, St. David's Foundation, and the Rundberg Health & Wellness Initiative in the Cultivate Health Center for Healthy Communities.\nLouisville, KY (PRWEB) October 05, 2015\nJoshua Rosenthal, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder at RowdMap, Inc., will be speaking on creating value in health care at the Cultivate Health Center for Healthy Communities event, sponsored by IBM Bluemix, Sendero Health Plans, City of Austin Innovation Office, The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, Design Institute for Health, Latino HealthCare Forum Community HealthCare Workers, St. David's Foundation, and the Rundberg Health & Wellness Initiative. The presentation entitled, “More than an Idea: Using Data and Technology to Deliver Market Value and Public and Social Good,” will be delivered at the Cultivate Health Center for Healthy Communities event on October 17-18 at IBM located at 11501 Burnet Rd., Austin, Texas. http://cultivatehealth.chctx.org/agenda.html\nThe blueprint for healthcare is overdue for a re-design, come help shape the new design. Cultivate Health will bring together healthcare industry professionals at all levels to serve as resources to you the creative, the programmer, the individual and teams that will make a difference in molding the new healthcare landscape. We will have community healthcare workers from Latino HealthCare Forum, Rundberg community members, registered nurses, physicians and many more.\nNew Healthcare Information Technology (HIT) has been making studies and opening up new vistas to redesign the delivery of care. At the same time the healthcare marketplace has found new interest in population health and determining the prevalence of disease, behaviors of and projected economic impact of health and wellness. To that end, CMS has made historic data releases including the largest data set of doctors and hospitals in history to support identifying provider practice patterns with national and regional benchmarks in order to transition the delivery of care to value based payments. https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-releases/2015-Press-releases-items/2015-06-01.html\nThe interactive BootCamp explores HIT, population health and new economic models for delivering care for diverse communities. Joshua Rosenthal, PhD, will walk the audience through the evolution of an idea to a value proposition giving specific context to why healthcare is so hard and different, but also to why digital health tools can become an incredible way to change how we all experience health. Developers, entrepreneurs and innovators will practice matching their technology, solutions and products with value propositions for the delivery of care in diverse socio-economic communities.\n“It’s easy to start with cool technology or an idea, but the trick is to connect it to a meaningful value proposition. The problem is that healthcare is unlike other markets and historically has suffered from perverse economic incentives from a Fee for Service payment model. Now, with advances in technology, the move to value based economics in the delivery of care, and historical releases of publicly available government data, all the pieces are in place to serve diverse populations in meaningful ways and connect population health to market value with a clear social and economic return on investment.” Joshua Rosenthal, Chief Scientific Office, RowdMap, Inc.\nThose interested in learning more are encouraged to contact RowdMap, Inc. directly or register for Cultivate Health. http://cultivatehealth.chctx.org/index.html\nAbout RowdMap, Inc. :\nAn Ernst and Young EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® winner, RowdMap helps health plans, government payers, providers, and hospital systems develop Risk-Readiness (SM) strategies to excel as they transition from fee-for- service to pay-for value.
