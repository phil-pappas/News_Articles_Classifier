Closing the gender gap has been a top priority at the company since Blake Irving took over as CEO two years ago. And there's solid progress to report. Since last year's GHC, GoDaddy has more than doubled the number of women interns and graduate hires. As a return platinum sponsor of next week's GHC, GoDaddy plans to showcase its transformation journey, share a timely documentary film and engage attendees with an interactive convention-floor booth, which features technology executives and recruiters. The diverse sponsorship approach is part of GoDaddy's quest to attract more women to join its mission to help people easily start, grow and run their own ventures through the use of technology. Overall, women now account for 20 percent of the GoDaddy technical workforce, which while still far below its ultimate goal, is up two percentage points from last year. GoDaddy is also providing all of its colleagues with \"Unconscious Bias\" training, in partnership with the Clayman Institute. Prior to GHC, GoDaddy plans to follow-up on its compensation parity pledge, a commitment made at the White House Demo Day this past summer. \"Gender diversity matters,\" said GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving . \"Diversity of thought reliably translates into better products. We have a gender diverse customer base, why wouldn't you have a gender diverse workforce building those products? I'm heartened by our progress over the past couple years, but we're still far from where we want to be â€” and I'm hoping that the women at GHC this year will help fuel our ongoing quest. Changing the face of tech, changing the lives of small business owners and continuing to drive our own transformation at GoDaddy.\" As part of this year's sponsorship, GoDaddy will again support technology students to attend GHC, including women from Harvey Mudd College , University of California Berkeley, California Polytechnic State University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Louisiana State University and others. New this year, GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving , a long-time tech executive and women's advocate, is delivering a plenary speech from the main stage [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTl6WTJobFpIVnNaUzVuY21GalpXaHZjSEJsY2k1dmNtY3ZjMlZ6YzJsdmJpOTNaV1J1WlhOa1lYa3RZV1owWlhKdWIyOXVMWEJzWlc1aGNua3ZYQ0lnY21Wc1BWd2libTltYjJ4c2IzZGNJaUIwWVhKblpYUTlYQ0pmWW14aGJtdGNJajVYWldSdVpYTmtZWGtnWVhRZ05Eb3pNQ0J3TG0wdUxEd3ZZVDQ9fA==]] titled \"Be the Image You Want to See: The Transformation of GoDaddy, Inc.\" GoDaddy is also underwriting the screening of \"[[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdVkyOWtaV1J2WTNWdFpXNTBZWEo1TG1OdmJTOWNJaUJ5Wld3OVhDSnViMlp2Ykd4dmQxd2lJSFJoY21kbGREMWNJbDlpYkdGdWExd2lQa05QUkVVNklFUmxZblZuWjJsdVp5QjBhR1VnUjJWdVpHVnlJRWRoY0R3dllUND18]],\" a new documentary which focuses on why more women aren't joining the tech ranks given all the economic opportunity.
