The Office for National Statistics said the UK consumer price index fell 0.1% year-on-year last month, compared to analysts' estimates for a flat reading in line with August. \nOn a month-on-month comparison, CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) also dropped 0.1% in September following a 0.2% increase in August. Analysts had predicted 0% growth. \nThe main driver of deflation was discounting at clothing stores and falling petrol and diesel prices. \n\"As UK year-on-year inflation hit negative territory for only the second time since 1960, the impact of persistent disinflation upon Bank of England decision making will no doubt have been playing into traders mind-sets, sending GBP-USD 130 points lower within two hours,\" said IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) market analyst Joshua Mahony. \n\"However, it is also worth bearing in mind that with wages growing at the fastest rate in over a decade, this is a benefit for the consumer and helps make up for all those years where real wages fell repeatedly.\" Chinese trade Chinese exports decreased 3.7% in September from a year earlier in US dollar terms following a 5.5% drop in August, the General Administration of Customs revealed. Analysts had expected a 6% slide. \nImports plunged 20.4% last month, worse than the 15.9% dip predicted, after a 13.8% fall in August. \nThe trade balance, however, unexpectedly widened to $60.34bn in September from $60.24bn a month earlier when a surplus of $47.90bn had been forecast. \n\"Chinese trade figures have been a source of concern for some time now, with both dollar-denominated exports and imports having contracted for most of the year when compared to 12 months previous,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. \"The biggest concern is the huge decline in imports and while a large part of this can be attributed to the collapse in commodity prices and should therefore ease of in the coming months, there does also appear to be a domestic demand problem as well.\" McCafferty calls for rate rise BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) policymaker Ian McCafferty has reiterated that interest rates need to rise to allow more scope for cuts in the event of a financial crisis. \nIn a testimony to the Treasury Committee on the hearing of McCafferty's reappointment to the Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, he said there was a need to return the Bank Rate far enough above zero \"to a level at which it can be an effective instrument\" in tightening or loosening policy. Last Thursday, McCafferty voted in favour of raising interest rates to 0.75% from 0.50%. He was once again the only policymaker to recommend the move. \nRoyal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) tops FTSE fallers Royal Mail was in the red on news the government has sold its remaining stake in the postal service group to professional investors. \nLuxury fashion retailer Burberry was under the cosh amid renewed worries about China - to which it is heavily exposed - following disappointing trade figures. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) edged lower on reports the bank may name US investment banker Jes Stanley as its new chief executive. \nGoing the other way, SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) jumped after the brewer agreed to a Â£68bn takeover offer from AB InBev. \nHousebuilders rallied in line with FTSE 250 peer Bellway (LSE: BWY.L - news ) which gained after posting a 44% jump in full-year profits that beat expectations. Persimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) , Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) and Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) were both firmly in the black. \nPharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) was also on the front foot after JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'underweight' and lifted the price target to 1,370p from 1,320p. The bank noted that medium-term consensus earnings per share estimates have fallen 15-18% year-to-date and expectations now look achievable, with downgrades no longer a concern. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,034.34 -0.00% FTSE 100 6,341.41 -0.47% FTSE 250 16,902.78 -0.50% FTSE 100 - Risers SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) (SAB) 3,949.50p +9.06% GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) (GSK) 1,328.50p +1.72% Persimmon (PSN) 1,967.00p +1.60% Carnival (CCL) 3,384.00p +1.50% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 929.00p +1.42% Berkeley Group Holdings (The) (BKG) 3,250.00p +1.25% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 577.00p +1.23% Barratt Developments (BDEV) 633.50p +1.20% easyJet (EZJ) 1,725.00p +1.17% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 192.70p +1.05% FTSE 100 - Fallers Royal Mail (RMG (LSE: 0HC8.L - news ) ) 453.30p -4.00% Tesco (TSCO) 194.30p -3.74% G4S (Amsterdam: GF6.AS - news ) (GFS (Taiwan OTC: 6026.TWO - news ) ) 248.20p -3.27% Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) (BRBY) 1,427.00p -3.25% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNY - news ) (ADN) 333.80p -3.11% Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) (STAN) 739.40p -3.05% Johnson Matthey (LSE: JMAT.L - news ) (JMAT) 2,520.00p -2.85% Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) (J) (SBRY) 263.80p -2.73% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 205.30p -2.61% Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 118.00p -2.60% FTSE 250 - Risers Michael Page International (Other OTC: MPGPF - news ) (MPI (Other OTC: MNIGF - news ) ) 483.50p +4.16% Bellway (Other OTC: BLWYY - news ) (BWY) 2,453.00p +3.50% Spire Healthcare Group (SPI) 368.30p +3.40% Sophos Group (LSE: SOPH.L - news ) (SOPH) 231.90p +3.25% Auto Trader Group (AUTO) 330.00p +2.96% Crest Nicholson Holdings (CRST) 540.50p +2.85% Virgin Money Holdings (UK) (VM.) 399.90p +2.51% BTG (Other OTC: BTGYY - news ) (BTG (LSE: BTG.L - news ) ) 573.00p +2.32% CLS Holdings (LSE: CLI.L - news ) (CLI) 1,790.00p +2.11% Vectura Group (LSE: VEC.L - news ) (VEC) 165.10p +2.10% FTSE 250 - Fallers Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 135.40p -6.30% Evraz (EVR) 89.20p -5.56% Weir Group (Other OTC: WEIGF - news ) (WEIR) 1,284.00p -4.75% IMI (IMI (LSE: IMI.L - news ) ) 1,012.00p -4.17% Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) (VED) 578.50p -4.14% Rotork (Frankfurt: RO41.F - news ) (ROR) 179.10p -3.92% Home Retail Group (HOME) 144.60p -3.73% Homeserve (LSE: 106666.L - news ) (HSV) 411.00p -3.54% Bodycote (BOY) 556.50p -3.30% Ashmore Group (Other OTC: AJMPF - news ) (ASHM) 282.50p -3.19% FTSE TechMARK - Risers NCC Group (LSE: NCC.L - news ) (NCC (BSE: NCC6.BO - news ) ) 260.00p +4.00% Dialight (DIA (Amsterdam: DI6.AS - news ) ) 664.00p +1.37% Oxford Biomedica (LSE: OXB.L - news ) (OXB) 7.38p +1.37% Triad Group (Stuttgart: TD8.SG - news ) (TRD) 31.50p +0.80% Gresham Computing (LSE: GHT.L - news ) (GHT) 110.50p +0.45% Skyepharma (SKP) 337.25p +0.30% FTSE TechMARK - Fallers Sarossa (SARS) 1.82p -4.71% SDL (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 383.75p -4.06% Spirent Communications (Other OTC: SPMYY - news ) (SPT (Taiwan OTC: 8431.TWO - news ) ) 73.25p -2.98% Oxford Instruments (Other OTC: OXGGY - news ) (OXIG) 677.00p -0.73% Innovation Group (Other OTC: INVGF - news ) (TIG) 39.50p -0.63% BATM Advanced Communications Ltd (Other OTC: BTAVF - news ) .
