Basically you can’t go beyond the limitations of your standard one-size-fits-all HCM solution. \nCriterion is the HR, payroll and recruiting platform that allows you to deploy only what you need. As your organization grows, your ability to scale to larger HCM needs will grow with it. Core HR with integrated self-service, time and attendance, and performance reviews Accurate payroll, payment processing and tax filing Multiple work locations governed by different taxation and overtime rules Unified job posting, applicant tracking and on-boarding \n“You should be excited about your HCM application,” says Sunil Reddy, Criterion CEO. “It shouldn’t dictate your processes, force repetitive entries or restrict your ability to import real-time information, but those are the obstacles many mid-market systems create — because the developers have stopped innovating or are limited by the technology path they chose.” \nCriterion was written from scratch to take advantage of leading-edge technologies. It also leverages Criterion’s 31 years of comprehensive, flexible and reliable solutions for HR, benefits and payroll. It delivers real time reporting and analytics and a REST API so you can adapt it to your organization. Criterion fits nicely into your organization’s top-tier stack, supports HTML5 and has a responsive design for modern browsers and mobile devices. \nCriterion supports primary and multiple secondary positions with customizable dashboards and KPIs. It includes ACA support with electronic filing capabilities, open enrollment and connections to carriers, the ability to post to job boards and automated alerts with scheduled reporting and 300 standard reports (or auto-fill your own customized reports). Of course it offers end-to-end security, field-level encryption and role-based controls. \nCome see a demo of Criterion at the HR Tech Conference October 18-21 in Las Vegas at booth #2741. \nAbout Criterion \nSince our inception in 1984, Criterion has grown to become a leading provider of modern HCM solutions with their software built to meet the unique needs of mid-market companies to comprehensively manage HR, payroll and recruiting.
