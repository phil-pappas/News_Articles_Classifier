You are made to wait in insanely long lines, you eventually get to the front only for the consultant behind the counter to send you away because of missing documentation.\nYou later return with the required documentation and wait in line for what feels like an eternity. Upon reaching the front of the line, you are told that nothing can be done until you pay for the ID or passport you are applying for.\nNot willing to pay, you make your displeasure known to all and sundry in the department. This is a form of protest. Once you realize that screaming at the top of your lungs isn't getting you what you want, you promptly reach across the counter and beat up the consultant that was assigned to you. Your protest, has now turned into criminal action.\nMuch like the above example, the students at Rhodes, Wits and UCT who are \"protesting\" because of the varsity fees can not be regarded as protesters. Any issues that they have with the fee structures for the privilege to study at university, whether justified or not, lost all credibility the moment the protests escalated into criminal behaviour.\nDisrupting lectures of students who are trying to learn, damaging university and public property and resorting to violence is plain and simply CRIMINAL. Why the universities in question entertain the notion on protests after such behaviour is carried out, is beyond me.\nWhy is it that the police have not properly intervened? Why have no arrests been made when these \"protesting\" hooligans were beating cars with sticks yesterday? Who is going to pay for the damage to the vehicle that was overturned near Empire road by these \"protesters\".\nAccess to tertiary education is NOT A RIGHT, but a privilege that many cannot afford (black, coloured, Indian and white).\nThe time for political correctness is over.\nIt is high time that the media start reporting these events for what they really are; criminal attacks and NOT protests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:55:46.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
