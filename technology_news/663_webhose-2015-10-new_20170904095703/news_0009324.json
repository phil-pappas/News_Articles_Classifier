The Coach Match system provides an innovative way to for companies to manage the relationship between employee and coach to achieve performance improvement, career development or accelerated leadership development goals.\nOrganizations struggle with time-consuming and inconsistent approaches in delivering high quality employee coaching to improve performance and leadership capabilities.
