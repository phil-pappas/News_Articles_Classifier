They walk more slowly, sway, bump into obstacles and have unequal step placement of their feet. However, most patients aren't diagnosed until they suffer from ocular discomfort, which usually occurs later in the disease when it's less treatable.\nThe researchers developed a sensing platform worn on special shoes to measure, filter and analyze gait information. The research team can detect and examine specific features of gait, such as step length, equity between feet and evenness of step. In the clinical trials, researchers are comparing the gaits of glaucoma patients and control groups.\nThe researchers hope to use the technology someday to diagnose the disease earlier and outside laboratory settings, adding to the current practice of imaging or a visual field test.\nThe UCLA group is recruiting participants in different stages of glaucoma for the next phase of research in order to provide a more comprehensive look at how glaucoma impacts gait.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJPbV1xb7G4"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:16:21.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
