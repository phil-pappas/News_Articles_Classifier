Three days later, employees stopped reporting to work, although the state says they still were required to provide support. \nJudge Chris Yates has scheduled another hearing for Nov. 2. The state wants HP to turn over computer code created to run the system. \nSince 2005, HP had been working to replace the computer system used at 131 offices where cars are registered. The deadline was 2010. \nHP says \"it's unfortunate\" that Michigan terminated the contract. An audit in 2012 found fault on both sides. \nThink your friends should see this?
