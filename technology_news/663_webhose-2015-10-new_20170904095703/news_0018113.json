The three products, Nara Bloc, Nara Lure, and Nara Liquid, are all high-tech, non-toxic bait and monitoring products for rats and mice. October 7, 2015 EMitter has introduced its line of Nara products – allergen-free rodent attractants. The three products, Nara Bloc, Nara Lure, and Nara Liquid, are all high-tech, non-toxic bait and monitoring products for rats and mice. Because they are non-organic, they will not mold or attract insects, and can last up to 12 months in any climate or environmental conditions. The baits are ideal in locations in which rodenticides cannot be used and can make trapping more successful, the company said. Consisting of an aromatized special synthetic, Nara Bloc is highly attractive to rodents, especially mice, the company said. The “mushroom form” of the Nara Lure increases the success of catching small/light mice, to which it is particularly attractive, the company said. Nara lure Both the Bloc and the Lure have long durability depending on location of deployment; and will not become infested by insects (e.g., flour beetle, sawtoothed grain beetle, cockroaches etc.) as is the case with some standard lures. They are particularly suited for use in wet areas, as they will not mold or decompose from humidity. Additionally, the Bloc enables identification of rat or mouse feeding based on gnawing traces. Nara Liquid is especially suited for deployment in dry areas. It is attractive to both rats and mice, is available in three scents, and can be used in rat and mouse snap traps, such as those of Kness. The liquid has maximum attractiveness for acute pest control measures, the company said. Nara is available through distributors.
