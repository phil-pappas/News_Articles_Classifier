The program encourages Spanish-speaking communities nationwide to live healthier lifestyles through good nutrition and physical activity. Fuel Up to Play 60 launched a redesigned website ( FuelUpToPlay60.com ) that provides Spanish-language content and materials, extending the reach and access of the program to students, teachers and families across the country. Several organizations have supported the effort, including the PepsiCo Foundation, which has provided a previously announced grant of $550,000 to develop Spanish-language materials and resources. In addition the PepsiCo Foundation will provide another $100,000 for mini-grants for health and wellness activities and programming within Los Angeles Unified School District and Miami-Dade County Public Schools. \nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7646551-fuel-up-to-play-60/ \nFuel Up to Play 60, a program founded by the National Football League (NFL) and National Dairy Council (NDC), is designed to engage and empower youth to take action for their own health by implementing long-term, positive nutrition and physical activity changes for themselves, their schools and their communities. Studies show that physical fitness may benefit brain health and academic performance, suggesting active kids may do better.[i] However, only 1 in 3 kids are active every day,[ii] potentially leaving many at a disadvantage inside and outside of the classroom. \n\"Hispanic youth and adults are more overweight or obese than Caucasians, and obesity rates for Hispanic youth start at a younger age,\" said Elena Rios, MD, MSPH, President and CEO National Hispanic Medical Association. \"There is a significant need among the Hispanic community for wellness programming and Fuel Up to Play 60 en espanol's customizable resources will help make a positive impact on the Hispanic youth and school community.\" \nThe national student body is increasingly diverse, making it important to reach students and their families in culturally relevant ways. With the Hispanic population in schools projected to increase to 29 percent of total enrollment by 2024[iii] and Spanish being the most spoken non-English language in the U.S.[iv], there is a need for Spanish-language resources that can help engage a greater number of kids and their families in health and wellness initiatives. \n\"With research showing that one in four children in the U.S. is Hispanic,[v] we knew that the largest school wellness program had to expand to ensure students and families from all communities receive the best tools to succeed,\" said Alexis Glick, CEO of GENYOUth. \"We are deeply grateful to partners such as the PepsiCo Foundation, Morgan Stanley and America's dairy farmers and importers for their generous contributions to GENYOUth, which together will provide grants of $250,000 in total funding direct to the Miami and Los Angeles school districts to improve nutrition and physical activity among Hispanic youth.\" \nLocal kickoff events will be held in Miami (Oct. 8) and Los Angeles (Oct. 13) to officially launch the program. Events will feature special appearances by Troy Drayton and Twan Russell in Miami, and Pro Football Hall of Fame Offensive Tackle Anthony Munoz in Los Angeles, in addition to many other distinguished guests from the Hispanic, health and wellness, education and business communities. \n\"PepsiCo and its philanthropic arm, the PepsiCo Foundation, believe positive change in our communities happens through strong partnerships. We're honored to partner with GENYOUth to help extend the impact of their successful results driven program,\" said Sue Norton, vice president, PepsiCo Foundation. \"By expanding the reach of the Fuel Up to Play 60 program to the Spanish-speaking community and through the grants to schools in Los Angeles and Miami, we hope to make a healthier lifestyle more accessible and to motivate and inspire high-achieving kids nationwide.\" \nThe new Fuel Up to Play 60 en espanol materials, available online, include an interactive, Spanish-language student Dashboard and Playbook with resources and information about healthy eating and physical activity. As parental diets and family physical activity habits often have an impact on children's lifestyles, take-home materials and interactive resources for family members take Fuel Up to Play 60 beyond the classroom and into the community to help achieve the most effective results. Students, parents and educators can access Fuel Up to Play 60 en espanol by visiting FuelUptoPlay60.com to learn more about their role in supporting healthy, active schools and communities. \nAbout Fuel Up to Play 60 \nFuel Up to Play 60 is an in-school nutrition and physical activity program launched by National Football League (NFL) and National Dairy Council (NDC), founded by America's dairy farmers, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
