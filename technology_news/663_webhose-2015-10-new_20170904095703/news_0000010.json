This milestone comes as part of the second annual \"Get to Know GMOs\" month, inviting the public to ask their toughest questions about GMOs and join the conversation about how our food is produced. \"On a day focused on critical thinking, open dialogue and scientific discussion, it's only fitting we acknowledge that consumers have a lot of questions and are interested in learning more about where their food comes from and how it's produced. We're excited that so many people are thinking critically about their food choices and looking to find answers to their questions at GMOAnswers.com,\" said Kate Hall , managing director of the Council for Biotechnology Information and GMO Answers spokesperson. \"When we embarked on GMO Answers more than two years ago, embracing skepticism was – and continues to be – at the heart of our mission.\"\nVisitors can review the cache of questions answered by farmers, scientists, academicians, doctors, nutritionists and biotech industry experts, who volunteer their time to answer questions submitted online. Some of the most viewed questions are:\nDo GMOs Cause Cancer? Is it true that GMOs require massive amounts of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides? How much of our food in the U.S. is genetically modified? In honor of International Skeptics Day and to celebrate the milestone of 1,000 questions answered, GMO Answers is launching 100 days of GMOs. Starting today, GMO Answers will share one question per business day of the top 100 questions posted to the website across its social platforms, using the hashtag #100daysofGMOs. The goal of this social media campaign is to engage the public in a dialogue and raise further awareness of the most commonly asked questions.\nAs part of \"Get to Know GMOs\" month, GMO Answers is featuring blog posts about GMOs and the environment on the site every Thursday in October and debunking \"spooky\" GMO myths for Halloween .\n\"GMO Answers welcomes tough questions about how our food is grown, and Get to Know GMOs month is a great opportunity to highlight that conversation,\" continued Hall. \"We are committed to serving as a resource to consumers who are searching for factual information to help them make up their own minds about GMOs.\"\nAbout GMO Answers\nGMO Answers is committed to responding to your questions about how our food is grown.
