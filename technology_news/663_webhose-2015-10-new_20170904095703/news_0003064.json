It was the first of six straight lbws for Victoria, with Ed Cowan (39), Moises Henriques (37), Shane Watson (64), Ryan Carters (6) and Sean Abbott (0) all trapped in front of the stumps to leave the Blues on 6-172 off 37 overs.\nThe Blues looked like they were cruising to victory with Watson and stand-in skipper Henriques at the crease, with the pair putting on a 74-run third-wicket partnership to take the score to 3-159 when the latter fell to Hastings in the 33rd over.\nWatson joined Henriques in the sheds 14 balls later and in the next over Hastings struck twice, removing Carters and Abbott.\nOther Stories Awesome All Blacks lay Cardiff ghosts to rest Rugby 0 comments Will Geoffrey ever find love again?
