Lab Archives' cloud-based ELN allows students and professors to manage, monitor and evaluate student work with intuitive technology that eliminates the need for paper notebooks in lab courses. \n\"Logger Pro's new functionality with LabArchives further supports the use of electronic laboratory notebooks by simplifying the data-collection process, saving students time and facilitating collaboration during college-level labs,\" said Vernier Co-Founder David Vernier, a former physics teacher. \nAs part of the streamlining process, students can now open Logger Pro directly from LabArchives ELN. The new Logger Pro function for LabArchives is available for free to users of both Windows and Macs.
