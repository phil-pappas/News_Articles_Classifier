The new versions - Cabin Freaq, Forest Freaq and Sea Freaq ­ - combine The Novogratz’ designs with one of Soundfreaq’s most popular and successful product. The limited edition speakers are currently available at Soundfreaq.com for $99 and are ready to ship in time for the holidays.\nInspired by Timber Cove, a hotel on the Sonoma coast in California, the Timber Cove Collection matches The Novogratz’s unique style with Soundfreaq’s track record for offering products with smart features, impressive audio quality and the convenience of Bluetooth streaming. Just in time for the fall and winter seasons, the collection evokes the dramatic Sonoma coast, it’s beautiful Sequoia trees, dramatic ocean views, a peaceful forest landscape and cozy nights by the fireplace.\n“We’ve been fans of the Novogratz for years and we’re thrilled to continue this collaboration with Bob and Cortney to bring their unique style into more homes,” said Matthew Paprocki, co-­founder and creative director of Soundfreaq. “Adding their design aesthetic to our Sound Rise takes it to the next level and makes it a statement in any bedroom or even office.”\n“Cabin Freaq, Forest Freaq and Sea Freaq were inspired by Timber Cove, a hotel in Sonoma, CA that we’re currently re­designing,” said Robert and Cortney Novogratz. “Our fans really loved Sound Rise Flower Freaq, which was the limited edition speaker we designed for Mother’s Day. When we saw such a positive response, we knew we had to offer something fun for holiday gift giving.”\nNamed a CES “Best of Show” finalist by iLounge, Sound Rise maintains the classic features found in old ­school alarm clocks, but with much improved functionality and added features to enhance today’s modern lifestyle.\nSound Rise streams award-­winning audio via Bluetooth and is equipped with a universal USB power port, allowing users to charge their smartphones with ease. Sound Rise also offers dual alarms with weekday/weekend settings and gradually increasing volume, allowing users to wake up gently to the radio, music or alarm chime.\nSound Rise’s upright design reduces the size of its footprint, taking up less room on valuable nightstand real estate. It’s also built with adjustable display settings that ranges from extra bright to total blackout for those who don’t want any light coming from their alarm clock.\nSoundfreaq also offers Sound Rise Hotel Edition, which takes Sound Rise’s highly-praised features and design, and adds additional functions to make it the ultimate alarm clock for hotels and their guests. With Sound Rise Hotel Edition, hotels receive the function of a hotel-specific product laid against a brand that offers the familiarity of home, both in its design and its lineage.\nSound Rise Hotel Edition is currently rolling out at luxury 5-star hotels and resorts, B&Bs and Airbnb accommodations across the United States.\nFor product images and one­sheets please go to: http://www.soundfreaq.com/press .\nAbout Soundfreaq ( http://www.soundfreaq.com )\nSoundfreaq is a global co­op of craftsmen – designers and engineers – with deep expertise in consumer electronics and a passion for great sound.
