It is priced at $9.99 a month. \nIn addition to the current crop of content, from early 2016 YouTube Red will offer members-only access to new, original shows and films from some of the service's biggest creators. These include Scare PewDiePie: from the creator and executive producers of The Walking Dead at Skybound Entertainment and Maker Studios; Sing It!, from Fine Brothers Entertainment and Mandeville Films; Lazer Team, from Rooster Teeth and Fullscreen Films; and Single by 30 from Wong Fu Productions and New Form Digital. \nCommenting on the launch, YouTube's senior product manager Matt Leske, said: \"Fans have been telling us they want more â€” more choice when watching their favourite content, more ways to support their favourite creators and, above all, the option to watch their favourite videos uninterrupted ... The free, ad-supported version of YouTube we all know and love isn't going anywhere. You'll still be able to enjoy YouTube, along with the YouTube Kids, Gaming and Music apps free of charge. But with YouTube Red, you'll be able to support the people who make your favourite videos while watching what you want, when you want, on any device you want, uninterrupted.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:55:31.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
