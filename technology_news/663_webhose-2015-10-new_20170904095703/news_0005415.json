Liberty has more than 27 million customers in 14 countries in the U.K, Europe and Latin America.\n\"It's all about global scale. If you want to be a meaningful player in most of any of these media communication businesses, you have to think about it,\" Malone told CNBC back in May.\nUSA TODAY\nJohn Malone: A cable pioneer back in the game\nMalone is looking to expand in the U.S., too. Earlier this year, Charter Communications offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $55 billion. Liberty is the largest shareholder of Charter. Federal regulators are reviewing the deal.\nThis Cable & Wireless move is another sign that Malone is always looking for ways to expand, says Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner. \"And it's a relatively low-risk endeavor\" that will \"gain them a lot of learning in the challenges that traditional customers are facing.\"\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n4 CONNECT 25 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1RYQdUE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f778af78d9357c2f3be4e140fe2cb5eb3fb85d0/c=502-0-2498-1996/local/-/media/2015/05/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635682567964841041-B01-MALONE-LIBERTY-06-54028821.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635718869102440918-XXX-ALLEN-CO-CONFERENCE-73328202.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYQdUE&text=Malone%2C%20Liberty%20Global%20in%20talks%20with%20U.K.-based%20cable%20firm&via=usatoday", "http://www.cwc.com/", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider", "http://www.libertyglobal.com/index.html", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/143c7aeac4dc2a78f65fa123fba6faf544800e2b/c=0-222-2667-3778&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/07/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635718869102440918-XXX-ALLEN-CO-CONFERENCE-73328202.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1RYQdUE", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RYQdUE&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/07/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635718869102440918-XXX-ALLEN-CO-CONFERENCE-73328202.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:00:12.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
