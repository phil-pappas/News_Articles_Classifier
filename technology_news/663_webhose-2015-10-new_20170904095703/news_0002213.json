The full launch window has not been disclosed.\n\"We are excited and ready to take on our first Atlas launch of 2015,\" said Col. J. Christopher Moss, commander of the 30th Space Wing, in a statement Wednesday. \"Our team and mission partners have put a lot of hard work into preparing for this important mission for our nation.\"\nUSA TODAY\nNASA sounding rocket launched from Wallops Island\nAmateur spacecraft observers speculate that the rocket is carrying a pair of satellites updating the Naval Ocean Surveillance System, or NOSS.\nIn addition to the primary mission, the rocket's Centaur upper stage will deliver a group of 13 experimental and student-developed CubeSats to orbit.\nThe tiny spacecraft include nine missions sponsored by the NRO and four by NASA. Kennedy Space Center's Launch Services Program was responsible for securing the ride for the NASA-sponsored payloads known as ElaNA-12.\nA successful launch would keep ULA on track to return to Cape Canaveral for an Oct. 30 launch of the Air Force's next Global Positioning System satellite on an Atlas V. The booster for that mission was delivered to the Cape on Tuesday.\nUSA TODAY\nAtlas V rocket lifts off with Mexican satellite\nAn Atlas V last Friday successfully delivered Mexico's Morelos-3 communications satellite to orbit, completing ULA's 100th launch since Boeing and Lockheed Martin formed the joint venture in December 2006.\nAnd Wednesday, in the first launch since an Antares rocket exploded shortly after takeoff on Oct. 29, 2014, a sounding rocket successfully blasted off from NASA's Wallops Space Facility in Virginia.\n23 CONNECT 70 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1LiSU2j TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/126262a83a6abd08b2b8c7d46bf60104bcb7f587/c=0-73-851-1208&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Brevard/Brevard/635798360884508904-nrol55-av-mate-vafb-05.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/477b74b9f1e0354bd39a9c6ff4073a19d84d62f4/c=274-0-1516-1242/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793672925454079-atlas-launch-100215-2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LiSU2j&text=Atlas%20V%20set%20to%20launch%20classified%20mission%20Thursday%20in%20California&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b9984c146a142e10007ccd1ab326df805a5a3cf/c=723-0-2395-1672/local/-/media/2015/10/05/Salisbury/Salisbury/635796379976396971-nasarocketview.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LiSU2j&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/Brevard/Brevard/635798360884508904-nrol55-av-mate-vafb-05.jpg", "http://on.flatoday.com/1RukSsG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c69a75dbf7bd625c32b733a05367202f318eb58d/r=265x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Brevard/Brevard/635798360884508904-nrol55-av-mate-vafb-05.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LiSU2j"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:00:16.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
