The aim of the campaign was to demand more accountability from oil companies on global warming.\nStarting with the company's 2017 annual meeting, a shareholder or a group of shareholders owning 3 percent or more of Conoco's outstanding shares for at least three years can nominate directors, the company said in a filing with regulators.\nIn May, a majority of Conoco shareholders approved a non-binding resolution allowing proxy access. At the time, the Houston-based company's board of directors had recommended a vote against the proposal.\nCompanies had argued that their boards' nominating committees are best suited to pick director nominees.\nThe proxy access measure was approved at two-thirds of the oil companies targeted by Stringer.\n(Reporting by Anna Driver ; Editing by Terry Wade and Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:04:09.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
