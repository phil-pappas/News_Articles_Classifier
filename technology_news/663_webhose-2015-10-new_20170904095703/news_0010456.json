Those interested in using Kubernetes on AWS, can use the Tectonic AWS Installer, available through the Tectonic Preview, or use the do-it-yourself CoreOS Kubernetes on AWS open source guides published today. Tectonic is the simplest way to run your containers in production, providing businesses with a consistent environment to manage applications in containers from dev/test to cloud to data center. \nThe AWS Installer is made of a CloudFormation for launching Kubernetes on AWS, as well as kube-aws , a tool CoreOS developed to assist in automating your cluster deployment and makes it easy to configure end-user tools like `kubectl`. The AWS Installer allows for elastic load balancing for Kubernetes Services, effortless scaling and a full transport security layer between Kubernetes components and users interacting with kubectl. This cluster setup is subject to regular conformance testing and is officially supported via Tectonic. \n\"As we head into AWS re:Invent next week we want to ensure businesses have the ability to scale their applications in containers by using Kubernetes on AWS,\" said Alex Polvi, CEO of CoreOS. \"The combination of Kubernetes, CoreOS and AWS is another step forward in helping companies reach hyperscale. We invite companies to try out Kubernetes on AWS through the Tectonic AWS installer available through the Tectonic Preview or through our open source guides.\" \nTectonic combines the power of Kubernetes and CoreOS to scale applications securely. As the only solution to utilize upstream open source software, Tectonic ensures that businesses are always the running best of Kubernetes and CoreOS. Companies can rest assured knowing that Tectonic is always running the most stable release of open source technology. Currently, Tectonic is available as a preview, which is available for people to try out for no cost until general availability. \n\"As Amazon Web Services is among the most prevalent cloud infrastructures in the market, support for Kubernetes container management and orchestration on AWS will help a growing number and type of companies attain greater speed and efficiency through cloud and containers,\" said Jay Lyman, Research Manager, 451 Research. \"The application container trend and ecosystem, timed with growing cloud adoption, is rapidly transforming the way infrastructure and applications are managed with Kubernetes on AWS serving as a prime example.\" \nNext week, CoreOS will be at AWS re:Invent discussing how to get started with Kubernetes on AWS. Please join us at booth 1449 to see a demo of the technology and learn more. \nSupporting resources: -- Sign up for Tectonic Preview by CoreOS, https://tectonic.com/ -- Request an invitation to Tectonic Summit, https://tectonic.com/summit -- Read more on the blog, https://tectonic.com/blog/ \nAbout Tectonic Tectonic, delivered by CoreOS, is an enterprise-ready platform for running containers in a distributed environment.
