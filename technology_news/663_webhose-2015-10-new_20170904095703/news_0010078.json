It is one of the biggest funds in the world [for SMEs],” he said about the fund raised by the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah that should be launched this month, adding that it would be “good news for Kuwait's entrepreneurial community.” \nAl Mutawa is also CEO of Al Mutawa Consulting Group (ACG), a Kuwait-based consultancy specialising in three business lines - oil and gas, entrepreneurial studies and support, and training and seminars. \nWhen it comes to business coaching, inspirational videos uploaded on his Instagram profile, @mutawacg, have drawn attention of more than 58,000 followers. \nAs a result of his achievements to help the wider community, as well as establish a successful business, Ahmad Al Mutawa is our latest Entrepreneur of the Week. \nDo you know an entrepreneur who deserves to be our Entrepreneur of the Week?
