Now Sony is bringing the technology to medical imaging where the increased image clarity will provide real benefits to practitioners and patients. \n4K is the highest resolution available today for surgery and will give physicians and their teams advanced visualisation with virtually no pixelation, especially during up-close viewing. \nAmanda Aldridge, Medical Solutions Product Manager at Sony Australia, said: “4K technology gives a better view of general anatomy and blood vessels, allowing nurses, clinicians and surgeons to see in far more detail compared to HD resolution. This is important for minimally invasive and general surgery procedures, and for more immersive education and training.” \nSony’s first 4K products, to go on sale in Australian in November, are two new 4K medical-grade monitors - the 31-inch LMD-X310MD and 55-inch LMD-X550MD. These will soon be followed by A 4K medical recorder able to record 4K and 3D, and to support HD video and stills simultaneously. A 4K IP Converter that will convert video signals to internet protocol format for transmission over existing data networks. A HD/4K content management system that will allow surgeons to store, access and share 4K and HD video and still images. \n4K has advantages other than better resolution. It allows medical teams to see simultaneously on one screen a “quad-split” view of four full HD images. Surgeons can also zoom in on a 4K image without experiencing the pixelation associated with lower resolution technologies. \nSony sees its entry into the 4K medical imaging market as the first step towards the creation of a 4K ecosystems of medical imaging technology. It is working with other medical industry companies to develop new 4K products and accessories to give medical organisations more options to create 4K solutions that are optimal for their facilities and their applications. \nSony’s new 4K monitors are based on the advanced technologies in Sony’s 4K consumer TVs and professional production monitors for the medical community. They can display images from a range of medical imaging systems, and allow up-scaling of HD videos to 4K. \nThey also feature Sony’s OptiContrast technology, which replaces the layer of air between the panel and the glass with a layer of resin specially formulated to match the refractive properties of the glass, and Sony’s Advanced Image Multiple Enhancer (AIME). This lets users adjust views to enhance structure and colour for more comfortable viewing and improves visibility. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:38:16.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
