Rudiantara declined to comment on how much foreign ownership would be allowed.\nThe country currently allows no foreign investment in the local e-commerce industry, which analysts predict will be the region's largest by 2020, on the back of a voracious appetite for Internet use in Indonesia.\nIndonesians are among the most active users in the world of social media websites like Facebook and Twitter.\nIn California, Widodo is also scheduled to meet Apple ( AAPL.O ) CEO Tim Cook as well as executives from Google ( GOOGL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ).\nApple is looking to invest in sustainable tin mining in Indonesia, the world's biggest tin exporter, and in setting up research and development facilities there, according to cabinet ministers.\nU.S. Ambassador Robert Blake told reporters earlier on Wednesday that a wide range of agreements was set to be signed by Widodo and Obama next week to \"expand cooperation in maritime, energy and defense sectors\".\n(Reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Mark Heinrich )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:21:40.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
