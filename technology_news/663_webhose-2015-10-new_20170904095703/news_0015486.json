The company has said that its net worth will soon be back in positive territory. Indeed, in the June quarter, the company made a net profit of Rs. 640 crore.\nInterglobe has consistently paid dividend to its shareholders. In 2010-11 it paid Rs. 490 crore; in 2011-12, it paid nothing; in 2012-13, it paid Rs. 549 crore; in 2013-14, it paid, Rs. 378 crore; in 2014-15, it paid Rs. 1,080 crore; and in 2015-16 it paid an interim dividend of Rs. 1,003 crore (this information is from its draft red herring prospectus). The promoters and their associates own 94.04% in the company.\nNet worth isn’t really a measure you look at, Gangwal said. A company’s net worth can turn negative because of two things, he explained: it was performing badly; or it had just declared a dividend. In Interglobe’s case, it was clearly the latter. And such payments are always factored into valuations, he added—the company’s valuation would go down by a proportionate amount because of the dividend payout.\nStill, with the benefit of “20:20 hindsight”, Gangwal added, the board would have probably recommended a lower dividend to ensure its net worth stayed in positive terrain, had it known the furore its latest filing would create.\nThere are analysts who have been irritated by the company’s move. Mint reported on 20 October that one of them lamented at one of the company’s roadshows in Mumbai “ You are showing negative net worth and asking for money from investors.. This is an insult to investors.”\nMost financial investors, however, Gangwal said, were not particularly bothered by this. They were more keen on the company “guaranteeing” future dividend payouts. That’s something it cannot do, he added.\nThe US-based Gangwal co-founded Indigo with Rahul Bhatia in 2006. He owns just less than 50% in the airline. He was previously US Airways Inc.’s CEO.\nInterglobe’s Rs. 3,000 crore IPO opens on 27 October. The airline has fixed a price band of Rs. 700-765 per share for the public issue that will close on 29 October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:57:24.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
