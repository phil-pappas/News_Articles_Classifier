Flying cars arrive in Perth October 21, 2015 by Cristy Burne, Sciencenetwork Wa A rendering of the YouFly vehicle in motion. Credit: Entecho \nThe creators of Back to the Future II had us believe flying cars, anti-gravity hoverboards and fax machines would be ubiquitous in the early 21st Century. \nThe iconic movie, which saw Doc Brown and Marty McFly travel forward in time to October 21, 2015,—today's date—may have been wrong about the fax machines but it is close to having the flying car part right. \nEngineer Kim Schlunke is the director of local company Entecho, and inventor of WA's very own flying-car technology. \nIf Mr Schlunke has his way, instead of bumper-to-bumper commuting, \"you'll jump in your car, dial an address, then sit back and read the morning paper,\" he says. \n\"The car will find the nearest landing site, steer around mountains and towers using GPS, and avoid things you can't predict, like seagulls and other craft, using collision avoidance radar.\" \nThe flying saucer-like vehicle known as YouFly is not quite a DeLorean nor is it powered by the mysterious Mr Fusion but it is able to fit in an ordinary garage and runs entirely on electricity. \nYouFly is capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), and operated with just two joysticks—one for height, the other for direction. \n\"You sit in the middle of a 2m diameter fan, in a nice cockpit,\" Mr Schlunke says. \n\"You can't touch the fan or reach it, and when it starts, it becomes transparent, so you can look through it.\" The YouFly vehicle. Credit: Entecho \nThe enclosed fan pumps air from the top to the bottom of the car, generating lift that is controlled by a flexible skirt around the car's body. \nMr Schlunke has test-driven YouFly \"at very low altitudes\" and says the most recent tests are exciting. \n\"It's flown with enough weight to fly a person…it flies around very stably and parks in carparks and things like that,\" he says. \n\"When a vehicle is as small as a car, the physics of flight are quite difficult, but we've been able to achieve efficiency through careful aeronautical engineering.\" The YouFly hoverpod being tested in a carpark. Credit: Entecho \nMr Schlunke admits Entecho isn't pursuing time travel as one of YouFly's capabilities, but says the craft will still provide a whole lot of fun. \n\"Hopefully it's the car of tomorrow, but that's a long way off,\" he says. \nIn developing YouFly, Entecho collaborated with the University of Western Australia and WA companies Strike Products and Composite Design. \n\"Pretty unique skills are needed to make the craft…Perth had the skill base I needed,\" Mr Schlunke says. Lockheed Martin to build Transformer TX—Autonomous flying payload carrier August 20, 2013 \n(Phys.org) —Lockheed Martin has announced that it intends to build a new kind of extraction and payload delivery craft that can be flown remotely or at times autonomously.

'Psychic robot' will know what you really meant to do October 7, 2015 \nWhat if software could steer a car back on track if the driver swerves on ice? Or guide a prosthesis to help a shaky stroke patient smoothly lift a cup? Brands eye big bucks with 'Back to the Future' nostalgia October 20, 2015 \nThe dog-walking drones and flying cars of Marty McFly's fictional 21st century are still the stuff of sci-fi in real-life 2015—but savvy brands from Pepsi to Toyota have rolled out gadgets and gimmicks tapping into \"Back ... How close are we to Back to the Future's vision of tomorrow? A scientist's view October 21, 2015 \nThe art of futurology – predicting what future society might look like – is plagued with difficulties. Books, films, TV shows and plays that feature such efforts are all judged through the prism of hindsight.
