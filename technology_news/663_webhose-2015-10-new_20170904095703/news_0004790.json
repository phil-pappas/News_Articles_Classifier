USAA was the first U.S. financial institution to offer facial and voice recognition on a mobile app as added protection against fraud and identity theft. The Touch IDTM recognition for iOS® users became available in March allowing them to login with their fingerprint.\nUSAA is a leader in delivering innovative and secure solutions that make life easier for its members.\n“Cybercrime is the new normal. It’s critical for all consumers to remain vigilant in protecting their online identity and financial situation,” said Gary McAlum, USAA’s chief security officer. “Biometrics provides our members another layer of security on the USAA Mobile App, and we’re ecstatic that a million members have taken such quick action to better protect themselves.”\nOctober marks National Cyber Security Awareness Month and with recent and ongoing data breaches of the consumer’s personal information, cyber criminals have ready access to tens of millions of records used to steal identities and take control of financial accounts. USAA believes traditional static login identifiers and passwords will become obsolete as individuals transition to more secure multifactor authentication, such as using biometrics in conjunction with other dynamic verification including USAA’s patented “Quick Logon” technology.\nBiometrics are part of USAA’s broader authentication strategy enhancing our members’ authentication experience while providing the highest levels of security within our mobile app.\n“We’re committed to continuing our focus on developing innovative solutions that offer our members the flexibility to manage their accounts quickly and securely in their channel of choice,” said Dana Simmons, USAA’s Executive Vice President. “Multifactor authentication is the most effective way to decrease our members’ vulnerability, and we will continue to promote the use of biometrics to our members as a more secure and convenient means to interact with USAA.”\nAbout USAA\nThe USAA family of companies provides insurance, banking, investments, retirement products and advice to 11.1 million current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.
