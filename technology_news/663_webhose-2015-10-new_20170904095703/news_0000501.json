Diesters from BioAmber's bio-based succinic acid are renewable alternatives to petroleum based emollient esters for personal care. They provide high-shine, excellent feel, are easily formulated, are mild and non-irritating, and can be up to 100% derived from plants when using plant-based alcohols. \nPlease download this free white paper to read more.
