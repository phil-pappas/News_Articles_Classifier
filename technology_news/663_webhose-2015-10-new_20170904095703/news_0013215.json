Through this partnership, agencies can strengthen their client relationships by offering policy premium payment online with the click of a button through their online Applied client self-service software, enabling their clients to manage their payment schedule when and how they prefer.\nThe Applied Partner Program is a technology and industry partnership program focused on increasing the availability of best-in-class software and enhancing automation and connectivity across the independent insurance distribution channel.

PayConex P2PE secures card transactions by encrypting all data within a PCI-approved point of entry swipe or keypad device, preventing clear-text cardholder data from being available in the device or the merchant’s system.\n“We are excited to partner with Applied Systems and empower their agency and brokerage customers with our integrated PayConex P2PE solution,” stated Guido Schulz, Chief Commercial Officer, Bluefin. “Applied Systems is committed to protecting card data and providing secure payment technology to their clients, and we are very excited that they have chosen PayConex as the secure payment engine behind their innovative insurance agency management software”\nApplied Systems is the world’s largest provider of agency and brokerage management systems, automating the insurance lifecycle for more than 13,000 agencies and brokerages and 450 insurers worldwide.
