Israeli Zaka volunteers clean up blood stains at site where a 19-year-old Palestinian man stabbed a Jewish man in Jerusalem on October 8, 2015 \n'We will burn everything' \nExperts say the parade of images on social networks is having a profound impact on young Palestinians. \n\"Every day we see a new martyr and the least that we can do to show solidarity is to change our profile pictures and share images,\" a protester in the West Bank city of Ramallah told AFP on condition of anonymity. \nSelfies are being posted of youthful stone throwers against a background of burning tyres or billowing tear gas. \nYoung Palestinians are at particular risk when they participate in protests or violence, according to psychologist Najah al-Khatib. \n\"They don't have the concept of danger or the sense of caution that an adult has,\" he said, adding that children and adolescents are more likely to be influenced by images on social media. \nPalestinian \"martyrs\", especially young ones, become icons to other children, Khatib said. \nSince Sunday, a 13-year-old and an 18-year-old have been among three Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli forces. \n\"I like throwing stones at the soldiers, like the other youngsters,\" said Mustafa, 10. \"I want to die a martyr.\" \nMustafa and his generation did not experience the last intifada, but he still pledges to \"liberate Palestine\"—specifically the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem where young Muslims and Israeli police have repeatedly clashed in recent weeks. \n\"We have seen such hard things since our birth that we can no longer tolerate the occupation, which makes our lives impossible,\" added Ahmed, 16. \nAt his side are two boys, their school satchels still slung over their shoulders. They say they have been throwing stones for hours. \nAsked why, one replies with indignation. \n\"Why? I could give you a new reason every day; the attacks on Al-Aqsa, children killed, the occupation. \n\"It is decided, we are going to burn everything.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:28:42.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
