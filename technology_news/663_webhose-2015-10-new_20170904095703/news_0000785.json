According to the study, 97 percent of agencies reported they must compile data from more than one data source; 65 percent of agencies report not having a data analytics solution in place to consolidate data from multiple sources into one interface. \nThe study, which surveyed 200 respondents - 34 percent Defense and 66 percent Civilian - confirms that quick, easy to digest data is vital to improved decision-making. According to the results, 68 percent of respondents believe one of the greatest benefits of data analytics is the ability to make better, quicker fact-based decisions. \n\"Centralizing data for public agencies raises concerns about security and data governance,\" said Lisa Dezzutti, President and CEO of Market Connections. \"Having the ability to quickly access, analyze and disseminate information gives agencies the ability to make better decisions that will improve overall efficiency and service.\" \nAdditional key findings include: More data sources leads to more manual staff hours. 71 percent of agencies believe compiling data manually and inputting the information into outdated spreadsheets is the greatest barrier to integrating more day-to-day decision-making. In fact, 59 percent of respondents said that they spend over 25 staff hours inputting data, while 20 percent cite more than 100 hours per month devoted to data collection. Governance is the key to meaningful insights. With security at the forefront of concern among respondents (49 percent), owning the collection and dissemination of data is high priority. For example, tryng to use and update an excel spreadsheet is nearly impossible, with formulas consistently being broken or individuals citing information from outdated versions. Agencies need to ensure data is collected and held in a secure, governed environment, and decisions are made based on the same set of data collected. The need for self-service access and visualization of data. Traditional business intelligence systems restrict the agility required to make decisions quickly. Thirty-four percent of respondents said their current analytics tools do not allow them to manipulate data, while 32 percent said that the data is outdated by the time it is delivered. Another 28 percent of decision-makers rely on IT to create reports.
