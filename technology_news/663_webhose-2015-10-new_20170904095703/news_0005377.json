The research team found that during conditions in which the polar night jet stream wind speeds exceed 90mph, or reverse their direction to flow from the east, forecasts in both the stratosphere and troposphere (the layer of atmosphere closest to the ground), are more skillful. \nWhile it was previously known that a sudden weakening of these winds, and subsequent warming of the stratosphere, was a source of predictability, the researchers found that the opposite was also true when the polar night jet stream strengthened and the polar stratosphere was unusually cold. Such stratospheric conditions occur up to 3-4 times a winter, meaning that around one in five winter 'sub-seasonal' forecasts (those looking 2-4 weeks ahead) might benefit from this effect. \nThe strength of stratospheric winds can influence the position of the jet stream in the troposphere, having a major influence on weather across the North Atlantic, and allow freezing polar air to travel further south than would normally be expected. \nThe researchers examined 30 years' worth of past forecast data to see how the state of the stratosphere affected the accuracy of the forecast. \nDr Andrew Charlton-Perez, University of Reading, who co-authored the study, said: \"We are only just beginning to learn how conditions in the stratosphere influence our weather several weeks later. \n\"The more we learn about these links, along with other processes in the tropical atmosphere and links between the land surface and the atmosphere, the more we can improve weather forecasts on this important sub-seasonal timescale.\" \nImproving sub-seasonal forecasts is the focus of several current major international initiatives including the S2S project, sponsored by the World Meteorological Organisation. This research was part of the SNAP project, which contributes to this effort by working with researchers in seven countries on stratospheric predictability and its influence on the troposphere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:36:23.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
