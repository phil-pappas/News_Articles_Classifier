In addition, a new application is being developed to assist students in creating individualized menus. This unique opportunity will not only help the state in its endeavor to ensure program integrity and solidify the farm fresh initiative, it will also equip the state's 1247 school districts with modernized software to streamline compliance, enhance meal appeal, and increase student acceptability. \nAccording to TDA assessment about 70% of the school districts in the state currently do not actively utilize software for their menu planning or production records. Through this purchase, TDA is making the tools available, even for small districts, to plan menus that are nutritious, compliant, and cost effective. TDA plans include sharing of ingredients, nutrients, recipes, and menus across districts to help reduce the workload for school districts in their menu planning and food production processes. \nThis project will help a large number of districts move their paper production records to electronic records, making record keeping and compliance so much easier. Administrative review processes for both TDA and districts will also be streamlined as menus and production records can be reviewed over the internet. \n\"We are excited to welcome TDA, the ESCs and all the school districts in the state to the PrimeroEdge family,\" said Gordon Rereddy, Director, Solution Sales at PrimeroEdge. \"PrimeroEdge understands and meets the unique needs of both State agencies and nutrition departments at school districts through a unified solution.\" \nPrimeroEdge Menu Planning is USDA-approved for use in both certification of compliance with lunch meal requirements and conducting nutrient analyses that meet Food and Nutrition Service requirements. This module integrates seamlessly with Production Records. As menus are assigned to the upcoming schedule, production records are generated and are instantly available for internal review. \nThese PrimeroEdge software modules will be piloted with select school districts in the coming months. After completion of the pilot, TDA plans to roll out access to all 7915 schools in the state by fall 2017. \nAssistant Commissioner, Angela Olige, stated, \"TDA is eager to provide schools with the tools needed to support local efforts in achieving health and wellness while creating a pathway for collaborative compliance with the federal regulations. We also look forward to the data that will be available to assist in advancing the use of Texas products in local schools.\" \nAbout PrimeroEdge PrimeroEdge is the industry leading provider of software solutions for school nutrition departments in State agencies and K-12 school districts across the country.
