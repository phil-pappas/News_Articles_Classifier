Georgia ranks ninth in the nation for men killing women, according to the most recent Violence Policy Center study. October is national Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM) and, hoping to lower that ranking, Verizon Wireless , in partnership with the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence ( GCADV ), is encouraging all Georgians to get involved with local organizations dedicated to helping victims of domestic abuse. One easy life-saving act is to donate old phones to the HopeLine ® from Verizon program to support victims and local domestic violence organizations in the Peach State. HopeLine from Verizon puts the nation's most reliable wireless network to work in the community by turning no-longer-used wireless phones into support for victims of domestic violence. Victims of domestic violence need help and the simple donation of a no-longer-used phone can be that lifeline. Proceeds from the HopeLine program are used to provide wireless phones and airtime to victims of domestic violence and cash grants to local shelters and non-profit organizations that focus on domestic violence prevention, awareness and advocacy. Consumers can donate their phones at Verizon Wireless Communications Stores or by mail using the postage-paid mailing label available at www.verizonwireless.com/hopeline . \"Domestic violence is not just a problem between two people. It is a problem that impacts the entire family, the workplace, and communities. It is important for all of us to be a part of the solution. We all have the ability to make a significant impact on this issue in small ways. Some of these include talking to our local media, reaching out to legislators, donating phones to the HopeLine program, donating supplies to a local shelter and spreading the word on social media,\" says Jan Christiansen , executive director, GCADV. \"Verizon has a longstanding commitment to raising awareness of domestic violence, working with many organizations to help domestic violence victims across the state,\" said Jonathan LeCompte , president – Georgia /Alabama Region, Verizon Wireless. \"During DVAM this year, we encourage all Georgians to join us in helping our neighbors live free from violence. Call your local domestic violence shelter or organization and ask how you can help. At the very least Georgians can dig through drawers, find no-longer-used phones and donate them to HopeLine.\" Since the launch of the HopeLine phone recycling program in 2001, HopeLine from Verizon has collected given out more than $29 million in cash grants and distributed more than 190,000 phones for use by domestic violence survivors.
