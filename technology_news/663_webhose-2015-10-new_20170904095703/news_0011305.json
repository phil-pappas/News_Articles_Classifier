It comes as streaming services like Hulu, Pandora, Spotify and TuneIn offer ad-free as a paid option. \nThe plan, which launches Oct. 28, includes exclusive access to new videos launching next year as well as the YouTube Music Key service -- to be called YouTube Music after it launches later this year -- for music videos and songs. The new YouTube Music app will allow you to toggle music videos to play audio only. \nBut you don't have to wait for the new music app to have Red features work across YouTube platforms, with the exception of the YouTube Kids app, starting next week. The apps, including the existing YouTube app, are free to download. \nThe service will cost $13 a month if purchased through Apple's iTunes -- but only because Apple takes a 30 percent cut, executives said. If purchased through the Google Play Store or on the Web, the subscription will still work on apps running on Apple's iOS or Safari browser. \nThe original videos will range in length from a few minutes to feature-length movies and come from established YouTube stars such as the Fine Brothers, who are creating a scripted 10-episode series about a singing competition show called \"Sing It.\" Another new show stars video game-playing star Felix Kjellberg in a reality series co-created by the makers of \"The Walking Dead\" called \"Scare PewDiePie.\" \nPerformer and comedian Lilly Singh said that while YouTube helped pay for the creation of a documentary of her world tour called \"A Trip to Unicorn Island,\" the new service won't drastically change how she serves her fans. \n\"Is YouTube Red going to be the extreme make of my financial career? No,\" she said. \"But that's not why I'm doing it. I'm doing it to give my viewers choice.\" \nYouTube still intends for advertising revenue to remain its core business, and executives say they believe it could take a while for paid subscribers to grow significantly. Some original content will also be made available to non-subscribers later with ads. \nKyncl said the subscription will bolster YouTube's revenues and that of artists, and said $10 a month is the upper limit of what consumers would pay for such a plan. He said YouTube's advertising revenues will not be hurt, given that the number of users switching to the new service won't likely make a dent in YouTube's billion-plus users. \n\"It wouldn't really impact the amount of eyeballs we're providing through our platform,\" he said. \nOne challenge is getting people to pay for a service they long associated with being free, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note Wednesday. \nThe move comes amid a boom in consumer appetite for ad-free experiences. \nAd-blocking software has become popular on personal computers, and Apple's iOS 9 operating system update last month allowed ad-blocker apps to run on its mobile Safari browser for the first time. Worldwide usage of ad blockers rose 41 percent last year to nearly 200 million people, according to PageFair, a firm that seeks to counter ad blockers. \nAnd yet content providers are finding a way to make money from eliminating ads, too. \nInternet radio giant Pandora Media Inc. made $54.6 million on subscription and other revenue in the quarter through June, mainly from its $5-a-month ad-free plan, Pandora One. Its subscription revenue is growing faster than ad revenue itself. \nHulu launched a \"No Commercials\" plan in September for $4 more per month than its regular $8 subscription, and TuneIn added a premium tier for $8 a month in August that throws ad-free music together with audio books and sports play-by-play coverage. \nRed could help boost the ranks of Google Play Music subscribers, which stood at around 815,000 in the U.S. at the end of last December, according to royalty tracking firm Audiam. \nThat's far short of leader Spotify with 20 million paying subscribers globally. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook told a technology conference this week that Apple Music has 6.5 million paying subscribers and millions more still on free trials following its launch at the end of June. \nYouTube is part of Google, a division of the newly created holding company Alphabet Inc. \n__ \nThis story has been corrected to remove reference to PewDiePie making movies. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
