The $5 billion US military Distributed Common Ground System, intended to pool and make battlefield intelligence easily accessible, was not functioning when a hospital was attacked in Afghanistan. Source: USAF\nAP AP Share A $5 BILLION intelligence network, designed to give commanders battlefield awareness but criticised for years as a flop, was not working in Afghanistan during the recent air attack on a hospital.\nAccording to a member of the US Congress who says he is in touch with military whistleblowers, the Distributed Common Ground System was not functioning when US commanders approved an air strike October 3 that killed 22 staff, patients and others at a Doctors without Borders hospital in Kunduz\nIt’s a network of computers and sensors designed to knit together disparate strands of intelligence in an easy-to-digest display. Its purpose is to clearly identify and prioritise targets — and avoid unwanted civilian casualties.\nIt joins a long list of heavily-hyped — and incredibly expensive — hi-tech defence material failing to live up to its marketing, such as the F-35 Stealth Fighter and the US Navy’s latest aircraft carriers .\nCollateral damage ...

Source: Supplied\nLOSS OF INTELLIGENCE\nIt’s unclear whether the breakdown of key DCGS systems contributed to the decision to approve the air attack, which Pentagon officials say was a mistake. But the coordinates of the hospital were entered into an intelligence database that is part of the DCGS intelligence network, according to a US official who would not be Quote: d because he was not authorised to discuss the matter.\nThe Army over the years has touted DCGS as having “saved lives” with its ability to fuse together various intelligence sources, including drone footage, mapping software, human source reports, social media and eavesdropping transcripts. But independent Army testers repeatedly have questioned the system’s effectiveness. One testing report in 2012 said it was “not survivable,” meaning it was at risk of failing in combat.\nAmong the elements of DCGS that were not working, service members told Hunter, were the intelligence fusion server, which is supposed to allow seamless information sharing across various Army elements, and the cloud, which is supposed to offer connectivity to units in the field.\nBillion-dollar breakdown ...

US, NATO and Afghan investigations are looking into the matter. The US has offered to compensate the families of those killed and injured.\nPentagon officials have said the military did not intentionally target the hospital, but they have not explained why the Army analysts who knew it was a medical facility were not able to convey that intelligence to commanders who approved the air strike.\nThe Associated Press has reported that special operations intelligence analysts knew the Doctors without Borders facility was a hospital, and were circulating intelligence reports about possible enemy activity at the site.\nSome of those analysts were using a commercial software system made by Palantir, a Silicon Valley company that competes with DCGS, according to an Army official who would not be Quote: d because he was not authorised to speak publicly.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ce5a327c1d390608a871f2e56d8fb07a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ad39e22d7236906fea248ef0e3efe226", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e44176d7acd14969e88f7b417166e064", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8415246f059737f3eb2dea245b5aaded", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:23:12.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
