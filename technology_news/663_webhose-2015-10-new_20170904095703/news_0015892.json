They don’t want payphones or fixed-line phones in their house, they want to use mobiles the same way that people use mobiles in Melbourne or Sydney,” he said.\n“The government has decided to invest a lot of public money on fixing the digital divide for fixed-line services with the NBN but we don’t believe this is fixing the whole problem. It’s not because of a lack of money but because of the way that this money is being spent. We need to look at how the ­government can enhance its investments and scope to deliver not only fixed-line connections but more technology-agnostic solutions that can help mobile ­competition.”\nThe $49 billion NBN was created to break Telstra’s hold on telecommunications services in Australia but the program is only building fixed-line infrastructure, meaning competition for mobile services has been left to the private sector to fight over.\nMr Berroeta said the $11bn being paid to Telstra from the public purse to buy the telco giant’s copper network for the NBN gave it an unfair advantage when it came to competing for mobile ­customers in regional Australia.\nTelstra is Australia’s dominant mobile carrier, with close to 16.5 million subscribers, compared with Optus’s 9.4 million and ­Vodafone Australia’s 5.3 million.\nMr Berroeta said the best way to counter Telstra’s dominance of the market was to have the NBN provide access to infrastructure to mobile operators on equal terms.\n“NBN is investing in a fixed-line network and a satellite network but it also has a fixed-wireless solution that could be used very well to provide mobile services to regional Australia,” he said. “It’s something we need to work on now because it’s a huge opportunity to have a common infrastructure that all players can access equally.”\nIn addition, Mr Berroeta said some of the $300 million spent each year to fund the universal service obligation to provide essential telco services to the bush should be diverted to improve mobile coverage and choice in regional Australia by co-funding infrastructure in remote areas and by creating incentives for the ­industry to invest in and share ­mobile networks. “The majority of transmission infrastructure in regional Australia is owned by one provider, which has received more than $1 billion in public funding over the years,” he said.\n“If Vodafone, or any other provider, wishes to operate in those markets where it is unviable to duplicate infrastructure, it needs to pay astronomical prices set by our competitor to access those transmission services. This is preventing effective competition in those areas.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:57:48.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
