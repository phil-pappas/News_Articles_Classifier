Call Gov. Brown at (916) 445-2841 and ask him to sign SB 178. \nTechnology has advanced exponentially. But our privacy laws are still in the digital dark ages.

The state’s major newspapers all support SB 178. An overwhelming majority of Californians - 82% - want to make sure the police get a warrant for digital information. Even state law enforcement has removed opposition from the bill. \nMake sure Governor Brown hears from you today and stands up for privacy, innovation and public safety in the digital age by signing SB 178 – CalECPA.
