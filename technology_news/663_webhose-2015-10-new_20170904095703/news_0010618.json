Prahalad, Hamel, Moore, Utterback, and Christensen's writings seeded the field. In 2004, Business Week published its first ranking of the \"The World's Most Innovative Companies\" and the innovation race was on. \nFor two decades now, the innovation body of knowledge has been both growing and refining. Models and frameworks by esteemed consultancies and research firms have come and gone, as have about half of the initial vendors of enabling techniques and software. Of course, what worked has remained. \nAll companies are quite lean as of 2015 and only a few markets are growing rapidly. Future growth and profit will derive from having a more appealing product portfolio than one's competitors. There is little fat left to cut. The mastery of innovation is essential to gain competitive advantage in the years ahead. Today's ability to monetize and trade the value of intellectual property (IP) assets now makes both product innovations and their IP transactable commodities, furthering innovation's importance. \nGGI held our first Innovation Summit in January 2006, about two years time-to-market after the Business Week list was published. We could predict the inevitable availability of a myriad of solutions appearing. By 2012, GGI had held 11 Summits on the State-of-Innovation. In 2015, GGI completely refreshed our Innovation Summit and held our 12th Innovation Summit in April 2015. Comments from Summit Alumni were quite positive on the State-of-Innovation in 2015. \nGGI's 13th R&D-Product Development Innovation Summit will be held December 8-10, 2015 in the greater Boston area. This information intensive event, targeted to medium and large corporations , draws on findings from over fifty secondary research sources and GGI's fifteen years of primary research on product development, innovation, IP, and metrics. \nThis Summit delivers the content to empower executives and thought leaders with the state-of-practice knowledge needed to increase corporate product portfolio and brand valuations from innovation and IP improvements in their companies. From a CEO/CXO perspective, this Summit covers strategies, tactics, tools, software, metrics, and the rewards that top people have to decide about to increase corporate productivity through innovation.
