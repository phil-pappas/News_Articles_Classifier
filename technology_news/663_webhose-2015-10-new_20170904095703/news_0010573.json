It also provides support for IMAP Idle Command. The feature allows users to establish a connection and wait for a trigger when some message is received. It also supports adding headers to EWS requests. This months release also fixes a number of issues, such as adding Calendar items to IPF.Note folder of PST, issue with saving contents of an Outlook Contact & more.\nLane Cove, Australia, October 15, 2015 --( PR.com )-- What's New in this Release?\nAspose team is pleased to announce the release of Aspose.Email for .NET 5.7.0. This month’s release brings new features, enhancements and a number of API improvements as a result of bug fixes. This month’s release includes a new feature of creating a MailMessage from an HTML file. The message is created with the specified html file and can include any inline images that are part of the html page. For this purpose, the resources on disc need to be specified using the load options. IMAP protocol in itself supports IDLE command. This month’s release enhances the IMAP client functionality and includes the support for this feature of IMAP protocol. The feature allows users to establish a connection and wait for a trigger when some message is received. This helps avoid polling the server all the time for any new incoming messages. The ImapClient’s StartMonitoring and StopMonitoring methods can be used to achieve this functionality. Microsoft Exchange Web Server (EWS) provides the facility of adding headers to the EWS client, in order to manage different Exchange level functionality. One such example is adding HttpHeaders such as X-AnchorMailbox that helps deal with the throtlling issues on Exchange Server. This month’s release enhances the API’s EWS Client to which headers can be added now. Aspose.Email API provides the capability of creating/sending messages with dynamic content such as first name, last name, signature, etc. This is achieved using the API’s TemplateEngine class that adds the dynamic contetns and results in MessagesCollection. This month’s release further enhances this functionality by allowing row-wise mail merge. This gives control over the information added to the message as a single record and can be used to create meta-data about the generated message. This month’s release also fixes a number of issues with the API in the form of bugs and exceptions, such as adding Calendar items to IPF.Note folder of PST, issue with saving contents of an Outlook Contact, problems with loading Aspose.Email’s generated messages in third party application, exceptions related to Recurrence patterns and Problem with ListMessages method of the API’s EWS Client. The main bug fixes & improved features added in this release are listed below:\n• MailMessage from HTML creation\n• IMAP IDLE command supporting\n• Callback or Trigger like option for each record being merged during mail merge operation\n• Add ability to add HttpHeaders in ews requests\n• 'IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.NamedView', 'IPM.Configuration.Calendar' and 'IPM.Microsoft.WunderBar.Link' items not extracted from PST/OST\n• Updating the service reference removes the KnownTypeAttributes if Aspose.Email reference is added in the project\n• Problem with adding IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request MSG to IPF.Note folder\n• Unable to set information of MapiContact\n• Wrong body extracted from EML after conversion from MailMessage to MapiMessage\n• MSG created using MapiMessage can't be loaded in 3rd party Content Server\n• Extra white spaces added while creating message body from template doc file\n• Missing emails from generated PST\n• EML to XPS: Problem with Arrows\nOther most recent bug fixes are also included in this release.\nNewly added documentation pages and articles\nSome new tips and articles have now been added into Aspose.Email for .NET documentation that may guide users briefly how to use Aspose.Email for performing different tasks like the followings.\n- Importing and Exporting Emails: http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/emailnet/Importing+and+Exporting+Emails\n- Public API Changes in Aspose.Email 5.7.0: http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/emailnet/Public+API+Changes+in+Aspose.Email+5.7.0\nOverview: Aspose.Email for .NET\nAspose.Email for .NET is a set of components allowing developers to easily implement email functionality within their ASP.NET web applications, web services & Windows applications.
