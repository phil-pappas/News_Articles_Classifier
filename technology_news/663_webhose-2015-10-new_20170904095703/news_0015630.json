Already among the most successful IT projects in Texas government history, eFileTexas is the largest mandatory electronic court filing system in the U.S. and is a model other states can follow. \nIn November 2012, the Texas Judiciary announced the plan to develop and deploy eFileTexas in accordance with a Texas Supreme Court mandate to create a uniform electronic filing system for all civil cases in district courts, statutory county courts, constitutional county courts and statutory probate courts. After conducting a thorough and competitive bidding process, the project to build and deploy the system was awarded to Plano-based Tyler Technologies ( News - Alert ). eFileTexas was rolled out in a phased approach based on county population, starting with the 10 largest Texas counties going live by Jan. 1, 2014. \nWith the system completely operational in all applicable courts across all Texas counties, more than 115,000 users from the legal community are registered and trained on eFileTexas, and thousands of court staff members use the system daily. Together those users submit over 25,000 documents per day. Fully accessible 24 hours a day, every day of the week from any Internet accessible location, the system delivers increased transparency and court availability to attorneys, litigants and court represetatives, creating a more efficient court system and use of staff time. \n\"Every branch of Texas government, particularly the Judiciary, is committed to applying technology that enables everyone, regardless of means, to access our justice system. With eFileTexas operational statewide, our 21st century state now has a 21st century Judiciary,\" said Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht. \"Many people and entities played key roles in the success of our e-filing project, which would not have happened without the expertise of and partnership with Tyler Technologies. Together, we launched a system that benefits everyone involved with the legal process.\" \neFileTexas creates more efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars through intuitive processes and procedures. By being entirely electronic, the platform helps courts and the legal community print 30 million fewer sheets of paper annually, create greater document security in the event of a disaster, and reduce mailing and storage costs. With solid support from county and court officials across all 254 counties, attorneys, and relevant private sector companies, eFileTexas simplifies access to public information, providing all relevant court participants with immediate access to necessary documentation. \nDeploying eFileTexas involved many participants, including the Texas Office of Court Administration and Judicial Committee on Information Technology, which carefully guided the project and provided clear direction to the courts in all 254 counties. The Texas Legislature played a vital role by supporting the initiative with necessary funding and legislation, and county and district clerks assumed significant workloads without additional resources during the transition to the new system. \n\"eFileTexas is a model of a well-managed government IT project. The Texas Judiciary did an outstanding job implementing technology that improves access to justice,\" said Bruce Graham, president of Tyler Technologies' Courts & Justice Division. \"Tyler is proud to play a part in a project of such unprecedented scale and scope, and we look forward to collaborating with the Judiciary on future endeavors to further enhance efficiencies to Texas' outstanding judicial system.\" \nA press conference about this landmark project will be hosted by Chief Justice Hecht on Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015, at 10:00 a.m. CT in the Supreme Court Courtroom (Room #101) at the Supreme Court of Texas Building, located at 201 W. 14th Street in Austin, Texas.
