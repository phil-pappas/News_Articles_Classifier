We hate seeing rain instead of stars, whether celestial or sporting. Televised matches washed out are replaced with replays of previous encounters. To view the stars and planets when it's raining, go to a planetarium.\nDevices that show the positions and movements of stars and planets go as far back as Archimedes. The Antikythera​ Mechanism , found in an ancient Greek shipwreck early last century, has now been confirmed to be such a device. However, the first instrument to resemble the modern planetarium as we know it celebrates its 92nd anniversary this month. It was demonstrated for the first time in October 1923 at a museum in Munich.\nSince then, their popularity has grown to such a degree that nearly every notable city in the world has one. You can even get them for your computer.\nIn the past, mechanical projectors were used to shine images on the interiors of domes, replicating what one would see outside in the real sky. These days most planetariums use fully computerised programs to put on the show.\nAdvertisement The lights dim softly so that eyes can adjust to the darkness. Slowly, brighter stars become visible just like in a dark rural sky away from city lights.\nThe difference is that in this setting, the sky can rotate very quickly so that you can see the movements of stars and planets, from night to night and season to season. Interesting phenomena are pointed out by an experienced guide. Furthermore, you can be transported to the sky of any place and time, from the night sky of ancient Babylonia, to that seen from Mars thousands of years from now.\nMelbourne has its planetarium at Scienceworks , and Sydney's is at the Observatory . Other Australian cities to have one include Brisbane , Launceston and Perth .
