We are doing everything to please the White people to understand us rather to go through and learn our minds, but the truth White people will never get to understand us as we do not make any significant mark to them. I feel like the psychology of our Black lives is being trapped in a space where we are still blocked to voice out what we feel rather give ideas of how the vehicle should be driven rather how should it deliver. The Psychology of Our Black lives is being blocked into getting down and dig up the truth that is being hidden away from the eyes and ears of our land.\nWe, as Blacks, we have been put in a space where our lives move around into one 4 corner box with no any other corners around to give more space for us to move. We are in a space where our live are being controlled as how should we live, being introduced into cultures that corrupt and kill the new minds of our youth. The psychology of our Black lives is that we are being cooked in a tiny pot and being turned into enemies of each other, being turned into monsters who see nothing wrong into killing a fellow brother into cold red blood. We as Blacks we have been oppressed in a way that we cannot even find a way to explain rather put into words, well recite into a song the oppression of our lives. We have been oppressed with our mind being taken into an experiment of changing us to turn against each other.\nThe psychology of our Black lives is that we are living in a space where White culture is so dominant that we even believe that, what we see rather what has been made by a human is being invented by a White person. We have been brainwashed not only by the way we are controlled but also by education where we are not told about the African Philosopher's, where we are not told that so many was invented by Africans, where we are not given the concrete history of our ancestors, where we do not get the useful clear knowledge of our selfless struggle. We have been made to believe only what is being made present to our eyes and ears. We are subjected to not to ask any questions but to take down notes without getting the full understanding as to why the writings are being driven into one side. We as Blacks we are abused by the same education and the same book which changes the rich history and put a history that is being turned around to make the White people to look so innocent into our faces. We are being abused by the education that never have given us a platform to recommend rather give the curriculum that will give us a clear understanding and a good education of our time.\nThe psychology of our Black lives is that we are like ships that wonder on the ocean without knowing the right direction to follow rather does not know how to read the campus. Our Black lives are driven by the one's who manage to take what belongs to us and took it to themselves. The psychology of our Black lives is that we are being locked in a round circle where we go around it with no action plan as we keep on going back to where we left off. As Black we live a life that is being cooked with so many additives that do not form a part of us. The psychology of our Black lives is that we are not allowed to question but to listen and move get into the ship.\nSoulNature Poet\nONE AFRICAN LOVE MOVEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:18:27.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
