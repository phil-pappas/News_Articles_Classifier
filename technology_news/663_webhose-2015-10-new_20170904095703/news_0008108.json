This system can significantly improve suspension performance and collect suspension energy. \nThis invention by researchers at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPolyU) is a linear switched reluctance actuator for automobile active suspension system. It is an electromagnetic design. The actuator's vertical position (i.e. the vehicles' horizontal level) can be adjusted easily. The response time of the suspension system is much shorter than conventional ones which consist of hydraulic and mechanical parts. It generates control forces to quickly absorb road shocks, suppress vibration and ameliorate both riding safety and comfort. \nMore importantly, the system can recycle the energy generated from the suspension to charge the vehicle batteries. Taking the electric vehicle \"mycar\" as an example, this system can save up to about 5% of the energy consumption when riding on countryside roads. Enables active electromagnetic suspension in vehicles, including electric vehicles and petrol cars Simple and robust configuration Recycles the suspension energy of vehicles (50-300W of electricity could be re-generated during lab test) Fast dynamic performance Direct drive with high efficiency Intelligent force control Optimizes the design of linear switched reluctance actuators \nApplications Active suspension system for vehicles Vibration energy recycling system for vehicles Power seats with active suspension in vehicles Other cases which need active suspension, such as aircrafts and ships 60 percent higher ride quality through electromagnetic car suspension April 7, 2011 \nResearchers at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e, Netherlands) have developed an active electromagnetic suspension system that can increase the ride quality of cars by 60 percent. Cars fitted with this suspension system ...

Judge orders suspension of WhatsApp in Brazil February 26, 2015 \n(AP)â€”A judge says he has ordered the suspension of the globally popular instant messaging system WhatsApp across Brazil because it has allegedly failed to help in an investigation. Smooth videos from airborne TV-cameras July 13, 2015 \nTU Wien and the company Dynamic Perspective develop an advanced camera suspension system, actively controlled to deliver pin sharp videos from dynamic aerial viewpoints. Engineers invent way for cars to harvest energy from bumps in the road August 4, 2015 \nThe 255 million cars on the road in the United States account for 40 percent of the country's fuel consumption. Most of that fuel is wasted.
