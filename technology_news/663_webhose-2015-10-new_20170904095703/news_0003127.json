The IMF is still projecting 7.5 per cent GDP growth this year. There are clearly difficult times ahead but India no longer looks as vulnerable to them as it once did.\"\nEmerging Markets is part of Euromoney Institutional Investor plc, one of the largest providers of financial information worldwide.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:41:44.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
