The TrueFix system is a telecom-grade platform built for emergency call location (such as E9-1-1 or E1-1-2), resource tracking, M2M/IoT and enterprise applications that require accurate, private and secure location.\nAt the core of the TrueFix platform is the TruePosition Wi-Fi location solution powered by the Skyhook Wireless crowd-sourced Wi-Fi database. The TrueFix Wi-Fi solution accurately locates phones and devices, particularly in areas where Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS) technology does not work well – such as indoors and in dense urban environments. The TrueFix platform also supports Enhanced Cell ID (E-CID) for phones that do not have Wi-Fi or A-GPS capabilities, and Z-Axis (vertical) location for phones and devices equipped with barometric pressure sensors. The system is scalable and cost effective, available in a cloud-based or on-premises implementation.\n“The release of the TrueFix platform represents a significant step in our efforts to create a cost-effective, secure, carrier-grade system that will enable U.S. carriers to comply with the FCC’s E9-1-1 indoor mandate,” said Rob Anderson, TruePosition’s Executive Vice President of Engineering and Technology and Chief Technical Officer (CTO). “The same platform addresses a critical unmet need in the global emergency call location, M2M and Location-Based-Services (LBS) markets by locating phones and devices in areas where A-GPS does not work.”\nThe TrueFix demonstration version is available via an Android-based application that can be installed on any Wi-Fi capable phone. The demo application will allow users to track phones via a mobile app and Web-based interface.
