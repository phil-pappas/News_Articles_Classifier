While the UK's tax authority had taken the position that bitcoin is a currency, tax authorities in some countries, such as Sweden and Germany, had argued that it should be treated more like a commodity, making transfers of it subject to sales taxes.\nWhile the ruling is not a surprise, because it follows a July recommendation from one of the court's top lawyers, European bitcoin businesses are breathing a sigh of relief. They had argued such taxes would give a competitive advantage to businesses outside the bloc that did not face similar threats.\nThe ruling is \"the first step in securing bitcoin's future as a genuine alternative to national currencies,\" said Richard Asquith, vice president at tax compliance firm Avalara.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:08:27.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
