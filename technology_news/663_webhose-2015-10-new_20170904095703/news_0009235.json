October 8, 2015 \nDUBLIN, Ga. and CHARLESTON, S.C. — Allgood Pest Solutions and Charleston Termite Company have officially joined forces to protect the Low Country from pest threats. The acquisition, which was completed in August, provides new product options for hundreds of customers. Both companies focus on pest protection for homeowners. In addition, Charleston Termite and Allgood Pest Solutions have had a similar approach to working with partners in real estate. “We all want to make the home buying experience a good one,” commented CEO Lanny Allgood. “As a pest control company, our relationships with homeowners often begin with a termite inspection, but we hope to continue to protect both the house and the family for years to come.” Charleston Termite owner Steve Surface is excited about the venture with Allgood. “My business has focused primarily on termite prevention and management here in the greater Charleston area. Already, my customers appreciate the broader pest protection Allgood offers.” That expanded pest protection comes in the form of a Pest Free Home, Allgood’s product line which promises no pests, no surprises and no hidden costs. Allgood is able to maintain a home free of pests thanks in part to the visit consistency and professional continuity of their “Same Face Promise,” which guarantees the same pest professional visit after visit, with no surprises or it’s free.
