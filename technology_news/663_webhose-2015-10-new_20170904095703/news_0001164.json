Along with Stratasys’ proprietary additive manufacturing systems, a range of machines from its subsidiaries, MakerBot and Solidscape , will also be on display. These 3D printing solutions equip designers, engineers and manufacturers with easy-access to the required tools, solutions and know-how to create accurate 3D printed prototypes, tooling, production parts and processes, in an efficient and cost-effective manner. \nAndy Middleton, President, Stratasys, EMEA, explained: “The shape of Stratasys’ offering to the marketplace has expanded considerably in recent times, as has the range of solutions, systems and services we are able to offer customers. We believe that we are now better placed than ever to deliver customers additive manufacturing solutions throughout the value chain – regardless of their size. \n“This includes strategic consultancy, where we work with companies to build a strategy around additive manufacturing, while our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing service offers easy access to customized 3D printed prototypes and production parts. Our proposition continues through to the implementation stage where we provide on-site expertise via Professional Services and collaborations with worldwide software vendors – such as Adobe and PTC – streamline the process when designing for additive manufacturing. Combine all these facets with our advanced 3D printing systems and materials, and you have a solution for everyone all under one roof.” \nVisitors will also be able to hear directly from Stratasys CEO David Reis, who will deliver a keynote presentation as part of the show’s conference program. Taking place at 10.00am on Thursday 19th November, David Reis will offer his expert view on the current trends and challenges within the industry today, how 3D printing plays a role in the wider prototyping and manufacturing world, and where the growth opportunities lie in the future. \nformnext powered by tct will take place on 17-20th November 2015 in Hall 3, Frankfurt Exhibition Centre.
