San Francisco: Washington, we have a problem.\nAs NASA announced in Washington on Tuesday morning that there was strong evidence to suggest liquid water flows on present-day Mars , its live-stream of the event struggled to cope.\nA screenshot of NASA's live stream buffering its way through a 'major' Mars announcement.\nAt times the stream, hosted on NASA.gov , didn't work at all, simply stating there was \"a problem getting the configuration information\".\nAdvertisement \"Please try again later,\" it said.\nA back-up stream, hosted on video-streaming website Ustream, also failed to load at times throughout the announcement.\nAnother screenshot of the live stream of NASA's \"major\" Mars announcement.\nBefore the event began at 1.30am AEST there were about 30,000 people watching the Ustream stream.\nThat quickly jumped to over 80,000 people as the announcement's start time approached.\nIt appeared the space agency that can send people to the moon and find flowing water on Mars couldn't provide enough internet infrastructure to live stream a major announcement.\nEven NASA's backup stream - hosted on Ustream.tv - failed to show the content at times throughout the announcement.\nBut in a statement to Fairfax Media, NASA said the difficulties came from Akamai, a content delivery network used by websites around the world.\n\"The problems were at Akamai, which provides the streaming capability we use. It affected just about anyone streaming on the Internet, including Ustream, which is why our streams there weren't any better than on NASA.gov ,\" said Brian Dunbar, Internet Services Manager at NASA's Office of Communications.\n\"We first saw them last night during the eclipse, and unfortunately they continued today. I don't have any details on exactly what the problem was, but we haven't found anything in our infrastructure.\"\nA spokesman for Akamai said in a statement however that the problem lay with a third party: \"Upon careful review, the issues experienced yesterday, while tuning into NASA's groundbreaking news conference, were related to a 3rd-party media player. The issue was resolved expediently once identified.\"\nIn the US, Bloomberg TV carried the broadcast but cut it off midway through after Russian President Vladimir Putin began delivering a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly. The US Weather Channel also carried the stream for a short while before cutting to news about wild weather in the US.\nMost other major news channels passed on the opportunity to even attempt to bring the news to their audiences live, opting to screen earthly matters instead, including a press conference from Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump or other live news from the UN.\nAccording to NASA, 130,000 people watched the Mars announcement live stream online, 50,000 on their own infrastructure and 80,000 on Ustream.\nAvid space watchers took to Twitter to joke about the video stream's flakiness :\nFunny how @NASA can find water in mars but can't organise a functioning live stream\n— Steven McNamara (@steven_mcnamara) September 28, 2015 @NASA Your stream isn't working very well. :/\n— Forrest (@comptechie) September 28, 2015 @NASA wants to tell us they gathered information from 140M miles away, but can't send a solid video stream halfway across the country.\n— Lost Gawd (@KKashifT) September 28, 2015 Apparently we can find flowing water on #Mars , but we can't provide enough infrastructure to live stream the announcement. #Nasa #fail\n— Reg Jackson (@rsjiii) September 28, 2015 @NASA is supposed to be our link to the future & #space - but can't even stream a clear signal of the #Mars press conference #FAIL\n— danNY (@DKicksIII) September 28, 2015 Why didn't @NASA use @Youtube live for the stream. @uStream lagging out constantly, and even at some points saying \"Channel off-air\" #fail\n— Brandon Height (@Lask0x) September 28, 2015 As much as the science is fascinating, the stream and presentation are a total embarrassment @NASA\n— Anonymous Twerp (@wtfsheep) September 28, 2015 Even though their stream is awful, @NASA has found liquid water on Mars! h.\n— Jess Molloy (@jessabellerina) September 28, 2015 @NASA Always have trouble with the #nasatv stream when there's something interesting to watch :-/\n— Alexander crosby (@crosbyar) September 28, 2015 Stupid Nasa live stream won't work, but from what I can gather we're all going surfing on Mars, right? #hang10 #cowabunga\n— James Maher (@mistermaher) September 28, 2015 @johngreen @NASA the stream keeps crashing and buffering for me.
