A record 20.5 million were gained in August, taking the total 4G user base to more than 229 million and exceeding 3G subscriber numbers for the first time.\nChina Mobile – listed in Hong Kong and with American depositary receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange – has now strung together three consecutive months of 19 million-plus new 4G subscribers. The telco's overall customer base has climbed to 820 million. China Mobile dominates the wireless market in China, with a market share of about 63 per cent, and should continue to build on its first-mover advantage in the 4G market.\nNow two-thirds of the way through the year, it looks as though China Mobile will easily smash its stated goal of 250 million 4G customers by year end. These are sought after as the data traffic per month per user is about 2.5 times the blended average of the entire user base.\nData traffic growth is very much becoming the revenue and earnings driver for the company. As the high-speed mix (3G and 4G combined) increases, we expect to see a resumption of growth in the average revenue per user (ARPU) metric, which has been under pressure as legacy revenues such as voice and SMS wind down and due to the popularity of \"over-the-top\" messaging applications.\nAbout 139 million 4G customers have been added in the year to date and, despite some of these seemingly migrating from 3G, the high-speed mix now sits at about 53 per cent. This represents a major shift from 25 per cent at the end of 2013.\nThe rapid uptake of 4G, along with discounted data rates, has led to an explosion of data traffic (up more than 150 per cent in the first half) across the company's networks. This is a phenomenon we expect to continue as video and other media is increasingly consumed on mobile devices.\nThe launch of Apple's latest iPhone models should further boost 4G subscriber uptake. While all three carriers in China will have the smartphones available, we expect China Mobile to sell more thanks to better promotions and its superior 4G network.\nPositively, the bulk of capital expenditure related to the extensive 4G rollout is also in the rear-view mirror. Free cash flow in the first half accordingly surged almost 58 per cent to RMB57.3 billion ($12.4 billion).\n China-related equities have been hit hard in recent months and China Mobile shares have not been immune to the rout. However, the business is relatively defensive in nature and the company's market position is very strong.\nWe view China Mobile's valuation as undemanding on about 14 times FY15 earnings estimates, and 13 times the following year. On an enterprise value to EBITDA basis, the shares look more attractive thanks to the company's massive net cash position. The ratio comes in at just 4.3 times and 4.1 times respectively over the same time frames.\nThus the value in China Mobile is clear. However, any investment should be taken with a medium-term view and with appreciation for the considerable volatility in Chinese equities.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.\nDisclosure: Interests associated with Fat Prophets declare a holding in China Mobile.\nOnline: For a free trial of Fat Prophets' daily market commentary please click here http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview", "external_links": ["http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview", "https://webmail.fatprophets.com.au/owa/redir.aspx?C=1FcMqgWj8Uut_OmGESNhBJEGBVmUw9IIuC5Ai2F9Tp0O-GWRZJzGDGD0V0eTuwvGr_tsamaGzL4.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.fatprophets.com.au%2ffranked_dividends.aspx%3fref%3dFinReview"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:31:57.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
