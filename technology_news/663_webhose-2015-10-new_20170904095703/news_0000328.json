The independently adjudicated data from The PARTNER II S3 Trial, which studied 583 high-risk and inoperable patients in the United States , were presented by Howard C. Herrmann , M.D., the John Winthrop Bryfogle Professor of Cardiovascular Diseases, and Director of Penn Medicine's Interventional Cardiology Program in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, during the late-breaking clinical trials session at the 27th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT), the annual scientific symposium of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. \nAmong the one-year outcomes reported in this large, rigorous U.S. FDA study, SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was associated with a very low overall disabling stroke rate of 2.4 percent, which is lower than this patient population's general risk of stroke. 1,2 \nThere were zero patients with severe paravalvular leak and only 2.7 percent with moderate paravalvular leak. Furthermore, for patients with mild or less paravalvular leak, there was no association with increased mortality. There was no evidence of clinical valve thrombosis or structural valve deterioration in these patients. \n\"These excellent results with the SAPIEN 3 valve support the use of TAVR as the preferred therapy for patients at high or greater risk for surgical aortic valve replacement,\" said Herrmann. \"The combination of new design features of the SAPIEN 3 valve, procedural improvements, operator experience and improved patient selection have all contributed to strikingly low rates of one-year mortality, as well as other important adverse events, including stroke, in high-risk and inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis.\" \nThe SAPIEN 3 study is a single-arm, non-randomized cohort of The PARTNER II Trial. The one-year analysis documented outcomes of the first 583 patients, whose average age was over 80, treated with the SAPIEN 3 valve at 29 centers nationwide and concluded January 2014. Access approaches included transfemoral (n=491) and transapical/transaortic (n=92), both high-risk and inoperable, as determined by the Heart Team. \nThe SAPIEN 3 valve was approved in Europe in January 2014 and in the U.S. in June 2015 for the treatment of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. \nClinical Outcomes at 1 Year from The PARTNER II High-Risk/Inoperable Trial with the SAPIEN 3 Valve (As-Treated): Clinical Outcomes 30 Days 1 Year All-cause mortality - % \n2.2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:31:17.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
