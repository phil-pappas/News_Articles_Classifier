(PRWEB) October 05, 2015\n2015 Health 2.0 Annual Fall Conference – Healthline Networks, a leading provider of intelligent health information and technology solutions, today announced the launch of Talix , a new health technology company focused on disrupting the healthcare risk adjustment market. Talix provides data analytics applications to help providers, payers and accountable care organizations gain deeper patient insights, improve patient risk management, achieve better outcomes and reduce costs. It does this by uniquely mining the fast-growing trove of both unstructured and structured patient data often buried in electronic medical record (EMR) systems.\n“Healthline has been tremendously successful over the years, both in the consumer space and the enterprise software space,” said Dean Stephens, CEO of Healthline Networks. “Our consumer health information business, Healthline.com, is the fifth largest health site in the U.S. today and is by far the fastest growing, reaching nearly 40 million unique users last month. Our enterprise software business has also been growing rapidly, serving many Fortune 100 healthcare companies through what has been our Healthcare Information Technology (HIT) Group.”\n“The mounting realization that we must differentiate Healthline’s two businesses as each continue to expand, combined with the growing market need for more impactful solutions in the healthcare risk adjustment space, led us to found and launch Talix,” said Talix General Manager Derek Gordon. “We intend for Talix to be nothing less than the premier healthcare risk adjustment solution provider in the U.S.”\nHealthline Networks is transferring its proprietary technologies developed over 15 years, including its health graph (a semantic taxonomy), clinical natural language processing (NLP) technology, search technology and a configurable clinical rules database, to the new wholly owned subsidiary company. Together, these technologies make up the Talix HealthData Engine .\nTalix’s Coding InSight application – the first SaaS application in a planned suite of healthcare risk adjustment apps built on the Talix HealthData Engine – enables provider and payer organizations to improve coding efficiency, optimize patient risk scoring and accurately realize reimbursements. Coding InSight delivers an automated method of analyzing vast amounts of patient data – both structured and unstructured – to uncover missed coding opportunities prospectively and retrospectively. As a result, healthcare organizations and payers are able to effectively close risk adjustment gaps, better manage patient population risk and improve health outcomes.\nTalix’s risk adjustment expert and Healthline Networks’ chief strategy officer, Murray Brozinsky, will demonstrate Coding InSight at the Health 2.0 Annual Fall Conference in Santa Clara, California on Tuesday, October 6, 2015 at 1 p.m. during the “Big Data Analytics for Population Health Management” breakout session.\nMore information about Talix can be found at http://www.talix.com .
