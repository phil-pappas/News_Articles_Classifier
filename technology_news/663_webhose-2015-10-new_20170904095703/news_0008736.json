Our message is 'Out the box, connect, configure and go',\" explains Fiona Keen, business manager.\nThe stackable K-Box is an ideal data capture solution for applications that require a large number of thermocouple and analog inputs. (For example 10 K-Boxes can be used to acquire data from 80 thermocouples). Accurate sensor measurement data is transmitted periodically on the CAN Bus enabling multiple devices to be connected together. The K-Box CAN Bus settings, calibration and sampling rates are all easily configurable. These settings are stored in the K-Box even when not powered.\n\"The system also works independently with our new Rebel Dash CAN display, which offers different modes, so data can be viewed in several ways. It is highly rugged, it can be used in cold and high temperatures, and it can be seen in bright sunlight,\" says Keen.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/k-box.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:25:53.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
