In 2002 I matriculated with an exemption, applied at Rhodes and RAU Universities but was unable to afford the admission fee. Both my parents were unemployed and both my older sisters never went to tertiary.\nI was heartbroken and distraught as I knew and understood that my family can only escape the chains of poverty if one of my siblings went to university. I looked for a job and was fortunate to be employed at a retail store for casual work that paid me R6.50 p/h.\nI could never be guaranteed how much I would receive as my days were not stable.
