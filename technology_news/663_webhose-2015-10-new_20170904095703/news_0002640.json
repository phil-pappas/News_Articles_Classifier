In order to broaden even further, Sekai Lab has come to establish US headquarters in California, the world's largest and the most advanced district in tech industry, for the following four reasons. Human resources of software development in the U.S., especially in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles are scarce. Therefore the market demand for reasonable and skilled engineer resources in Asia is prospected. There was a need for setting up US headquarters to offer services supporting Japanese and Chinese companies entering and expanding in North America. A need to provide localization services to support North American companies enter and expand in Asian markets (especially China).
