Non-IFRS total revenue increased 14%, with software revenue growth of 13% and services and other revenue growth of 23%.

Excluding acquisitions and in constant currencies, non-IFRS software revenue increased 8%, with non-IFRS new licenses software revenue growth of 11% and periodic, maintenance and other software revenue growth of 7% for the 2015 nine-month period. During the first nine months of 2015, the Company’s growth was well-supported by both its core industries, most notably Transportation & Mobility and Aerospace & Defense and its diversification industries, in particular Energy, Process & Utilities, Life Sciences, Marine & Offshore and CPG. On a regional basis, for the nine-month period, growth was relatively balanced across the three regions from both a total software perspective and an organic software basis. (All growth rates are in constant currencies.) Non-IFRS software revenue increased 13%, with new licenses revenue growth of 17%. Non-IFRS periodic license, maintenance and other software-related revenue increased 12% with a strong performance across all three regions. Recurring software revenue represented 72% of total software revenue for the 2015 nine-month period and was comprised of maintenance and periodic licenses (rental or subscriptions). (All growth comparisons are in constant currencies.) By product line, non-IFRS software revenue increased 4% for CATIA, 12% for SOLIDWORKS, 2% for ENOVIA, and Other Software, which included the 2014 acquisitions of Quintiq and Accelrys, increased 35%.

Business Outlook \nThibault de Tersant, Senior Executive Vice President, CFO, commented, “Our third quarter financial results were well aligned with our guidance. Thanks to broad-based growth in Europe and the Americas, we were able to absorb the short-term market volatility in Asia as well as high year-ago comparisons in that region. \n“Based upon our progress year-to-date, we confirm our two key 2015 financial goals - double-digits organic new licenses revenue growth in constant currencies and an organic improvement in our non-IFRS operating margin of 100 basis points. Year-to-date organic new licenses revenue increased 11% exclusive of any currency benefits and on an organic basis we have improved our operating margin by 80 basis points. \n“Turning to our outlook, thanks to our pipeline of opportunities with clients we see a strong finish to the year with a fourth quarter embedding organic double-digit new licenses revenue growth in constant currencies. We therefore reaffirm our 2015 financial objectives and upgrade them for currency upside from Q3 and the reversal of tax reserves. As a result, we now target a non-IFRS EPS objective of about €2.20, increasing 21% in comparison to last year.” \nThe Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial objectives are as follows: Fourth quarter 2015 non-IFRS total revenue objective of about €745-755 million based upon the exchange rates assumptions below; non-IFRS operating margin of about 34%, and non-IFRS EPS of about €0.66; 2015 non-IFRS revenue growth objective of about 12% in constant currencies at €2.82 to €2.83 billion (based upon the 2015 currency exchange rate assumptions below); 2015 non-IFRS operating margin of about 30%, compared to 2014 where the non-IFRS operating margin was 29.8%; 2015 non-IFRS EPS of about €2.20, representing a growth objective of about 21%; Objectives are based upon exchange rate assumptions of US$1.15 per €1.00 and JPY135 per €1.00 for the 2015 fourth quarter and US$1.12 per €1.00 and JPY134.8 per €1.00 for the full year. \nThe Company’s objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below. \nThe 2015 non-IFRS objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements and are estimated based upon the 2015 currency exchange rates above: deferred revenue write-downs estimated at approximately €37 million, share-based compensation expense, estimated at approximately €35 million and amortization of acquired intangibles estimated at approximately €160 million.

Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors. The Company’s current outlook for 2015 takes into consideration, among other things, an uncertain global economic environment. In light of the continuing uncertainties regarding economic, business, social and geopolitical conditions at the global level, the Company’s revenue, net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly, whether on an annual or quarterly basis. While the Company makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook, the Company’s business results, however, may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore, due to factors affecting sales of the Company’s products and services as described above, there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results. \nIn preparing such forward-looking statements, the Company has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.15 per €1.00 for the 2015 fourth quarter and US$1.12 per €1.00 for the full year as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY135.0 to €1.00 for the fourth quarter and JPY134.8 to €1.00 for the full year; however, currency values fluctuate, and the Company’s results of operations may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThe Company’s actual results or performance may also be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in the “Risk Factors” section of the 2014 Document de Référence , filed with the AMF on March 24, 2015, and also available on the Company’s website www.3ds.com . \nNon-IFRS Financial Information \nReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered as a substitute for IFRS measurements. Also, the Company’s supplemental non-IFRS financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. Further specific limitations for individual non-IFRS measures, and the reasons for presenting non-IFRS financial information, are set forth in the Company’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in the Company’s 2014 Document de Référence filed with the AMF on March 24, 2015. \nIn the tables accompanying this press release the Company sets forth its supplemental non-IFRS figures for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, which exclude the effect of adjusting the carrying value of acquired companies’ deferred revenue, share-based compensation expense and related social charges, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other operating income and expense, net, certain one-time items included in financial revenue and other, net, and the income tax effect of the non-IFRS adjustments and certain one-time tax effects. The tables also set forth the most comparable IFRS financial measure and reconciliations of this information with non-IFRS information. \nInformation in Constant Currencies \nWhen the Company believes it would be helpful for understanding trends in its business, the Company provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed herein \"in constant currencies\", the results of the \"prior\" period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year, and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year. \nAbout Dassault Systèmes \nDassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.
