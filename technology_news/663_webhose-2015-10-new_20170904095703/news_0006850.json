First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) up, Chinese exports are expected to have contracted 6% year-on-year in September, on weak external demand and an extra holiday in the month. Imports are projected to fall 15.9%. The trade surplus may have fallen from $60.2bn to $47.90bn last month, according to analysts' predictions. \nThe report comes amid concerns about the slowdown in the world's second largest economy so any further sign of weakness is likely to add to woes. \nIn the UK, inflation is expected to remain at 0% year-on-year in September, well below the Bank of England's 2% target. On a month-on-month comparison, the consumer price index is forecast to fall to 0% last month from 0.2% in August. \nThe BoE said the outlook for CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) in coming months looked weaker than it previously thought, according to the meeting minutes of its 8 September policy meeting. The central bank, which is taking inflation into close consideration in determining the timing of an interest rate hike, said CPI was unlikely to reach 1% until the spring of 2016. \nMeanwhile, the BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) will release its Credit Conditions and Bank Liabilities surveys, which are key in the Bank's assessment of economic conditions. \nElsewhere, Germany will see the release of its ZEW survey on economic conditions as well as the final estimate of CPI for September. \nTuesday 13 October INTERIMS LiDCO Group (Other OTC: LDRUF - news ) INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Intertek Group (Other OTC: IKTSF - news ) INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Trade balance (CHINA) Consumer Price Index (GER) (07:00) ZEW Survey (EU) (10:00) ZEW Survey (GER) (10:00) GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) O'Key Group GDR (Reg S) (WI) FINALS DotDigital Group (LSE: DOTD.L - news ) , Nanoco Group (LSE: NANO.L - news ) , Proactis Holdings (LSE: PHD.L - news ) IMSS Michael Page International (Other OTC: MPGPF - news ) EGMS GCP Infrastructure Investments Ltd, UDG Healthcare Public Limited Company AGMS CSF Group (LSE: CSFG.L - news ) , FinnAust Mining (LSE: FAM.L - news ) , Leeds Group (LSE: LDSG.L - news ) , Myanmar Investments International Ltd, Premaitha Health (LSE: NIPT.L - news ) TRADING ANNOUNCEMENTS Michael Page International UK ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS BRC Sales Monitor (00:01) Consumer Price Index (09:30) Producer Price Index (09:30) Retail Price Index (09:30)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:50:19.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
