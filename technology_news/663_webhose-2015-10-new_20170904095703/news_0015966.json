You do still experience gravity in space and Newton knew this. Gravity is what keeps the earth around the sun and the moon around the earth. While we call it zero G when in space what is actually happening is that the astronauts are in free fall. The space ship, or station, and all that is in it is falling at the same speed, this gives the feeling that there is no gravity. We can get the same effect here on earth by flying a parabolic.\n“On a more serious note, the first person to predict zero gravity, had to have been a super genius. To see something that nobody else has seen, in their imaginations. A truly ridiculous theory, of people and things floating around, and to successfully convince other people of this was amazing.”\nAs I explained that is not what Newton had to do. What did do was give us the first predictive theory of what gravity is. He even worked out how fast you had to travel to get into orbit. With this theory other people could do experiments and see for themselves.\n“Is it such a stretch of the imagination to assume that there are other such, fundamental principals that we are currently ill equipped to conceive that will in the future be universally accepted.”\nOnly if we work on teaching our kids science and math.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:45:25.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
