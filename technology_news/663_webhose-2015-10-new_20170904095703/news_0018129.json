The St. Louis-based vertical sporting goods retailer will use the RetailNext store analytics platform to optimize its brick-and-mortar shopping experience at all five company-owned factory outlet stores. The comprehensive RetailNext platform will be deployed at all Rawlings-owned factory outlets in an attempt to uncover deep customer behavioral insights that can be used to create a better in-store experience.“We are pleased to begin working with RetailNext on various in-store optimization projects,” said Scott Kennedy, business analytics manager at Rawlings. “The test-and-learn methodology e-commerce implements today will be the new standard for in-store operations tomorrow. Questions as simple as, ‘should we leave the front door open or closed during the day,’ will now be evaluated by the shopper acquisition rate metrics gained from RetailNext.
