He is the author of the respected blog “Reverse Engineering Mac OS X: https://reverse.put.as . Pedro is an expert in reverse engineering malware and rootkits to improve security for Mac OS X and Apple iOS. WHAT: Pedro Vilaça recently disclosed an Apple EFI firmware zero day that lets remote attackers compromise the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) on Mac computers and install rootkits. Firmware-level malware is not detected by most virus scanners, anti-malware products and forensics tools. In a session entitled, “Is There an EFI Monster Inside Your Apple?”, he will present research findings that include: -- An overview of the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and how hackers and government agencies can exploit its flaws to install rootkits that bypass full-disk encryption, remain undetected for long periods of time and persist across OS reinstalls -- How to reverse EFI binaries and search for EFI rootkits, and increase security in OS X -- Best practices for defending the enterprise from stealth EFI attacks SyScan360, Beijing Marriott Hotel Northeast, 26A Xiaoyun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China 100125 Wednesday, October 21, 2015 from 10:50 am – 11:40 am To schedule a conversation with Pedro Vilaça, please contact Marc Gendron at marc@mgpr.net or 781-237-0341. \nAbout SyScan360 \nFollowing BlackHat and DEFCON in Las Vegas, the security industry shifts to Asia with SyScan360 in Beijing, China on October 21-22.
