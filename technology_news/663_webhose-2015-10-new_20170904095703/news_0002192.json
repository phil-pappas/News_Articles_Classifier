The service streamlines toxicity testing of compounds in InSphero’s 3D liver microtissues by initiating regular screening runs on the first Tuesday of each month at a cost of $990 per compound. The newest addition to the company’s growing portfolio of 3D InSight™ Services takes advantage of the more liver-like functionality and greater than 4 week in vitro lifespan of primary liver cells (hepatocytes and Kupffer cells) when co-cultured as 3D spheroids, allowing repeated dosing of compounds over the two week testing protocol. Such testing is unique to 3D cultures, as the same cells grown in 2D (monolayer) culture live only a matter of days, allowing only limited assessment of drug toxicities. The service quantifies total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a measurement of cell viability, an assay routinely used to assess drug induced liver injury (DILI). Results for test compounds and defined control compounds are returned to the customer three weeks after initial dosing. Since its commercial launch in 2010, InSphero has seen the rapid adoption of its 3D InSight™ Microtissues and Services by leading pharmaceutical, chemical and cosmetics companies. More recently, large pharma organizations have completed validation studies and begun converting from conventional assays to InSphero’s 3D microtissues. Dr. Johannes Haugstetter, Director of Services for InSphero, says exposing cells to drugs over 14 days can reveal toxicity at lower doses than seen when only treated for a matter of hours or days, as in 2D hepatocyte assays. “Long-term exposure in 3D models more accurately predicts potential drug toxicity by mimicking native liver tissue and the repeated exposure to drugs that would be experienced by a patient repeatedly taking the drug. 14 Day Hepatotoxicity Testing provides more reliable evidence of a drug’s safety or potential toxicity, and does so at a fraction of the cost of animal models which may not accurately reflect the response in humans. Growing acceptance of our liver microtissues as a more predictive and mechanistically relevant model necessitated the adoption of a convenient format for routine, long-term testing of compounds that emerge from primary screens.” The 14 Day Hepatotoxicity Testing Service complements an array of InSphero standard and custom service offerings , including endpoints to determine functional and mechanistic drug toxicity in 3D microtissues derived from liver, pancreas, heart, brain and skin.

About InSphero InSphero provides superior biological relevance to in vitro testing with its easy-to-use solutions for production, culture and assessment of more organotypic 3D cell culture models. The company’s patented 3D cell culture platforms and methods enable large-scale, reproducible production of a broad range of assay-ready 3D InSight™ Microtissues derived from liver, pancreas, tumor, heart, brain and skin. These models and contract research services utilizing them help to identify promising drugs and toxic liabilities with greater predictivity at early development stages, enabling better pre-clinical decision making, saving development cost, and shortening time to market. InSphero’s technologies drive significant findings in peer-reviewed journals, through collaborative projects such as EU Body on a Chip and HeCaToS, and validation in the world’s largest government institutions and pharmaceutical, chemical and cosmetics companies. This 3D know-how is now also being applied in the diagnostics field to aid development of personalized chemotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer. Founded in 2009, the privately held company is headquartered in Schlieren, Switzerland with subsidiaries in the United States (Brunswick, ME) and Waldshut, Germany. It has been recognized for its scientific and commercial achievements with a number of national and international awards. \nRead the full story at http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018236.htm .
