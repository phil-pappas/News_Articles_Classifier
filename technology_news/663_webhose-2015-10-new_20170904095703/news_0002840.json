Photo: AP\nHackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace broke into Sony Pictures computers and last November released thousands of emails, documents, social security numbers and other personal information in an attempt to derail the release of the North Korean-focused comedy The Interview . The US government blamed North Korea for the attack.\nAdvertisement In a memo to staff on Tuesday, Sony Entertainment chief executive officer Michael Lynton called the agreement \"an important, positive step forward in putting the cyber-attack firmly behind us\".\nSony Corp chief executive officer Kazuo Hirai told a technology conference on Tuesday that following the hack, the movie studio has \"come out more resilient, more strong and they have a very good management team in place now\". Hirai said there wasn't much of a business impact from the hack, although he said employee morale was hurt for a short time.\nFormer Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal left her position after a trove of embarrassing emails was leaked, including racially insensitive remarks about US President Barack Obama's purported taste in movies. She continues to run a production venture at Sony that will handle major blockbuster franchises such as the Spider-Man series.\nAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:05:08.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
