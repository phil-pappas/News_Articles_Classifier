Photo: Bloomberg\nIf you own an Android device it's almost certainly vulnerable to a remote attack that can be triggered simply by receiving a media file in a messaging app.\nThe recently revealed bug known as \"Stagefright\" affected nearly one billion Android handsets, most of which were from LG, Samsung or Google. The bug could be remotely exploited when an Android device received a malicious media file in an MMS, giving an attacker complete control of the affected device.\nThe bug was severe enough that all three firms promised from August to deliver users monthly security updates and fix haphazard patching on Android that has historically left millions of users exposed to old bugs and unable to update to secure versions of Android.\nGoogle's next security update for its Nexus phones and tablets will contain fixes for two more high severity flaws in Android that have been dubbed \"Stagefright 2.0\". The common name is derived from the bugs being located in the media playback engine built into Android called Stagefright or \"libstagefright\".\nAdvertisement Joshua Drake, the researcher at security firm Zimperium who reported the first Stagefright bug to Google in April, on Friday revealed details about the new bugs on a company blog.\nZimperium founder and CEO Zuk Avraham told Fairfax Media the latest two Stagefright bugs are likely not going to be the last, meaning that Android vendors shifting to a monthly update cycle was a well-timed but also necessary move.\nGoogle reportedly fixed the bugs in Nexus devices with a patch issued on Tuesday. What's not known at this stage is how long it will take for Samsung and LG to issues faces for their respective flagships, nor whether their older devices will receive the patch.\n\"No one really knows how many stage fright bugs are out there now. I wouldn't assume this is the last one. I would assume there are many more,\" said Avraham.\nOne of the new bugs affects every version of Android from the current 5.0 Lollipop down to the first release of Android in 2008 known as version 1.0. An attacker could exploit the flaw by sending a vulnerable device a specially crafted MP3 or MP4 file, though devices would need have installed third-party apps that can load and read media files.\nThe other bug is limited to Android 5.0 and above, however can be exploited with the device's default applications.\nGoogle last week confirmed it had 1.4 billion active Android users, 90 per cent of whom are running Android 5.0, Android 4.4 KitKat or Android 4.3 to 4.1 Jelly Bean. Less than 10 per cent of users are on earlier versions.\nGoogle had previously said Stagefright attacks would have been mitigated on 90 per cent of Android devices as it has since 2012 enabled the anti-exploitation technology Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR) in Android. However, researchers at its security team Project Zero recently revealed last month it is possible to bypass ASLR in Android.\nAvraham said the \"scary part\" about bugs like Stagefright is that they show that attackers don't require large resources or weapons to have the tools to inflict serious damage.\n\"Having a lot of weapons doesn't mean you have an advantage these days. In the cyber world, you don't need a lot of F-16s. You need one really good hacker — someone like Josh,\" said Avraham.\n\"Suddenly you have a lot of people you haven't heard of — 17 to 18 year old kids — in the security community that have very good technical skills. The new generation are actually really good and you only need one of these guys to perform such an attack. Just one,\" he added.", "external_links": ["http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.se/2015/09/stagefrightened.html", "https://blog.zimperium.com/zimperium-zlabs-is-raising-the-volume-new-vulnerability-processing-mp3mp4-media/", "https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:09:48.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
