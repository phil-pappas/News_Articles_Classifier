Mink commented, “Pallet racking has been a popular and effective storage method in warehouses, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers for decades due in large part to its ease of design and implementation. As easy as it may be to install some frames and beams and call it a day, it’s also important to assess the need for pallet supports or wire decks and to decide which is best for your application.”\n· Just the Beams: The two beams that make up a storage level work hard to keep your pallets up in the air but those beams alone are often not sufficient to keep your loads safely elevated.\n· Pallet Support Crossbars: One method of providing more sufficient support for your pallet is to use pallet support cross bars. Typically, two pallet supports are used per pallet position, but more can be used depending on the weight or state of the pallet.\n· Wire Mesh Decking: Wire mesh decking is an upgrade over pallet supports and can be used successfully in almost any selective pallet rack application.\nIn addition to providing more uniform support than pallet supports for potentially weak or damaged pallets, it also provides the versatility to store cases that are not palletized. In this way, wire decking can serve a similar purpose to plywood or solid steel decking but is preferred by fire inspectors everywhere since it allows sprinklers to spray through to lower levels. Wire mesh decking is typically more expensive than pallet support crossbars but creates a safer and more versatile storage surface.\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://ow.ly/Toeb2\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
