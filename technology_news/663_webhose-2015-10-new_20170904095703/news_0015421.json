The new threesomes app is proving popular. Picture: Supplied \nTHERE are no two ways about it: this dating app was built for threesomes. \nLondon-based start-up 3nder — whose name can be pronounced “Thrinder” to rhyme with “Tinder,” according to its founder — has raised $US500,000 ($690,000) in seed capital from a pair of unnamed angel investors, New York Post reports. \nSince 3nder’s mid-2014 launch, nearly 1 million users have downloaded the iOS app in search of kinky hook-ups — whether “straight, bisexual, gay, poly- or pansexual,” says founder and CEO Dimo Trifonov. \nThe growth has spilled into the US, where New York is 3nder’s second-biggest market behind California. Worldwide, users are sending about 1.2 million messages a month on 3nder while logging around 4 million swipes. \nThat falls sorely short of the 1 billion swipes per day seen on Tinder, the hook-up app whose viral growth is boosting billionaire Barry Diller’s IAC/Interactive. Three’s the magic number ... Nearly a third of the accounts created on 3nder are couples, and most are millennials. Picture: Supplied \nStill, 3nder’s smallish subscriber base is a motivated one that’s willing to pay its monthly fee of nearly $US13. Revenue is up 500 per cent this year, and “it’s all organic, we haven’t done any marketing or advertising,” Mr Trifonov told The Post .
