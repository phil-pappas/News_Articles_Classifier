Its shares were up 8.1 percent at 0753 GMT.\nThe raised guidance was due to a number of large orders received during the latter part of the third quarter, reflecting continued growing demand and a strengthening of the company's delivery capacity, Fingerprint said.\nThe company said its third-quarter revenue amounted to around 960 million crowns, based on preliminary figures, which would be above the its guidance of around 860 million. It will release final third-quarter results early next month.\nFourth-quarter revenue is expected to be higher than in the third quarter, it added.\nChief Executive Jorgen Lantto repeated the firm's forecast that about 50 percent of the smartphones sold globally in 2016 would use fingerprint sensors, up from around 30 percent this year, but he declined to give a forecast for the firm's revenues or market share next year.\nExcluding Apple, which makes its own sensors, Fingerprint targets half of the market for touch fingerprint sensors for smartphones in 2015.\n\"Around 20 suppliers of mobile phones have announced phones with our sensors (in 2015),\" Lantto said, adding that only two suppliers had used its sensors last year.\nShares in Fingerprint Cards have risen more than eight-fold so far in 2015 on the back of the rising demand. The company had previously raised its 2015 sales forecast in August, June and May.\n($1 = 8.2451 Swedish crowns) (Editing by Terje Solsvik and Pravin Char)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:10:46.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
