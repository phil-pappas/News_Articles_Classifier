The effect is called \"Contextual Content,\" meaning that the content is tailored to fit a user's changing context throughout their day. \nApps built with Fusion emphasize habitual use through real time web content on mobile devices combined with more traditional periodical content on tablets. The goal is to convert casual web users into dedicated app loyalists by growing the mobile user base and fostering in-app engagement. \nFusion was built specifically for iOS 9 and powers apps for iPhone, iPad and even Apple Watch, enabling brands to truly be available anywhere, anytime. \n\"Most magazine brands also have a significant web presence and yet their native apps typically include only digital replicas of the print,\" said MAZ CEO, Paul Canetti, \"With Fusion, our aim is to converge web and periodical content into a unified brand experience that matches the expectation of the mobile user: getting what you want, when and how you want it.\" \nFusion, like MAZ's other products, is a fully managed cloud service, complete with publishing and marketing tools, analytics, and dynamic advertising integration. \nFor more information about Fusion or about MAZ, visit mazdigital.com. \nCONTACT: Shouvik Paul", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:13:33.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
