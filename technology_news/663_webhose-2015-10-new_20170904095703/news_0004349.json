Picture: David Geraghty Source: News Corp Australia\nOne of the nation’s leading venture capitalists says information technology courses must become a core part of primary school curriculums and believes there is merit in considering the potential mandating of superannuation contributions into the Australian tech sector.\nPaul Bassat, who leads the James Packer-backed venture capital firm Square Peg Capital, said Australian entrepreneurs could also learn from the Israeli experience where softwear developers are trying to solve globally significant problems rather than simply imitating what had been done in other markets.\nSquare Peg Capital has spent tens of millions of dollars on more than 20 investments in a range of start-up companies, largely in Australia.\nNow the company intends to spend $US150 million ($212m) in Israel over the next three to five years in venture and growth-stage online and technology companies. Square Peg co-founder Dan Krasnostein moved to Tel Aviv last year to lead expansion plans. Former Cisco executive Arad Naveh has also joined Square Peg as a venture partner based in Israel.\n“We see here in Australia some of the entrepreneurs trying to solve big and hard problems. But we do see probably too many people trying to solve what I would sort of see as relatively small problems or essentially imitating what other people have done successfully in other markets. And the Israelis are typically trying to solve big, hard, complicated problems, which I think is really exciting,” Mr Bassat told The Australian in an interview for the Cracking the Code series, in partnership with GE.\n“It is so hard to build a successful start-up. There are so many things that can go wrong. The risks are so weighed against you. If you’re going to do it, go off and try to solve a big hard problem rather than trying to solve a small problem. And that’s the thing that I think we see out of Israel really consistently.\n“One of the things that’s happened in Israel is that market has evolved ... Hopefully we can go through a similar journey in Australia.”\nIn June Square Peg took a delegation of 40 leading Australian technology entrepreneurs, investors and executives, together representing more than $US150 billion in value, to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to learn about the Israeli hi-tech industry.\nThe delegation included James Packer and former Telstra chief David Thodey as well as Rob Rankin, chief executive of Mr Packer’s Consolidated Press Holdings, Evans & Partner founder David Evans, Carsales chief Greg Roebuck, Seek boss Andrew Bassat, Square Peg backer Justin Liberman, and his cousin Josh Liberman.\n“The interesting thing for me is (to note) how many of the Israeli companies have data at their core.” Mr Bassat said.\nSquare Peg has invested in several early-stage Israeli storage and database softwear technology businesses, including Feedvisor, the world’s first algorithmic pricing and business intelligence platform for online retailers.\nOnly weeks after Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes called for local companies to be ­allowed to import “masses” of the best workers from Silicon Valley, Mr Bassat said the local education system needed to be overhauled to improve our track record on innovation.\nNew Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has already declared that innovation would be at the centre of his government’s agenda. A recent Committee for Economic Development of Australia report warned that 40 per cent of Australia’s workforce, more than five million people, could be replaced by automation within the next 10 to 15 years\n“For me, the most important thing by far is the education system. We need to be investing heavily in IT education. From primary school it needs to be a core and compulsory part of the curriculum for all kids, in the same way that maths and English are,” Mr Bassat said.\nMr Bassat added that most problems in the world were being solved by software “and therefore you need a large number of really smart, really talented software engineers as well as all other relevant skills”.\nThere have also been calls for Australian super funds to invest more in the local venture capital industry. But they have been hamstrung by the standard risk-return model and their investment mandates.\nJosh Liberman last year called for a certain proportion of super fund profits each year to be dedicated to risk ventures for which they would receive a full tax deduction.\nMr Bassat, who is also a director of Wesfarmers and serves on the Australian Football League Commission, said there was some merit in the arguments.\n“I generally prefer not mandating because usually when you create rules that then creates a whole lot of loopholes and exceptions and creates unintended consequences. But the argument’s definitely not without merit. More capital would be a really good thing.”\nBut he stressed that more entrepreneurs and more software engineers was “priority one”.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/04/1227556/777799-b8d99c1e-6a2a-11e5-9bb9-94d25a90b8df.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:08:00.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
