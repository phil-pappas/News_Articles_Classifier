CEO Satya Nadella said the company wants to “move people from needing Windows to choosing Windows to loving Windows.”\nMicrosoft introduced two new Surface tablets. The first company-designed PC sold poorly when introduced in 2012, but the latest models show the company is now moving from a “position of strength,” Moorhead said in an interview.\nIn July, Microsoft reported Surface sales, driven by the Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3, generated $888 million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, up 117 percent during the year. Tablets generated $3.6 billion in revenue, up 65 percent from the year before.\n“One of the biggest reasons they’ve gotten into these devices is because their Windows franchise, with the success of Apple, was at risk,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft introduced the Surface Book, a laptop with a tablet-style detachable screen. The Book starts $1,499, while the new Surface Pro 4 tablet will start at $899.\nAnalyst Geoff Blaber, vice president of research for CCS Insight, said via e-mail that the Book was “a highly innovative flagship device that will act as a much needed halo product for Windows 10 and the broader PC market. Surface Book proves that innovation in personal computing is not just confined to Apple’s Cupertino campus.”\nBut Blaber said Microsoft’s three new mobile phones, the Lumia 950, Lumia 950 XL and Lumia 550, still can’t challenge Apple, Google and Samsung.\n“These new Lumia devices tick all the boxes in terms of specifications and features, but they are unlikely to be enough to lure customers away from the iPhone or Android-powered rivals,” he said.\nMicrosoft also introduced an upgraded Band 2 wearable device, with a curved screen, barometer and apps for messaging and fitness tracking. A Microsoft video on the Band 2 ended with a wing-suited BASE jumper.\nBlaber called the Band 2 a “dramatic improvement” over the original’s “unattractive and uncomfortable design.”\nStill, he said, “at $249, Microsoft is hoping to address the space between low-cost fitness bands and smartwatches, but it’s a segment that is yet to establish itself. And it’s a hefty price tag.”\nMicrosoft also touted an upcoming Windows 10 update to its Xbox One game console, and said a $3,000 development edition of its experimental HoloLens “mixed reality” headsets will start shipping in early 2016.\nAnalyst Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets said Microsoft still has to change its perception “as a ‘rounding error’ in the smartphone and tablet landscape. While the new hardware products look impressive, it all comes down to consumer adoption as Microsoft aggressively tries to change its image.”\nBenny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
