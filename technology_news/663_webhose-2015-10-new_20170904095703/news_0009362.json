And it also gives them reason to theorize that life itself is more plentiful throughout the universe.\nResearchers examined grains of the mineral zircon from western Australia's Jack Hills and dated them to when Earth was barely 400 million years old. Inside one they found carbon residue that they suggest is a remnant of a colony of tiny organisms of some unknown type.\nTheir report was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:20:30.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
