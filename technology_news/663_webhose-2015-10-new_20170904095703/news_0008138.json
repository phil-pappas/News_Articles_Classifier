More Bild hits out against adblockers \nMatch’s owner, IAC , the media and entertainment conglomerate run by Barry Diller, announced plans to spin off the division in June. It plans to list up to 20 per cent of Match Group’s common stock in the offering, which is expected to complete by the end of the year, with IAC retaining the remaining stake. \nDocuments filed with regulators on Friday said Match proposed raising up to $100m, a place holder amount used to calculate fees ahead of listing. \nA portion of the funds raised will be used to repay debt to IAC and as a dividend to the parent company, Match said, with the remainder going to general corporate purposes. \nRevenue rose 11 per cent to $888.3m in 2014 and net earnings climbed 17 per cent to $148.4m. Twelve months trailing revenue through June was $1bn. \nIn the filing, Match said it generates “substantially all” of its dating revenue from 4.7m paying customers of membership sites such as Match.com. It has recently begun charging for some premium features on Tinder, a free location-based dating app, such as allowing users to reconsider a potential match they had rejected and browse profiles of users in other cities. \nThe company laid out a bullish growth vision in its filing, estimating its potential market at 511m — the population of adults in North America, western Europe and other select markets “who are not in a committed relationship and who have access to the internet”. Match said that could grow to 672m by 2019. \nAs its total user base has grown to 59m monthly active users, the company’s brands have become increasingly reliant on mobile activity. In the first half of this year, 68 per cent of new users signed up on mobile devices, up from 27 per cent in the same period in 2013. This shift has enabled us to reach groups of users which had previously proven elusive, such as the millennial audience \n- Match \n“This shift has enabled us to reach groups of users which had previously proven elusive, such as the millennial audience,” Match said. It also noted that mobile users across its brands access the products more often than those who visit the sites on desktop. \nMatch expects to boost revenues from advertising, particularly on Tinder, where the company said it is selling less than 2 per cent of available spots. \nBut it also identified significant risks to its business, including its reliance on other platforms such as Facebook and Apple and Google ’s app stores to distribute its products and register users, and the possibility that bad behaviour by users might damage its reputation. \n$100m \nDocuments filed with regulators on Friday said Match proposed raising this place holder amount used to calculate fees ahead of listing \nMatch also warned of the potential for cyber attacks on its own systems or those of its partners and vendors that could expose customers’ personal data and financial information. \nEarlier this year, the adultery website Ashley Madison suffered a catastrophic hack that exposed the identities of millions of customers, leading to lawsuits and eventually the ousting of its chief executive. \nMatch plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol MTCH. The offering is being underwritten by JPMorgan, Allen & Co and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nWhether Match can successfully win investors’ hearts — and wallets — remains to be seen. Along with Square , the payments start-up that filed for an IPO this week, the company will test a tough market for IPOs . \nDiscerning investors rattle IPO deals \nPulled deals and investors demanding better terms come as 2015 listings trade down 4% on average \nRead more \nAfter years of robust capital-raising activity, investors have become increasingly discerning about buying shares in company flotations against the backdrop of global economic uncertainty. They are demanding price concessions and some high-profile deals have been scrapped. \nNearly all of the recent IPOs have been priced below their indicated ranges including First Data, the payments processor controlled by KKR, which this week raised $2.65bn in the year’s largest IPO for the US. One deal that did price within its range, Pure Storage, the flash storage company, slumped in its debut before rebounding. \nAlbertsons, the grocer, and Digicel, the Caribbean telecoms group of Irish billionaire Denis O’Brien, postponed their IPOs. \nInvestors who have bought IPOs this year have fared worse than the broader market. On average, 2015 listings are trading down 4 per cent, according to Renaissance Capital, which specialises in IPO research and investment. More than half of this year’s deals are also trading below the issue price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:53:06.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
