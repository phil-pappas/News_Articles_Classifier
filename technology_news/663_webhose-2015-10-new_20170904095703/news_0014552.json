Through our latest update, the SD Elements platform makes it easier for payment service providers and other organizations to not only achieve compliance with the new EBA guidelines, but to also be ready for the higher standards of the upcoming PSD 2 implementation. SD Elements uses the industry’s most robust set of security requirements, so it enables all companies to achieve the highest level of information assurance within their networks and products.”\nAnnounced on December 19, 2014, the EBA’s new guidelines are the minimum security requirements that European Union payment service providers (PSP) must implement. Online fraud is a growing concern to businesses and governments around the world, but in the EU fraud has skyrocketed in recent years. According to estimates cited by the EBA, fraud on card internet payments alone caused €794 million of losses in 2012 (up by 21.2% from the previous year).\nThe Security of Internet Payments guidelines serve as a transitional regulation before Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD 2) enters into force in 2017/2018. The current guidelines establish key security requirements for all types of online payment transactions, including card payments, direct debit, internet credit transfer and electronic money transfer between e-money accounts.\nSD Elements’ new update helps PSPs meet the requirements set forth by the EBA to ensure more secure online transactions. However, the SD Elements platform goes further, by providing the industry’s most comprehensive set of software security requirements, which allows organizations to eliminate up to 97% of high-risk vulnerabilities in their software applications.\nKey highlights for SD Elements’ EBA update:\n SD Elements now covers all sections of the EBA’s Security of Internet Payments, which have ramifications on secure software development Specifically, these include sections pertaining to risk control and mitigation, traceability, enrollment for or provision of authentication tools and software, secure customer authentication and login parameters, transaction monitoring, protection of sensitive data, communication security, customer education and customer access to transaction data SD Elements now provides more than 90 links between its own secure development tasks/tests and the sections/subsections of EBA Security of Internet Payments It also provides more than 15 particular task amendments to clarify specific requirements of the EBA document\nWhat is SD Elements?\nInstead of fixing application flaws after the fact, SD Elements enables developers to create secure code from the start, and prevent vulnerabilities from ever existing – the most cost effective way of mitigating risks.
