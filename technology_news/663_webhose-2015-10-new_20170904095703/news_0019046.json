Brouchkov shrugs it off, noting that the Yakut people in the Sakha region are ostensibly exposed to the bacteria when the permafrost melts — and not only do they seem OK, but they “even seem to live longer than [people in] some other nations.” \nHe adds further research is needed to see what mechanisms keep the bacteria alive and kicking. \n(Hope he doesn’t decide to start guzzling blood anytime soon.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:19:47.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
