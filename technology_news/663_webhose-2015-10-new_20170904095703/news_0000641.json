Hurd and Krzanich also said they started another new partnership - this one to target Oracle's database and software customers to ditch their IBM computer servers and buy Oracle/Intel servers instead. \nWhat's interesting is that, like IBM, Oracle also competes with Intel. \nOracle's fastest, most expensive computer servers use Oracle's own chips, the SPARC chips technology that it gained when it bought Sun Micrososystems. \nBut the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So Intel and Oracle are getting cozier these days going after IBM. \nOracle CEO Mark Hurd says they have already convinced thousands of customers to drop IBM for Oracle when running Oracle software. That's interesting, but Oracle currently has 420,000 customers, so it sounds like a fairly low percentage so far. \nWe'll see how much harm this renewed love affair between Intel and Oracle really does to IBM. \nThe reason IBM divested its Intel computer server business is to stop focusing on computer server hardware and go after new areas instead, particularly the big data/analytics trend, and cloud computing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:46:40.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
