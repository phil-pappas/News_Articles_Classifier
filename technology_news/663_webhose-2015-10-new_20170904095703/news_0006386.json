But in recent decades scientific evidence has been building that particles can indeed become \"entangled\", so that no matter how far apart they are, they will always be connected.\nThe Delft experiment is conclusive because, for the first time, scientists have closed two potential loopholes at once.\nThe first suggests that particles could somehow synchronise behaviour ahead of time, while the second implies that testing might detect only a subset of prepared entangled pairs.\nTo prove their case, the team led by Delft professor Ronald Hanson used two diamonds containing tiny traps for electrons with a magnetic property called spin and measured all entangled pairs across 1.3 km separating two laboratories.\nThe experiment effectively closes a chapter in an 80-year scientific debate, but Hanson said it also had important implications for the future, since sophisticated cryptography is already using quantum properties to guarantee data security.\nSuch quantum encryption systems will only be 100 percent secure, however, if all loopholes are closed, as in the Delft system.\n\"Loopholes can be backdoors into systems,\" Hanson told Reuters. \"When you go loophole-free then you add an extra layer of security and you can be absolutely certain there is no way for hackers to get in.\"\n Science and Trends Albert Einstein Also Read Apple looks all set to fight bendgate with the next iPhone These guys made a guitar with old hard drives Truecaller introduces Truemessenger to help you get rid of spam messages Xiaomi to approach authorities to sort security concerns", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Albert%20Einstein_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151022/technology-science-and-trends/article/einstein-wouldnt-it-new-test-proves-universe-‘spooky’", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Albert%20Einstein_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:06:57.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
