And how that child fares, they say, affects the community as a whole.\nThe first 2000 days Coming next Thursday on cleveland.com: In early childhood, the brain develops with astounding speed, adding 700 new synapses a second at age 3. But it also is vulnerable to a host of risks.\nCleveland Connects forum: Bill Isler, CEO of The Fred Rogers Co., joins local experts for a panel discussion from 6 to 7:30 p.m. Oct. 19 on the importance of early brain development and ways, including preschool, to help it along. The forum is sponsored by PNC Bank, and admission is free. Click here for more information or to sign up for the forum at the Idea Center at Playhouse Square.\nWith that as a backdrop, Northeast Ohio Media Group, The Plain Dealer Publishing Co. and Ideastream (the public broadcasting entity that includes WVIZ/PBS Channel 25, WCPN FM/90.3 and WCLV FM/104.9) and sponsor PNC Bank, will embark on a year-long effort to spotlight childhood development, the factors that can hinder it and why it is a critical issue for Greater Cleveland.\n\"I don't think I can come up with a more important topic to explore across a year than the first 2,000 days of a child's life,\" said Chris Quinn, NEOMG vice president of content. \"This is not just about helping a kid read or be ready for school. Recent research has proven that what happens in those first five years dictates a child's long-term prospects for health, wealth, education, lasting friendships and happiness.\"\nIndeed, the World Health Organization identifies early childhood as the most important developmental phase throughout the lifespan, with lasting impacts that will affect the individual and the community.\nThat's because those first five years are the peak period for brain development. At age three the brain is adding 700 new synapses a second.\nIt is also a period when outside influences -- from health issues like stress and nutrition and exercise to outside issues like poverty and environment -- can have the greatest impact on that development.\n\"The numbers are there,\" said Kristen Baird Adams, a senior vice president and managing director at PNC, which has targeted early childhood development as its signature philanthropic effort.\n\"Sixty percent of our kids are entering kindergarten not prepared to learn. Those readiness gaps only become more profound\" as the child grows.\nChildren who lag in development are more likely to fail the third grade reading tests, more likely to not graduate from high school, more likely to have employment trouble and limited opportunities as an adult and more likely to interact with the justice system.\n\"For us, it's a table stakes economic development issue,\" Adams said.\nThe first components of the multimedia effort, a look at brain development at an early age, will appear in the next weeks on cleveland.com and in The Plain Dealer. On Oct. 19, NEOMG, The Plain Dealer Publishing Co. and Ideastream, with sponsorship from PNC, will host Cleveland Connects: The First 2000 Days -- a community forum that will include a panel of experts in child development, including Bill Isler, CEO of the Fred Rogers Co. Isler will also deliver a keynote message.\nAt that forum the community will have a chance to weigh in, too, by participating in the discussion.\n\"The whole idea is we bring someone in of national stature to give us some sense of a national overview,\" said Mark Rosenberger, Ideastream managing editor of content. \"We let them deliver a keynote and then we have a panel of local folks who sort of use that as a jumping off point.\"\nIn coming months, through stories, graphics, videos and broadcast forums, the effort will take an intense look at the issue.\nAmong the topics:\nGreater Cleveland's lead problems and its impact on brain development in small children. The importance of proper prenatal care and how it can be a key step toward healthy childhood. The factors that can affect early childhood health and how proper post-natal care and the correct environment can help prevent allergies, asthma and obesity. The best practices for a successful pre-K program and the challenges of transitioning into elementary school. The deprivations of poverty, and how more important pre-K is in urban areas than suburbia. \"By shining a bright spotlight on early childhood development, we're going to be able not only to elevate the community knowledge as to how important these first 2,000 days are, but also why it is so important for all of us and what role we can play,\" Rosenberger said. \"The whole idea is to convene a community conversation.\"\nThat discussion will also look beyond the impacts on children. It also will focus on the costs to the community.\n\"It's a pocketbook issue,\" Quinn said. \"The research is pretty clear that an investment in those five years pays big dividends for taxpayers a few years down the road when children do not have to be held back a grade in school, don't require expensive special education programs, avoid costly health issues and, as adults, stay off unemployment rolls.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.ideastream.org/programs/cleveland-connects/first-2000-days", "http://www.who.int/social_determinants/themes/earlychilddevelopment/en/"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:59:22.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
