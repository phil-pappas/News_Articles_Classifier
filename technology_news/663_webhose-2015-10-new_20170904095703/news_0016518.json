Its work will help align advanced manufacturing research with national priorities and challenges to ensure efficient use of federal and private funding for the greatest possible return on investment. \n\"Engineering and scientific advancements based on fundamental research have been the main drivers of U.S. economic growth over the past half century,\" said NSF Director France CÃ³rdova. \"Thanks to innovative technologies enabled by manufacturing research, production has grown at its fastest pace in more than a decade, creating significant economic value for the nation. To continue to reap these benefits, we must seek new research frontiers for manufacturing and pursue them for high impact U.S. manufacturing innovation and economic competitiveness.\" \n\"This consortium will provide a continuous channel to draw on the perspectives, knowledge and insights of not only industry but also academia,\" said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Willie E. May. \"Having this access to private-sector viewpoints and studies on urgent questions related to manufacturing technology R&D will help us better coordinate and prioritize research and funding.\" \nRecommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in its 2014 report, Accelerating U.S. Advanced Manufacturing, the consortium will study needs, challenges, and opportunities facing U.S. manufacturing, producing studies within an anticipated shorter-than-usual turnaround time. NSF and NIST announced a competition for the new consortium in April 2015. \nSridhar Kota, Herrick Professor of Engineering, will lead the University of Michigan's work on MForesight, which has already partnered with 30 thought leaders from industry, professional associations and academia. MForesight aspires to create an inclusive advanced manufacturing community with greater communication and collaboration across a broad spectrum of sectors. \nFederal users of the information will include NSF, NIST, other federal research and development agencies, the interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office and the Advanced Manufacturing Subcommittee of the President's National Science and Technology Council. Agencies will have the opportunity to fund studies where they have particular needs. ### \nFor further information and to learn how to participate, visit mforesight.org . \n-NSF- \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:48:26.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
