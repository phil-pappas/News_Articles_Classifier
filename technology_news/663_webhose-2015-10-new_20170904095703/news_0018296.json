But one thing you can’t deny the fact is they are always among the first few to get an update to the latest Android OS – in this case Marshmallow 6.0. But to have a flagship device that screams beauty and brawns, now that’s a bonus. It is also known as Moto X Pure Edition in the United States. - Advertisement - \nWe have heard reports that most recent release by Motorola will get the update; these include the mid-range Moto G lineup and the entry-level Moto E as well. That’s something that other manufacturers don’t seem to be able to say confidently, let alone confirming it. And that’s why people become loyal followers, it is because they are well taken care of. \nIn the case of Moto X Style, which is expected to hit the market as early as this month – it seems to have it all. A beautiful design, a beast in terms of hardware, amazing camera and most important of all; the pure Android experience. No bloatware, no unnecessary apps, games and everything else in between. \nNow in the 3 rd generation, it has been a huge learning curve and growth for the Moto X. There’s also another younger sibling called Moto X Play which we will be taking a look in the coming days. But for now let’s talk about what makes the Moto X Style great. \nFirst up is its look and feel. It comes with a body of 153.9 x 76.2 x 11.1 mm (6.06 x 3.00 x 0.44 in) and weighing in at 179 g (6.31 oz), it certainly isn’t thin, though. But with a sleek metal frame and curved back, it feels as amazing as it looks. You can customize it even further with Moto Maker. Pick a soft-grip back and metal accents in your favorite colors or dress it up even more with a premium leather or real wood back. Or personalize it even further by engraving your name on the device. Talk about personalization! \nThe Moto X Style will be sporting a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~520 ppi pixel density which really makes for only the most amazing stuff being displayed on the screen. Images and videos will look excellent on it. In terms of protection, there’s the Gorilla Glass 3 available. Need more? Now here’s something new included with the device, a water repelling nano-coating or IP52 certified. Spills, splashes or rain, will no longer ruin your day. \nAs for the performance side of things, you can be sure of getting the best out there. The Moto X Style will be equipped with a Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset paired with a Hexa-core processor comprising a Dual-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A57 & Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 418 graphics and 3GB RAM. You can expect the best out of it. The only thing that seems to be missing is the 4GB RAM that have been gaining some momentum amongst other manufacturers. But when you have a lean software, that additional 1GB RAM wouldn’t make much difference right? - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Moto X Style will be sporting an amazing 21MP-5MP setup. Capture the moment like never before with the top-rated 21 Megapixel camera. It allows you to capture clear, color-balanced photos quicker than ever. It is equipped with the industry-leading 21 MP Sony IMX230 image sensor—the latest and best complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor for mobile phones. Its single-shot Auto High Dynamic Range (HDR) feature overcomes high-contrast environments to create the best photo possible. And with an ƒ/2.0 aperture, the camera gets more light for improved low-light performance. Finally, an absorptive blue glass infrared filter eliminates flare in challenging lighting scenes like campfires and candles. \nNimble camera features help to ensure that you always get a great shot. By using hundreds of thousands of pixels, Phase Detection AutoFocus utilizes hundreds of thousands of pixels to ensure incredibly quick focus. And zero shutter lag means there’s no delay between when you touch the screen and the time that the photo is taken. The feature called Best Shot will capture multiple images before and after you touch the screen. Then it recommends the best version, helping avoid blurs, blinks, and other photo fails. And it works for selfies, too. Talking about selfies, with the front camera’s wide-angle range, you will never leave a friend cropped out of a selfie. And a front LED flash will make you look great even in low light. \nThat’s a lot of interesting features with regards to the camera. As far as storage is concerned, there are three choices available. You can go for either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB. Since the price difference isn’t that huge between each of them, it makes more sense to get the highest 64GB version, rather than getting a microSD card. Talking about that extra space, just pop in a microSD card and it supports up to a maximum of 128GB. \nIn terms of battery, the Moto X Style will have a non-removable 3000 mAh battery. There’s also the innovative TurboPower™ Charging, which gives you up to 10 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. Very cool feature I must say. \nThey say we should save the best for last, and we did. In terms of software, it will come with Android Lollipop 5.1.1, but it doesn’t just stop there. You will get to experience the pure Android experience; the way it was meant to be — without unnecessary clutter from preloaded apps or software. You’ll get the cleanest user experience along with faster device performance. \nMoto Display gives you a simple, discrete preview of notifications and updates. Just approach your phone to see what’s new, then go right to the related app to handle it —or leave it for later. Moto Assist understands whether you’re in the car, at work, or at home, and adapts in ways that help you. Like letting only priority calls through while you’re asleep. Or automatically replying to important messages when you’re in meetings. Keep your hands free by using your voice to control your phone. Do things like asking for directions, search for information, or get answers to your questions—all without ever touching your phone. \nAnd what’s even better than that? A promise to get the update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0 very soon. I believe other than the Huawei Nexus 6P and LG Nexus 5X which are Google’s direct collaboration with the manufacturers themselves, this is the next best thing. Plus, you get the benefit of an expansion slot and amazing camera among other things. - Advertisement - \nGreat metal look and feel, great specs, great camera, an expansion slot and a promise of getting the latest Android OS, makes for everything that you wish for from the Motorola Moto X Style. And best of all, you don’t have to break the bank to own one. \nThe Motorola Moto X Style is expected to be released in October 2015 with the price starting from $399.99 for the 16GB model, $449.99 for the 32GB model and $499.99 for the 64GB model.
