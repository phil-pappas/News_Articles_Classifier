Ramaiah founded ISSQUARED in 2010 with the belief that IT Services could be much more reliable for enterprise clients if they could find innovative, time-efficient vendors who could anticipate challenges in the areas of ITIL Processes, Infrastructure, Network Security, and Identity Management, before they became issues. The company was named as IS 2 to communicate how a client could –multiply– its Information Systems resources by working with ISSQUARED. \nIn 2013, Indian-born Ramaiah added Security Monitoring Services out of their Hyderabad-based office. In 2014, a U.K. office was opened to serve European clients to architect services to deploy virtual desktop infrastructure and enable enterprise mobility. \nAbout ISSQUARED \nISSQUARED (IS 2 ) is a privately held company headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, with their global service delivery center in Hyderabad, India, and European office in the U.K. It specializes in Identity and Access Management Information Systems for clients in the pharmaceutical, construction, retail, and government sectors.
