We picked him up at his place in Las Vegas. Brought him out there. Great mood. Ready to have a good time,” Hof recounted to ET. “He just wanted a little peace and quiet and get away from the pressures of his life.”\nAccording to Hof, Odom’s demeanor changed when he a call that appeared to bother him.\n“He did get a phone call on Sunday that upset him a little bit, but I don’t know what that was about,” Hof recalled. “But after that he regrouped, and he was eating good. Sleeping good and just having a good time.”\nAccording to Hof, two female employees found Odom unresponsive on Tuesday afternoon and alerted management, who called emergency services. Odom was rushed to the Desert View Hospital in Pahrump and later transported to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas.\n“We called 911, my staff did. They said ‘roll him on his left side’ and he started throwing up a lot but he was breathing. Then the ambulance and the police came and took him to the [hospital],” Hoff explained. “They said he was in bad shape and they thought he might not make it.”\nHof told ET that he doesn’t know what caused Odom to lose consciousness, but that he does not think drugs were involved.\n“The police looked through his things and they didn’t tell us they found anything,” Hof said. “The girls that were hanging out with him didn’t see any use of any illegal drugs at all.”\nHowever, Hof claims that Odom was taking herbal Viagra substitutes and allegedly in high quantities.\n“We heard, from my people, like eight or 10 pills,” Hof said, adding, “I’ve seen guys take one pill and have a real good time so it sounds like a lot to me.”\nComments", "external_links": ["http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1250536613001/?bctid=4556757289001"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:02:54.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
