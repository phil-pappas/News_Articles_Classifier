A-lign was founded by Scott Price and Gene Geiger, two former “Big 4” executives who each have over 20 years of technology and security auditing experience. In the past 6 years, the company they built has transformed into one of the nation’s preeminent successful professional services firm, striving to set the bar that others aspire to meet. This re-branding is the next evolution for a company ready to bring its image and culture into alignment with the dynamic sum of its parts.\n“I am elated to see how far A-lign has come, and to share and demonstrate the power behind our new brand,” explains A-lign Managing Partner Scott Price. “I am thankful for where we’ve been and excited how this new brand will allow A-lign and its extraordinary people to achieve our clients’ goals.”\nIn early 2015, Scott and Gene understood that their company – which had experienced an internal transformation through growth in clientele, services, and professionals – was due for a new business identity. Staffed by over 40 of the best people in the business, A-lign was expanding its already broad international footprint, but the company lacked a unifying image and culture to empower this growth.\nThe road to reinvention began with 8 hours of strategic planning focused on identifying and cultivating the pillars of A-lign’s company culture. Scott and Gene landed on a set of company values that now serve as core tenets in how A-lign does business, a legacy-defining big vision to bring purpose and direction to the team, as well as a mission – or core purpose – that can be summed up in a single word: Dedication.\nThese cultural foundations fueled the creative process that allowed Scott and Gene to discover and foster the new A-lign brand identity. An information or security audit can feel a lot like climbing a mountain – it can be difficult, stressful, and easy to lose your way. A-lign partners with clients on this mission, helping them reach this summit and navigate the next leg of their journey.\nThe mountain-climbing analogy perfectly embodies who A-lign is, what A-lign does, and what clients can expect. As Todd Skinner once said, “We cannot lower the mountain, therefore we must elevate ourselves.” A-lign elevates its clients, its people, and the very industry itself.\nA-lign has just announced the formal launch of its new brand.
