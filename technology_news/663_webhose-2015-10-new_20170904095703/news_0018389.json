US President Barack Obama on Saturday offered his \"deepest condolences\" over a suspected US airstrike on a hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz that killed 19 people, and promised a thorough probe of the incident.\n\"On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest condolences to the medical professionals and other civilians killed and injured in the tragic incident at a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz,\" he said in a statement released by the White House. \n\"The Department of Defense has launched a full investigation, and we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy,\" Obama said. \nThe attack early Saturday left the building engulfed in flames, and dozens more people seriously wounded, with photos posted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) showing their staff shocked and dazed. \nMSF said the aerial raid hit the main hospital building housing the intensive care unit and emergency rooms, while the surrounding buildings were left untouched. \n\"I have asked the Department of Defense to keep me apprised of the investigation and expect a full accounting of the facts and circumstances,\" Obama said. \n\"Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to all of the civilians affected by this incident, their families, and loved ones.\" \nHe added: \"We will continue to work closely with President (Ashraf) Ghani, the Afghan government, and our international partners to support the Afghan National Defense and Security forces as they work to secure their country.\" \n'Full investigation' into Afghan hospital bombing: Pentagon chief Washington (AFP) Oct 3, 2015 - A \"full investigation\" is under way into a deadly bombing at a hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Saturday, amid wide speculation that the incident was the result of a US air strike. \nCarter said that \"US forces in support of Afghan Security Forces were operating nearby, as were Taliban fighters.\" \nThe bombing killed 16 people, including nine staff from the Doctors Without Borders nonprofit, known by its French acronym MSF. \nDozens more were seriously wounded at the facility, a key lifeline that has been running \"beyond capacity\" during fighting that saw the Taliban seize control of the northern provincial capital for several days. \nThe Pentagon gave no further details on the circumstances surrounding the bombing. \nBut according to one US official, the investigation will focus on the role played by a US AC-130 gunship, an aircraft that can target tanks and ground targets with powerful guns. \nGeneral John Campbell, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan who oversees 13,000 US and allied troops, has dispatched a \"general in Kunduz to conduct a full investigation,\" the US official told AFP. \nAccording to the official, the AC-130 aircraft opened fire to defend US special forces embedded in an advisory and training capacity with Afghan special forces in Kunduz. \n\"In the context of their mission they were coming under fire from different Taliban positions\" the official said, adding that \"the AC 130 returned fire.\" \nFor the moment, however, \"we are not sure what happened,\" the official added. \nIn his statement Saturday, Carter said that \"a full investigation into the tragic incident is under way in coordination with the Afghan government.\" \nCarter added that the United States would \"continue to work with our Afghan partners to try and end the ongoing violence in and around Kunduz.\" \nThe early Saturday strike left the building engulfed in flames, with photos posted by MSF showing its staff shocked and dazed. \nA suspected US air strike on a charity hospital in the Afghan city of Kunduz killed 19 people Saturday, a bombardment US President Barack Obama said was a \"tragic incident\" but which the UN condemned as \"inexcusable\". \nWashington has promised a \"full investigation\" into the bombing at the facility, a key lifeline that has been running beyond capacity during fighting that saw the Taliban seize control of the northern provincial capital for several days. \nThe attack early Saturday left the building engulfed in flames, and dozens more people seriously wounded, with photos posted by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) showing their staff shocked and dazed. \n\"At 2:10 am (2040 GMT) local time... the MSF trauma centre in Kunduz was hit several times during sustained bombing and was very badly damaged,\" the organisation, known by its French initials, said. \n\"Twelve staff members and at least seven patients, including three children, were killed; 37 people were injured. This attack constitutes a grave violation of international humanitarian law.\" \nThe charity said the bombing continued for more than 30 minutes after American and Afghan military officials were first alerted they were being hit. \n\"All parties to the conflict, including in Kabul and Washington, were clearly informed of the precise location (GPS coordinates) of the MSF facilities,\" the statement added. \nMSF said the aerial raid hit the main hospital building housing the intensive care unit and emergency rooms, while the surrounding buildings were left untouched. \n- 'Collateral damage' - \nNATO conceded US forces may have been behind the strike on MSF, which has long treated the war-wounded from all sides of the conflict. \n\"The strike may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility. This incident is under investigation,\" a NATO statement said. \nThe incident has renewed concerns about the use of US air strikes in Afghanistan, a deeply contentious issue in the 14-year campaign against Taliban insurgents. \nUN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called for a full and transparent probe, noting that, \"an air strike on a hospital may amount to a war crime\". \n\"This event is utterly tragic, inexcusable and possibly even criminal,\" he said. \nObama offered his \"deepest condolences\" for the \"tragic incident\" and said the Pentagon would carry out a full investigation. \nUS Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said that \"US forces in support of Afghan Security Forces were operating nearby, as were Taliban fighters\". \nThe Pentagon gave no further details, but one US official said the investigation will focus on the role played by a US AC-130 gunship. \nThe bombing came after Taliban insurgents overran the northern Afghan city on Monday. It was the first major city to be captured by militants since 2001. \nThe Afghan defence ministry expressed sadness but in a statement said \"a group of armed terrorists... were using the hospital building as a position to target Afghan forces and civilians\". \n- 'Again and again' - \nMSF said some 105 patients and their caregivers, as well as more than 80 international and local MSF staff, were in the hospital, the only medical facility in the area that can deal with major injuries, at the time of the bombing. \n\"The bombs hit and then we heard the plane circle round,\" said Heman Nagarathnam, MSF's head of programmes in northern Afghanistan. \n\"There was a pause, and then more bombs hit. This happened again and again. Those people that could had moved quickly to the building's two bunkers to seek safety. But patients who were unable to escape burned to death as they lay in their beds.\" \nThe soot-blackened building was filled with the smell of burning flesh and some bodies were charred beyond recognition, said Qiamudeen, a 31-year-old shopkeeper whose neighbour was killed in the strike. \n\"I was shocked, emotional and in tears when I reached the hospital,\" Qiamudeen, who goes by one name, told AFP. \nThough the Afghan government insists the city is firmly in their control, many Kunduz residents were too afraid to leave their homes to check on wounded relatives because of sporadic firefights between troops and Taliban snipers lurking in the city. \nKunduz is facing a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire between government forces and insurgents. At least 60 people are known to have died and 400 wounded in recent fighting. \nThe Taliban's offensive in Kunduz, their biggest tactical success since 2001, marks a major blow for Afghanistan's Western-trained forces. \nUS-led NATO forces ended their combat mission in Afghanistan last December, though a 13,000-strong force remains for training and counter-terrorism operations. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:35:00.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
