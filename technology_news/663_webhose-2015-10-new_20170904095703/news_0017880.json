Five banks participated in the syndicated loan. \nThe project will be the largest-scale solar power generation project that is included in a reconstruction plan made by Soma City and uses an area affected by a tsunami in the Tohoku region of Japan. Of the total loan amount (¥15.8 billion), 77 Bank will provide the largest share (¥6.8 billion). \nThe power producer for the project is \"Renatosu Soma Solar Park LLC,\" an SPC (special purpose company) owned 40% by Kyudenko Corp, 30% by Orix Corp, 19.8% by Beltecno Energy (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo), 10% by Kyuden Mirai Energy Co Inc (Fukuoka City) and 0.2% by Hokuto Denki Setsubi Kouji (Minamisoma City, Fukushima Prefecture). \nThe construction of the plant started in July 2015, and the plant is scheduled to start power generation in June 2017. The plant is expected to generate about 60,000,000kWh of electricity, which is equivalent to the amount consumed by 16,660 households, per year. All of the electricity generated will be sold to Tohoku-Electric Power Co Inc. \nKyudenko Hokuto Denki Specific Construction Joint Venture and Kyudenko provide EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) and O&M (operation and maintenance) services, respectively, for the plant. Marubeni Corp will deliver about 198,000 solar panels manufactured by Hanwha Q Cells Co Ltd to the plant. The PV inverter employed for the plant is a product of Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corp (TMEIC). \nIsobe District, which is the construction site, was damaged by a tsunami at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake, and it became difficult to do faming there due to salt damage. As a result, the land category of the district was permitted to be changed from farmland in March 2015. Solar panels will be set up on about 700,000m 2 of land including part of Isobe Aza Seriyachi ( See related article ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:01:17.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
