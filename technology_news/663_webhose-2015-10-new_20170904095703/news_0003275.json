The light has advanced electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), which prevents interference with other onboard equipment. \nExcellent light quality from 32 white LEDs and 16 tactical mode LEDs together with the build standard of the driver board electronics provide long life and consistency in performance of the LEDs. \nThis is matched with rugged casing, which makes the Oxley DC Combi a 'fit and forget' option that outperforms any other comparable product. The extended working life, typically 50,000 hours, dramatically reduces replacement, maintenance, disposal and labour costs compared to existing lighting technology. \nThe DC Combi Series 1 light is qualified to EMC standard DEF-STAN 59-411 Land Class A and to Input Voltage standard DEF-STAN 61-5 PART 5. \nThe rugged, lightweight and versatile DC Combi was designed specifically for use in military vehicles and is also compatible for military field shelters, temporary work spaces and naval and marine area lighting.
