The move almost instantly raised the prices consumers paid for e-books to $12.99, $14.99 or higher, according to the U.S. complaint.\nApple argued unsuccessfully that it brought fresh competition to an e-book market dominated by online giant Amazon and did not conspire to fix e-book pricing.\n\"Due to the injunction and monitorship, Apple has entirely revamped its antitrust compliance program,\" Cote said in her ruling.\n\"It is to be hoped that this program will benefit not only the American public, but Apple as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:26:22.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
