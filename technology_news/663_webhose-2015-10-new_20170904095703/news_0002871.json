Now the English company has released a teaser video that officially confirms the new model family will be unveiled on October 28. \nThe name Bonneville has starred in Triumph’s lineup since 1959, when the first T120 model was introduced as a high performance sport bike. It resurfaced in 2000 after Triumph was resurrected by its current owner, John Bloor, and has been one of its best sellers ever since. In its current form the Bonneville family of sport classics is powered by a 900 cc air-cooled inline twin engine and hasn’t received any substantial upgrades since 2009. \nApparently time has come for a new generation to emerge, as the new Euro 4 emission standards that come into force in 2016 would probably translate to considerable detuning for the few remaining air-cooled motorcycles. \nA few days ago Triumph released a short teaser video announcing that the new Bonneville model family will be formally introduced on October 28, adding that \"something big is coming.\" In the closing frames of this footage we are left with the dark silhouettes of three different models, with the café racer taking center stage. \nSo far several Bonneville versions have been spotted while testing, featuring liquid cooling and escorted by rumors of 1,100 cc capacity. All through 2015 spy photos have hinted at a number of variants that include a classic roadster, two café racers (a lower-spec model and one with Ohlins suspensions), a scrambler and a bobber. \nThe most recent evidence came from the short film Outlaws , starring British soccer legend David Beckham and promoted by Belstaff, the iconic clothing brand that maintains a close cooperation with Triumph. In the film Beckham is riding two different Bonneville models, one of which is clearly identified as a brand new liquid-cooled café racer and the other being a visually modified version of the existing Scrambler 900. \nWatch Triumph’s teaser video below and stay tuned for the unveiling of Triumph’s highly anticipated 2016 Bonneville in a week’s time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:50:52.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
