No alternative design was proposed.\nThree men holding large flags with various Confederate emblems watched the rally from a distance across the Capitol lawn.\nCritics say the Mississippi flag is a divisive reminder of slavery and segregation and doesn't represent a state where 38% of the 2.9 million residents are black. Supporters say they see the Confederate emblem as a symbol of history and heritage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:04:55.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
