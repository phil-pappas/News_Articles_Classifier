The artists coated and dotted the canvas with paint, before using palette knives to scrape the surface. \n\"This is the first time I've painted, and to have been able to do it with Fanzhi -- I am deeply honored,\" Ma wrote in the auction catalog . \"Together, we created an earth: to protect the earth, to protect the oceans, to protect the air, to protect water.\" \nThe piece sold at Sotheby's on Sunday for about 42.2 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.4 million) -- 17 times more than estimated by the auction house. Proceeds from the sale are going to the Paradise International Foundation, a non-profit, environmental conservation group backed by Ma, Zeng and other Chinese philanthropists and entrepreneurs. \nRelated: Chinese struggle to give away their riches \nTaking cues from Western billionaires like Warren Buffett, Ma has increasingly engaged in philanthropic work. Last year, he established a multi-billion dollar trust to fund environmental, medical, education and cultural causes in China. \nIn May, Ma became chairman of the board for the Nature Conservancy's China program. Over the summer, he spent $23 million to buy a giant parcel of land in upstate New York, and has plans to turn it into a conservation area. \nZeng and Ma's painting was on the auction block as part of a larger modern and contemporary Asian art sale at Sotheby's that brought in about 596 million Hong Kong dollars ($77 million). \nAmong the 98 works sold were several pieces by Taiwanese sculptor Ju Ming, Japanese artist Kusama Yayoi's iconic optical dotted pumpkin sculpture, and a bicycle installation by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:11:47.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
