Peterson , Microsemi's chairman and CEO. \"I thank our dedicated employees for the ongoing contributions that made this recognition possible, and the OC Tech Alliance for its continuing commitment to serving the specific needs of our community's technology companies.\" Microsemi was recognized as the \"Public Outstanding Technology Company\" by OC Tech Alliance for its successful product developments, financial accountability and industry leadership.

About Microsemi's Award-winning Integrated GNSS Master Synchronization Solution In order to provide accurate timing for indoor small cells, an outdoor Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna is required, which is very expensive and requires complicated antenna installation even for a relatively few number of small cells. Microsemi's new ground-breaking indoor wall and ceiling mounted IEEE-1588 Integrated GNSS Master with integrated GNSS receiver and antenna eliminates the need for an outdoor antenna and all the related cabling. This significantly decreases the effective cost of the solution while providing all the performance requirements of a 1588 GrandMaster. The innovative design complements Microsemi leadership position as a leading source of timing and synchronization solutions.
