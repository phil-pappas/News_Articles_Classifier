(PRWEB) October 05, 2015\nEmpire Precision Plastics, a manufacturer of injection molded opaque parts and optics, will feature its molded and diamond turned polymer optical components at the 2015 Optifab conference, Oct. 12-15 in Rochester, N.Y.\n“This show is an important opportunity to highlight the growing capabilities at Empire, and in the Rochester area,” Empire CEO Neal Elli said. “We are investing heavily in expanding our technology and capabilities to meet our customers’ next-gen needs.”\nEmpire provides injection molded polymer optics , single point diamond turning, thin film coating and multi-component sub assemblies for medical, aerospace and industrial programs. The company affords customers considerable cost savings by integrally molding an optical element with other features such as frames, tabs or mounting brackets.\nAs a supply chain partner, Empire’s process is designed to scale, from prototype to volume production, assembly and inventory. Single point diamond turning, or SPDT, is useful for customers in the beginning stages of this process.\nSingle point diamond turning is ideal for rapid prototyping or small volume production of spheres, aspheres, parabolic mirrors, and other optical components. With its in-house diamond turning system, Empire can create plastic lenses without the added first step of building an expensive injection mold, saving time and development costs. In addition to prototyping, single point diamond turning is well suited for the manufacture of precision plastic optics in limited quantities.\n“Often our customers need to meet early demands on a short timeline,” Elli said. “Diamond turning saves time as they move from small-volume runs into full-scale production.”\nFor more information, stop by Optifab booth 509, or visit http://www.empireprecision.com .\nABOUT EMPIRE PRECISION PLASTICS\nEmpire Precision Plastics ( http://www.empireprecision.com ) has a 20-year legacy of partnering with customers to solve their most challenging injection molding problems.
