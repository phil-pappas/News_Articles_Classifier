An excerpt of the ominous video that has the internet stumped. Vision: stuff.co.nz\nPT1M2S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings A shaky video shot in front of a gloomy, windowed brick wall and filled with coded messages has become an object of fascination in certain corners of the internet, as Redditors and tech writers rush to try and figure out what it means - and why it even exists in the first place.\nThe video features a single figure, covered in a dark cloak and a death mask, who gestures to several different visual codes. The edits are short and jumpy, and the whole thing plays out with a grating, noisy soundtrack. It's, well, very creepy.\nInternet sleuths have found earlier versions of the video available online on YouTube and 4Chan as early as May, but they went largely ignored at the time. The mystery took off last week - just in time for Halloween - when Johny Krahbichler of Gadgetzz blogged about it after receiving a CD containing the video. \"This Creepy Puzzle Arrived In Our Mail\", the headline reads.\nAn image from the baffling video Photo: Supplied\nKrahbichler also asked Reddit for help. Someone immediately created a spectrogram of the audio, which helped to deepen the mystery even more. The frequency visualisations contained a written message, \"YOU ARE ALREADY DEAD.\"\nAdvertisement Although the clarity varies between spectrogram-generating software, one spectrogram produced by Reddit user M4nic_H3dgehog contains detailed, and very, very graphic images of what appear to be one or multiple women being tortured.\nKrahbichler doesn't remember exactly when he received the CD containing the video, he said, because he ignored it at first. \"I thought it was someone who wanted me to try out their software,\" he said.\n\"I was unsure what to think of it, but I found it very odd. I later re-examined it and started noticing the 'codes' and letters hidden all around the video. That's when I realised it's some sort of puzzle,\" he said in the email. \"I didn't really try that hard to solve it, but I had no luck either way.\"\nThere are other decoded clues, too, including the coordinates to the White House, and a message that apparently reads \"RED LIPSLIFE TENTH\". The DVD menu also produced additional clues, including an entirely different spectrogram of a skull and coded messages, including what appear to be wingdings.\nKrahbichler's post got an immense response online, he said, especially once Gizmodo picked up the story. \"Of course I have no idea what the final solution is, but safe to say I'm more intrigued than ever,\" he wrote.\nAlthough engrossing video mysteries like this one aren't quite a daily occurrence on the web, there's a thriving cottage industry of creepy content out there for anyone looking for a good scare. The popular subreddit r/NoSleep specialises in this sort of thing in the form of short stories, for instance. But this video is particularly intriguing for some.\nIt comes with the typical hallmarks of an intentionally creepy, but ultimately harmless, film: weird costumes, jump scares and an anonymous industrial location. But then, encoded in that packaging, there appear to be some genuinely disturbing images, leading some to speculate that the story behind the video will be the scariest reveal of all.\nHere are a few of the theories being floated:\nIT'S CREEPYPASTA, OR IT'S A JOKE\nThe idea of a coded video containing a bountiful salad full of disturbing images and ideas has some assuming that the whole thing was created as a joke. Or at least as an attempt to make creepypasta - the fictional images and stories that circle the web because of their intriguing ability to horrify.\n\"My first response, after I realised it was a puzzle, was that it's probably some sort of joke,\" Krahbichler told us.\" He \"got a bit scared\" after some of the more disturbing parts of the video were decoded, he said, but now, \"I'm starting to think again it's just an elaborate joke.\"\nIT'S A SCARY/DUMB PRANK ON KRACHBICHLER\nOthers have suggested that someone is playing a trick on Krachbichler personally, perhaps one of his friends. But Krahbichler doubts it. Plus, although it appears he was the first news outlet to receive a copy of the video, there are two other YouTubers who uploaded copies earlier this year.\nThe earliest comes from YouTuber aetbx - this is the only video on his account, and it was uploaded in May. Barely anyone watched it until this weekend.\nOn Gadgetzz, Krahbichler notes that the same video was posted to a paranormal 4chan forum in May, where the original poster also claimed he or she found the video on a park bench.\nIT'S A SERIAL KILLER\nBased on the disturbing images contained in the spectrogram, it is easy to see why some might come to this conclusion.\n\"I was pretty scared when people started to suggest it's a serial killer,\" Krahbichler said. \"Although it seems someone had found one of the 'gruesome' images on Google, making that seem doubtful.\"\nHe remains cautiously sceptical that the video might pose a danger to him or to others, especially since the whole thing feels more like how a filmmaker might depict the mind of a killer than anything based in real life. There are other questions nagging at him, too, like why would a real serial killer send the video to him, and not to a bigger news outlet, or directly to the police?\nIT'S A MARKETING STUNT\nIt hasn't escaped the minds of some that the whole thing could be a marketing scheme. Draw in the collective attention of Reddit's best sleuths - and with them, the media - and then reveal that the video's true meaning is that we should all go buy some sort of commodity or other.\nIf the video is a marketing scheme, then whoever is behind it will probably have to explain why it incorporates several disturbing images of what appear to be the brutal torture and deaths of multiple women.\nBut it's still a possibility.\nAdditionally, a Redditor from Poland (the country from where the video was mailed) said that it resembled a lot of amateur YouTube productions from there. \"Our bets are that this is a indie videogame promotional, since our fledgling studios don't have large budgets for \"standard\" advertisement,\" 9u4d wrote.\nWhatever it is, Krahbichler is just happy he could give the curious something to talk about. \"What's so amazing is the engagement, people are reposting it everywhere and there are so many comments around the web,\" he said.\nThe Washington Post", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDSfMmwNU2w"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:08:06.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
