It can be used for testing high-voltage batteries as well as simulating high-voltage batteries while testing hybrid and electric vehicle drive lines and inverter systems. It is fully line regenerative, resulting in a very power efficient unit, minimizing electricity usage, lowering operating costs, and providing an extremely environmentally friendly ‘green’ profile.\nThe new small engine AC motoring dynamometer is said to be the smallest available on the market today. It is further differentiated by its ultra-low inertia properties, and ability to convert easily between horizontal and vertical orientations, accommodating either shaft orientation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:14:38.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
