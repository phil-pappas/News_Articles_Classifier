(Photo: Paul Sakuma, AP)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The tech earnings rush continues Wednesday, as streaming media giant Netflix reports third quarter earnings after the markets close.\nLet's look at tech stocks to watch:\nNetflix . In a third-quarter forecast released in July, Netflix projected it will add 1.15 million U.S. streaming customers and 2.4 million international customers. Meanwhile, analysts predict Netflix will report earnings of 8 cents a share off revenue of $1.75 billion. Last week, Netflix raised the price of its Standard subscription plan to $9.99 a month. Shares are up 0.4% in pre-market trading.\nIntel . Flat revenue and a dip in earnings during the third quarter sent shares of the chip maker down 2%. The company easily beat earnings estimates, reporting 64 cents a share, but profit slipped 6% year-over-year.\nSAP . The company unveiled its Cloud for Analytics software service, which will allow businesses to add analytics to existing SAP software. SAP says it is collaborating with several partners including Google and the National Football League.\nFacebook . The social network is testing a hub for video , which could serve as direct competition to Google and its video platform YouTube. Users watch 4 billion videos on Facebook each day.\nZendesk . The customer service software company acquired French firm We Are Cloud SAS, which makes the software BIME Analytics. Zendesk says the deal will allow it to integrate more data analytics capabilities across its products.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1LtHU1S TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd8c91de23ae4900e54857b4a3b964b28aa90ba7/c=277-0-4618-3264&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768033376498595-AP-NETFLIX-BABY-BENEFIT-74945625.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LtHU1S&mini=true", "http://twitter.com/brettmolina23", "http://usat.ly/1LtHU1S", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768033376498595-AP-NETFLIX-BABY-BENEFIT-74945625.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768033376498595-AP-NETFLIX-BABY-BENEFIT-74945625.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LtHU1S&text=Tech%20Five%3A%20Netflix%20to%20report%20quarterly%20earnings&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:22:42.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
