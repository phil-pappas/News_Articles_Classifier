Picture: Joel Ryan/Invision/AP \nJanet Jackson tackles Instagram use on Unbreakable World Tour \nJanet Jackson has reportedly banned people from posting videos and photos of her concerts on Instagram. \nSeveral fans have received emails with a message saying “a third party reported that the content violates their copyright” and other social media users have had their accounts suspended, according to The Guardian newspaper. \nAnd one fan told the New York Post newspaper: “Five emails from Instagram about the five videos I had posted. It seems like Miss Jackson's [legal] team is on fire. What a shame they don't understand the times we live in.” \nHowever, the publication reported that the photo sharing app claimed people's accounts were being deactivated due to a “bug” and was not done on purpose or for legal reasons. \nA spokesperson for the company said: “We have identified a bug that resulted in the removal of accounts that shouldn't have been removed. \n“We have fixed the bug and are in the process of restoring the impacted accounts.” \nThe singer - who is currently on her 'Unbreakable World Tour' - will bring her live show to the UK in March 2016. \nA representative for the singer is yet to respond to the claims. \nUPDATE \nJanet Jackson has reached out to her fans and released a statement apologising after some Instagram users had their accounts shut down for posting photos and recordings from her 'Unbreakable World Tou \nJanet Jackson has apologised to fans who had their Instagram accounts shut down after posting footage from her 'Unbreakable World Tour'. The pop superstar reached out after it was reported on 21 OCtober that some users of the photo sharing app had their accounts deactivated for uploading videos and images of Janet performing at her concerts. Janet has now released a statement on Twitter where she explained that posting long video clips of her concerts causes a \"contractual problem\" but that it was never her \"intention\" for the accounts to be closed. The 'Scream' singer also encouraged her fans to keep uploading short videos and photos from her shows. She wrote: \"Hey you guys, I have been listening ... I love and appreciate my fans. I want you to know that I enjoy watching the short video clips of how you are 'Burning It Up' at the 'Unbreakable' shows. Please keep posting them. My team is passionate about protecting the intellectual property we are creating for the tour and possible future projects. It was never their intention, acting on my behalf, to have social media accounts removed. Permitting the use of long clips does present a contractual problem for these projects.\" Janet, 49, added that she loves her fans and wouldn't be where she is today without them and assured them they could still share content from the tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:24:57.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
