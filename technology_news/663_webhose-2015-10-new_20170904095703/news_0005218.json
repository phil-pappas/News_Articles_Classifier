(NASDAQ: FNJN), a cybersecurity company, and its subsidiary Finjan, Inc. are providing updates in two patent litigations matters currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \nIn our litigation, Finjan, Inc. v. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (3:14-cv-04908-EMC, Docket: 56), the matter has been reassigned from Honorable Judge Edward Chen in the San Francisco division to the Honorable Judge Phyllis Hamilton, the Chief Judge in the Oakland division (4:14-cv-04908-PJH, Docket: 57). Although a trial date had not yet been set by Judge Chen, all pending dates set by Judge Chen will be reset by Judge Hamilton in accordance with her calendar. \nIn our litigation, Finjan, Inc. v. Symantec Corp. (3:14-cv-02998, Docket: 108), the Honorable Judge Haywood S. Gilliam, Jr. presiding in the San Francisco division has stayed the case pending a decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on whether to institute Inter Partes Review (IPR) of Finjan's patent claims in five of eight patents asserted against Symantec. An IPR is a trial proceeding conducted at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the USPTO to review the patentability of claims in a patent. Depending on the PTAB's decision on whether or not to institute those IPRs, Judge Gilliam will determine whether to extend the stay. \n\"We expect to see modifications like this in individual case schedules, this is all par for the course when dealing with unlicensed parties who routinely use delay tactics instead of engaging in constructive licensing negotiations,\" stated Phil Hartstein, Finjan's President & CEO. \"Finjan will diligently continue its enforcement activities to protect its valuable patent portfolio.\" \nFinjan has other filed patent infringement lawsuits against Blue Coat, FireEye, Proofpoint and Sophos. The court dockets for the foregoing cases are publicly available on the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) website, www.pacer.gov , which is operated by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. \nABOUT FINJAN Established nearly 20 years ago, Finjan is a globally recognized leader in cybersecurity.
