Neuralstem, Inc. (Nasdaq: CUR), a biopharmaceutical company using neural stem cell technology to develop small molecule and cell therapy treatments for central nervous system diseases, announced that principal investigator, Eva Feldman , MD, PhD, will give an update on NSI-566 Phase I and Phase II trial data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the American Neurological Association Annual Meeting in Chicago, Il on Monday, September 28, 2015 .\nDr. Feldman will review the current state of cell-based therapies being studied for the treatment of neurological disorders, including Neuralstem's NSI-566, an investigational spinal cord-derived stem cell therapy in development for ALS, in \"The Current State of Stem Cell Therapies\" session. The Phase I and II trials are the first in the world to use intraspinal stem cell transplantation. She will also discuss NSI-532.IGF, Neuralstem's next-generation cell therapy for Alzheimer's disease, at the meeting as part of the \"Dementia and Aging\" special interest group symposium. Dr. Feldman is Director of the A. Alfred Taubman Medical Research Institute and Director of Research of the ALS Clinic at the University of Michigan Health System, and an unpaid consultant to Neuralstem.\nDr. Feldman will appear within the following ANA sessions:\nInteractive Lunch Workshop: Current State of Stem Cell Therapies\nMonday, September 28, 2015 - 11:45am to 1:00pm\nSpecial Interest Group Symposia 3: Dementia and Aging\nMonday, September 28, 2015 - 3:30pm to 5:30pm\nData Blitz Presentation featuring Dr. Feldman (5:20 â€“ 5:30 pm ): Human Neural Stem Cells Expressing IGF-1: A Novel Cellular Therapy for Alzheimer's Disease About Neuralstem\nNeuralstem's patented technology enables the commercial-scale production of multiple types of central nervous system stem cells, which are under development for the potential treatment of central nervous system diseases and conditions.\nNeuralstem's ability to generate human neural stem cell lines for chemical screening has led to the discovery and patenting of compounds that Neuralstem believes may stimulate the brain's capacity to generate neurons, potentially reversing pathologies associated with certain central nervous system (CNS) conditions. The company has completed Phase Ia and Ib trials evaluating NSI-189, its first neurogenic small molecule product candidate, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), and is expecting to initiate a Phase II study for MDD and a Phase Ib study for cognitive deficit in schizophrenia in 2015.\nNeuralstem's first stem cell product candidate, NSI-566, a spinal cord-derived neural stem cell line, is under development for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neuralstem has completed two clinical studies, in a total of thirty patients, which met primary safety endpoints. In addition to ALS, NSI-566 is also in a Phase I trial in chronic spinal cord injury at UC San Diego School of Medicine, as well as in clinical development to treat ischemic stroke.\nNeuralstem's next generation stem cell product, NSI-532.IGF, consists of human cortex-derived neural stem cells that have been engineered to secrete human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). In animal data presented at the Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2014 Annual Meeting, the cells rescued spatial learning and memory deficits in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.\nFor more information, please visit www.neuralstem.com or connect with us on Twitter , Facebook and LinkedIn .\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information:\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
