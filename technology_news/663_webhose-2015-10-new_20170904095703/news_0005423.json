Available now to customers, this seamless data transfer between systems facilitates coordination of care between inpatient and ambulatory settings to enable complete, accurate and relevant information at the time of care. \nWith the rapid rise of EHR adoption, the industry focus has shifted to interoperability between systems. eClinicalWorks customers can easily view hospital data that includes discharge summaries, CCDAs and additional codified information that is discretely importable into the EHR. Using this integration, data flows into the eClinicalWorks EHR without any manual intervention by the ambulatory provider. Hospital and emergency room admissions, discharge notification alerts and discharge summaries can be sent from the hospitals directly into the eClinicalWorks EHR to make inpatient-outpatient interoperability more seamless. \n“Children’s National Health System is invested in integrating the essential health information of children throughout the region,” said Dr. Brian Jacobs, Vice President, Chief Medical Information Officer and Chief Information Officer at Children’s National Medical Center, which has eClinicalWorks integrated with Cerner. “Ensuring the best health and healthcare for children requires sharing important health data with providers, patients and families with a need to know. This is critical to ensuring the most informed diagnostic and treatment decisions and high quality health and healthcare for the children and families who entrust their wellbeing to us.” \n“To deliver our patients with the best care possible, we require information from wherever they are seen,” said Carl Cameron, COO/CIO of Holyoke Medical Center. “Integrating eClinicalWorks with Meditech gives us a seamless view into our patients’ care, regardless of where it occurred. Knowing that eClinicalWorks has made interoperability a priority is one of the reasons we selected the company.” \n“By having our eClinicalWorks system integrated with Epic, we are able to provide our clients a way to securely access patient health record information from the patient’s primary care provider (PCP) and include it in their care record, when necessary for treatment purposes under HIPAA. The Little Clinic records are also securely available to the PCP for continuity of care for treatment purposes under HIPAA,” said Eileen Myers, MPH, RDN, Vice President of Affiliations and Patient Centered Strategies for The Little Clinic. “eClinicalWorks has simplified the sharing of care information.” \neClinicalWorks is now offering free interoperability of CDA data using a query-based exchange with Cerner, Epic, McKesson, Meditech and Siemens, and is extending this integration to all hospital systems in the industry. Practices will also get hospital alerts and discharge summaries from the hospital systems as notifications to enable the successful transition of care for patients between inpatient and outpatient settings. \n“eClinicalWorks has developed strong partnerships and continued collaborations with its customers and industry vendors with the main goal of making it easier for providers to share data across systems,” said Girish Navani, CEO and co-founder of eClinicalWorks. “Interoperability is important for ambulatory care. We have shown great success in integrating our ambulatory clients with hospital systems and we intend to continue this momentum forward.” \nAbout eClinicalWorks eClinicalWorks® is a privately-held leader in ambulatory healthcare IT solutions.
