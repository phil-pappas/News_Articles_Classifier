They'll be part of an international network of seven institutes focused on neuroscience and a wider network of 20 focused on astrophysics, nanoscience, neuroscience and theoretical physics. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that seven universities are contributing to the research, not three. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
