The MakerArm aims to be an end-to-end solution for prototyping hardware, doing everything from sketching to printing to cutting, etching, gluing and attaching — it'll even ice a cake.\nRelated: New, Improved 3-D Printer Makes Objects at a Faster CLIP\nIt does this all by having an all-purpose, high-precision robotic arm with swappable heads. Pop on the 3-D printer head and make a rough version of your device. Swap on the grabber and the arm will place and screw in the circuit board — then customize it with the soldering head. Have it plot diagrams with a pen, or etch designs on anything its laser will pierce.\nMakerArm advertisement MakerArm is, of course, a tool for professionals — you can't just tell it to make a phone or toy and let it do its thing. But people who know what they're doing will surely appreciate its versatility — the device can replace several bulky alternatives like milling machines and laser cutters, as long as nothing heavy-duty is required.\nThe creators of the MakerArm are looking for funding on Kickstarter , with around $85,000 of the target $350,000 raised so far. The early bird specials are gone, but you can pre-order a device for around $1,400 — well below the $2,200 it's expected to retail for later.", "external_links": ["http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253051/makerarm2_1c729a73c3896339f6741e43405a2199.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253051/makerarm2_1c729a73c3896339f6741e43405a2199.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253046/makerarm_57e15ea83bb855dce9a81154c79127f5.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253046/makerarm_57e15ea83bb855dce9a81154c79127f5.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253051/makerarm2_1c729a73c3896339f6741e43405a2199.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1849283018/makerarm-the-first-robotic-arm-that-makes-anything", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/1253046/makerarm_57e15ea83bb855dce9a81154c79127f5.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:20:57.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
