With this additional capital and support, we can expand the products and services we offer to the growing ranks of the Aspiration community.\"\nJoseph Chen , Chairman and CEO of Renren, commented, \"Renren is committed to investing in the most important and fastest-growing fintech platforms, so we could not be more thrilled about the opportunity to invest in Aspiration. The financial industry is ripe for transformation and, with its 'do well and do good' approach, we believe Aspiration is poised to be one of the defining new financial brands for 21 st century consumers – first in the United States and then around the world.\"\nAspiration creates and curates financial products and brings them directly to the customer at Aspiration.com, thereby disintermediating traditional advisors and middle-men. Aspiration's mutual funds have a $500 minimum investment. It recently unveiled a high-yield, FDIC-insured checking account: The Aspiration Summit Account offers up to 100 times the interest rates provided on checking accounts at the big banks, no minimum balance requirement or monthly service fees, and free access to every ATM in the world.\nAspiration's unmatched pro-investor approach trusts its customers to pay only what they think the company deserves, even if that means zero. Aspiration brings a unique charitable aspect to financial services by donating 10% of its revenue to charities providing microloans and mentoring for low-income Americans to start businesses – and helping its customers give to the causes of their choice as well.\nLaunched in November 2014 , Aspiration has become one of the fastest growing online financial firms in America – eclipsing the growth rates of the so-called \"robo-advisors\":\nOver the past six months, Aspiration has been doubling its number of accounts an average of every six weeks. 60% of Aspiration's customers have not previously owned another retail investment product. Aspiration customers are in all 50 states and U.S. Armed Forces serving overseas, with over 70% outside of New York and California . While most Aspiration customers are Millennials, they range in age from 18 to 88. Over 90% of the investors in the Aspiration Flagship Fund choose to pay Aspiration even though they are not obligated to – a testament to the honorable nature of most Americans and the value Aspiration customers see in its products. \"Wall Street works great for a fortunate few, but most Americans have been left out of the possibility of wealth-creation because they haven't had a financial firm they felt they could trust or one laser-focused on their specific needs and goals,\" said Joseph N. Sanberg , co-founder and chair of Aspiration's Board of Advisors. \"With its unique model, groundbreaking technology and customer-friendly education approach, Aspiration is successfully opening the doors of investing to the middle class.\"\nAbout Aspiration\nOne of the fastest growing online investment platforms, Aspiration offers everyone the type of investment strategies that were once limited to only the wealthiest Americans.
