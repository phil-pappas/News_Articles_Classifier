LOUIS, Oct. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Wing速 , a pocket-sized sensor and powerful app that measures lung function with medical-grade accuracy, will launch an Indiegogo campaign to raise $50,000 on October 20. In the United States, approximately 30 million people suffer from asthma. Asthma is the number one cause of ER visits, hospitalizations and missed days of school in children even though nearly all asthma attacks and resulting hospitalizations, ER visits and even deaths due to asthma are preventable. Wing is a device that can help bridge this gap. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276007 \nBy plugging the simple, smartphone-powered sensor into the headphone jack of your smartphone and launching the Wing app, a user can easily measure their lung function by blowing into the sensor. Wing provides more than just a number with instant, accurate results easily explained according to a \"stoplight\" zone system. This green/yellow/red zone system gives a clear description of how a user's lungs are doing so that they can detect declines in lung function early and take the right action at the right time to help prevent asthma attacks. \n\"The more you use Wing, the smarter and more personalized Wing becomes to help you stay one step ahead of your asthma,\" Co-founder Abby Cohen said. \"Wing not only helps you better understand and proactively manage your asthma on a day-to-day basis, but also allows you to work with your doctor to determine how to avoid things that trigger your asthma and find a treatment plan that keeps you breathing your best.\" \nEveryone's asthma is unique--each person's lungs are affected by different things in ways that are specific to them. The Wing app automatically stores and tracks lung function measurements over time and also allows users to track the two things that affect their lungs: medications and triggers (e.g. weather, pollen, exercise, etc.). Users can visualize these factors with their lung function, share a report of their data with their doctor and see asthma control improve over time. \nBesides helping those with asthma, people with other respiratory conditions, such as COPD or cystic fibrosis, can also benefit from using Wing. Anyone who is interested in better understanding their lungs, including quantified selfers, athletes or even wind musicians, can also use WIng to measure and track their lungs. \nWing is currently compatible with iOS 8 and later, with an Android app in development. Sparo Labs has submitted a 510(k) FDA application for Wing and is currently pending FDA clearance. \nIndiegogo backers will be able to contribute $99 (33% off retail price) to Wing's Indiegogo campaign, starting on October 20, to accelerate development and manufacturing of Wing. In return, contributors will be the first to get Wing once it is cleared by FDA.
