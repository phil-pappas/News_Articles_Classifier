Mysterious South Australia geoglyph wiped off map Liz Burke news.com.au What happened to the Marree Man? Mysterious South Australia geoglyph wiped off map Liz Burke news.com.au The Marree Man can barely be seen any more. \nIT’S as enthralling as any ancient legend, but the mystery of South Australia’s Marree Man is far more modern and in danger of being far shorter lived than folk figures before it. \nFrom the red dirt ground, it’s a series of dug out lines wider than city roads apparently carved with some serious excavation equipment. \nThe lines and swirls look to be the product of an impressive operation, but its not until you get up in the air that spectators can really marvel at the mythical giant man.

Picture: AP Photo/Peruvian Air Force 1 of n \nFrom the air, those lines made with a plough or ripper form the figure of Marree Man. The 4km tall carving, 28km in total length, clearly makes up the shape of an indigenous man, most likely a hunter armed with a throwing stick. \nAt least that was the case in 1998 when a tourism operator was reportedly the first to catch a glimpse of the enormous artwork. Since then, natural forces have caused the once 35cm deep carved outline to erode and the figure to fade. \nThough locals have been campaigning for the Marree Man to be preserved, these days he’s just about gone with only a few barely distinguishable features remaining.
