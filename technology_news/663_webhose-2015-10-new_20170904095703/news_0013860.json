Verity, designed by Austin-based Hart InterCivic, will replace the tribe's former election service. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151020/278606 \nHart's solid reputation and track record for reliability and customer service made Verity an obvious choice. \n\"Hart is no stranger to the people of Oklahoma and the Osage Nation,\" said Phillip Braithwaite, President and CEO of Hart InterCivic. \"We created a rock-solid, custom solution for the state of Oklahoma that is used in every local, state and federal election from border to border.\" \nVoters in the Osage Nation participate in elections for Principal Chief, Assistant Principal Chief, Congress, elections for the retention of Judges of the Osage Judiciary, and other elections required by the Constitution and by law. \nVerity benefits coming to the Osage Nation include: -- Accessibility for all voters. The Verity Touch Writer ballot marking device allows voters with disabilities to vote privately and independently, using non-segregated ballots that are identical to the paper ballots other voters use. -- Easy transport and storage. Verity's components are compact. Not only does the briefcase design save warehouse space, the system is easy to transport and set up for voting. -- Affordable and adaptable. Over the lifetime of the voting equipment, Verity's unique, adaptable architecture can efficiently respond to changes in ballot formatting rules, reporting needs or other election management tasks. -- Ballots on demand. Ballots can be printed as needed, reducing waste.
