TSMC supplies the key computing brains in electronics devices known as processors. TSMC's weak performance contrasts with 33% year-over-year profit growth in the second quarter and 65% growth in the first quarter.\nThe decline in quarterly profit is a reversal from its record-high earnings last year when TSMC began shipping the processors used in Apple Inc.'s smartphones and tablets.\nThe performance of TSMC, which controls more than 60% of the world's contract manufacturing market for non-memory chips, is widely seen as a barometer of global technology demand. But the dominant player has been facing rising competition from South Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics Co. and U.S.-based Globalfoundries Inc. in the market for non-memory chips.\nFor the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, TSMC predicted revenue of 201 billion to 204 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$6.2 billion-US$6.3 billion), which would be 8.3%-9.7% lower than NT$222.52 billion a year earlier. The tepid outlook came after its third-quarter net profit fell to NT$75.33 billion (US$2.33 billion) from NT$76.33 billion a year earlier, partly due to a loss of NT$2.8 billion from shutting down its unprofitable solar business.\nRevenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 1.7% to NT$212.51 billion from NT$209.05 billion, while its gross profit margin fell to 48.2% from 50.5%.\nThe chip manufacturer also reduced its capital spending budget for this year to US$8 billion from the US$10.5 billion to US$11.0 billion it guided in April.\nWrite to Lorraine Luk at lorraine.luk@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 05:38 ET (09:38 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:54:23.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
