(AP) - A federal jury has found Apple Inc. infringed on a technology patent held by the foundation that protects the University of Wisconsin's intellectual property.\nThe U.S. District Court jury in Madison on Tuesday rejected claims from the technology giant that the patent was invalid and that no infringement took place.\nThe Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation sued Apple in February 2014 claiming it used the foundation's patented technology in its latest processors, which power iPhone and iPad devices.\nThe technology dates back to 1998 when the work of four UW researchers was patented. The foundation sued Intel Corp. over the same patent in 2008 and settled for an undisclosed amount.\nThe jury will decide what monetary damages the foundation is to receive.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:18:24.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
