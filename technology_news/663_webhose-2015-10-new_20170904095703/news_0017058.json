Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been criticized for her use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. In December 2013, IG Steve Linick issued a \"management alert\" warning top State Department officials that their repeated failure to correct cybersecurity holes was putting the department's data at risk. Clinton approved significant increases in the State Department' information technology budgets while she was secretary, but senior State Department officials say she did not spend much time on the department's cyber vulnerabilities. Under Clinton and Kerry, the State Department's networks were a ripe target for foreign intelligence services, current and former government officials say, echoing the situation at OPM, which last year saw sensitive personnel data on 21 million people stolen by hackers linked to China. State Department officials responsible for cybersecurity acknowledged that the department had gotten behind in its compliance with standards in the Federal Information Security Management Act, known as FISMA, which requires, for example, that agency systems be certified as secure. »", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsserve.net/ONPglobe256.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:22:41.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
