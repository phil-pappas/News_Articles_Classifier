This ruling affirms the prior finding by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that all patent claims asserted against Silicon Labs’ silicon TV tuner products are either invalid or not infringed. \nThe investigation was initiated in February 2014 based on a complaint filed by Cresta Technology (Cresta) alleging that Silicon Labs and several of its customers infringed three patents related to TV tuners. Cresta subsequently withdrew one of the patents. After a full hearing and review, the ITC found that there was no violation committed by Silicon Labs or its customers and that all patent claims asserted by Cresta were either invalid, not infringed or both. In addition, the ITC found that Cresta failed to satisfy the ITC’s domestic industry requirement for each patent, resulting in a separate and independent basis for the finding of no violation. \n“We are pleased that the ITC agreed with Silicon Labs and its customers that Cresta’s claims were without merit,” said James Stansberry, senior vice president of Silicon Labs’ IoT Products. “This finding is good news for our customers and for the consumer broadcast industry. Silicon Labs vigorously defends itself against all unjustified allegations of infringement.” \nSilicon Labs \nSilicon Labs (NASDAQ:SLAB) is a leading provider of silicon, software and system solutions for the Internet of Things, Internet infrastructure, industrial automation, consumer and automotive markets.
