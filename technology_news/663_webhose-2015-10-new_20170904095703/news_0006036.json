The format hit by the biggest decline in trust in the UK was editorial content (down 8% points to 54%) followed by emails that consumers sign up for (down 7% to 56%) and newspaper and radio ads (both down 6%). \nPersonal recommendation, trusted to some degree by 81% of UK respondents, was the most trusted form of advertising or communication, with the credibility gap widening between it and other formats. It now stands alone as the only format trusted by more than 60% of UK respondents – an accolade shared by some five formats just two years ago. Consumer opinions online' (58%) is now the second most trusted format (up from fourth two years ago) and is followed by 'emails signed up for' and TV ads (both 56%). \n\"There isn't one simple rule for maximising advertising effectiveness in a saturated market like the UK, but understanding how consumers feel about the ads they're served on various media platforms is a good starting point,\" explained Nielsen's EVP of marketing effectiveness for Europe, Terrie Brennan. \"While advertisers have started to follow consumers online, about a third of online advertising campaigns don't work - they don't generate awareness or drive any lift in purchase intent. More than ever, consumers are in control of how they consume content and interact with brands, so understanding ad resonance across screens is now the only way to successfully drive memorability and brand lift.\" \nNotably, personal recommendation was also the format most likely to lead to some form of action being taken by consumers (cited by 71% of respondents), followed by opted-in emails (62%) and TV ads (53%). \nYet striking a more optimistic note for the TV industry, Brennan stressed that even though brands have generally increased their digital ad spend as they become more comfortable with digital advertising and measurement, TV formats still deliver the highest unduplicated reach, up to 85-90%. The analyst cautioned moving from TV to an all-display digital plan as 'a bold move', advising that a mix of both offline and online channels would typically offers the best ROI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:46:57.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
