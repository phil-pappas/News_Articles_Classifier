NEC ES will collaborate with Eos to provide a complete GSS(TM) (grid storage solution), which includes DC battery systems, power conversion systems, controls hardware, the NEC ES AEROSÂ® controls software suite as well as service and maintenance packages. \nWith a strong reputation for safety, reliability and speed of installation, the GSS(TM) is one of the most widely deployed grid energy storage solutions in the world with over 120MW installed. In the largest deployed sites, exceptional commercial reliability is being achieved with availability factors of over 99%. The GSS(TM) can also be rapidly deployed and put into commercial operation within six weeks of equipment delivery on-site. \n\"Looking into the future, we acknowledge that no single energy storage technology will be able to meet the diverse needs of the grid and other stationary applications. This collaboration with Eos is part of our ongoing commitment to develop a comprehensive energy storage technology portfolio for our GSS and provide energy storage capabilities that match evolving industry needs,\" said Bud Collins, CEO of NEC ES. \nEos's Aurora DC battery system is optimized for four hours of continuous discharge and can be used for peak shaving, solar and wind energy time-shifting or transmission and distribution (T&D) grid support. \n\"With batteries currently being tested with major utility companies around the world, Eos is demonstrating the technology's viability and its ability to provide DC energy storage systems at pricing levels that increase the number of economically viable applications and opens up new markets to storage,\" said Mr. Collins. \nThe collaboration expands NEC ES energy storage technology offerings and allows the company to supply an Eos-enabled GSS, supporting reliable, secure, efficient and sustainable electricity grid infrastructure. \n\"With NEC Energy Solutions' global reach, system integration expertise and track record of reliability, Eos has established a powerful partnership to offer and support turn-key solutions for our Aurora customers worldwide,\" said Philippe Bouchard, VP of Business Development at Eos. \"At a price of $160/kWh, the Aurora DC battery system offers industry-leading cost, safety, and longevity. Our combined capabilities will create cost-effective, robust, and most importantly, bankable energy storage solutions designed to meet longer duration requirements in a safe and certified package.\" \nThe companies are able to quote turn-key systems today with multi MW-scale volume available in 2016 as Eos gears up for mass production. \nAbout NEC Energy Solutions \nNEC Energy Solutions develops and manufactures smart energy storage solutions for electric grid, backup power and lead-acid replacement applications with system integration expertise focusing on high performance, efficiency, safety and reliability.
