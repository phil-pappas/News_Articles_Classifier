MemCon is the memory industry’s premier event, showcasing the thought leaders that are driving advances in memory technology. A live webcast of MemCon’s keynotes is available here . \nRambus Speaking Engagement: \nKeynote : Blurred Lines – The Convergence of Storage and Memory Date : Tuesday, October 13, 2015 Time : 11 – 11:30 a.m. PDT Topic : The definitions and distinctions between memory and storage have been clear for some time, however, a number of factors including the virtualized overhaul of the data center, the slowing of Moore’s law, and the slowing of DRAM scaling are going to blur the lines between storage and memory. The impact will touch system and software architecture, numerous multi-billion dollar industries, and challenge some of the basic assumptions about solid state memory devices. The path to deployment of storage class memory is beginning to become evident and this talk will focus on the impact and optimization of hardware as more flexible support for converged memory and storage is developed, as well as the requirements and characteristics of a converged memory and storage interface.
