These 2D semiconductors offer superior energy efficiency and conduct electrons much faster than silicon.\nFurthermore, unlike graphene, the other highly touted 2D semiconductor, TMDCs have natural bandgaps that allow their electrical conductance to be switched “on and off,” making them more device-ready than graphene. Tungsten disulfide in a single molecular layer is widely regarded as one of the most promising TMDCs for photonic and optoelectronic applications.\nHowever, until now, coherent light emission, or lasing, considered essential for “on-chip” applications, had not been realized in this material.\n“TMDCs have shown exceptionally strong light-matter interactions that result in extraordinary excitonic properties,” Zhang says.\nThe study appears in Nature Photonics.\n 25, 2015 3:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:52:40.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
