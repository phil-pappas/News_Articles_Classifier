(pronounced: “A-team”), an innovative provider of “performance acceleration” SaaS, has launched a new product that integrates a weekly employee feedback with engagement metrics which allows organizations to track and analyze their employee engagement index over time. This is a breakthrough and innovative technology that is also an industry-first which helps solve the performance management challenges faced by growing companies.\nToday, a major disruption is happening in employee engagement industry for the first time in many decades. One recent example is GE announcing that it is eliminating its legacy annual performance reviews for 80,000 employees and replacing them with regular employee feedback software because managing performance just once a year doesn’t work in today’s fast paced work environment. And in an HBR article titled “GE’s Real-Time Performance Development,” the author discusses how a major shift from annual performance reviews to regular employee feedback is enabled by software and technology. Bloomberg describes this as “constant-feedback workplace of the future.”\nA story about the industry shift in The Atlantic describes a major trend away from annual performance reviews and that increasingly more companies are doing regular, weekly employee feedback software. Such software which also improves communication and alignment between companies and their people.\nContributing to the nascent disruption, an article appeared about Amazon and how its workplace faced some challenges after which the tech giant announced “ Amazon wants to Know How Its Employees Feel Every Day ” to track and manage its declining employee morale and engagement issues. And a recent Forbes story announced a “new emerging market” and that employee feedback is a new “killer app” , and discusses how regularly measuring the pulse of employees via software is the more modern method of managing performance at organizations. These recent news are all contributing to the major global shift and industry disruption and Atiim aims to pioneer the way with its industry-first, integrated software as a service (SaaS) to enable global customers to manage their teams more effectively.\n“We are aiming to be the leader in performance acceleration space, which is right at the center of the major industry disruption that is beginning to happen today,” said Zorian Rotenberg, Founder and CEO of Atiim. “The ease of use, the UX, and the breadth of capabilities in Atiim are successfully filling a void for companies who need to improve employee engagement, enhance communication and alignment with employees, and ultimately, boost performance and improve their culture. Innovation is what sets Atiim apart, and we carefully listen to our customers’ feedback and deliver the technology they need to realize the full benefits of enabling their people to work more effectively and productively while reducing costs and saving time.”\nAtiim allows business executives, managers, and teams to use a two-way, closed-loop employee feedback tool which is automated every week. Individuals receive automated reminders to complete their report, and the data they enter is presented in a clear and succinct format for each manager to review and respond to.\nTeams save a lot of time because this weekly two-way feedback reduces the misalignment and the wasted effort in meetings when trying to be reactive to problems faced within every business. Atiim allows individuals to intercept problems before they blow up and snowball.\nBoth managers and their people can access current and past reports via the organized dashboard, and notifications are gathered and made available in one easy-to-access location at the top of the page.\nFor a free trial and more information about the Atiim Pulse Report, visit here .\nAbout Atiim Software\nAtiim Software develops innovative software as a service (SaaS) for performance management which includes OKR (Objectives and Key Results) goals management, two-way employee feedback and employee engagement tracking.
