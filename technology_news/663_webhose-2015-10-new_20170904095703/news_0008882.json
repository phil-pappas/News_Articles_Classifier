I think this is quite amazing,” the governor of Kanagawa prefecture, Yuji Kuroiwa, told reporters at the vehicle’s recent media launch, according to the Japan Times .\nShinjiro Koizumi – son of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi – who is a ruling party MP for Kanagawa, told reporters: “There are a lot of people who say [self-driving cars] are impossible. But I think this will happen faster than people expect.”", "external_links": ["http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/01/22/editorials/testing-elderly-drivers-for-dementia/#.VhIMfROqqko", "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/10/01/robocab-driverless-taxi-experiment-to-start-in-japan/?mod=e2tw", "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/01/business/robot-taxi-plans-fujisawa-residents-test-driverless-car-supermarket-rides/#.VhH5_ROqqko"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:59:23.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
