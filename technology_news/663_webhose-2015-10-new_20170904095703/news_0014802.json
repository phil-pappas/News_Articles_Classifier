In Australia, its customers include Telstra, Australia Post, Queensland Police and Domino’s.\nIn 2013, Pitney Bowes launched a five-year, business-wide transformation project to become a globally integrated company.\nIt was Pitney Bowes chief executive officer Marc Lautenbach, a 27-year IBM veteran, who best understood the critical success factors in implementing ERP.\n“We partnered with many technology companies as part of this, but Marc’s personal experience has really helped shape the path we chose with the project,’’ Pitney Bowes SMB Mailing Solutions executive vice-president and president Mark Shearer told The Australian.\nPitney Bowes, which has 16,000 employees, is moving from operating its businesses independently, country-by-country, to offer more consistency in business processes, product line and customer experience around the world.\nThe first stage involved stabilising and transforming the 95-year-old mailing business. The next part of the transformation was optimising “operational excellence’’ globally, which includes all new ERP systems and IT support for each business process.\n“The most challenging part of that is moving from disparate, inconsistent business processes to be totally globally consistent,’’ Mr Shearer said.\n“Everything from customer billing to how we configure a system, how we handle customer service and customer support - we are moving to consistent global proficiencies with all new IT support in every one of those processes.’’\nThe final element will be its efforts to grow revenue in the rapidly growing digital commerce and software businesses.\n“The operational excellence, this business process and IT transformation that really is at the core,’’ Mr Shearer said.\nPitney Bowes is working with numerous agency partners and a couple of tech partners including cloud platforms like IBM Blue Mix, Amazon and SAP for their transformation.\nNow two-and-a-half years into the project, Pitney Bowes will go live with its first country implementation in Canada during the fourth quarter.\n“The hard work was getting every business process globally to agree to a common way of doing business,’’ Mr Shearer said.\nPitney Bowes has learnt its own lessons from the experience so far.\n“The first is it is absolutely essential to have a shared vision across the leadership team and not only have a shared vision, but collaborate across the company literally every week to keep the project on track,’’ he said.\n“The second thing that I have learned is to really pull this off you need proven leaders that have done this before and finally you need the employees of the company to be highly-engaged and building a culture that is centred around serving our clients.’’\nPitney Bowes will be rolling the new processes and systems out over the next 12 to 18 months country-by-country starting in October.\nDuring the second half of next year, Pitney Bowes plans to implement in Australia where it has 250 staff.\n“Even though the Australian implementation is in the second half of next year, we are beginning the process of simplifying our business and moving towards more common process even before the IT systems show up,’’ Mr Shearer said.\nCustomers can look forward to being able to see all of their Pitney Bowes information online in one repository and being able to interact in a variety of ways: in person, over the phone or on the web.\n“I think our goal is to make it easier to do business with Pitney Bowes and really present our clients with much more responsive overall experience,’’ Mr Shearer said.\nPitney Bowes has invested well over $US100 million globally in the digital transformation project.\n“Operationally we have already taken out about $US125 million of annual expense from the work we have done to date and we think we are going to eliminate another $US125 million of expense by the end of 2017,’’ he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:53:36.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
