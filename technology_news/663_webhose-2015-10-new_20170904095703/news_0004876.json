It’s bad enough that Microsoft is already dealing with some hefty competition with Apple’s MacBook Air and MacBook Pro . \nThere are plenty of laptops and 2-in-1 laptops that run on the new Windows 10 operating system, but none are quite like Microsoft’s new design. The Surface Book is not only Microsoft’s first ever laptop, but is also the first ever laptop in the Surface line . \nBoth the Surface Book and Dell’s XPS 13 have similar internal parts and hardware that are pretty strong. But there’s always one that’s better than the other, so this guide will help you determine which laptop works best for you. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) \nThis guide will compare the 128 GB Touch version of the XPS 13 to the Surface Book. However, the non-touch version of the XPS 13 is much more affordable than the two touch versions and the ultimate version of the Surface Book, which is retailed at $1,699. \nThe Surface Book is not available yet, but Microsoft is already taking advance orders ahead of the notebook’s scheduled Oct. 26 launch. \nDisplay and Design \nFirst, it’s time to look at the display and design of the Surface Book and the Dell XPS 13 . The Surface Book has a resolution of 3000 x 2000 with a density of 267 pixels per inch. As for the XPS 13 Touch, it comes with an optional UltraSharp Quad HD+ with a resolution 3200 x 1800 and density of 267 pixels per inch. The XPS 13 is also more attractive than the Surface Book with its smooth curves and thin design. \nDell also boasts that the XPS 13 is the smallest and lightest laptop that you’ll ever own. It’s named after its 13-inch screen with an Infinity Edge display that shows no borders. That means the display covers the entire surface. \nThe one thing that Microsoft’s notebook has over Dell’s laptop is that it is a 2-in-one laptop/tablet. You can remove it from the keyboard to use it as a tablet. The Surface Book also has an impressive camera with a 5MP webcam and 8MP rear camera. The XPS 13 may have a high-definition chat camera, but it’s placed in the lower left corner of the front screen.

However, the XPS 13 is ahead of the notebook with its 5th Gen Intel Core i5 processor. The Surface Book will have a similar i5 Core processor from the Skylake company. But Dell promises to compete against Microsoft with its choice of Intel Core i3-6100U, Core i5-6200U, or Core i7-6500U processors. \nWhen it comes to graphics, the XPS 13 Touch’s Intel has a 5500 GPU chipset, while the Surface Book has the Intel 520 GPU. \nThe Dell also beats out the Surface Book when it comes to battery life. The company claims that it has the longest battery life of any 13-inch laptop that’s on the market. It can last up to 18 hours after a full charge. Meanwhile, the Surface Book’s has a 12-hour lifespan. \nThere’s no doubt that Microsoft’s new notebook and Dell’s new laptop are both powerful. They both have impressive specs and features, but Dell could easily beat out the Surface Book, especially since it’s being launched ahead of time. Unfortunately, there aren’t any more details about the Dell XPS 13 on the internet, not even on tech blogs or news sites. \nThe Surface Book retails from $1,499 while Dell’s XPS 13 starts at $799, which is obviously much more affordable.
