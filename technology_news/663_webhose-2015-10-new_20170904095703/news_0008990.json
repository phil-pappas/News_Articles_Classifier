On Oct. 19, 2015, Windstream announced the sale of its data center business for $575 million in cash, but did not disclose the use of proceeds. \nWindstream will sell the data center business to TierPoint, and the two companies will enter into an ongoing strategic reciprocal partnership. The transaction is expected to close in two to four months after the customary approvals are obtained. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the business generated approximately $122 million in annualized revenue and $41 million in annualized EBITDA. Capital spending associated with the data center business has not been disclosed. \nIn Fitch's view, debt reduction stemming from the sale will not lead to a positive rating action and Fitch continues to monitor the operating trends in Windstream's business. On June 30, 2015, Windstream had approximately $5.7 billion in total debt outstanding. Fitch rates Windstream with an Issuer Default Rating of 'BB' with a Stable Outlook (see the complete list of ratings at the end of this release). \nFollowing the REIT spin-off earlier in 2015, Fitch expects Windstream's 2015 total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR to approximate 5x, with the lease being in place for part of the year, and 5.4x in 2016. This adjusted leverage metric is above the median for other 'BB' companies. Offsetting factors to the higher adjusted leverage include the reduction of outstanding senior secured and unsecured debt, and the cash flow benefits arising from the reduction in interest expense and common dividends. \nRATING SENSITIVITIES \nPositive Trigger: A positive action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR, which will be used as the primary metric, is sustainable under 4.75x. Additionally, revenues and EBITDA would need to stabilize or demonstrate a return to growth on a sustained basis. \nNegative Trigger: A negative rating action could occur if total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is 5.5x or higher for a sustained period, or if competitive and business conditions were such that the company no longer makes progress toward revenue and EBITDA stability. \nFitch currently rates Windstream as follows: \nWindstream Services, LLC \n--Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BB'; \n--$1.25 billion senior secured revolving credit facility due 2015 'BBB-/RR1'; \n--$581 million senior secured credit facility, Tranche B5 due 2019 'BBB-/RR1'; and \n--Senior unsecured notes 'BB/RR4'. \nWindstream Holdings of the Midwest \n--IDR 'BB'; \n--$100 million secured notes due 2028 'BB/RR4'. \nPAETEC Holding Corp. (PAETEC) \nThe Rating Outlook is Stable. \nAdditional information is available at ' www.fitchratings.com '. \nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
