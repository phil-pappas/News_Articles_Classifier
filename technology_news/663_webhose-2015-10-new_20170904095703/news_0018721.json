The App Market Analyzer has been built from the ground up with tools that specialize in trending metric analysis, optimizing ASO (app store optimization), and performing general app keyword research. Android currently has a 52.6% market share, which leaves the question, why is there such a vacuum of analysis tools for Google Play? This is part of the frustration of being an app publisher for Android devices. “I was beyond frustrated with the current app marketing tools, especially for Google Play. Most services focus only on the iOS App Store and leave Google Play as an afterthought. I saw a void and we filled it,” said Matthew Rohr, CEO of First Century Thinking LLC. 59% of app developers will never get a return on their investment. This is in part due to misinformation and poor market research tools, especially for the Google Play market, where the majority of the app market share resides. The App Market Analyzer finally fulfills a role that’s been in desperate need of a solution for many years, and can help many app publishers to start making money on their apps. The App Market Analyzer is a powerful analysis tool that is able to look at all the available app market data and put it into an easy-to-understand format, so the developer or marketer can make better informed decisions. App Market Analyzer’s major features include: - Google Play App Market Analysis - Trending Analyzer - Powerful Tools to View Positional Trends - App Insights - Improve ASO or Monitor an App’s Market Performance - Keyword Research - Find a Keywords Supply, Demand, Competitiveness and ROI - Favorites - Save All Your Favorite Keywords & Apps - Review Comment Analysis, App $ Worth, App Keyword Ranking & More! Some of the more remarkable features that the App Market Analyzer employs is the ability to give deep inside information on apps. This includes the ability to view an estimation of how much an app is worth. There is also a tool for analyzing customer reviews and comments, which give insights into how customers view an app. This information leads to innovation, which can in turn lead to more money and a higher position in the app marketplaces. The App Market Analyzer is produced by First Century Thinking LLC, a company dedicated to producing high-caliber family-friendly software, apps and websites since 2011.
