Jennifer Davis reports.   \nChile's first electric car, called Soki, is whizzing around Santiago streets in test runs right now and is set to be widely available for purchase locally, by March 2016. The two-seater vehicle can run for up to 60 km or 37 miles and costs about $12,000 dollars. Daniel Pavez, one of the car's creators, says the idea was to combine the best parts of a traditional car with a motorcycle or bicycle to help people best navigate busy city streets. (SOUNDBITE) (Spanish) ELECTRIC CAR CREATOR, DANIEL PAVEZ, SAYING: \"I made this part from personal motivation but later it turned into a technical challenge that we tried to resolve with the inclusion or the development of a concept of transportation that tries to provide in the same product, the same sense of safety and comfort that you find in a car [traditional car] with the agility of a motorcycle and with the efficiency of a bicycle, and trying to make it very economical.\" Soki runs on a battery that can be charged in three hours. Its creators are launching an 11-city tour to show off the sleek machine.  //reut.rs/1YSn9mv", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:28:48.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
