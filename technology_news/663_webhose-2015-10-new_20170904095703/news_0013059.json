This test demonstrated many technical capabilities of the RVSS system and is a key program milestone in its deployment schedule. U.S. Border Patrol agents are currently operating the RVSS in Nogales, Ariz. , and CBP has also initiated deployments in both Naco and Douglas , Ariz. \n\"The Remote Video Surveillance System is a critical element of our overall plan to secure the border, increase our mission effectiveness and protect our agents,\" said Mark Borkowski , assistant commissioner and chief acquisition executive of CBP's Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition. \"The General Dynamics team has done a great job honoring its commitments and we are excited to have achieved an initial operating capability in our first area of responsibility. We look forward to continuing this strong relationship, and to completing the rest of our Arizona deployments over the next year.\" \nLocated on elevated fixed towers and building structures, the RVSS advanced wide-area electro-optical and infrared multi-sensor camera system provides Border Patrol agents with persistent ground-surveillance and real-time video analytics to effectively detect, track, identify, classify and respond to missions along U.S. bordes. To date, General Dynamics has deployed a new command-and-control system and installed upgraded RVSS camera suites on five new and 12 legacy tower sites supporting the Nogales Border Patrol Station. During the test, the system was used to assist field agents in real-world missions. \n\"This upgraded RVSS deployment significantly enhances Border Patrol agents' ability to protect the southern border from illegal activity,\" said Edward Hudson , vice president and general manager of General Dynamics Information Technology's Advanced Technology Solutions sector. \"The RVSS upgrade increases the Border Patrol's situational awareness and improves efficiency and officer safety.\" \nIn July 2013 , CBP awarded General Dynamics One Source the contract to upgrade RVSS along the southern U.S. border. The contract has a potential value of approximately $103 million over 10 years, if all options are exercised. General Dynamics One Source is comprised of General Dynamics Information Technology and General Dynamics Mission Systems. \nGeneral Dynamics has a diverse portfolio of contracts with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and commercial customers to provide wireless network infrastructure, secure mobile communications, operational support systems and advanced surveillance systems such as electro-optical and infrared long-range cameras. These programs include Tactical Communications Modernization (TACCOM), Commercial Tier 1 Carrier Wireless Network Infrastructure and mission-critical wireless communication systems deployments such as Rescue 21, the U.S. Coast Guard's nationwide command, control and communications system that connects Coast Guard personnel with distressed mariners. Additionally, the company has supported large technology integration programs, including the consolidation of DHS Headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Washington, D.C. \nMore information about General Dynamics is available at www.generaldynamics.com .
