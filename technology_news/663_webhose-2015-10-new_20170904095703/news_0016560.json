The Measurement Map Atlas will be available to the market immediately.\nThe Measurement Map Atlas is an advanced collection of Measurement Maps, which are visual depictions of the alignment between Human Capital investments and programs to strategic business goals. The Measurement Map communicates complex information in a single image that is easily understood by all business stakeholders and is instrumental in guiding teams through their analytical endeavors. Example maps from the Atlas include topics such as: Collaboration Portal, Supervisor Development, Call Center, Strategic Selling, Loan Officer Evaluation, and Retail Store Performance.\n“The Measurement Map Atlas is a culmination of over 10 years of consulting work in conducting business impact studies for Fortune 500 organizations. Vestrics works every day with clients in need of Measurement Maps, but not quite knowing where to start. The Atlas provides a framework in crafting program specific maps, but allows the user to fully customize based on their organization’s needs.
