Her son's obsession with internet browsing had Raghunath worried.Discussions with other mothers on cyberbullying and increasing obesity among children only raised her concerns. Instead of switching off the Wi-Fi, the stay-at-home mother started working on the idea of a mobile app that could help parents track their children's activities on the internet.Last December, Raghunath launched eKavach, an app that when downloaded on the parent's phone and the child's device, could help parents block specific web categories, set time limits for internet access, and get real-time notifications. \"The app has seen more than 7,500 downloads in India,\" says Raghunath. A variety of mobile apps and devices have emerged to help parents deal with issues related to kids, be it their safety, online activity or performance in school.Angel Child Monitoring and KidMobile are both sim-card enabled devices that can be strapped on the child's wrist or carried by the child like a cell phone, and be used to track the child's location. Angel Child Monitoring has been developed by Bengaluru-based Krishnendu Dasgupta, a telecom industry veteran who quit his job in Cisco a year-and-a-half ago, to develop this gadget following the rape of a six-year-old girl at an city upmarket school.\"The device even allows parents to check what the kid is up to just by making a call to the gadget. It does not ring, but the call is answered automatically. Parents can hear all that's happening around the child,\" says Sudipta Panda, who bought the device after one worrying incident where his son went for a spelling competition without informing them, and didn't return home at the usual time.KidMobile has the additional feature of capturing images around the child, and combining that with GPS location and time; these can be viewed by parents at any time. Both gadgets come equipped with panic buttons.Then there are platforms for parents to interact with other parents, so they can help each other. Talkative Parents connects parents of kids in the same class. Launched by Bengaluru-based Mahesh Vorkady last year, the app has a database of 6,900 schools and over 2,000 active users. Once the app is downloaded, parents can select the child's school and class. Vorkady plans to bring teachers too onto the platform.BabyChakra, founded by Mumbai-based Naiyya Saggi, started as a portal for parents to connect with childcare services. Earlier this year, they launched a platform called MomStars where they identified and requested mothers who were regular visitors to the portal, to review services and counsel other mothers.Priya Sood is one such MomStar. She came across BabyChakra while looking for a paediatrician close to home, for her two-year-old baby. As a homemaker, she was engrossed with housework and limited to just taking care of her child. Now, with the once-a-month MomStar meetups, she gets a chance to interact with mothers dealing with the same issues she is.\"We recently had a live chat on school admissions, since the season is coming up. An educationist came on the platform and answered all the parents' queries,\" Sood says.But when it comes to intrusive apps, don't children protest? Some do, but others are too young to object. Raghunath's attempt to use eKavach on her son's device was met with a lot of resistance.\"It was a big fight for 20 days. I had to make him understand it was for his own good. He is now used to it,\" she says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:54:48.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
