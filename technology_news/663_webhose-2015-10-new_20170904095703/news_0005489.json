This conference is designed to help empower the higher education community to be a foundation for a thriving, equitable and ecologically healthy world while celebrating and inspiring campus sustainability innovations. The conference consists of more than 400 sessions, which allow attendees to personalize their experience and attend case studies, panel discussions or networking events that interest them the most. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278412 \nOne must-see component of this year's show is Innova EV Car Share . After a pilot program selection process administered by Internet2 last year, Innova UEV began research with their Dash electric vehicles at four progressive sustainability-focused campuses in January 2015. The selected schools were Colorado State University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Washington and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Colorado State University was recently recognized by AASHE as the first campus to be given Platinum STARS recognition for sustainability achievements. \nThe Innova EV Car Share solution was designed with sustainability efforts in mind. This turnkey program can help higher education institutions add significant STARS points. Other benefits of car sharing for campuses include decreasing congestion and parking constraints. In addition to reducing parking needs because of shared use, three Dash vehicles fit within a single traditional parking spot. This vibrant electric car sharing program with solar charging stations represents a highly visible way that campuses can foster the sharing economy. The Dash bridges the transportation gap between a bike and a traditional car. \nInnova UEV Founder and CEO Roman Kuropas commented on the AASHE Conference: \"The Innova UEV team is excited to introduce this innovative sustainability program to universities across the country as a way to reduce CO(2) output as well as decrease congestion. Visionary schools that make this level of commitment to the environment are sure to add to their sustainability prestige as leaders in higher education.\" \nWhile higher education is Innova UEV's first focus, the Dash is also suitable for cities and retirement communities where shared-use mobility is beneficial. In urban settings, the Dash can serve as a first mile and last mile supplement to mass transit to enable multimodal transportation and help more commuters part with single-occupancy cars. \nInnova UEV has partnered with Verizon to make the vehicles truly connected. Verizon not only provides 4G LTE wireless connectivity within the vehicles, but it also contributes secure back office services that provide a user-friendly experience between driver, application and vehicle. The Innova EV Car Share app locks and unlocks the vehicles and provides a personalized experience based on the user's preferences. It also displays how much carbon emissions are saved for each ride. \n\"This conference is especially exciting for AASHE as we not only have the opportunity to connect emerging and advanced sustainability professionals to exchange ideas and work together to lead the global sustainability movement, but we are also able to celebrate our tenth anniversary with our community, including the founder of the Oberlin Project, David W. Orr, one of our keynote speakers,\" said AASHE Executive Director Meghan Fay Zahniser. \nBy creating a diverse community engaged in sharing ideas and promising practices, AASHE provides administrators, faculty, staff and students as well as the businesses that serve them with thought leadership and essential knowledge resources; outstanding opportunities for professional development; and a unique framework for demonstrating the value and competitive edge created by sustainability initiatives. \nContact: Regan Sonnabend", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:15:34.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
