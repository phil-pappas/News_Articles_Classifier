The original video was launched in July. Interlude worked with Interscope Records and SB Projects to develop a version which allows fans to participate in how the video unfolds. This is the first time Interlude has recreated an existing music video into their interactive format. \nThe new Interlude interactive music video includes brand new exclusive content featured for the first time in the new interactive video. It gives Carly’s fans the opportunity to experience her journey with her. Through a series of text messages and emojis, viewers get the chance to be active participants in what she does, how she feels, where she travels to, how she spends her spare time: Ride a skateboard? Go to Paris? Sing Karaoke? This is all a conversation that each individual viewer has with Jepsen. Each experience is uniquely tailored to each viewer’s choices. \n“Working with label and management partners to craft unique video experiences, Interlude is focused on creating new opportunities for artists and fans to engage,” said Brian Harris Frank, President, Interlude Music. “It’s early days, but this video is an example of the potential to dramatically change the dynamics of music videos. We are eager to be a part of the evolution of music industry and see some very interesting marketing opportunities through our platform.” \nThe new Interlude Interactive video experience is available now at https://www.carlyraemusic.com/runawaywithme . \nAbout Interlude \nInterlude ( www.interlude.fm ) is pioneering a new form of media in which video can respond to a person’s actions and interests in real-time.
