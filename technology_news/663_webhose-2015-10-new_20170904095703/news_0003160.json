(Photo: PTI) Mumbai: Murder accused Indrani Mukerjea has denied killing her daughter Sheena Bora and has put the entire blame on her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and her driver Shyamvar Rai in her statement to the CBI, according to reports. The former media executive during her questioning to the CBI claimed that she called up Sheena on April 24, 2012 and invited her to meet Khanna for a family dinner at Bandra. Indrani in her statement alleged that Khanna was growing vary of Sheena's increasing importance in the Mukerjea family since she was in a romantic relationship with Peter Mukerjea's son and Khanna felt it could affect his biological daughter Vidhie's future. Indrani claimed she had no hand in the murder and said Sanjeev Khanna and her driver were entirely responsible for Sheena's death. According to sources, Indrani offered full cooperation to CBI officials and gave them all the details they sought from her. She is said to have spoken in fluent English and had insisted on looking at the statement after it was recorded. The Sheena Bora case has recently been handed over to the CBI over allegations made against former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria and current Mumbai Police Commissioner Ahmed Javed. The CBI had registered a case against all three accused in the case under Sections 120-B, 364, 302, 307, 328, 201, 202, 203 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 3(25) of the Arms Act relating to the alleged murder of Sheena Bora on the request of the Maharashtra government and further notification from the Centre. Indrani, along with her first husband Sanjiv Khanna and driver Shyam Rai, were arrested on August 25 this year in connection with Indrani’s daughter Sheena’s murder.
