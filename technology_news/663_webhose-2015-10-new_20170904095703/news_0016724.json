Louie Douvis by James Eyers National Australia Bank has joined Commonwealth Bank of Australia and a group of 20 global global banks in a trial of \"distributed ledger\" technologies based on the \"blockchain\" that facilitates bitcoin transactions.\nThe blockchain and similar decentralised ledgers use computers with advanced encryption to keep track of transactions, bypassing traditional banks or clearing houses.\nNAB has joined a project being run by global financial innovation company R3, which is seeking to design protocols around a system banks might use to transfer funds or information to each other at lower cost and without having to rely on central banks.\nNAB chief executive Andrew Thorburn said the project would \"work through the legal implications, the technology architecture and the different use cases around the world today that we can test\".\nHe said the blockchain \"is an opportunity for banks to learn together about something that could have a very significant impact on our business in future years. It could be a virtual banking system.\"\nOther banks are also investigating how the blockchain might be employed. Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzerâ€‹ said last month the development of the blockchain \"will certainly have a very interesting and potentially disruptive impact on financial services\". Westpac and CBA are also conducting trials with Ripple Labs to develop blockchain-like technology to allow banks to send information to each other.\nDevelopment of the blockchain has been one of the hottest topics at the SIBOS 2015 payments conference in Singapore this week, which is being attended by 8000 delegates.\nDespite their enthusiasm for the blockchain, banks appear less supportive of bitcoin start-ups, with the competition watchdog considering an inquiry into the actions of banks for shutting down accounts of local bitcoin operators.\n In a lunchtime speech to the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Mr Thorburn also said NAB would put more funding into NAB Ventures, an innovation fund seeded with $50 million in July to invest in potentially disruptive businesses. He added the fund was not established to make a profit. \"We are doing it to learn. It is equity capital at risk so we can learn faster to protect the core, grow our business and serve our clients better.\"\nIn a recent note, analyst Matt Wilson, head of financials research at JCP Investment Partners, said the blockchain \"looks set to be the next big thing, a truly disruptive technology platform\".\n\"This technology has the ability to remove the friction and minimise the capital intensity of cash management and liquidity,\" he said. \"Delivery of a successful distributed ledger could change the global payments system and potentially replace [international payment and settlement systems] SWIFT and CLS, to become the most secure and instant method of funds transfer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:22:56.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
