Twitter announced, Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, the company is laying off 336 employees, signaling CEO Jack Dorsey's resolve to slash costs while the company struggles to make money. Richard Drew, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story SAN FRANCISCO \nTwitter is laying off up to 336 employees, signaling CEO Jack Dorsey's resolve to slash costs while the company struggles to make money. \nThe cutbacks announced Tuesday could equate to about 8 percent of Twitter's workforce of 4,100 people. \nThe purge comes two weeks after Twitter brought back one of its co-founders as permanent CEO in hopes that Dorsey would be able to resolve problems that have slowed user growth at the messaging service and compounded an uninterrupted cycle of financial losses. \nCutting costs can boost profits but at Twitter, it has also raised uncertainty about the future and the company's desire for aggressive growth and the larger audience it has sought for so long. \nThe layoffs may be a sign of desperation at a sinking company, said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor. \n\"It is important to run a tight ship, but simply cutting jobs is often the action of a company that does not know what else to do,\" Windsor said. \nYet Twitter's workforce has nearly doubled over the past two years, weighing on efforts to turn a profit for the first time in its nine-year history. Since Dorsey and his partners started the service, Twitter has lost nearly $2 billion; investors are now worried that the company's third-quarter results, scheduled for October 27, will be another disappointment. \nStill, trading in the company's shares before the opening bell suggested that investors agree with Dorsey, that the company must cut back before it begins to grow. \nShares rose almost 3 percent in premarket trading Tuesday. \nDorsey has acknowledged that Twitter is too confusing for many people to use, turning off new users at a time when other social services such as Snapchat and Facebook's WhatsApp have grown in popularity. \nAs part of its revival plan, Twitter last week unveiled a new feature called \"Moments\" that packages commentary, video and photos about major events that have captured people's attention. The work on Moments began while Dorsey's predecessor, Dick Costolo, was still Twitter's CEO. \nAfter returning as CEO, Dorsey promised to make Twitter more accessible to the masses next year. Jettisoning jobs will give Twitter more financial leeway while it designs new tools. \nTwitter's expenses through the first half of the year climbed 44 percent to $1.2 billion. The company's revenue totaled $938 million during the same period.
