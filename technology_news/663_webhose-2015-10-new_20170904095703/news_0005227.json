The announcement comes one month before the observance in the United States of Veterans Day, when the nation remembers the service and sacrifice of its approximately 23 million living veterans. \nSamsung Electronics’ donation will ensure the continued upkeep and care of the memorial grounds, including the 19 sculptures representing members of the U.S. Armed Forces who engaged in combat, the Memorial Wall filed with more than 2,500 etched photos depicting personnel and scenes of the war, and the Pool of Remembrance dedicated to those killed, wounded or missing in action. \n“Over sixty years ago, millions of U.S. service members came to South Korea’s aid during the Korean War. More than one hundred thousand Americans were wounded and over 36,000 gave their lives in defense of freedom. Samsung remembers their sacrifice,” said Won-Kyong Kim, Executive Vice President of Samsung Electronics America. “That’s why Samsung is proud to support the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation’s Maintenance Fund, so that millions of visitors to Washington, D.C. also remember their defense of freedom.” \nThe relationship between Samsung and the United States was born more than six decades ago when American forces helped South Korea maintain its independence. After the war, the United States and Korea were dedicated to rebuilding the country. At the time, Samsung, a rapidly growing company, was focused on the re-development and industrialization of South Korea. Since then, the United States-Republic of Korea relationship has been one based on common respect and trust, serving as a foundation for the deep alliance and global partnership. The strong cooperation across political, economic, social and cultural arenas has enabled an environment in which Samsung’s innovations and technological leadership have been able to flourish. \n“The Korean War Veterans Memorial is one of the most inspiring war memorials in our Nation’s Capital. This memorial serves to honor the veterans and those who made the supreme sacrifice in the war and with the generous donation from Samsung, we can be assured it will stand as a tribute and remain inspiring for decades to come,” said Colonel William E. Weber, Chairman of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. \nJoined by Representative Xavier Becerra (D-CA), Chairman, House Democratic Caucus, and Representative Ralph Abraham, M.D. (R-LA), Chairman, Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs and House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, in a ceremony announcing the donation last week on Capitol Hill, Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY), Korean War Veteran and Founder and Chairman Emeritus of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, expressed tremendous gratitude as one of the few Korean War veterans currently serving in Congress. \"We know that the Korean people, as exemplified through Samsung, are saying: ‘We will not forget the sacrifice you made to allow us to play such an important role in the community and economics of the world.’” \nRep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) also commented, “Samsung and the appreciation of the Korean people for the United States’ role in the Korean War is a message for humankind, the world and for all who have endured any sacrifice.” Congressman Rangel continued, “Samsung didn’t have to do this – but to those of us who still feel that Americans should at least know about those who served and sacrificed their lives in the Korean War, this kind gesture by a corporation is so well, and so emotionally, received.” \nThis year Samsung Electronics America’s National Day of Service is Friday, October 16. Regional U.S. employees from the technology leader will join with veterans and volunteers in cleaning the Korean War Veterans Memorial and in readying the site for the 2015 observance of Veterans Day. \nSamsung Electronics America, with its growing footprint of 17,000 employees in the U.S., is making support for veterans and military family initiatives a major part of its social responsibility and citizenship efforts. In 1996, Samsung endowed $5 million to the American Legion for a scholarship fund to honor those who came to Korea’s aid during its struggle against communist forces. Since its inception, the scholarship program has awarded more than $5.49 million in college scholarships to nearly 1,900 students who are direct descendants of U.S. war veterans. In 2013, Samsung was honored for its years of dedication to this cause with the American Legion’s prestigious Patriot Award. These efforts are rooted in the company’s recognition of the importance of the U.S. military role in South Korea’s history. \nTo learn more about the KWVMF, visit: http://www.koreanwarvetsmemorial.org/ \nAbout Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. \nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies, redefining the worlds of TVs, smartphones, wearable devices, tablets, cameras, digital appliances, printers, medical equipment, network systems, and semiconductor and LED solutions.
