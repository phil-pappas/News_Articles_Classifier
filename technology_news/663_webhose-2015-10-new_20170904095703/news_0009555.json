In his Twitter profile, Snowden described himself by saying, “I used to work for the government. Now I work for the public.” \nHe had a brief exchange of tweets with prominent astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson about the discovery of water on Mars and joked that his work for the Freedom of the Press Foundation keeps him busy, “but I still find time for cat pictures.” \nSupporters see Snowden as a whistleblower who boldly exposed government excess but the US government wants to try him for leaking intelligence information. Snowden left the United States in May 2013 and has been living in Russia since June of that year. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:25:35.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
