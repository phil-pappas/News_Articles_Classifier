Since Dorsey and his partners started the service, Twitter has lost nearly $2 billion.\nWhen reports of the anticipated layoffs surfaced late last week, investors initially fretted that Dorsey might be reacting to disappointing performance in the quarter that just ended in September. Twitter eased those worries Tuesday by disclosing that its revenue for the period will hit or slightly exceed its previously target of $545 million to $560 million. The official results are due out Oct. 27.\nTwitter's stock gained 99 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $29.74 in midday trading Tuesday.\nDorsey has acknowledged that Twitter is too confusing for many people to use, turning off new users at a time when other social services such as Snapchat and Facebook's WhatsApp have grown in popularity.\nAs part of its revival plan, Twitter last week unveiled a new feature called \"Moments\" that packages commentary, video and photos about major events that have captured people's attention. The work on Moments began while Dorsey's predecessor, Dick Costolo, was still Twitter's CEO.\nAfter returning as CEO, Dorsey promised to make Twitter even more accessible to the masses by next year. Jettisoning jobs will give Twitter more financial leeway while it designs new tools.\nTwitter's expenses through the first half of the year climbed 44 percent to $1.2 billion. The company's revenue totaled $938 million during the same period.\nRetrenching will cost Twitter $10 million to $20 million, mostly to pay for employee severance packages. The accounting charge for the reorganization is expected to be lower, ranging from $5 million to $15 million, because Twitter some of the departing employees will be losing stock options that didn't vest.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the 'up to' 336 jobs could be cut, not 336.\n ", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:23:14.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
