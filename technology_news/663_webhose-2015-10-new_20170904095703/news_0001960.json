The first bird is to raise the commercial and political influence in neighboring countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, and the other bird is to sustain a steady growth of the Chinese economy.” \nLin continued that it’s not certain what the impact on containerised shipping will be, and warned that the government could abandon the strategy even though it’s expected to be a major plank a five-year plan. \nThe transport initiative was launched in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jingping in order to combine the Maritime Silk Road developments via ports and roads with the Silk Road Economic Belt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:54:33.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
