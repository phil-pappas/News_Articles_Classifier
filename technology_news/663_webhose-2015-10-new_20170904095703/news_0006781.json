In addition, Stan Gregor, formerly the Head of Cantor Fitzgerald Wealth Management, is joining Dynasty as Director of Network Development – Eastern Division, reporting to Tim Bello, Head of Network Development. \nWith the addition of 10 financial advisory firms thus far in 2015 and a total of 34 advisory firms in the Dynasty Network, the firm has seen a rapid expansion of its business in the last year. Dynasty has recently expanded its footprint, opening corporate offices in Chicago and San Francisco to handle the demands of its burgeoning business. To allow for more local and customized service of their growing network of independent advisors, Dynasty has created a three division structure and is hiring key resources to build out the divisional coverage positions to further support their advisor client base. \n“In an effort to continue to provide an extraordinary level of service on behalf of our clients and to best leverage the existing talent we have, we are announcing an expansion of our team,\" said Shirl Penney, President and CEO of Dynasty Financial Partners. \"Jason has been an integral part of the Dynasty team from the beginning and we are confident that he will provide the vision, management, and leadership required to continue to innovate and deliver the best support and service platform in the industry.” \nMr. Pinkham will be responsible for transition and relationship management in three divisions: Eastern - based in NYC, Midwest - based in Chicago and Western - based in San Francisco. \n“I have had the incredible good fortune to work with every team that has joined Dynasty’s growing network over the last five years. It has truly been a pleasure and honor to support them both in transition and growth of their businesses,” said Mr. Pinkham. “Adding a physical presence in new markets is incredibly important to maintain the level of service necessary to support our Network Firms on a more localized basis and we will continue to make strategic investments in our people, platforms, and capabilities.” \nNetwork Development Role \nDynasty expects to continue to onboard teams of RIAs that are looking to better streamline their operations with an integrated platform model, IBD advisors looking for flexibility in running their business as an RIA, and advisors moving from brokerage firms seeking a partner to help them both transition to RIA business owners and support them in running their new firm. \nTo address the increase in number of inquiries from firms looking to use Dynasty’s platform and become members of the Dynasty Network, Dynasty has decided to make additional investments in the Network Development team. To address this growing demand, Dynasty has hired Stan Gregor to assist with Network Development activities on the East Coast. \n“At Dynasty, we have had tremendous momentum in the wealth industry, particularly in the last six months. I am really looking forward to having an executive of Stan’s stature join Paul Landaiche and me in representing Dynasty. Stan is a proven executive and leader in the wealth management arena,” said Tim Bello, Head of Network Development. “He will be a significant addition to our Network Development team as Dynasty continues its tremendous growth.” \nStan Gregor brings over 28 years of experience in wealth management and financial services to Dynasty. Prior to joining Dynasty Financial Partners, Mr. Gregor was Founder and Co-CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald Wealth Partners since 2012. Before that, he worked as Head of Wells Fargo Wealth Management Eastern US Markets and Head of the Wealth Insurance Group. He joined Wells Fargo in 2007. \nMr. Gregor has a B.A. in Business Administration from Adelphi University and completed Executive Management Programs at Wharton Business School and Duke University Business School. \nAbout Dynasty Financial Partners \nDynasty Financial Partners is the premiere integrated platform for the wealth management industry’s top advisors.
