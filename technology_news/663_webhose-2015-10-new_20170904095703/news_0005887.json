With this work, NordiaSoft’s R&D team is addressing “Techniques for Efficient Porting of Waveform Applications between Embedded Heterogeneous Platforms” which ranks first in the Wireless Innovation Forum list of the Top 10 Most Wanted Wireless Innovations – 2015. \nNordiaSoft will demonstrate new capabilities for the development of embedded systems, targeting software portability and code reuse through the Open Computing Language (OpenCL), a framework for writing source code that executes across CPUs, GPUs, DSPs and FPGAs. In addition to the SCA which provides a programming framework for portability across platforms, OpenCL now brings portability across processing elements. OpenCL enables developers to implement their algorithms in C-like source code, and execute without modification in a variety of processor types, making it easier to develop applications and improve performance by selecting the appropriate processor type. OpenCL conformant implementations are available from organizations such as Altera, AMD, Apple, ARM Holdings, IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Samsung and Xilinx. \n“It has long been a sought-after goal for Software Defined Radio development to write portable signal processing code, a goal that is shared amongst other embedded systems domains. With this new capability in our product we are showing this goal can be achieved, making the development of heterogeneous and distributed embedded systems easier and faster,” said Steve Bernier, NordiaSoft CTO. \nNordiaSoft will also demo a series of new features for its SCARI Software Suite, targeting, amongst others, the development of real-time applications. \nMeet us at the WInnComm-Europe, October 6-8 2015, in Erlangen, Germany for a demonstration. \nAbout NordiaSoft: NordiaSoft offers products and services for those who need to create state of the art software-defined platforms as used in the telecommunications, aerospace, radar, electronic warfare, robotics, transportation and instrumentation domains. \nMedia Contact NordiaSoft: Juan Pablo Zamora Zapata Business Development Officer Phone: +1-819-307-0333 Email: info@nordiasoft.com Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:54:05.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
