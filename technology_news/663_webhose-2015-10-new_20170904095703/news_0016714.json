It can find a parking spot and parallel park itself. It also uses cameras and sensors to warn drivers about potential side impacts. \nBut analysts say the lane-changing feature is an industry first. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the system is also unique because it will constantly collect data from actual drivers and improve itself. The system will note, for example, how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located. \n\"I think this is going to be quite a profound experience for people,\" Musk said Wednesday in a conference call with media. \"It will change people's perception of the future quite drastically.\" \nBut Musk also added a word of caution: Drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel, and the autopilot system will chime to remind them if they don't. Drivers—not Tesla—will be held liable if there's a crash, Musk said. \n\"We're being especially cautious at this early stage, so we're advising drivers to keep their hands on the wheel just in case,\" he said. \"The software is very new.\" In this Sept. 15, 2015 file photo, a Tesla Model S is on display on the first press day of the Frankfurt Auto Show IAA in Frankfurt, Germany.

Owners will get the system through a software update starting Wednesday evening in North America. Owners in Europe and Asia will get the software update in about a week. \nOnly owners who paid the $2,500 charge for the full autopilot system will be able to activate the semi-autonomous features, but Musk said the side-impact warning will be available to everyone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:50:02.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
