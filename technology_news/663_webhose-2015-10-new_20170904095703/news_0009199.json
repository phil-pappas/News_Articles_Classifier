Civica, founded in 1997, has established itself as a premier eGovernment website content management system (CMS) provider throughout the United States for local governments, special districts and non-profit groups. Civica has launched more than 400 government projects across 125 agencies, many of which are shared clients with Granicus’ suite of legislative management and video streaming solutions.\n“Civica represents a solid strategic fit for Granicus,” said Jason Fletcher, Granicus CEO. “The content created by our clients in core Granicus products is often the most viewed content on our clients’ websites. With that in mind, bringing Civica’s website CMS into our product offering provides an integrated product experience that differentiates Civica from its traditional competitors, and Granicus from ours.”\nThe acquisition of Civica represents a significant commitment by Granicus to help governments more easily present critical content to citizens online while saving staff time in managing and updating their websites.\nIt is anticipated that early product integration projects will include:\nIntegrated search: a unified search feature to display website content results alongside content from traditional Granicus products like upcoming legislation, video content, land and vitals records and citizen board and commission information Mobile responsiveness: seamless desktop and mobile display of Granicus’ public-facing content pages within the Civica CMS, with no need for an iframe for an optimal user experience Dynamic, intelligent content presentation: as live meeting video content is underway, an automatic reconfiguration of the website’s homepage to predominantly feature the video player, while news or announcements display when live events are not available\n“Government websites are becoming more platform-like in how citizens use them,” said Javier Muniz, Granicus Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder. “The idea of a website to engage citizens needs to be rethought to reflect the fact that citizens typically come to a government website with a singular mission or focus – often on a mobile device. Our aim will be to help governments build websites that meet the needs of those citizens effectively, resulting in happier constituents and staff alike.”\nFor more initial information about Granicus’ acquisition of Civica, please visit http://www.granicus.com/civica .\nAbout Granicus, Inc.:\nGranicus provides the industry’s leading cloud-based solutions for government efficiency and transparency, with software that helps more than 1,200 organizations and 63,000 government staff members streamline their workflows and establish more meaningful connections with citizens — online, over social networks and on mobile devices.
