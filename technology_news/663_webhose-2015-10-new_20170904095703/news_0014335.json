They haven’t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.”\nCarney goes on to state that the Times got most of their facts wrong and the main source had an axe to grind after Amazon caught him defrauding vendors and falsifying business records.\n“Had the reporters checked their facts, the story they published would have been a lot less sensational, a lot more balanced, and, let’s be honest, a lot more boring,” he wrote.\n\"It might not have merited the front page, but it would have been closer to the truth.\"\nBut, rather than let the matter lie, the Times hit back with an open letter on the same day .\nGetty An employee in the Amazon warehouse\nThe newspaper stood by its story and the “more than a hundred current and former employees, at various levels and divisions, over many months.”\nCarney himself decided to respond , yet again, and keep the debate ticking over.\nAt which point, it's fair to say, most of us stopped caring.\nBut it does show that the Times hit a nerve with its piece and maybe Amazon isn't as immune to criticism as many thought.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://medium.com/@NYTimesComm/dean-baquet-responds-to-jay-carney-s-medium-post-6af794c7a7c6#.klibibb4h", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://medium.com/@jaycarney/what-the-new-york-times-didn-t-tell-you-a1128aa78931#.o81qexdsh", "https://medium.com/@jaycarney/jay-carney-s-response-to-dean-baquet-c0407042e893#.cvca4n4gq", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:29:30.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
