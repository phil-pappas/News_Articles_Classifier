The result was a 57-cent reduction in the per-share price received by stockholders, equivalent to about $100 million.\nMr. Bouchard dismissed a malpractice claim against Goldman, but will allow other claims to proceed.\nGoldman has denied the allegations in the case in court filings.\n\"It was Goldman that first discovered the share-count discrepancy, and it did exactly what a banker is supposed to do by bringing it to the attention of the board's legal advisors,\" the bank said in a court filing.\nThe Tibco decision follows a similar finding this month in a case involving Bank of America Corp.'s role in Zale Corp.'s sale to Signet Jewelers Ltd. in 2014. Delaware Vice Chancellor Donald Parsons kept alive allegations that Bank of America had conflicts of interest in advising Zale because it had earlier pitched Signet on the same transaction, while dismissing allegations against Zale's directors.\nBank of America said it disagreed with the ruling and didn't have conflicts of interest in the deal.\nThe two decisions come amid new scrutiny by shareholders' lawyers of investment banks' mergers-and-acquisitions advice. Over the past year, more than a dozen lawsuits have named banks as defendants, arguing errors or conflicts of interest that allegedly shortchanged investors.\nMost of the lawsuits have yet to run their course but, in one high-profile ruling, RBC Capital Markets LLC was ordered last year to pay $76 million after a judge found that the bank's desire for fees colored its advice to a client in a buyout. RBC has appealed the ruling.\nThe lawsuits pose a challenge for banks jockeying for position in M&A, one of the most competitive and lucrative businesses in finance. The scrutiny has caused boards and their lawyers to be extra cautious about conflicts of interest among their bankers, who stand to make millions if a deal is completed and often little if one isn't, lawyers say. RBC has appealed the ruling.\nVista agreed in September 2014 to buy Tibco for $24 a share. Using the mistaken, higher share number--which double-counted some shares pledged as compensation--the deal would be worth $4.2 billion to stockholders. But the parties later realized the mistake and revised the share count, lowering the deal's total price tag to $4.1 billion. Shareholders sued, and are now arguing that stockholders should have received the full amount.\nBehind the scenes, Goldman and Tibco's lawyers have disagreed privately about who knew what and when, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Vista notified Goldman in October of last year that it had relied on the mistaken share count when it made its final offer, according to court documents, and people familiar with the matter say Goldman relayed that to Tibco's lawyers at Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati PC. At a hearing last year, a lawyer for Wilson Sonsini said the board wasn't aware of Vista's reliance on the mistaken share count until far later.\nWrite to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com\n 20, 2015 21:29 ET (01:29 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:59.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
