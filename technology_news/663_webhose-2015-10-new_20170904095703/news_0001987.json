Analysts had predicted 1.56 billion euros on average.\nA slowdown in China has led to sluggish global demand for semiconductors used in smartphones, personal computers and tablets. Intel Corp., one of ASML’s biggest customers, said in July it’s cutting about $1 billion from its budget this year for new factories and equipment. ASML is trying to persuade clients such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to upgrade their machinery to extreme ultraviolet lithography systems, which can produce smaller chips while increasing capacity and speed.\nGlobal PC shipments fell 7.7 percent in the third quarter, hurt by slower desktop sales and higher dollar-based prices, Gartner Inc. said last week. PC manufacturers shipped 73.7 million units, compared with 79.8 million a year earlier, the market researcher said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:56:08.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
