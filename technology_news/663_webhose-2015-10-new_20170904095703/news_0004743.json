It allowed passengers to order and pay for groceries and arrange a delivery time.\n“Smart Mall uses an interactive screen for people to order their shopping,” said Moaza Al Matri, director of marketing and corporate communications at the Roads and Transport Authority, who added that the service would soon be available at five more stations.\n“Five years ago people were doubting how successful the Dubai Metro would be. Now it is carrying about 600,000 people every day,” said Ms Al Matri.\nThe RTA also asked people to sign up to Sharekni, a car pooling app that encouraged drivers to leave their vehicles and share a lift to cut traffic.\nDrivers must register with the RTA and undertake background checks before being offered incentives with small payments from passengers, although how much was not available.\nAnother RTA development is a 360-degree augmented reality for learner drivers to help them get used to busy highways.\n“Drivers can sit passively at the moment and see what is happening around them on the road, but we are developing the technology so they can interact and make decisions,” said Arif Abdulkarim Almalik, RTA director of drivers, training and qualification.\n“For example, if there is a hazard in front of them, they can slow down. It is safer than the traditional way of learning to drive on busy roads.\n“In future, this could be developed to help drivers who have been penalised to improve their driving. The driving conditions of Dubai mean it can be a difficult place to learn.”\nThe police are also embracing new technologies to develop training and assess the welfare of officers. A new app allows officers to rate their job satisfaction and happiness.\nIf they signal a red warning on their mobile, a senior officer will meet them to address their concerns.\nAn in-house computer game development studio is also helping new recruits develop policing skills and learn how to respond in a team to certain situations.\nThe Virtual Technology Centre in the General Department of Smart Services uses virtual applications to teach training methods.\n“We are running these programmes when young people have finished school and are beginning their national service,” said Lt Ahmad Ali Hamad Albedwawi. “It is encouraging them to work together as a team and to help them focus on achieving a goal with others.”\nThere are other applications for technology, Lt Albedwawi said.\n“We have a special weapons and tactics unit in Dubai Police and there is another programme that we can use to help to create different scenarios for training purposes, such as hostage rescue.\n“A driving simulator helps us to show young people how dangerous bad driving can be. It is good as an awareness tool.”\nDrones are another example of technology being used by emergency services.\nSix are used by Dubai Civil Defence Department, deployed to fires or other emergency rescue situations by officers on motorcycles.\n“They are an important piece of equipment to be used in such situations where it may not be safe for us to enter,” Capt Amer Ahmed Aldaisi said.\nnwebster@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:07:50.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
