The extremist group also published several articles written by prominent IS writers.\nThe videos coincide with a wave of Israeli-Palestinian violence and ratcheted-up tensions among Israelis after a series of seemingly random lone-wolf attacks by Palestinians.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:05:54.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
