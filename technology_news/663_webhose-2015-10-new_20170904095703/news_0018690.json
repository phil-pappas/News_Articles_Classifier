Margins are typically thin, but volumes are massive when crop supplies are ample - and prices low - as they currently are.\n\"Historically, the way a commodity firm gets in trouble is when they get too far away from that model. ... That does take some discipline and that's something that Cargill has learned exceedingly well,\" said Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois.\nU.S. farmers are currently harvesting among their largest-ever corn and soybean crops, adding to already record-high global stocks.\nMeanwhile, farmers in South American grains powerhouse Brazil have been actively marketing crops as their real currency has plunged to around 13-year lows against the dollar. Sales of the crops are typically made in dollars, meaning that farmers realize greater earnings for their crops when the currency weakens against the dollar.\n\"For the last two years, farmers have held on to their crops in the third (calendar) quarter so results were weaker for all these companies,\" said John Rogers, a senior vice president and team leader for chemicals and commodities at Moody's.\n\"This year, because crop prices are down and stocks-to-use ratios are pretty high, there's not much hope for further price increases through next year, so there's more opportunity for these companies to make money.\"\nDisappointing results for ADM and Bunge in their most recent quarters were blamed on turbulent global markets. An unexpected spike in crop prices late in their quarter also negatively skewed results as inventories were temporarily valued at higher prices, making margins on sales seem tighter.\nIn comparison, Cargill's most recent fiscal quarter ended on Aug. 31, allowing the company favorable comparisons with losses that arose from an unexpected surge in crop prices in late June, Rogers said.\nAnalysts at BMO Capital Markets and Credit Suisse upgraded Bunge to \"outperform\" last week on expectations that a weak Brazilian real swelled supplies of soybeans available to the company for processing and helped boost the export of Brazilian soybeans.\nAnalysts also expected ADM to benefit from the weaker real and bumper crops in the United States, home to most of its assets, although weak margins in ethanol biofuel could partly offset gains.\nADM is to report its quarterly results on Nov. 3. Bunge has not yet announced a reporting date.\nADM shares hit a one-month high on Wednesday and Bunge shares rallied to a two-month peak, though both are down about 15 percent on the year.\n(Additional reporting by Tom Polansek ; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:59:07.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
