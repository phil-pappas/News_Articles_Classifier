But at GoDaddy, women actually make more than their male counterparts. \nThat's notable, considering the criticism GoDaddy has faced for showing scantily clad women in its advertisements -- a practice it has since discontinued. \nFemale GoDaddy employees are paid about a penny more for every dollar a male employee makes. Though that's true on the whole, there are still roles within the company where men still get paid better. For example, in tech roles, GoDaddy's female staff members make marginally less (0.1%) than men, or about 99 cents to a dollar. \nThe gap is bigger at management levels, where female execs earn 96 cents to a man's dollar. Women make more than men do at GoDaddy by a marginal difference. \nGoDaddy says the company is looking into why there's still a pay difference for certain jobs, but has a few theories, including how long executives have been in their roles, and differences in starting salaries. \nAlthough the company has made progress on pay parity, GoDaddy discovered it still needs to do more to improve gender diversity. \n\"[GoDaddy] specifically analyzed software development engineers and software development test engineers, and found that in both categories, the population of women decreases as the seniority level increases,\" the company said in a statement. \nIn three software development categories, GoDaddy actually has no women in those roles. There are no women in certain senior development roles at GoDaddy. \nWednesday's announcement was the first-ever for GoDaddy. Releasing diversity statistics to the public has become a new annual practice for the likes of Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) , Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) , Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) , and Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) . \nYet GoDaddy is alone in disclosing pay differences between genders. \nLike GoDaddy, a host of large and small tech companies also pledged to pay more attention to their hiring practices earlier this summer. \nThe National Venture Capital Association -- which includes 45 VC firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers -- committed to advancing opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities. That includes measuring and reporting diversity numbers at their firms and portfolio companies. \nCompanies like Xerox ( XRX ) and Box ( BOX ) promise to interview at least one woman and one underrepresented minority for every senior level position.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:44:08.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
