At the same time, new chipsets supporting carrier aggregation have started to reach the market, and this should lead to lower prices and wider adoption of the technology.\" \nPhil Kendall, Director of Wireless Operator Strategies at Strategy Analytics, added that, \"More than 70 percent of operators do not yet have enough LTE spectrum available to support 40 MHz of aggregate bandwidth for 300 MHz peak downlink speed unless they use three separate LTE carriers in three distinct bands, and this can requires more expensive and complex mobile devices. However, this has started to change with refarming of legacy GSM and 3G spectrum to LTE by operators, allowing more operators to adopt carrier aggregation.\" \nAbout Strategy Analytics \nStrategy Analytics, Inc. provides the competitive edge with advisory services, consulting and actionable market intelligence for emerging technology, mobile and wireless, digital consumer and automotive electronics companies.
