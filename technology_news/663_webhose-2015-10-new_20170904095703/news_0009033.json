It disarmed and was formally disbanded at a ceremony in the capital Ouagadougou on Tuesday.\nLast week, a senior army source said the majority of putschist troops had taken up new postings with the military. Those left to join loyalist forces had until October 2 to show up at their new postings, and those who failed to do so would be \"considered deserters\", the source said.\n\"Not all members of the former RSP have yet reported to their stations. There are still people who are at large. There are weapons that have yet to be found,\" secretary general of the defence ministry, Colonel Major Alassane Mone, said at the government's weekly press conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:04:48.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
