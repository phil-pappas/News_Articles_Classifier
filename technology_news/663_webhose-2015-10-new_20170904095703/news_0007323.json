This compares to revenue of $1,481.4 million, gross margin of $641.5 million, or 43.3% of revenue, operating expenses of $450.5 million, operating margin of 12.9% of revenue, and net income of $131.3 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 28, 2015 (the \"June 2015 quarter\"). The September 2015 operating expenses, operating margin, net income and income per diluted share were negatively impacted by $7.3 million of restructuring charges. The June 2015 operating expenses, operating margin, net income and income per diluted share were negatively impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $79.4 million. In addition, the June 2015 gross margin, operating margin, net income and income per diluted share were negatively impacted by an impairment charge related to a long-lived asset of $9.8 million. \nNon-GAAP Financial Results \nFor the September 2015 quarter, non-GAAP gross margin was $744.0 million or 46.5% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were $363.6 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 23.8% of revenue, and non-GAAP net income was $313.0 million, or $1.82 per diluted share.

This increase was primarily the result of approximately $449.0 million in cash flows from operating activities which was partially offset by approximately $98.4 million of treasury stock repurchases, including net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation; approximately $49.5 million of capital expenditures; and approximately $47.7 million of dividends paid to stockholders during the September 2015 quarter. \nDeferred revenue at the end of the September 2015 quarter remained stable at $517.4 million, as compared to $518.1 million at the end of the June 2015 quarter, while deferred profit balances at the end of the September 2015 quarter increased to $325.0 million, as compared to $322.1 million at the end of the June 2015 quarter. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The estimated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $146.7 million as of September 27, 2015. \nGeographic Distribution \nThe geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2015 quarter is shown in the following table: Region Shipments Revenue Taiwan 26% 28% Japan 17% 18% Korea 13% 17% China 25% 16% United States 8% 9% Southeast Asia 8% 8% Europe 3% 4% \nOutlook \nFor the December 2015 quarter, Lam is providing the following guidance: Reconciling GAAP Items Non-GAAP $1.275 $75 $1.275 $75 Shipments Billion +/- Million - Billion +/- Million $1.410 $75 $1.410 $75 Revenue Billion +/- Million - Billion +/- Million Gross margin 44.0% +/- 1% $21 Million 45.5% +/- 1% Operating margin 17.8% +/- 1% $37 Million 20.5% +/- 1% Net income per diluted share $1.19 +/- $0.10 $38 Million $1.42 +/- $0.10 Diluted share count 174 Million 2 Million 172 Million \nThe information provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and does not incorporate the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, financing arrangements, other investments, or other significant transactions that may be completed after the date of this release. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items provided include only those items that are known and can be estimated as of the date of this release. Actual results will vary from this model and the variations may be material. Reconciling items included above are as follows: Gross margin -- amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $21 million. Operating margin -- amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million. Earnings per share -- amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, $37 million; amortization of note discounts, $9 million; and associated tax benefit for non-GAAP items ($8) million; totaling $38 million Diluted share count -- impact of a note hedge issued contemporaneously with the convertible notes due in 2016 and 2018, 2 million shares. \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results \nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the September 2015 and June 2015 quarters exclude amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, restructuring impacts, the amortization of notes discounts, and tax expense (benefit) of non-GAAP items. Additionally, the September 2015 quarter non-GAAP results exclude cumulative income tax benefits due to a court ruling, and the June 2015 quarter non-GAAP results exclude acquisition-related inventory fair value impact, long-lived asset impairment, goodwill impairment, and additional accrual for certain tax matters. \nManagement uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's website at http://investor.lamresearch.com . \nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \nStatements made in this press release that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
