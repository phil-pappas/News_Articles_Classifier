The Wallenpaupack plant's license expires at the end of 2045. \nBrookfield Renewable CEO Sachin Shah said: \"These high-quality assets provide a unique opportunity to leverage our operating platform and hydroelectric expertise in a market facing significant coal retirements and increasing reliance on renewable.\" \nThe deal, which is awaiting regulatory approvals and is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be concluded in the first quarter of 2016.
