Darr Beiser, USAT)\n6 CONNECT 24 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO—A researcher presenting at a European computer security conference demonstrated hacking into a Fitbit in ten seconds flat, giving her a back door to enter cells phones or computers synched to the fitness device, according to security company Fortinet.\n“Our researcher was able to take a Bluetooth antenna, take her laptop and scan the air for devices,” said Aamir Lakhani, chief security analyst with Fortinet, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based computer security company, told USA TODAY after the demonstration.\nOnce Fortinet researcher Axelle Apvrille found a Fitbit in the vicinity, she used its Bluetooth connection to upload a small piece of malicious software into the device, Lakhani said.\nApvrille had to be within ten feet of the Fitbit for her exploit to work.\nBLUETOOTH LINK\nWhen the Fitbit was synched via Bluetooth up to a smart phone or laptop, she was able to send the malware into the connecting device, as the Fitbit uploaded its data.\nFitbit said it didn’t believe the exploit was possible.\nIn an emailed statement, the company said that it believes the security issues reported by Apvrille are false and that Fitbit devices can't be used to infect users with malware. The company said it will continue to monitor the issue.\nFitbit has not seen any data to indicate it is currently possible to use a fitness tracker to distribute malware and the company is focused on protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe, the statement said.\nApvrille presented her research Wednesday at Hack.lu, a security conference held in Luxembourg.\nShe used a Fitbit Flex, a fitness wristband that records the users’ fitness activities such as walking and running. Using BlueTooth, the user can then upload their information to the phone or computer.\nThe malicious software Apvrille inserted into the Fitbit was very small, “just a few lines of code,” said Lakhani.\nBut once that malware was uploaded to a phone or computer, “it gives an attacker an opportunity to take over that second device,” he said.\nApvrille posted a video of the malware injection on YouTube. She informed FitBit of her findings this summer, Lakhani said.\nNo one has seen an attack like this “in the wild” and it’s considered simply a proof of concept, said Lakhani. \"This specific attack was very specific to Fitbit,” he said.\nEXPERT: 'IT'S AN ENTRY'\nBased on what he's seen, and the generally poor quality of Bluetooth security, \"I would have no reason to suspect that this is not a real issue,” said Ryan O’Leary, senior director of threat research at WhiteHat Security, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer security company.\nWhile it wouldn’t be possible to craft a “mega exploit” out of this, “it’s an entry. You’re basically making a little bit of a back door into their system. You potentially could do a lot of negative things with [the user's] machine,” he said.\nHowever given that the would-be attacker must be within ten feet of the Fitbit, this particular hack is unlikely to become a major problem.\n“You have to be around somebody with a Fitbit for at least ten seconds. So it probably doesn’t harm a lot of people,” O'Leary said.\nBad guys want to infect millions of people, he said, \"not just the two or three who run by.\"\n6 CONNECT 24 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1RZhbve TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RZhbve&text=Fitbit%20hacked%20from%2010%20feet%20away%2C%20security%20firm%20says&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811202062235681-CES010813000007-53510159.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RZhbve", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RZhbve&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1617756645cd53588f08f733dd136e8327d7b7ac/c=245-0-4012-2832&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811202062235681-CES010813000007-53510159.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa8qVAPPlTE", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/521cd80a4fb9f1f1edf37d025629b379daee5bba/r=500x332/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811202062235681-CES010813000007-53510159.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:10:36.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
