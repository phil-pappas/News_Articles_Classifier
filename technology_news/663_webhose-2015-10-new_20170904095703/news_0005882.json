Using this new customizable, adaptive software offering, healthcare organizations will be able to alert clinicians at the earliest stages of potential sepsis cases and provide real-time guidance in monitoring and treatment. In the U.S. alone, there are over 200,000 deaths each year due to sepsis, with hospital admissions due to sepsis increasing three-fold over the past decade. September is Sepsis Awareness Month, sponsored by the Sepsis Alliance ( www.sepsis.org ), with the intent to raise awareness of this deadly and costly medical condition. \n“Unlike many other life-threatening conditions, sepsis can and should be eminently preventable,” says Stephen Wasko, President of ViMedicus. “Combining Vivace’s powerful real-time analytical tools with ViMedicus’ intuitive patient visualization and clinical workflow platform will allow clinicians unparalleled support in the treatment of sepsis.” \n“Although it has long been recognized that sepsis kills and disables millions and requires early suspicion and treatment for survival, mortality remains at 35-60%.” According to Tom Velez, CEO of Vivace, “The key to advancement will require world-class workflow and cognitive decision support tools that unleash the power of information. The integrated ViMedicus / Vivace Early Warning Response System (EWRS) will provide clinicians with the actionable intelligence needed to save lives.” \nAbout ViMedicus \nFounded in 2010, ViMedicus is an innovative healthcare team providing intuitive technology and coordinated care solutions that enable patients and providers to achieve their health goals.
