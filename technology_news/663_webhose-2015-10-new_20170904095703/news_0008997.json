The Irish data watchdog’s initial refusal to examine the complaint led to the EU court case, which led to the banning of the safe harbor accord, struck between the EU and U.S. in 2000.\nThat original decision “must now fall” and the Irish regulator “must investigate,” McDermott said. He said the probe wouldn’t be delayed.\nLast year, an Irish judge asked the top EU court to decide on key points in the Schrems case, seeking guidance on whether the safe harbor still protects privacy and whether national regulators have the power to suspend illegal data flows from the EU to the U.S.\nRide services\nUber growing\nin New York\nUber is beginning a push into Long Island and upstate New York cities, including Buffalo and Rochester.\nThe digital ride-sharing company started its effort Tuesday with a news conference in the state Capitol in Albany. General manager Josh Mohrer released a report showing that Uber would create 13,000 jobs and generate $80 million in fares its first year operating in the regions, home to more than 10 million residents.\nBefore the service can broaden its reach, the New York Legislature must overhaul insurance regulations. Those changes failed to get support in the session that ended in June. Lawmakers are expected to take them up again when they reconvene in January.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said in July that he supports a statewide regulatory system for Uber and other ride-sharing companies such as Lyft.\nIn June, Lyft, which like Uber is based in San Francisco, agreed to pay $300,000 in a settlement with Attorney General Eric Schneiderman after it began operating in Rochester and Buffalo in April 2014 without state and local approvals. It didn’t admit to wrongdoing as part of the deal. While Lyft pressed for the statewide regulatory changes during the last legislative session, Uber remained on the sidelines.\nReal estate\nApartments\nspur building\nConstruction companies built more apartment complexes in September, sparking a temporary rise in housing starts for a real estate market that otherwise appears to have crested this summer.\nThe Commerce Department said that housing starts last month rose 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million homes. But a 17 percent surge in multifamily housing — which includes apartments — accounts for almost all of that increase.\nNew construction and sales of existing homes surged in the first half of the year. But rising prices and the absence of wage growth have capped growth as affordability became an issue.\nPermits fell 5 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.1 million, a sign that construction will slow.\nEntertainment\nViacom buys\ninto DigiTour\nViacom has acquired a significant minority stake in the live entertainment company DigiTour Media , which produces concerts and festivals that feature popular personalities from YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and other online outlets.\nOther new investors include LionTree and Slow Ventures. Terms were not disclosed, but a person with knowledge of the deal said Tuesday that the total amount of capital raised was about $10 million.\nFifth Harmony, Hayes Grier , Demi Lovato and 02L are among the social media stars that have performed in DigiTour events, which are designed for teenage and tween audiences. The company said it would sell 350,000 tickets this year. DigiTour now is selling $35 tickets for a Sept. 5 festival in Houston that includes several social media stars.\nFor Viacom, the investment represents a bid to stay relevant to a generation of social networking, streaming viewers who are abandoning traditional television. The media group is struggling to reverse ratings declines at its networks, which include MTV , Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.\nDigiTour was founded in 2010 by music industry veterans Meridith Valiando Rojas and Chris Rojas. Its seed investors include broadcaster-producer Ryan Seacrest and Andrew Siegel from AV Partners , which is the investment arm of Condé Nast.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:07:53.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
