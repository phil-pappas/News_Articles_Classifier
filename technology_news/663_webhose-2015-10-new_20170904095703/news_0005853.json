FoxTales , an innovative storytelling platform that allows consumers to capture, instantly access, and share branded memories at events, worked with Facebook and CNN to create an interactive video experience that will place attendees at key campaign stops in the midst of all the action and make their voices heard! The debate at the Wynn Hotel and Casino caps off three weeks of cross-country touring, starting at the GOP Debate at the Reagan Library, that has allowed citizens in Venice Beach, Nogales, Phoenix, Denver, New Orleans, Lafayette, Ferguson, St. Louis, Kansas City and Ames to share their thoughts on the elections. “We couldn’t be more thrilled to integrate our technology in such a meaningful way. Utilizing our platform, we’re giving a voice to campaign attendees and driving real time social conversations around important issues straight to their timeline,” says Josh Hubberman, CEO of FoxTales. FoxTales produced the #campaigncamper, a customized airstream trailer built with a relaxing lounge area, live content feed and a custom FoxTales video experience featuring its own podium, lighting and teleprompter.\nUsers walk up to the podium with an embedded touch device and can either choose to record a stump speech or ask the candidates a question. If they choose to record a stump speech they can either, choose to read from a custom developed teleprompter or speak freely. If they choose to ask the candidates a question, their video could be played live during the debate or displayed during a CNN broadcast.\nUsers receive immediate access to their video via the FoxTales TaleBoard gallery on their phone and can then post straight to their personal Facebook timeline. All content from the tour will live inside a custom Facebook TaleBoard integration on the CNN Facebook page, allowing users anywhere in the world to browse and share the videos. Social media continues to change the face of politics and #campaigncamper is at the heart of that change for the 2016 elections.
