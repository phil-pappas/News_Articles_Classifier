The company announced a first-half loss in September and the departure of its finance director, but admitted on Friday it did not know of any reason for the acceleration in selling. The shares fell 10.7 per cent to 75p on Friday. \nBerenberg clients appeared to have taken the broker’s advice regarding Mothercare , which reported on Thursday a 6.5 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to October, driven by a 20 per cent rise in online sales. \nHold at price target of 250p, Berenberg said as it initiated coverage of the stock. Following a 7 per cent gain on Thursday, the shares rose a further 6.2 per cent to 253.5p day, giving a weekly gain of 14.2 per cent. \nPlatinum miner Lonmin climbed as much as 18 per cent on Wednesday after announcing a loan refinancing and rights issue package, but subsequent losses, including Friday’s 4.2 per cent decline to 28.25p, left the stock down 1.7 per cent over the week. \nEvgen chief remains upbeat as shares take dip on debut \nInvestors in pharmaceuticals company Evgen Pharma suffered in its first week on the Alternative Investment Market, writes Nicholas Megaw . \nShares in the Liverpool-based group opened at 42.5p on Wednesday but fell 16 per cent to 35.1p by the end of the day. They closed Friday at 33.7p, a 20 per cent fall for the week. \nBut the company remained positive and focused on its long-term growth. \nChief executive Dr Stephen Franklin said he was interested in major projects facilitated by the fundraising. “The share price will look after itself,” he said. \nEvgen’s float at 37p a share raised £7m, £2m more than its target. It has said that the proceeds will be used to fund two clinical studies into metastatic breast cancer and subarachnoid haemorrhage — a type of stroke. \nDr Franklin said the additional money would allow Evgen to begin a third trial. \nEvgen’s core technology seeks to treat diseases using a synthetic form of a compound commonly found in broccoli and other vegetables. \nShares in peers such as Circassia and 4D Pharma have been damaged by volatility in the wider biotech sector since the end of the summer. \nLottery group DJI Holdings seeks listing on Nasdaq \nDJI Holdings , which runs Chinese lottery businesses for football clubs such as Arsenal and Manchester City, is seeking a secondary listing on the Nasdaq in the US after a disappointing year on Aim, writes Andrew Bounds. \nIt said that using Nasdaq would boost its credentials as a tech business and bring in more institutional shareholders. \nThe Cheshire-based business provides technology as well as supporting lotteries and games in China. It listed in 2014 and shares have more than halved in the past 12 months from 121p to 44p. \nThey were marked down in March after Chinese authorities suspended online lottery sales. \nNet revenue in the first six months of the year dropped from £3.4m to £2.1m and operating losses widened from £2.2m to £2.5m. \nDarren Mercer, chief executive, said that DJI, which raised £6m in September, was branching out into new forms of technology. \nShanta Gold shines after mine sets output record \nShares in Shanta Gold rose 15 per cent on the week after the miner set production records at its Tanzanian mine, writes James Wilson . \nShanta’s 24,500 ounces of gold output from the New Luika mine were 10,000oz up on the previous quarter, helping to foster interest a month after Shanta published a feasibility study for the next phase of the project. \nToby Bradbury, chief executive, said Shanta had been able to “bolster its mining capability” and was confident of meeting its annual guidance. \nNew Luika’s expansion would be based mainly on an underground mine, which Shanta hopes to start in 2017 and to finance from cash flow and existing bank facilities. \nThe plan is based on expected all-in sustaining production costs of below $700/oz, and a gold price of $1,200, slightly above today’s level. Shanta has identified about 500,000oz of reserves but hopes that more drilling will allow it to convert some of an additional 500,000oz of gold resources into mineable reserves.
