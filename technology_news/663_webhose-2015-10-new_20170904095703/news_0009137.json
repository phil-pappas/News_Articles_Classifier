Interestingly, the files are so large that at the current resolution, they would make an 11 x 11' print.\nThe concept and initiation of the social media campaign was a result of a frequently asked question of New Horizon Scientists: how are you going to take pictures of Pluto, given that it's so far from the sun?\n\"We realized that we could make a web tool that would estimate approximately when the light levels dropped to Pluto levels,\" said Alex Parker, research scientist at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado.\n\"We looked up tables of illumination levels during various stages of twilight—used to determine when streetlights come on and such—and determined how low the sun would need to be on a clear day to match Pluto. After that is was a matter of doing the math,” he added.\nThe Solar System Exploration Public Engagement team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were responsible for attaching the mosaics, using approximately 1,500 to 2,000 images for each.\nThe creators of the mosaic have also given their tributes to Clyde Tombaugh, the man responsible for the discovery of Pluto in 1930. Zooming in the adjacent image will show a picture of Tombaugh and his homemade 9-inch telescope in the region of Pluto’s heart, which is informally named Tombaugh Regio.\n\"It's gratifying to see the global response to Pluto Time, which allowed us to imagine what it's like on Pluto, some three billion miles away,\" said Jim Green, NASA's director of planetary science. \"This is a wonderful example of how space exploration and science unite us with a common bond.\"\nTo experience Pluto Time where you live, click on the link below:\nhttp://solarsystem.nasa.gov/plutotime\nHere is a video on YouTube about Pluto Time (Video credits: NASA)\n Science NASA Pluto Time Also Read World's thinnest transistor is only three atoms thick Sony Xperia Z4 delayed, possibly debut in Q2 Internet turns festive over gay marriage decision Apple launches 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Pencil and Smart Keyboard", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/pluto_charon_mosaic_full_size_1a_1400%20%281%29_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/technology-science-and-trends/article/nasa-unveils-dazzling-mosaics-pluto", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/pluto_charon_mosaic_full_size_1a_1400%20%281%29_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/plutotime", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:05:37.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
