The average cost of stem cell processing is c£1000 meaning that this could be a second barrier to therapy.\nBioEden have launched a unique early start bonus plan, supporting their mission statement 'Helping to make stem cell therapy an affordable reality'.\n'A child can be enrolled from birth onwards long before the tooth falls. At the time when the tooth is ready to fall, all monthly fees are credited to the parent with an addition loyalty bonus of 10%. These credits are then used to offset the tooth processing costs. For many parents this means they have little or no processing costs to pay', said Tony Veverka BioEden's Group CEO\nDuring Membership the parent is provided with all the tools to understand the work of BioEden, and therapies that are and become available. The child receives fun educational tools that engages them in the BioEden process, allowing them to ‘become their own hero’.\nFor more information contact info(at)bioeden(dot)com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037826.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037826.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:21:41.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
