It focused on copies of J.D. Edwards and Siebel-branded Enterprise software.\nRavin was found jointly liable for $14.4 million of the $50 million figure.\nStatements from the two companies on Friday showed the fight was not over.\nOracle said it'll seek a court order barring Rimini Street from continuing to do business \"based on massive infringement.\"\n\"This case certainly was not about an honest dispute over licensing terms, as Rimini pretends,\" Oracle said. \"It was about IP theft, pure and simple. Rimini and Seth Ravin got caught, and now they have to pay. \"\nA Rimini Street statement derided the idea of a court injunction as meaningless, because it said Rimini Street no longer uses the processes at issue.\nIt said the jury found the company liable only for \"innocent,\" not \"willful,\" property right infringement, and that Oracle suffered no lost profits.\n\"The use by Oracle of the term 'IP theft' is purely defamatory,\" the Rimini Street statement said. The company promised \"forthcoming court filings.\"\nRimini Street is suing Oracle in another case, asking the court to confirm that Rimini Street's new processes for PeopleSoft update development don't infringe on Oracle copyrights.\nThe jury verdict this week came in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by Oracle USA Inc., Oracle America Inc. and Oracle International Corp. It focused on computer software maintenance and upgrade services provided by Oracle for its licensed systems and offered by Rimini Street as a third-party provider.\nU.S. District Judge Larry Hicks ruled in August 2014 that Rimini Street violated the copyrights of the two Oracle products and ordered the jury trial on damages.\nThe jury didn't grant punitive damages.\n____\nThis story clarifies the proper names of Oracle corporate plaintiffs.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:01:12.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
