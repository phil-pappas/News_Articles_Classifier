Of the roughly 175 products listed in G2 Crowd’s Project Management Software category, the ranked products each received 10 or more reviews to qualify for inclusion on the GridSM.\nThe GridSM factors in customer satisfaction reported by users, along with vendor market presence determined from social and public data to rank products. Based on a combination of these scores, each software solution is categorized as a Leader, High Performer, Contender or Niche.\nThe Fall 2015 report also includes GridsSM representing reviewer company size segments: Small Business (50 or fewer employees), Mid-Market (51 to 1,000 employees) and Enterprise (1,001+ employees).

[The] Workflow editing tool gives you a possibility to create a complex workflow only with drag-and-drop. On the other side, the workflow can be configured with various complex rules to be applied on status changes or on the external information.”\nVasilii T., Software Engineer at PAY.ON\n“Clarizen is a robust cloud based project management software for the collaboration age. The flexibility to adapt and mold your instance to suit the individual business needs is extraordinary.

This means that I can slice my projects any way I like and can see all the relevant tasks. Additionally, the user interface is intuitive and fun - it's helped me to get clients who have resisted project management actually managing their projects for the first time - result!”\nSally R., Strategic Leader at Projects, Processes & People\n“Simplicity! Trello is really simple to use, it's intuitive flow makes it easy for anyone to grasp quickly, helping new team members get on board really fast. The way it allows us to collaborate across teams, Dev Team, Analysts and Sales, makes it easy for everyone to be on the same tool.”\nRyan H., Director of Operations & Expansion at Brandseye\n“Workboard is very intuitive and easy to use. The free version of the software is very robust. I recently upgarded to Workboard Elite and am now using Workboard for 1 on 1s and team meetings.
