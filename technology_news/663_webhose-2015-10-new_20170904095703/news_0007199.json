By eating invasive vegetation, these animals will help to maintain the steppe character of the land.\nAfter a nine-hour drive and few more minutes of hesitation, six calves - five cows and a bull - jumped out of a truck at dawn to take the first look at their new home at the former Milovice military base, 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Prague.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:11:09.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
