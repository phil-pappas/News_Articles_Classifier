Facebook Inc. added 2.2. percent. Nasdaq futures expiring in December traded at 4,574.50, or 2 percent above their level at the 4 p.m. close Thursday in New York.\n“The results are the dominant force at the moment and there’s a underlying positive tone,” said Otto Waser, chief investment officer at R&A Research & Asset Management AG in Zurich. “We had a bit of a weak start in the earnings season, and it now looks like some companies are going to be able to deliver good results. The market is a bit more reactive to positive than negative news at the moment.”\nBetter-than-expected results yesterday from companies including McDonald’s Corp. and EBay Inc., combined with the prospect of more stimulus from the European Central Bank, helped lift U.S. stocks for the first time in three days. Contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.7 percent to 2060.25 today.\nThe volatility that struck stocks, bonds and commodities for the last two months is dissipating. The measure of U.S. equity turbulence known as the VIX is currently at its lowest since August and recently posted the longest streak of daily declines since 2009.\nMore earnings are expected today from companies including American Airlines Group Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. Of those reporting so far, about 45 have beaten sales estimates while 75 percent have topped profit projections.\nInvestors will also look to economic data later today -- a Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing and services is expected to drop to 52.7 from 53.1 the previous month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:45:13.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
