They wanted a lot more insight into the types of customer that they could target and engage with on a more ongoing basis.”\nAddressing these needs has been a big driver of the change flowing through Groupon, with the revamped website just the “tip of the iceberg,” according to Mr Venn.\nThe new website is designed to give Groupon customers greater functionality in sorting and searching of the myriad deals on offer.\nThere’s also a personalisation and curation aspect. The printed voucher has also been retired in favour of a paperless redemption option and a new app functionality lets users view all deals within their proximity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:37:50.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
