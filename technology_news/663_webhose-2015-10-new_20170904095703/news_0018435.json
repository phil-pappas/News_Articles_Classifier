On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and international reef scientists pronounced it a global coral bleaching event, only the third in recorded history. \nNo place with coral has been spared, though some regions—such as Hawaii—have been hit harder than others, experts said. Excessive heat stresses the living coral, which turns white and then becomes vulnerable to disease. \n\"We may be looking at losing somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 percent of the coral reefs this year,\" NOAA coral reef watch coordinator Mark Eakin said. \"The bad news for the U.S. is we're getting hit disproportionately just because of the pattern of the warming.\" \nHe called bleaching a crisis, especially with worsening global warming forecast for the rest of the century: \"If that's not a crisis, what is?\" \nEakin said he's especially concerned about Hawaii, which already suffered through bad bleaching in 2014. \n\"Hawaii is getting hit with the worst coral bleaching they have ever seen, right now,\" Eakin said. \"It's severe. It's extensive. And it's on all the islands.\" \nIn one part of northwestern Hawaii, \"the reef just completely bleached and all of the coral is dead and covered with scuzzy algae.\" \nFlorida started getting hit in August. The middle Florida Keys aren't too bad, but in southeast Florida, bleaching has combined with disease to kill corals, Eakin said. It has also hit Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and is about to hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, he said. \nWarm water causes bleaching and ocean temperatures are at record high levels, partly because of steady manmade global warming and partly because of the El Nino, which is an occasional warming of the central Pacific that changes weather worldwide, Eakin said. Add to that Hawaii's \"blob,\" a pool of warm water that has stagnated in the northeast Pacific. \nThe last super El Nino, in 1997-1998, was the first global bleaching event. A smaller El Nino in 2009-2010 was the second. \nSo far the 1998 bleaching was worse, but that was the second year of an El Nino and we're in the first of two years now, Eakin said. \nOceans worldwide are by far the warmest on record—August 2015 was four-tenths of a degree warmer than in August 1998. Next year, he said, may be as bad as this year or even worse. \nNOAA produced forecasts of bleaching that show it as a giant red blob moving across the globe again. And what worries marine ecologist Gregor Hodgson, who heads the group ReefCheck, is the forecast that the blob will hit the Great Barrier Reef in Australia next spring. \nThe computer model forecasts \"this horrendous dramatic\" impact on the Great Barrier Reef, Hodgson said. \"It's truly terrifying.\" \nThis isn't just a problem for divers and fish; coral reefs are crucial globally, Eakin said. Coral reefs protect shorelines, produce tourism dollars and help provide food for 500 million people around the world, he said. \nEven though coral reefs are one-tenth of 1 percent of the ocean floor by area, they are home to 25 percent of the world's fish species, Eakin said. \n\"You kill coral , you destroy reefs, you don't have a place for the fish to live,\" Eakin said. \nMore information: NOAA Coral Reef Watch: coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/index.php \nJoint coral bleaching site: www.globalcoralbleaching.org 19 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:33:18.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
