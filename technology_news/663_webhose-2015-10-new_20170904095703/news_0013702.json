The ICD-10-CM features include complete access to IMO's guided search with access to thousands of additional new qualifiers available in ICD-10-CM. \n\"This is a remarkable achievement - the entire IMO Problem (IT)™ Terminology enhanced ICD-10 offering right in your hand!\" said Frank Naeymi-Rad, PhD, MBA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IMO. He continued: \"We want our customers to know that we are fully supporting their transition to ICD-10. With the IMO Anywhere solution we've made it easy to navigate complex ICD-10 qualifiers anytime, anywhere, so you can focus on quality patient care while we deal with the complexities of vocabulary management.\" \nWith the IMO Anywhere solution, clinicians can look up the right clinical codes without access to their clinical systems. Featuring full ICD-10 drill-down functionality, the IMO Anywhere solution makes mobile searching fast, easy and clinically accurate, no matter where the point-of-care happens to be. In large health systems, the IMO Anywhere solution is a single, easily accessible \"source of truth\" for ICD and SNOMED® coding.

It displays the same live content clinicians see in their IMO-enabled electronic health record system.
