The fluctuations in the anodic curves are indicative of the pitting corrosion characteristic of Mg 2 , 35 . However, Mg demonstrated the highest corrosion rate in 0.9 wt.% NaCl, which was two-fold and four-fold greater than the corrosion rates observed in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 1× PBS, respectively. This behavior may be attributed to the ionic composition of the electrolytes. It has been reported that the critical chloride concentration required for Mg to undergo pitting corrosion is approximately 30 mM 28 . The chloride concentrations in the physiological electrolytes exceeded the critical concentration and were 200 mM, 154 mM and 140 mM for 0.1 M MgCl 2 , 0.9 wt.% NaCl and 1× PBS, respectively. Chloride ions react with the Mg(OH) 2 passive film on the Mg surface to form a more soluble product, MgCl 2 . Dissolution of the Mg(OH) 2 film reduces the protected surface area and exposes a larger active Mg surface to the electrolyte 18 , 35 . Although this process suggests that the highest Mg corrosion rate corresponds to the electrolyte with the highest chloride concentration, the interaction of Mg with the remaining electrolyte constituents should also be considered. Although 0.9 wt.% NaCl and 1× PBS exhibited similar concentrations of chloride ions compared to the concentration observed for 0.1 M MgCl 2 , the Mg corrosion rate in PBS was approximately four-fold lower than that observed in 0.9 wt% NaCl. The presence of phosphate ions may explain the reduced corrosion rate of Mg in 1× PBS. Phosphate ions react with Mg to form a poorly soluble Mg 3 (PO 4 ) 2 product that passivates the Mg electrode surface 21 . It should be noted that a lower corrosion rate is not necessarily desirable because the discharge chemistry relies on the continuous formation and breakdown of passivation on the Mg surface. Consequently, the formation of a poorly soluble Mg 3 (PO 4 ) 2 film may hinder the anodic reaction on the Mg surface. In contrast, the presence of magnesium ions in 0.1 M MgCl 2 may have hindered the dissolution of Mg into the electrolyte solution because a 50% reduction in the corrosion rate was observed with Mg in 0.1 M MgCl 2 compared to that observed in 0.9 wt.% NaCl. However, the measured electrical conductivity, which contributes to the total internal resistance of the electrochemical cell, was highest for 1× PBS and lowest for 0.1 M MgCl 2 , indicating a lower potential drop across the cell when the former electrolyte was utilized. This finding suggests that there exists a design trade-off between solution conductivity and corrosion behavior in electrolyte selection. Magnesium/iron half-cells Uncoated half-cells and electrode size \nIn contrast to conventional battery systems, in which the specific capacity generally increases as the discharge rate is reduced, the Mg electrodes exhibited a parabolic relationship between their discharge rate and specific capacity. The reduced performance at lower discharge rates may be attributed to the pitting nature of Mg. A surface passive film comprising Mg(OH) 2 forms when Mg is immersed in an aqueous solution. Pitting corrosion occurs when the Mg(OH) 2 film is locally disrupted, exposing the active Mg surface. Because Mg(OH) 2 is formed as a reaction product of Mg corrosion, the surface passivation is continually broken down and reformed in pitting zones 18 . When current is drawn from Mg-based batteries, the native passivation is disrupted to initiate battery discharge, as well as corrosion of the anodic material. However, at sufficiently low currents, the rate of Mg(OH) 2 reformation is postulated to exceed the rate of film breakdown, resulting in premature termination of the battery. This effect was experimentally observed by discharging a terminated battery, which had previously been discharged at low current (i.e., 5 µA), at elevated current to rupture the reformed passive film and initiate a second interval of discharge (data not shown). In contrast, when high current is drawn from the Mg-based batteries, excessive breakdown of the surface film enhances surface corrosion of the Mg. The parabolic relationship observed between discharge rate and power is attributed to the increased charge transfer resistance and corresponding voltage decline caused by the accumulation and film formation of Mg(OH) 2 ( Figure 3b ). Furthermore, reduced capacity and power have been observed in batteries at high discharge rates due to the limitations pertaining to ion transport as well as kinetics 2 , 18 . \nThe scalability in performance was investigated with Mg anodes of two sizes. Results indicated that the specific capacity scaled with increasing anodic material, preserving the parabolic trend observed with specific capacity at increasing discharge rates. However, the average discharge power did not scale with increasing anode size because of a voltage drop with larger Mg anodes at higher discharge rates. These findings regarding the scalability of various performance parameters suggest that the surface-area-to-volume ratio may be a critical factor in Mg/Fe battery design. Improving performance with thin PCL coating \nIt was hypothesized that a thin protective coating of a biodegradable polymer (e.g., PCL) could enhance the performance of Mg-based batteries by increasing the mechanical integrity of the surface Mg(OH) 2 film and, in this manner, enable discharge at higher current densities. This effect was experimentally confirmed with PCL dip-coated electrodes in the half-cell configuration. Although the PCL-coated electrodes supported smooth discharge profiles, the less stable behavior observed during the tail end of the discharge lifetime may have been caused by the steady accumulation of Mg(OH) 2 because the polymeric coating may have hindered or slowed down the transport of discharge products from the anode surface. A comparison of the parabolic trend observed for specific capacity and discharge rate supported the proposed hypothesis ( Figure 3g ). Implementation of the PCL coating shifted the parabolic trend towards higher discharge rates. This shift reflected the additional charge transfer resistance imposed by the PCL coating, wherein higher current densities were required to break through the PCL-enforced surface passivation. The thin PCL coating improved the specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the Mg/Fe electrochemical cells without sacrificing performance with respect to discharge power or potential. Because PCL is an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer, these findings suggest that PCL coatings can be exploited in producing Mg-based biodegradable batteries 4 , 15 , 36 . Design trade-offs with electrolyte selection \nAs discussed previously, the design of a biodegradable battery may comprise two general approaches in terms of electrolyte utilization: (i) placing a specified biocompatible electrolyte within a biodegradable electrolyte cell or (ii) using human physiological fluid as the electrolyte. Although electrochemical testing in 0.1 M MgCl 2 supports the former approach, 1× PBS was used to investigate battery performance with physiological solution as the electrolyte. Figure 3j compares the discharge profile in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 1× PBS; as shown, the discharge potential decreased linearly with discharge in PBS. This phenomenon may be attributed to the presence of phosphate ions in PBS, which serves as a pH buffering agent but also reacts with the Mg anode to form an Mg 3 (PO 4 ) 2 passivation layer. The passivation presents additional mass transfer resistance at the anode surface. However, the average discharge potential and average power were comparable between 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 1× PBS. In fact, Figure 3k indicates that PBS supports higher-specific capacities. Consequently, whereas 0.1 M MgCl 2 supports more stable discharge potentials, 1× PBS promoted higher-specific capacities and a longer lifetime for the Mg/Fe half-cells. Figure 3l shows the average powers obtained in 1× PBS and 0.1 M MgCl 2 , which were comparable at a given discharge rate. \nIt is speculated that the buffering capacity of PBS promoted the lifetime and specific capacity of Mg-based battery chemistries because Mg is resistant to breakdown in alkaline environments. Studies have reported the accumulation of a thick white film of precipitated Mg(OH) 2 when the pH exceeds 9. Magnesium becomes resistant to corrosion when the pH exceeds 10.5 because the elevated pH level corresponds to the pH of saturated Mg(OH) 2 20 , 37 . Given that Mg(OH) 2 is a product formed from the oxidation of Mg and its accumulation increases the local pH, the aforementioned effect suggests that the performance of Mg-based batteries may deteriorate or terminate once the electrolyte pH exceeds a critical value indicative of excessive Mg(OH) 2 accumulation. Consequently, the buffering system observed in PBS and physiologically in the body may support enhanced battery performance by stabilizing the electrolyte pH as Mg breaks down because of both battery discharge and parasitic corrosion. The buffering capacity of the 1× PBS was experimentally confirmed. It was hypothesized that higher discharge potentials would be attained in 1× PBS due to its higher electrical conductivity. As shown in Table 2 , the conductivity of 1× PBS was two orders of magnitude greater than that of 0.1 M MgCl 2 , thus reducing solution resistance. However, the average power attained in 1× PBS approximated that in 0.1 M MgCl 2 because the Mg/Fe half-cells demonstrated similar discharge potentials in the two electrolytes. Furthermore, the average power increased significantly at higher current densities (i.e., >330 µA cm −2 ) because of the disintegration of the Mg anode at the electrolyte-air interface. This observation served as another indication, as confirmed by corrosion testing ( Figure 2 ), that Mg is more corrosive in PBS. PCL-coated Mg/Fe full-cells \nFigure 4 demonstrates the superior performance of PCL-coated Mg/Fe batteries in PBS, which sustained a higher and more stable discharge potential than batteries discharged in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 0.9 wt.% NaCl. Interestingly, a linear reduction in discharge potential was observed for PCL-coated batteries in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 0.9 wt.% NaCl, which was not observed in corresponding half-cell experiments with uncoated electrodes. In addition, PCL-coated batteries in PBS achieved the longest discharge lifetime and the highest energy, average power and Coulombic efficiency. These results suggest that the application of the PCL coating in the full-cell configuration, which imposes additional mass transfer resistance attributed to the transport of Mg(OH) 2 , favored PBS as the electrolyte. As mentioned previously, accumulation of the Mg(OH) 2 discharge product is mass-transfer- and pH-dependent. Because of the additional mass transfer resistance of the PCL-coated full-cells, the pH buffer system provided by PBS allowed for superior performance as the battery electrolyte. This enhancement was experimentally confirmed by measurements of the electrolyte pH before and after battery discharge ( Table 3 ). As shown, the pH deviated by less than 0.5 throughout the discharge lifetime of the PCL-coated battery in PBS, whereas the changes in the electrolyte pH for batteries discharged in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 0.9 wt.% NaCl were over five- and seven-fold higher, respectively. It is speculated that the buffering capacity of PBS hindered the precipitation of Mg(OH) 2 , whereas its accumulation during the discharge of the PCL-coated full-cells in 0.1 M MgCl 2 and 0.9 wt.% NaCl may have gradually increased charge transfer resistance, accounting for the linear decline in discharge potential.
