The scientists join a network of 365 current and past Young Investigators who represent some of the best young group leaders contributing to research in Europe and beyond. \n\"We welcome these young scientists to our growing network,\" says Gerlind Wallon, Manager of the Young Investigator Programme. \"The status of Young Investigator offers them recognition and access to a network of their peers in Europe.\" The programme targets researchers under forty years of age who have established their first laboratories in the past four years. \nThis year the programme received 174 applications. Thirteen per cent of the candidates who applied were selected and the new investigators originate from ten countries. \nThe Young Investigators receive a range of benefits, including an award of 15,000 Euros and the opportunity to apply for additional funds to help start their first independent research laboratories. Laboratory management and non-scientific skills training as well as PhD courses offer the young group leaders and their students the chance to develop professional skills. The scientists also receive access to core facilities at EMBL and funding for themselves and their group members to attend conferences. \nThe next application deadline is 1 April 2016.
