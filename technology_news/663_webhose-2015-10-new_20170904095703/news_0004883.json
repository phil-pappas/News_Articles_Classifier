Is the securing of a countervailing point of view often a casualty of the need for space, or the end desire to give only one side of the argument?\" he questioned. \n\"Are some of these emerging media outlets even concerned about accuracy and balance?\" McKenzie further asked. \nBut despite the changes, he said that traditional media have a decided advantage in the areas of balance and fairness. \n\"Established media houses for the most part are expected to provide accurate and balanced information, though there are some notable international exceptions,\" he said. \nMcKenzie was the guest speaker at the 15th staging of the annual Jamaica Broilers Fair Play Awards Tuesday at the Terra Nova All-Suite Hotel in Kingston where TVJ's Nadine McLeod walked away with the first-place trophy and $500,000 for her feature, Business on Back Road. \nSecond place went to The Gleaner's Tameka Gordon, who won a trophy and $300,000 for her piece, NHT Acquires OUTAMENI, while Nationwide and 18 degrees North tied for third place with their respective pieces, Krauck & Anchor chronicle. They both received trophies and $100,000 each. \nAn elated McLeod said she was very surprised, but was grateful as she and her team had put a lot of work into the feature. \nThe competition attracted 30 entries, four from radio, seven from television and 19 from print. Each entrant was required to submit a three-part media report, which was stipulated to encourage media practitioners to complete more substantial reportage and engage in more meaningful follow-up. \nIn his report, chief judge Professor Hopeton Dunn said that many of the submissions were strong and competitive, but there were others that could be described as \"unexceptional\". He pointed to the need for more investigative work and journalistic enterprise along with improved use of language and better quality in sound and visual image. \nHe also encouraged more entries from radio and independent and small media outlets as well as on economics, science, arts and culture, sports.
