This can cause problems for humans whose resources get taken away,” he wrote. \nThis view is not surprising given Mr Hawking’s belief AI’s will one day surpass the human race in intelligence. \n“It’s clearly possible for a something to acquire higher intelligence than its ancestors: we evolved to be smarter than our apelike ancestors, and Einstein was smarter than his parents,” he wrote. \n“If this happens, we may face an intelligence explosion that ultimately results in machines whose intelligence exceeds ours by more than ours exceeds that of snails.” \nHowever, it wasn’t all doom and gloom, Mr Hawking said the last television show that made him laugh out loud was The Big Bang Theory . \nAnd, as for his favourite song? \nIt’s “Have I Told You Lately” by Rod Stewart, of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:54:38.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
