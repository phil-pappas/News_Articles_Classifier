Tulsa, Oklahoma - Thrive15.com founder and current Chief Operating Officer is a man on a mission. His mission to \"mentor millions with a business school experience that is ten time more engaging, practical, and enjoyable than traditional business school at 1% of the cost\" is causing many people to raise their eyebrows. If Thrive15.com fulfills its mission, it has the potential to completely transform the traditional education and business school business models. Clark claims that the transformation has already begun. Clark adds, \"I personally have no issues with formal education or Cornell University, however one of our Thrivers is a Cornell graduate who can speak from experience. He has reported to us time and time again that he is learning more practical business skills such as search engine optimization, sales, management, and leadership in his few months as a Thriver (the term Clark uses to refer to subscribers) than he ever did when on campus at Cornell. And this anecdotal example could be dismissed if it wasn't happening over and over again. People are ready for practical education. Our world is changing at a faster rate than ever before and if you blink you are relevant. Thrive15.com provides the practical on-going education that this fast-changing business climate demands. Learning is no longer an event. Learning is now a never-ending process.\" Although, Clark's goals are lofty there is evidence that may indicate he is correct. Lynda.com recently sold to Linkedin.com after reporting they had nearly 3 million users. TeamTreeHouse.com is teaching the ever-evolving coding and web-development skills missing from most college campuses at a very disruptively low price point. Digital Tutors reportedly has over a million subscribers. Clark believes that Thrive15.com will be the educational game-changer that Steve Jobs envisioned. Clark adds, \"If you do a Google search for \"Steve Jobs, the Lost Interview\" you will find an interview with him in which he explains that the future of education must involve customized learning experiences, real time feedback and passionate teachers capable of engaging their students. I encourage you to listen to Steve's words. Go watch the video. Steve transformed the music industry, the movie industry, the personal computer industry, the personal electronic device industry, and the phone industry. As Thrive15.com grows I believe we are helping one of the world's true visionaries to bring yet another industry transformation to pass. We miss you Steve!\" Quick Facts Thrive15: Thrive15.com provides 15-minute practical online business courses taught by millionaires, mentors, and everyday entrepreneurial success stories.
