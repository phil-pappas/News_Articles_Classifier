Platforms are ready-to-run, integrated systems offering unparalleled performance, analytical power, and cost-effective data storage ANAHEIM, Calif. , Oct. 20,   (Teradata 2015 PARTNERS User Group Conference) -- Teradata (NYSE: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWRHVnlZV1JoZEdFdVkyOXRMMXdpSUhKbGJEMWNJbTV2Wm05c2JHOTNYQ0lnZEdGeVoyVjBQVndpWDJKc1lXNXJYQ0krVkVSRFBDOWhQZz09fA==]]), the big data analytics and marketing applications company, today announced the shipment of two enhanced analytic platforms, the Teradata® Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 and the Teradata® Integrated Big Data Platform 1800. Working together within the Teradata® Unified Data Architecture™, they offer nearly unlimited, cost-effective data storage and analytical power for the most demanding enterprise analytics. Many organizations have unknowingly allowed their data and analytics environments to grow into disparate ecosystems with appliances and point solutions that are not integrated. Without ready-to-run, integrated systems, it takes longer to master the data loading and the execution of a range of analytics to quickly get value. Teradata maximizes customer value by unifying the technology, integrating the data, and offering powerful analytic platforms. \"Teradata analytic platforms are delivered as turn-key, integrated solutions that easily fit within an analytic ecosystem. The platforms are hungry for massive amounts of data and are ready to run a wide range of analytics,\" said Oliver Ratzesberger , president, Teradata Labs. \"Teradata has simplified the deployment and management of its platforms, providing users unparalleled performance and the ability to expand their analytical capability.\" Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 runs the most demanding analytic workloads that require the highest performance, most consistent query response times, and ability to support thousands of concurrent users, hundreds of applications, and massive volumes of data. It is the data warehouse at the core of the Teradata Unified Data Architecture. The overall computational power of the Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse is boosted by 25 percent with the latest technology from the Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2600v3 Family. It offers up to 15 percent faster in-memory processing with the latest DDR4 SDRAM cards with up to 1.5 terabytes of memory per cabinet. To support tactical queries that require sub-second access to frequently used data, the solid state drive (SSD) size is now four times larger and offers up to 128 terabytes of hot data space per cabinet. \"NetApp storage solutions within the Teradata Active EDW 6800 offer extreme performance and efficiency,\" said Joel Reich , executive vice president, Product Operations, NetApp. \"NetApp is dedicated to simplifying the complex world of enterprise data management to help IT organizations reduce cost and complexity, lower risk while increasing control, and adapt quickly in response to change.\" Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 The Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 is available at a cost-effective price of approximately $1,000 per terabyte of compressed data. It enables customers to perform complex analytics at scale on a wide range of big data. Running on the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform, the Teradata Database provides users access to data in many common formats, including XML, name-value pair, and JSON (Java Script Object Notation) data from web applications, sensors, and Internet of Things-connected machines. Technical upgrades to the platform offer organizations faster query execution with the newest technology from the Intel® Xeon® Processor E5-2600v3 Family and high-performance DDR4 SDRAM memory. To enable customers to cost-effectively collect and analyze extremely large amounts of detailed data, the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform comes with larger, four-terabyte storage drives. This allows up to 333 terabytes of uncompressed data in a single cabinet—a 45 percent increase in capacity--and more than 300 petabytes in a system. According to Ratzesberger, \"One Teradata customer reported that they loaded and queried substantially more than 10 petabytes of production data in the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800, within the first month of deployment.\" \"Intel® Xeon® processors provide a high-performance and robust foundation for data analytics,\" said Pat Buddenbaum , general manager, Enterprise IT Solutions, Intel's Data Center Group. \"Through our collaboration with Teradata, we are enabling businesses to unlock the value hidden in their enterprise data and quickly transform it into actionable business insight.\" Integration Software Teradata software tightly integrates the Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 and the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 with the recently announced Teradata Listener™ software. Teradata Listener enables high-volume Internet of Things and JSON data to be ingested into the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform providing data scientists, business analysts, and developers the ability to quickly and easily analyze new data streams. Then, Teradata QueryGrid™ software resident in the Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse allows the data to be dynamically queried for faster answers to business questions. It offers data scientists, business analysts, and developers the ability to quickly and easily analyze new data streams for faster answers to business questions. Without relying on IT for help, users can analyze data from clickstreams, social media feeds, mobile events, IT server logs, sensors, and telematics. Teradata QueryGrid software connects not only the Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 and the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800, but also other Teradata platforms, Hadoop distributions and analytic engines. Teradata QueryGrid offers bi-directional data movement and pushdown processing, which integrates platforms and analytic engines. Customers benefit with seamless self-service access to data and analytic processing across the analytic ecosystem without requiring special tools or IT intervention. Teradata Listener ingests massive volumes of data and pushes the data into the Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse and the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform enabling multiple users to perform real-time analytics. Teradata Listener is an intelligent, automated, and self-service software platform. It continuously captures and stores fast moving, extremely large data sets from hundreds of sources such as clickstreams, social media feeds, mobile events, and the Internet of Things such as IT server logs, sensors, and telematics. The Teradata Active Enterprise Data Warehouse 6800 and the Teradata Integrated Big Data Platform 1800 are now available worldwide. Teradata Listener is now available in beta, and will be generally available globally in the first quarter of 2016.
