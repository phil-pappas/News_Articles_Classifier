However, neither Fallon nor Rogen seemed to know.\nWoz did his best to relate the story in an entirely believable way, but Rogen decided the tale was bunkum.\nWoz was so keen to add details that he forgot to explain that the story was true until Fallon was bidding the audience farewell.\nPerhaps, though, the most amusing part of the segment was Woz explaining that the man wanted to steal a device he'd made that let you make free phone calls.\nFallon chimed in about the robber: \"Was it Bill Gates?\"\nComedy never dies.", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/mG2627ZyLlQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mG2627ZyLlQ"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:53:06.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
