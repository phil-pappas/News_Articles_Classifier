The conference runs through the 28th. CheckAlt LoanPay offers banks and credit unions an alternative way to accept customer loan payments that is faster than an ACH transaction and less expensive than a credit or debit card transaction. The solution can reside on the financial institution’s web or mobile site, as well as their banking platform so payments can be accepted by phone through a call center, or at the branch. CheckAlt LoanPay is a complete package with hosted registration and payment pages, all branded with the financial institution’s logo and corporate colors. Financial institutions can expand their capabilities, extend their footprint and capture market share with CheckAlt’s Mobile Business Capture App – the latest enhancement to CheckAlt’s Business Capture RDC solution. Financial institutions can now empower their business clients to make deposits from everywhere they do business. No more driving check payments collected out in the field back to the main office for scanning and submitting to the bank or credit union. A business’s employees can capture these check images from out in the field using their smart phone and submit them for processing along with the checks scanned through the desktop Business Capture solution. CheckAlt delivers this white-label solution economically and with greater flexibility and customization which means banks and credit unions can attract and retain more high-value business relationships.\n“FinTech innovation is an integral part of CheckAlt’s mission,” stated Shai Stern, CEO & Co-chairman CheckAlt. “We forward our mission every time we partner with a financial institution and deliver these FinTech solutions to help them lower expenses by achieving operational efficiencies and capture market share through expanded capabilities.”\nCheckAlt serves almost 400 US financial institution clients delivering advanced and scalable image item processing that is compatible with all incumbent core systems and white label payment processing solutions to help attract and retain high-value business banking relationships.
