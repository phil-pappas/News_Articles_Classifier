MatterMojo for Office 365 is an affordable cloud-based matter management system which allows law firms to manage clients, matters, inception and risk via a simple but elegant portal. It also has contact and task management and integrates with key document management providers. Lawyers can enjoy all the benefits of Office 365 whilst managing their clients and matters efficiently. \nOffice 365 Groups brings together People, Conversations, Calendars and Files across Office 365. By linking together email conversations, file storage, and calendar event management, Groups create an integrated experience for teams to focus on group activity. Groups can be public to enable information sharing within your company, or private for teams that deal with sensitive subjects. Groups are also an integral part of Outlook 2016 and a number of apps have been released in recent weeks to enable Group collaboration on smartphones. \nThe integration uses MatterMojo’s new Connected App capability to link clients and matters to Groups. Once linked, users can access the Group’s OneDrive file store directly from within MatterMojo, providing native visibility of client and matter documents. This integrated experience will be extended over the coming months to include other Group features such as calendar and conversations, enhancing the collaboration capability even further. \nTim Cheadle, CEO, commented “The idea of a group as a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events where group members can conveniently collaborate and quickly get stuff done fits perfectly with MatterMojo. As a SaaS vendor building in the Microsoft Cloud, we share a common technology platform with Office 365 which allows us to provide fully integrated experiences very quickly”. \nAd Coelum Technology continues to build out its product and in the short term it will be focusing on user requested enhancements, time recording and client collaboration. \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:08:40.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
