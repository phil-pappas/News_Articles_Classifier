Volumes were up 1.7% from August, reflecting the seasonal increase in cargo transportation, which rises in the fall as retailers stock up for holiday shoppers.\nMany retailers and manufacturers built up inventories around the start of the year, fearing that a labor-related slowdown at West Coast ports would drag on. But the ports have been operating normally for months, leaving companies with extra goods in their warehouses, and a reduced need to bring in more cargo by truck or rail.\nCSX Corp., a railroad, said Wednesday it expects rail volumes to continue to fall through the end of the year, and trucking companies are also bracing for weak pricing as demand levels off.\nHowever, some see freight volumes bouncing back as inventories decline toward the end of the year. The pace at which retailers and manufacturers run through stockpiles could increase if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates later this year, raising the cost of holding inventories, the Cass report said.\nWrite to Brian Baskin at brian.baskin@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 14, 2015 13:41 ET (17:41 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:34:28.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
