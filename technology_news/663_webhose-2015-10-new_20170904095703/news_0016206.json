Carpenter, who opposed the application, said that the Mthatha High Court, as a lower court, was superseded by the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals – which had already ruled on the matter and had sentenced the king to 12 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:17:26.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
