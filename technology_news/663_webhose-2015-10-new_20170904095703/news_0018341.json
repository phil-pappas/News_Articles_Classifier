AP Professionals use social media monitoring sites like Geofeedia or Ready Or Not, a free app that develops a heat map based on a user's geolocation tracking data.\nBut AFR Weekend decided to test the seven minute theory with more basic resources. After browsing around Twitter through the hashtag #Sydney one evening, the graphic shows what could be learnt about a woman chosen at random who had left the geo-location tracking on her Twitter account on and had also linked to her Instagram account, which locates her posts down to the house number on the street. It shows how she left clues on where she lived and worked, when she was home alone and when her house was empty.\n\"One thing that's killing people is they're not aware of what their smartphones can and can't do,\" says Marta Gangko, an expert in cyber risk at Deloitte.\n\"People have to start educating themselves, if you have apps running with location tracking enabled, everyone knows where you are. And the nature of businesses and governments collecting as much data as they can these days, means you won't always know where this information is going or what it will be used for.\"\n This is quite separate from Australia's controversial metadata retention laws which come into effect on Tuesday.\nTelecommunications companies will be required to archive the call records, IP addresses and location data of all their customers for up to two years. This information can only be accessed by authorised agencies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and Australian Federal Police.\nSocial media a location giveaway When pressed on internet security, most people are concerned with the safety of their credit card details or maybe their medical records. Questions were raised this week about Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's use of a private email server rather than the protected government network. But few think of the amount of location-based information we share online everyday. The interconnected nature of social media sites (allowing cross-posting and various plug-ins) means it's easy for people to work out where we're posting from and sometimes how often we're there.\n\"We've seen this location-based information used effectively by criminals and outlaw motorbike gangs for intimidation,\" says Beltin Group's Bowden. \"Where they've broken into someone's empty house and left a note.\"\nWhile \"Facebook stalking\" is a colloquial term for perusing somebody's social media accounts to find out more about them, the openness of people's whereabouts on their platforms has lead to serious privacy abuses and genuine stalking.\n\"It happens all the time,\" says Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis of the NSW Police Fraud and Cybercrime Squad. \"We are definitely aware of criminals and people of ill repute using social media to obtain information on individuals and organisations.\"\nAlleged perpetrators of domestic violence are increasingly using Facebook accounts and GPS tracking to locate their victims, sometimes compromising the secrecy of refuge locations .\n\"The thing is, tracking a person via their geo-location tags is not an offence,\" says Detective Superintendent Katsogiannis. \"This is why it's so important people know it exists and it's already built into their mobile devices.\"\nSites and apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram use geolocation metadata, known as GPS tags, in order to offer us different services and targeted ads. Most devices automatically have \"Location Services\" enabled, allowing these social-networking sites and most other apps to pull our longitude and latitude coordinates using a standard website app interface (an API). Once they've got this data, they can pinpoint exactly where we are and this information is shared with advertisers and other organisations.\nDon't be a walking homing beacon Of course, Location Services is what makes so many apps useful. Mapping apps figure out where you are and provide directions. Recommendation apps, like Yelp, offer up nearby restaurants and bars. Uber can send a car to pick you up. It's a useful technology that has made life a lot more convenient. But understanding how companies collect this information and what they use it for is important to protect yourself from being a walking homing beacon or putting yourself in danger, either physically or in the path of hackers.\n\"It's up to you to make a critical judgement,\" says Bowden. \"Within your device's settings you can decide which apps can see your location and which can't. Clear your location data, this means there's not this beautiful catalogue of information other apps could be using to measure your behaviour, habits and key locations.\"\nDeloitte's Ms Gangko says some apps collect our location data with no other purpose than to on-sell to advertisers or other organisations.\n\"Some apps don't need location services to function properly, so maybe turn them off. Most social media platforms and applications have multiple settings to allow you to choose.\" She adds, \"We need to do our own personal due diligence otherwise anyone can get hold of it and in the end it's really on you.\"", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/10oct/seven_minute_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-23/new-technology-threatens-womens-refuge-security/6340020"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:30:58.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
