The transaction was expected to close in the first quarter of next year.\nThe deal includes GE Capital's global Commercial Distribution Finance and Vendor Finance platforms, employing about 3000 people. It also includes part of the Corporate Finance business, which serves companies across the United States and Canada.\n\"Since our April 10 announcement, we've signed more than $US126bn in transactions, which is over 60 per cent of our overall plan, and are on track to become less than 10 per cent of GE's earnings as the company transitions to a more focused digital industrial company,\" Mr Sherin said.\n\"This acquisition is an outstanding opportunity for Wells Fargo to deepen relationships and strengthen our presence in key commercial lending markets,\" Tim Sloan, head of Wells Fargo Wholesale Banking, said in a separate statement.\nIn September, Wells Fargo announced it would buy GE Capital's railcar services, without disclosing the terms of the transaction.\nMr Sherin said that once the transactions have closed and GE Capital's retail finance business, Synchrony Financial, has been split off, GE Capital would seek removal from US regulators' list of systemically important financial institutions, which must hold extra capital because they are deemed \"too big to fail\" without wreaking havoc on the financial system.\nShares in Dow member GE edged up 0.3 per cent in morning trade, while Wells Fargo was flat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:21:01.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
