But he must do more than shift conservatives to the centre | Mark Bahnisch \nThese mobile-based apps allow users to send messages that self-destruct after reading and avoid metadata collection.\nThe Labor leader, Bill Shorten , said he did not use such apps. Shorten called on the prime minister to “voluntarily clear up whether or not” he had used the services to send classified material.\nTurnbull said at a press conference in Sydney on Friday that he does not use a private email account to send classified government information. “The answer is I can’t do it and I wouldn’t do it and I protect classified information very carefully.”\nAll classified information went through the government system, he said. \n\nBut the prime minister has confirmed he did us a non-government account, which he has had for years, for other communications.\nTurnbull said he used a variety of messaging technologies and “you shouldn’t assume that government email services are more secure than private ones”.\nEarlier a spokesman for Turnbull defended the prime minister and said most government correspondence was not subject to sensitive security markings.\n“Many MPs and ministers use private messaging systems – including SMS, WhatsApp, Wickr, etc and private emails etc – for non-sensitive material for reasons of convenience and superior functionality,” the spokesman said.\n“All communications or records of a minister which relate to his or her duties are (subject to many exemptions) potentially subject to [freedom of information] whether it is on SMS, a private email server or a government email server.\n“The majority of government correspondence is routine and of a non-sensitive nature and is therefore not subject to sensitive security markings.”\nThe Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said the prime minister needed to ensure “that any use of technology by him is appropriate and isn’t designed to avoid proper scrutiny”.\nRelated: Turnbull to meet business and union leaders to outline reform agenda \n“We know that Malcolm Turnbull and others in their plotting against Tony Abbott’s prime ministership were using Wickr in order to avoid scrutiny and to make sure those messages disappeared, but we need to be, I think, very careful about this and I think the prime minister should get proper advice,” Albanese said.\n\n“I do believe he has an absolute responsibility to make sure that any technology that he is using for sensitive material, that is national security-related or related at all to his job as prime minister, needs to be done in an appropriate way.”\n\nAsked about his own email use, Albanese said he had a Gmail account “for personal use” but any parliamentary business was “done through the parliamentary system”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:53:21.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
