The company further revealed that the unauthorized access appears to have occurred between late 2013 and early 2014. \nWhile contact information, including names and addresses, were the focus of the hack, social security numbers and other sensitive data – information used to perpetrate identity theft – were also at risk. \n“Consumers have a right to expect that the companies they do business with will keep their information safe from criminals who can use this data to commit identity theft and fraud,” said Cari Laufenberg , a member of Keller Rohrback’s nationally recognized complex litigation group. \nNearly five million Scottrade current and former customers nationwide may have been exposed in the attack.
