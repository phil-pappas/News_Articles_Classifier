Source: Supplied\nA landmark government review into regional telecommunication services has labelled the decision to pay Telstra more than $330 million a year to deliver ­essential telco services to broadband-starved users in the bush as “questionable”.\nThe long-awaited Regional Telecommunications Review said the obligation and funding mechanisms that require Telstra to maintain its ageing copper network in the bush needed a rethink as consumers increasingly dump landline telephones for mobiles and social media messaging apps.\n“The historic nature of the standard telephone services and the accompanying Universal Service Obligation (USO) funding arrangements means it fails to target the areas of greatest need or deal adequately with inequality of outcomes in regional Australia,” the report said.\nUnder the $11 billion deal that Telstra has with the government and NBN to participate in the mammoth infrastructure project, the telco is being paid for up to 20 years to ensure that all Australians have access to a basic phone service — including maintaining its ages-old copper network in the 7 per cent of the nation where the NBN will be provided over fixed wireless and satellite.\nTelstra’s rivals, including Optus and Vodafone, have for years decried the funding mechanism of the USO, saying Telstra financially benefits from the deal and that it should be replaced with a new transparent funding program to tackle the nation’s distorted regional telecommunications market.\nThe review, chaired by former Telstra executive Deena Shiff, agreed in principle, saying the cost effectiveness of the USO agreement was “questionable”.\n“The present standard telephone service is of rapidly declining relevance. Within the next few years the majority of consumers, including those in regional Australia, will not be using voice calls over the PSTN, but will be using mobiles, VoIP and other social media applications, as primary communication method,” the review said.\nIt recommended the federal government, in consultation with industry and consumer groups, should develop a new consumer communication standard for voice and data that would set technology-neutral standards in terms of availability, accessibility, affordability, performance and reliability. “As the NBN rolls out, the universal fixed-access network infrastructure will be fundamentally broadband, not Telstra’s traditional copper network. As a result, voice calls will largely migrate away from Telstra’s network, especially in fibre areas.”\nThe review also recommended that the government should leverage its $29.5bn investment in the $49bn NBN by allowing the company to use its infrastructure in rural and regional areas to ­improve mobile services.\nThe NBN was created to break Telstra’s hold on telecommunications services but the program is only building fixed-line infrastructure, meaning competition for mobile services has been left to the private sector to fight over.\nBut the review said the NBN should be permitted, and resourced, to provide carrier-to-carrier products that could include satellite backhaul, terrestrial backhaul for mobile carriers, and options to support new and niche infrastructure providers.\n“More use can be made of NBN infrastructure in supporting new, niche and existing mobile and wireless operators who wish to offer regional wireless coverage extensions. Although NBN is not a provider of wholesale mobile services, it has taxpayer funded inputs (tower and backhaul in particular) which can assist a range of carriers investing in or upgrading infrastructure in regional Australia,” the review said.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/22/1227579/063013-d891a5c4-788a-11e5-98bf-217dbc548dd3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:27:28.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
