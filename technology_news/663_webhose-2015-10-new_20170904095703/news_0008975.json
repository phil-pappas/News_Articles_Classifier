Glen McCurtayne by Ben Potter Top universities want to set up a new $200 million early-stage commercialisation company to take research from the laboratory bench to the point where it is ready to be packaged up for investors.\nThe talks are being led by Melbourne, Queensland, NSW and Australian National universities. CSIRO, the largest research spender along with the University of Melbourne, is also involved.\nThe company will be launched next year and could eventually be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. It is intended to be available across the Group of Eight longest established universities.\nThe initiative follows a series of bumper sales of university-generated technology companies over the past year that have boosted confidence in the value of university intellectual property (IP) in Australia.\n\"It's an early-stage commercialisation fund based around intellectual property generated by the universities – and doing it at scale,\" said one university commercialisation chief.\nIt dovetails with the Turnbull government's determination to get a bigger bang for taxpayers' $9.7 billion annual investment in research and boost the nation's hitherto poor record in innovation, commercialisation and collaboration between research and industry.\nPay and promotions in spotlight In parallel, universities are looking at the thorny issue of how they can change the pay and promotions structures for academics to shift the incentives from publishing to having a beneficial commercial or social impact.\n In the past 18 months Spinifex Pharma – a pain management company spawned by the University of Queensland – has been sold for up to $US700 million to Novartis, headlice treatment group Hatchtech has been sold for $279 million and drug developer Fibrotech for up to $500 million.\nBrandon Capital's Medical Research Commercialisation Fund, which backed these companies, has since closed a new $200 million fund. Last month Blackbird Ventures raised $200 million from investors including First State Super and Hostplus.\nThese successes have boosted interest in commercialisation of research. A similar group of investment managers and funds could be targeted for the universities' commercialisation company.\nThe talks are still at an early stage. The company could be based on IP Group plc, a London Stock Exchange-listed listed company that develops ideas from 12 partner universities into fledgling businesses.\n\"Preferential access to university IP has been demonstrated to be something you can take to the public market. Why wouldn't you do that here?\" said one source.\nThe new company would aim to bridge the \"valley of death\" between the laboratory benchtop and venture capital fund investors.\nThis is the stage at which many Australian inventions founder because the local innovation \"ecosystem\" lacks the breadth and depth of established innovation systems of Silicon Valley, Boston and Israel.\nAs well as money, the company would crucially offer chief executive, chief financial officer and chief technology expertise to fill the vacuum in management at many embryonic firms.\nThe need to do more so-called \"translational\" research – to get ideas across the \"valley of death\" to the point where the market can take over – was stressed at the Prime Minister's innovation round table last Friday.\n\"We all have a common objective – to see a better translation of research,\" said Doron Ben-Meir, director of research, innovation and commercialisation at the University of Melbourne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:15:10.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
