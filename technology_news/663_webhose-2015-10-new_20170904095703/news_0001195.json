We are thankful for the trust and cooperation we get from Maersk and MSC.” \nThe call represents the dawn of a new era for East Asian imports to Israel – Israel’s largest and most important trade route aside from Western Europe. \nAccording to the Israel Shipping & Ports Authority, imports will total more than 200,000 containers annually once the 2M Alliance’s ships begin to call at Haifa Port on a weekly basis. \nMendi Zaltzman concluded: “I am satisfied by our efficiency today, dealing with such a big vessel, and I am sure that this cooperation between us and the 2M will expand in the near future.” \nView a birdseye video of Haifa Port unloading the Gustav Maersk below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:54:32.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
