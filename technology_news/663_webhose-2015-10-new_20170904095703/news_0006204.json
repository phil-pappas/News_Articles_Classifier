That’s why last year he started McCauley Labs out of Livermore. His self-funded lab is currently working on creating virtual reality, VR, technology that is able to track a person in a room — telling where they are with high precision — without having to use an expensive camera. Jack McCauley, one of the co-founders of Oculus VR, is now working on his own VR… more Vicki Thompson Get the business news you need to start the day with SVBJ's free Morning Edition email. McCauley sat down with the Business Journal Thursday at the third annual C2SV — Creative Convergence Silicon Valley — music and technology conference in downtown San Jose. He talked about everything from the future of virtual reality to his work advising students on their product ideas as the “Innovator in Residence” at the college of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. McCauley joined Oculus VR in 2012, before the company was purchased by Facebook Inc. for $2 billion in 2014, and headed up engineering for a time while also helping to create the Oculus DK1 and DK2 headsets. He’s also created the guitars and drums for the Guitar Hero video game series and did work for Electronics Arts Inc. and Microsoft Corp. “(Working at Oculus was) a good experience for me, but I wanted to start my own thing,” he said. At his innovation and research facility, which is small for now with just a staff of four, he wants to incubate various ideas. Right now, the lab is focused on virtual reality, specifically on tracking. McCauley is mostly tight-lipped for now, but he says to look out for announcements from his lab in the near future. “We’ll be running an experiment soon and will video tape it in ultra slow movement,” he said. Future of VR and AR The future of content on VR devices — which replicates an environment that simulates a physical presence in real places — is totally wide open right now, McCauley said. Artificial reality, which provides live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such like video or graphics, is also open to all sorts of experiences, he said. For example, you could play chess on a virtual set or conduct a meeting with people in 3-D virtual form. “Keeping people entertained is just part of it,” he said. Just this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit that the social media company is dabbling in augmented reality, but that it’s a bit further out, TechCrunch reported . The newest version of Oculus Rift ships in the first quarter of 2016 . Mentoring at U.C. Berkeley In his recent work at Berkeley, his alma mater, McCauley liked working with students in the engineering department. He helps them develop pitches, find the right people to pitch ideas to and even help tinker with making their prototypes work. “I didn’t know I would (enjoy it) since I’m not an educator,” said McCauley, who said one word of wisdom he got on teaching was to criticize the things the students work on, not the person. There’s a VR club at Berkeley, too, that he said he might “use their brains” for future projects.
