The deal also covers Etihad's eight partner airlines in which it has bought minority stakes.\n\"We want to invest in innovation,\" Etihad's Chief Information and Technology Officer Robert Webb said in an interview. \"We want technology to be pervasive throughout the business.\"\nGovernment-owned Etihad signed the deal with IBM following a string of similar agreements with suppliers, such as Sabre Holdings Corp., SAP SE and Panasonic Avionics Corp., Mr. Webb said. The airline has negotiated products and services for all the carriers in which it holds minority stakes to cut costs, he added.\nEtihad has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years by purchasing minority stakes in other airlines and supporting their financing needs. To date, it has made non-controlling investments in eight airlines, including Italy's Alitalia, Germany's Air Berlin PLC and Jet Airways (India) Ltd.\nIBM signed a similar deal with Deutsche Lufthansa AG in November last year worth EUR1 billion ($1.14 billion), which the German airline said would generate cost savings of EUR70 million a year.\n\"This is a movement across the industry,\" said Martin Jetter, senior vice president at IBM Global Technology Services. \"You need an IT infrastructure that's available around the world and the applications and technology that allow the airline to find out the preferences of their guests.\"\nWrite to Rory Jones at rory.jones@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"NIRI Demo Co\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014\n 13, 2015 06:49 ET (10:49 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:21:44.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
