FRISTERS stands for Friends and Sisters, and is dedicated to helping teen moms through a challenging time in their life and to direct them and their children towards self-sufficient and productive lives.” Every year over 400,000 teenagers give birth in the United States. Knowing that teen pregnancy is a significant issue within the San Joaquin Valley, Orchard Bible Fellowship is very excited to open its doors to FRISTERS, and ultimately to young mothers and children, providing help and support. FRISTERS is an organization that offers a place of safety, community, help, and hope to teenagers who have chosen to parent. Through a unique curriculum designed to suit their specific needs, young moms are given the opportunity to grow to become the best women and the best mothers they can be. FRISTERS also offers an early childhood education program for their children to help them prepare for kindergarten and life. Since its inception, FRISTERS has helped hundreds of young women graduate from high school, enroll in college and vocational training schools, get drivers’ licenses, find employment, get off of welfare, and become loving, caring, responsible parents and role models to their children. If you know of a teen mother in need, please urge her to contact FRISTERS president and founder, Ali Woodard, or any of her wonderful staff at 949-387-7889 or info(at)fristers(dot)org.
