The British government said it wants permanent changes, but fundamental changes to the bloc require treaty changes and therefore unanimous agreement of the 28 member states.\nMr Cameron hopes soon to move those discussions to the political level and with a wider number of players ahead of a substantial discussions at the EU summit in December, a British official said.\nBut the prime minister is facing mounting frustration in Paris, Berlin, Brussels and elsewhere at his lack of detail. So far, he has laid out only four broad areas, including competitiveness, immigration and welfare, sovereignty and economic governance.\nEuropean officials say it is impossible to move ahead with negotiating overhauls to Europe until the British government lays out its demands precisely.\nManfred Weber, a German member of the EU parliament, said officials don't know in detail what the British want out of the renegotiation. \"We know the headlines but we don't know the content,\" Mr Weber said.\nWhile Mr Cameron has found support in Europe for some of the broad ideas he has put forward, some countries -- including Germany and France -- have set limits on what they would agree to, such as curtailing the free movement of EU citizens.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met with Mr Cameron at his country retreat last week, told her parliament on Thursday that she was optimistic a solution could be found to keep Britain in the EU but that the principles of free movement and non-discrimination are \"non-negotiable.\"\nOfficials in France are concerned that if the UK is slow to make its proposals, a referendum could fall at an awkward moment in various European countries, in particular in France, where Presidential elections are due in May 2017. If Britain's debate on welfare benefits for non-nationals spills over into other European countries, it could call into question the fundamentals of EU treaties and fuel anti-European parties such as France's National Front.\nThere is also concern that Mr Cameron might add to his demands as he goes along and so officials would like one exhaustive list, a Belgian diplomat said.\nMr Cameron has struggled to get his EU renegotiation on the summit agenda, where officials are due to focus on pressing issues facing Europe, including its refugee crisis, conflict in Syria and talks between Russia and Ukraine. The discussion about Mr Cameron's renegotiation efforts isn't expected to be lengthy, according to an EU diplomat.\nMr Cameron recently told The Wall Street Journal that the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe from the Middle East and Africa made it more challenging for him to make the case for staying in the EU to the British people, who were watching waves of refugees and other migrants arrive in Europe from Syria and elsewhere with concern.\nSome politicians in Germany and elsewhere have expressed concern that the crisis was preventing Cameron from making his case for reform and his opting out of an EU plan to relocate migrants across Europe was eroding political goodwill.\nThe prime minister is due to have lunch with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of the summit, where the pair will discuss Mr Cameron's demands and the state of play with the technical talks. The prime minister is also due to meet with Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, Thursday.\n\"I can't say that huge progress has been achieved, I can't say that nothing has been achieved,\" Mr Juncker told the European Parliament Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:48:44.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
