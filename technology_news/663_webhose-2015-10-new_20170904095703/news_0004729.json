Capra Consulting Group, Inc. \nCHICAGO -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- W. Capra is extremely excited with the success of the 2015 NACS Show and the ongoing impact it is having on the Convenience and Fuel Retail industry. Through 15 years of involvement and investment, W. Capra continues to see its impact expand through sharing its insights and experiences in educational sessions, driving meaningful conversations on the expo floor with retailers and suppliers, and providing executive level guidance at the Technology Edge Solutions Center. As the industry progresses through a technological transformation, W. Capra will continue to position itself as an advocate for all players. \nW. Capra team member highlights from the 2015 NACS Show include: At the “Mobile Payment Solutions” workshop Doug Rodewald pointed to the success of early adopter convenience retailers saying, “this is proof mobile payment can explode.” Attendees at this session were urged to focus their mobile commerce efforts on the customer experience when considering mobile payments. During the “Payments Technology Deep Dive” session, Terry Mahoney and Jim DuBoyce shared results from a recent survey they took where over 50% of respondents believed mobile payments will account for 20% of all retail payment transactions by 2020. In the same survey, retailers acknowledged that the EMV road is a long one – only about a third responding say they will have EMV capabilities at the dispensers by October 2017. In the “Is That A Smart Promotion?” session Ed Collupy, a former retailer, said many small-to-midsized convenience store operators struggle with assessing data coming from their POS systems. “The challenge is … turning data into action” and told the story of a 60 store retailer who did just that. He also shared during the “Power and Influence at Work” session his approach as an IT leader to get thoughts across in a meaningful and influential way in order to walk away with commitment. \nFor more information on W.
