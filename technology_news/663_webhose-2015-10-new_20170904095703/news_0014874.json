As a result, PTC plans to complete its new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by year's end.\nTranslarna is PTC Therapeutics' lead product candidate and has conditional marketing authorization in the European Union.\nMuscular dystrophy is an umbrella term for more than 30 inherited diseases that cause muscles to weaken and wither away, and that currently have no cure. Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, which are mostly boys and young men, can lose their ability to walk as young as 7 years old, and breathing and pumping blood worsen over time.\nThe New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company said overall data in the 48-week study demonstrated the ability of the treatment to slow the progression of a form of the disease, known as nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely halts the synthesis of an essential protein, PTC said.\nIn the overall study population of 228 patients between the ages of 7 and 16, patients that received Translarna showed a 15-meter benefit over a placebo in a test that measures how much ground a patient can cover in six minutes—a traditional standard to determine the effectiveness of muscular-dystrophy drugs. PTC said the benefit wasn't statistically significant.\nIn a pre-specified patient population of patients with a 6-minute walk distance of 300 meters to 400 meters, PTC Therapeutics said Translarna provided a highly significant benefit of 47 meters versus a placebo. The company said the result was in line with its experience in an earlier study.\nTranslarna also showed a benefit over a placebo in secondary and tertiary study goals, including improved performance on a number of timed tests of ambulatory functions.\nThe company said that 97% of the patients that completed the late-stage study enrolled in an extension study.\nTranslarna has U.S. Food and Drug Administration orphan drug status as a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy treatments from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. are further along in their efforts to receive U.S. regulatory approval.\nAn FDA advisory panel is set to review BioMarin's new drug application for its treatment—called Drisapersen—on Nov. 24. Sarepta said an FDA advisory panel is tentatively set to review its application for its treatment—eteplirsen—on Jan. 22.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 16:45 ET (20:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:23:46.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
