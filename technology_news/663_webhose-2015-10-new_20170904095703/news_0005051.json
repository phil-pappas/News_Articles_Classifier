We don’t do that anymore,” said Maureen Ciarniello, the Vancouver school board’s associate superintendent of learning services. “If you talk (about that) with little kids or teenagers, they’ll just look at you really oddly because that isn’t part of their lexicon at all. They don’t think about ‘Now I’ll do this, now I won’t.’ Technology is in every bit of their lives, and it’s in most of our lives too.” \nIn Peter Ritchie’s Grade 6/7 class at Homma elementary in Richmond, technology is just part of the routine. There are two computers — an Apple laptop and an Apple desktop — and a smart board that are used every day. \nThe school also has a portable “iPad cart” that contains 30 iPads shared on a schedule. When Ritchie’s class has the iPads, the students can use them for almost any subject. \nWhen The Sun visited, the students were using the iPads for language arts. They were given an assignment to first read a section of the book A Wrinkle in Time, then use an app of their choice to create a prediction of what they think the book is about, using evidence from their reading. They were to talk about characters, setting, plot, mood, conflict and other elements of the story. \nOne pair of students chose to make an iMovie. Within a few minutes, they laid out a storyboard and began to fill in some screens with words, graphics, music and ideas. Other students were using an app called “popplet” to draw a “mind map” illustrating various themes of the book. The program allows students to create various boxes with connections between them (similar to a family tree) and then add photos and text to the boxes and visual touches such as colour-coding. \nOne boy created a box for Meg, a character in the book, and added another box with her unique characteristics — she was bullied but she bullied others, and she is smart. Her brothers had their own boxes, but were joined with another that showed their commonalities — both boys like sports, for example. “These apps allow students to show their learning in many different ways,” said Ritchie, who is working on his master’s degree in technology and curriculum. \nOne boy showed how the iPad could be used for math in a game where students matched fractions, percentages and decimals to create pairs with equal values. Ritchie said he often shares ideas with other teachers on Twitter, a collaboration he called “the best Pro-D I’ve found.” \nRitchie also uses Fresh Grade, a software program that connects students, parents and teachers so they can share samples of work, comments and grades. He said it’s a tool designed so kids can no longer say “nothing” to the classic parental question of “What did you do at school today?” \nWhen parents have already had the opportunity to see an iMovie their child made, or view the results of their math test, the conversation already has a starting point. \n“The goal is more of an enriched conversation,” Ritchie said. \nChris Loat, a teacher consultant for technology integration in Richmond, says the iPad is becoming a really useful tool in the classroom, especially because kids have different learning styles. He was recently at a school where students created a slide show about the human brain narrated by students recording their own voices. One boy created an impressive slide show and the teacher was “amazed” because the boy was reading three grades below his grade level and she would never have known how much he knew about the brain if he had to write it out or take a written test. But verbally, he was able to show he had learned a lot about the subject. \nLoat has formed a mentoring program so teachers who are the go-to technology person in schools now have a formalized network in which to find solutions and get ideas. There are now 81 technology mentors in Richmond. \nAt Pacific Heights elementary in South Surrey, Jeff Unruh teaches a Grade 6/7 class in which he uses technology when it helps the students and makes learning more fun, but never just for the sake of using technology. \nWhen The Sun visited, Unruh’s class used a technology that allows an instant scan of what students have learned, using an iPad that collects and collates the answers. Unruh knows right away if the students are getting it, even to the point that the iPad scanner can provide real-time graphical evidence (such as a bar chart projected on a smart board) that shows how many students get a question right. \nUnruh read the children a story, The Giving Tree, and then students answered questions by holding a symbol up a certain way. Each symbol was different, so there was no copying each other. The iPad at the front of the class scans the symbols and, voila, the evidence is there. \n“It’s something that’s a little different and makes it a little fun,” Unruh said. “I pick and choose when I want to use technology and I don’t use it all the time. This is all about how kids will learn best.” \nUnruh’s school has six classrooms with smart boards, as well as a laptop cart and an iPad cart. This year, the school decided to distribute the iPads, placing a few in each class, so they can have them full-time. \n“Surrey is really technologically forward-looking,” Unruh said. “They want to make sure the tools are there.” \nSome of the technology is paid for by the district, while some of it is funded by the Parent Advisory Committee. The PAC bought the smart boards. \nAfter a pop quiz about The Giving Tree, Unruh asked the students to write an entry on their class blog, which is only accessible to students in the class. They were to write 150 words and then read somebody else’s entry and leave a “constructive” comment. \n“As soon as they realize somebody else will be reading it, they spend more time editing and revising what they write,” Unruh said. \nAlthough the blog entry is on a standard template, one girl changed the header on her blog, using a fancy script. Unruh noticed and asked how she did it. “What’s fun for me is when the kids take the initiative and do something that I didn’t ask for,” he said. \nUnruh said working with technological tools can help students learn problem solving, how to work in teams, and other skills that aren’t always associated with using computers. \n“I’m definitely very techy, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of my educational program,” Unruh said. “We do things because kids are having fun with learning.” \nThere is plenty of evidence of traditional learning in the classroom, too — handwritten newspapers introduce each student to the classroom and there are math questions written out and solved on the white board. \nA boy in the class showed how to use a tool called Makey Makey, an electrical building system that allows kids to wire up a contraption that can do things like play the piano on the computer. \n“The kids love to tinker and build stuff and take stuff apart,” Unruh said, adding he brought in old computers and PlayStations to let the kids take them apart. “I give them screwdrivers and they explore. Sometimes, they stay in at recess and lunch to do it.” \nOne boy talked about using the electrical building system LittleBits to create a robot tank, a project he worked on with a team of students last year. LittleBits is a bit like Lego, but it contains magnets and electrical connections so students can dream up their own creations. \nStudents in Grade 11 and 12 at Templeton secondary in Vancouver are taking similar skills to a whole other level in a program that focuses specifically on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. \nWhen The Sun visited, students in Grade 11 were learning how to program an arduino — a gadget that can collect information or send out signals — to make an LED blink. Students in Grade 12 were working on building a system using an arduino that would collect data from a rocket they’re going to launch. \nThe gadget will measure the outside temperature when the rocket is in the air, the acceleration of the rocket, and the pressure in the atmosphere. \nGrade 12 student Kenneth Tubungbanua was using a soldering iron to connect wires to the arduino. Every student used a laptop, either to supplement the learning about programming or to test the device. One group of students displayed a computer they had taken apart and rebuilt in a cardboard box because it was lighter and took up less room than the tower it was initially housed in. The tower was too clunky to fit the project they were working on, so they came up with a Plan B. \nTempleton principal Aaron Davis said the east-side school has been the beneficiary of many private donations that have helped fund the purchase of computers and software. They also benefited from money raised when the school was used as a film set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:18:46.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
