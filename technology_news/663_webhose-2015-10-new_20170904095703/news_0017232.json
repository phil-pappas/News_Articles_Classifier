Every salesperson has an option to visit a customer face to face or simply have a web video conference meeting to save all parties the expense and frustration with travel. In some situations a customer will prefer to meet in a virtual environment because face-to-face is not always realistic with demanding schedules pressed for time, they are bounded by geographic constraints, and still demand a professional salesperson to offer the same attention to detail with a high level of customer service. But, are sales teams up to the challenge of adapting to new skills with the latest technology?\nAccording to Doug Devitre , Author of Screen to Screen Selling: How to Increase Sales, Productivity, and the Customer Experience With the Latest Technology (McGraw Hill Professional Education, October 2015) \"Sales organizations need to look at the customer experience and find more efficient ways and create value for their customers. This involves making the transition from verbal conversations to a more visually stimulating dialogue with technology as the strategic lever. Before an organization can train on new skill sets, sales management must adopt a new mind set as to what is really in the best interests for the customer.\"\nDevitre's new book promises to boost sales performance and the customer experience—without being physically present, choose the right technology for the right job/budget and prepare the best visuals for every transaction, every client, every time a connection is made. Sales leaders will be able to visually demonstrate value in a way that makes them stand out from the competition or conduct meetings, train employees, coach teams, and give presentations that captivate audiences—and seal the deal every time.\nCopies of Screen to Screen Selling are now available on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, 800-CEO-Read, McGraw Hill Professional Education and other popular retail distribution channels. Devitre will be appearing in person for book signings at the C-Suite Conference Ritz Carlton San Francisco Sunday November 1st and the Barnes and Noble West County Mall St. Louis location Thursday October 29th .\n\"We can either embrace a customer-friendly environment with technology or get passed up by someone that does\" says Devitre. This step-by-step manuscript is accompanied with a multichannel mobile responsive learning experience that includes checklists , videos, and templates to jumpstart beginners and give digital natives the competitive edge. \"Time is of the essence in today's competitive environment. By the time someone makes a roundtrip flight their competitor has already had 10 meetings with similar customers and had dinner with their family at home.\"\nDoes face-to-face still work? Absolutely. But it may not be worth sacrificing unnecessary travel when the customer prefers expertise Screen to Screen.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/doug-devitre/screen-to-screen-selling/prweb13001793.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://linkedin.com/in/dougdevitre", "http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/calendar/488092", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/doug-devitre/screen-to-screen-selling/prweb13001793.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/007184788X", "http://conference.c-suitenetwork.com/", "http://screentoscreenselling.com/toc"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:33:06.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
