Bloomberg Optus marketing and product managing director Vicki Brady said Netflix had proven to be hugely popular with customers. Where the telco giant had spent several quarters losing subscribers until late 2014, this turned into positive growth thanks to the launch of cheaper unlimited broadband plans and free bundled content .\n\"You can't deny that SVOD [streaming video on demand] services are having a dramatic impact on behaviour in Australia … and changing the game in entertainment,\" she said. \"For our total broadband traffic growth between the start of April … we've had a 50 per cent increase in broadband traffic on our fixed-line network.\n'Amazing demand' \"That goes to the point that there's an amazing demand from customers – particularly when you give them unlimited [data allowances] combined with the wonderful streaming services.\"\n Optus is also likely to repeat its previous offer of providing new mobile customers with free Netflix subscriptions in an effort to entice customers from Telstra and Vodafone Australia.\nBut it won't be alone – Telstra on Thursday night will launch its own TV offering with a range of streaming video applications .\nAs first reported by Fairfax Media, Optus and Cricket Australia are actively negotiating digital broadcast rights that would give customers access to matches.\nMs Brady declined to comment on those talks but said sports content would be a key part of Optus' push to offer customers a total entertainment package.\n\"[Optus chief executive Allen Lew] has talked very publicly about the need to have a portfolio of content and clearly in the Australian context, sport matters,\" she said. \"If we're going to be relevant and really make a difference for Australian consumers, then absolutely sporting content is going to be a part of that.\"\nRising competition Optus has about 1.03 million fixed-line broadband subscribers, which makes it third behind Telstra with 3.1 million and TPG with 1.8 million . It is also facing rising competition from M2 Group as the company attempts to merge with Vocus Communications and become Australia's fourth-largest telecommunications company.\nBut the SingTel-owned company hopes its ownership of Australia's second-biggest mobile network will help it appear more enticing than rivals who are forced to resell mobile services such as TPG and M2.\n\"If you look at the decisions customers are making, mobile and home services combined are increasingly important to customers who just want to make it simple with one provider,\" she said. \"Content is shifting and I want to be able to watch it at home and when I'm out.\n\"We've talked about convergence in the market for more than a decade but we're starting to see customers see the benefit now.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-launches-roku-to-take-on-apple-and-google-20150727-giltvh.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/tpg-found-david-teoh-has-warned-he-will-keep-building-his-nbn-rival-network-20150922-gjs7tr.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:23:54.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
