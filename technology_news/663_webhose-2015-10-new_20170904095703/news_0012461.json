Comment \nThe O’Reilly Design Conference is just a few short months away, and we’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be hosting a Startup Showcase . \nWe’re seeking design startups that want to pitch judges and attendees — a broad selection of venture capitalists, leaders, and innovators from the investment and design communities. Successful applicants will receive free space in the exhibit hall at the Design Conference. Onsite, a panel of judges will vote for the best in show — winners will be announced on the keynote stage and will be featured in a post on oreilly.com . \nStartup requirements include: Must be early stage, under three years. Your product should not yet be launched but within view of shipping an early version, or you may bring a fairly polished prototype (you can’t show up with a laptop displaying a 3D rendering). Your startup must be pre-Series A. Your product must be scalable, repeatable — i.e., not a consultancy. \nOur stellar review panel includes John Maeda of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers; Irene Au of Khosla Ventures; Enrique Allen of Designer Fund; and many others you will recognize. Step up and tell us why your startup should be a part of the O’Reilly Design Conference. \nSubmissions are open through Monday November 16 — apply now .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:28:10.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
