Universal Pictures \nThis isn't a documentary. Filmmakers often sacrifice historic accuracy for the sake of story, and \"Steve Jobs\" is no exception. Sorkin and Doyle created conversations, situations and narratives that didn't actually happen. Sorkin, faced with questions from a technorati audience in Silicon Valley -- including people who knew Jobs -- defended his artistic choices, saying journalists who followed the company \"have an obligation to be objective. I have an obligation to be subjective.\" \nAnd so the story Sorkin and Boyle tell is one about an impatient, uncompromising man who was unflinching when it came to using and dismissing people as he went about trying to change the world. What's missing is the story about why he felt he was the one to change it and how he went about doing it. \nThe filmmakers deserve credit for an inventive storytelling approach that takes you behind-the-scenes as Jobs, known for creating a cult of secrecy at Apple, prepares to introduce three important products to the world. You don't actually need to watch him launch the Mac, NeXT workstation or iMac computer. Those events can be found on YouTube. Instead, the movie makers present a kind of revisionist history to what was happening backstage. \nConsider this exchange between Jobs, played ably by Michael Fassbender, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. \n\"What do you do?\" asks Woz, portrayed by Seth Rogen, under a lot of hair. \"You're not an engineer. You're not a designer. You can't put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen. So how come, 10 times in a day, I read Steve Jobs is a genius. What do you do?\" \nJobs' response: \"Musicians play their instruments. I play the orchestra.\" \nOr the scene right before the Mac is introduced in 1984. In one of the funniest moments in the movie, Jobs threatens Mac software engineer Andy Hertzfeld to get the Mac's voice demo (\"Hello, I'm Macintosh\") working a few minutes before they're set to unveil it. \n\"Fix it? We're not a pit crew at Daytona,\" sputters Hertzfeld, played by a likable Michael Stuhlbarg. \"It can't be fixed in seconds.\" \n\"You didn't have seconds. You had three weeks,\" Jobs snaps back. \"The universe was created in a third of that time.\" \n\"Well, some day you'll have to tell us how you did it,\" Hertzfeld cheekily replies. \nA nice zinger. But like I said, these and other \"Sorkinisms\" were made up. Sorkin says he used Walter Isaacson's 2011 authorized biography of Jobs as his \"inspiration\" and said he spoke to all of the people portrayed in the film, except of course with Jobs, who died in 2011 at the age of 56. \nThe real Hertzfeld said last week the film is \"a fine movie, brilliantly written and performed and full of humor and feeling,\" but it's not, you know, actually true to life. \n\"It deviates from reality everywhere -- almost nothing in it is like it really happened,\" Hertzfeld told Recode . \"But ultimately that doesn't matter that much. The purpose of the film is to entertain, inspire and move the audience, not to portray reality. It is cavalier about the facts but aspires to explore and expose the deeper truths behind Steve's unusual personality and behavior, and it often but not always succeeds at that.\" \nAnd so, if you know the source material, like some of us us in the tech press do, the scenes where the film \"not always succeeds\" come to the fore. Maybe it's because we've spent our careers trying to uncover the truth. Maybe we're just too familiar with real history to tolerate the revisionist variety. Or maybe because the relationships Sorkin focused on don't seem to be the most compelling threads to the Jobs narrative. They include Jobs' tortured relationship with his oldest daughter, Lisa Brennan Jobs, whose paternity the famous technologist once disputed, and his falling out with former Apple CEO John Sculley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:46:47.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
