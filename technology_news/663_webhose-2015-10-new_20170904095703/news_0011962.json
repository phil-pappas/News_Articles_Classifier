A strain gauge for piezo actuators is an add-on used to ensure linearization of displacement response and compensate for creep and hysteresis. The strain gauge can be fitted to plate and ring piezo actuators, and a version for piezo benders will follow.\nKvistgaard, Denmark, October 21, 2015 --( PR.com )-- A plug-and-play solution\nThe strain gauge provides feedback used to ensure linear displacement response and to compensate for creep and hysteresis. This enables a highly accurate and repeatable motion vital for nano- and micropositioning and many other types of applications. The strain gauge is fitted directly to the individual piezo actuator and can be applied to both plate and ring piezo actuators, single and stacked. Cedric Goueffon, Global Sales Manager at Noliac, explains:\n\"Many customers have contacted us about the possibility of adding a strain gauge to the actuators as an add-on. Therefore, we are happy to announce that we now offer a full package. We have developed this plug-and-play solution saving the customers the trouble of having the actuator fitted with a strain gauge elsewhere. To start with, we offer the strain gauge for piezo plate and ring actuators, single and stacked, and a version for piezo plate and ring benders will be launched later. The strain gauge for plate and ring actuators can be ordered now,\" Cedric Goueffon ends.\nRead more about the strain gauges for piezo actuators on http://www.noliac.com/products/actuators/options/strain-gauge/\nOptions to fit customer requests\nNoliac is always looking for ways to accommodate customer requests. Therefore, Noliac provides a list of options that can be applied to the actuators to ensure a perfect match for specific applications:\nEnd pieces (steel top pieces and ceramic end plates)\nWiring options (different wiring options for the specific product type)\nUltra-high vacuum (piezo actuators in versions specially designed for ultra-high vacuum)\nParallelism (parallelism with high accuracy for actuator plate and ring stacks)\nBender holder (a plug-and-play holder for bender plates)\nConnector (enables a direct plug of the actuator to a print circuit board)\nMore information\nMore information about the strain gauge or other options, can be please contact us using the Request for Quote: form or contact sales at http://www.noliac.com/contact/", "external_links": ["http://www.noliac.com/products/actuators/options/strain-gauge/", "http://www.noliac.com/contact/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:49:13.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
