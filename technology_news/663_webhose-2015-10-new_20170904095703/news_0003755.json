These intelligent forms enable subscribers to create complex legal documents quickly and accurately by guiding users through a simple interview “wizard,” then automatically assemble customized finished documents based on the answers provided. This service ensures compliance, increases accuracy and reduces costs in the production of critical documents and forms. James Publishing’s offerings will initially cover a range of estate planning documents, but will expand to other practice areas such as business law, litigation, and family law and into additional jurisdictions.\n“We are very excited to start offering our premier legal content in the most flexible and user accessible method possible with the HotDocs Market” says Laila Barada, Director of Operations at James Publishing. “We look forward to adding more titles from our vast legal library on HotDocs Market in the coming months. HotDocs Market provides the most flexible and user accessible method possible for distributing our content in the cloud.”\nJonathan Hoy, Director – Publishing Partnerships at HotDocs, said: “We are thrilled with the addition of James Publishing as the newest member of our growing family of HotDocs Market publishers. The popularity of HotDocs Market continues to grow; in just a little over seven months, our users have assembled over 60,000 documents on the platform. We anticipate that will only continue to increase thanks to the inclusion of James Publishing's forms.”\nAbout HotDocs\nHotDocs is the global leader of automated document assembly technology, with customers in 42 different countries and a user-base, globally, that exceeds one million end users.
