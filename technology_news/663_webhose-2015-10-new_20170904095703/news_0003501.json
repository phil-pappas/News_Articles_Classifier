Photo: Tim Watters/Sea Shepherd\nA legal case is being revived against Japanese whaling in Australian Antarctic waters, with a claim that the whalers stand in contempt of the Federal Court.\nAs the whaling fleet prepares to go south again this summer, Humane Society International has won the right to pursue the contempt action and has served a writ on the whaling fleet's head office in Tokyo.\n\"HSI is proud to have brought this case to draw attention to the shameful legacy of whaling, which is continuing today,\" director Michael Kennedy said.\nSanctuary: where Australia claims whales are fully protected. Photo: Environment Department\n\"This time around, it's a criminal case.\" Mr Kennedy said.\nAdvertisement In the original 2008 case, HSI won a Federal Court injunction to prevent the whalers' company, Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha​, from killing whales in Australian Antarctic waters, which are declared by Canberra to be a whale sanctuary.\nAfter that, the whalers continued to operate in the Antarctic until the International Court of Justice ruled their program illegal last year.\nThe Environmental Defenders Office, acting for HSI, said it had gathered evidence of continued whaling within the Australian whale sanctuary after the Federal Court injunction was issued.\n\"We certainly are making the allegations that there is good evidence on a number of occasions the whalers have killed, injured, taken or interfered with whales in the sanctuary, contrary to the court's orders,\" said Sue Higginson, principal solicitor of EDO NSW​.\nKyodo Senpaku has refused to acknowledge the case in the past, but the matter has been listed for hearing in the court on 18 November.\nAfter losing the ICJ case, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government intended to renew \"research\" whaling to gather the scientific information it needs to manage whale resources.\nUnder the latest plan, NEWREP-A, the whalers would harpoon 330 whales in the upcoming Antarctic summer, and kill nearly 4000 minke whales over 12 years.\nInternational Whaling Commission scientific experts have said that Tokyo has failed to demonstrate the need for killing whales in order to achieve the plan's objectives.\nIn the most recent public comment by the Japanese Government, the IWC Commissioner, Joji Morishita​, said in June that a final decision to sail south this summer was yet to be made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:47:58.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
