US President Barack Obama. \nUS President Barack Obama has wished Michael J. Fox a happy 'Back to the Future' Day. \nThe 54-year-old politician took to his Twitter account to extend his best wishes to the Canadian-American actor, who starred in the iconic sci-fi franchise and who, in 'Back to the Future Part II', travelled forward in time to October 21, 2015. Happy Back to the Future Day, @RealMikeFox ! Ever think about the fact that we live in the future we dreamed of then? That's heavy, man. — President Obama (@POTUS) October 21, 2015 \nObama said: “Happy Back to the Future Day, @RealMikeFox! Ever think about the fact that we live in the future we dreamed of then? That's heavy, man.” \nAnd the 54-year-old star didn't waste much time in responding to the message. Mr. President, I never dreamed I'd be talking about the future with someone who's making History. https://t.co/i5swY8ksEB — Michael J. Fox (@realmikefox) October 21, 2015 \nHe wrote: “Mr. President, I never dreamed I'd be talking about the future with someone who's making History. (sic)” \nEarlier this week, Christopher Lloyd - who played the part of Dr. Emmett L. Brown in the franchise - hailed the enduring appeal of the 'Back to the Future' movies. \nHe said: “There's no other character that has come up, that keeps going for 30 years. \n“They all have their time, and then they fade away. 'Back to the Future' refuses to fade away. I saw it last night, and I have to say it seems fresh and contemporary, not 1985, 1986. It has a lot of laughs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:22:49.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
