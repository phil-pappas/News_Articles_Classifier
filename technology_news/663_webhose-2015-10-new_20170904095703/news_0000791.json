Those 3,000 will count towards the primary goal of #HackClimate to plant 1,000,000 trees globally. Beginning October 6th, supporters can help crowdfund the campaign for one dollar per tree. The campaign was designed by Republic of Change, a soon-to-launch social network promoting individual and collective action on climate change.\n“I’m glad to see more organizations drawing attention to the climate challenges facing us today,” said Shawn Mills, CEO of Green House Data. “Participating in this campaign furthers the Green House Data goals of energy efficiency and sustainability, while also supporting additional outreach and education on the issues of climate and deforestation.”\nThe consensus of the UN, NASA, NOAA and many climate scientists is that sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere remains one of the best ways to combat climate change.\nGreen House Data was founded with efficiency and sustainability in mind, with energy efficient data center facilities and over 100% of the power supplying them attributable to renewable energy sources. The company is also an EPA Green Power Partner and a certified B Corp.\nThe #HackClimate campaign will also include series of articles on Medium and the production of a feature-length documentary covering socially and environmentally responsible businesses.
