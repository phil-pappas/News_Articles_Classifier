The year-ago quarter benefited from strong betting on the month-long soccer World Cup tournament, the company said.\n\"Performance was weaker than our expectations across the board impacted by weaker gross win margin than we had anticipated,\" Cenkos analyst Simon French wrote in a note.\nThe London-based company said its third quarter was hurt by 23 million pounds in additional gambling duties this year while its gross win margin was lower than expected in the quarter.\nAnalysts expect the company to report full-year operating profit in the range of 290.9 million pounds to 312.1 million pounds, according to company-compiled estimates.\nWilliam Hill shares were down 4.6 percent at 329.3 pence at 0705 GMT. As of Thursday's close, the stock was down 5 percent year-to-date.
