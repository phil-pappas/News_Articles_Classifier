The speakerphone solves the problems of device connectivity and distracting background noise through an innovative design. Set up the Jabra Speak 810 in seconds. Plug-and-play connectivity through Bluetooth, USB or the 3.5mm port makes it easy to use a smartphone or laptop with the speakerphone. No IP or VoIP connection is required. The USB port can also charge another device. A total of six microphones with Jabra s unique ZoomTalk technology are built into the Jabra Speak 810. The microphones focus on the human voice and disregard background noises, reducing listener strain on the other end of the call. The speakerphone is designed for meeting rooms of approximately 1,000 square feet. Up to 15 participants can comfortably conference through this phone. The Jabra Speak 810 delivers a professional audio conferencing experience all through existing mobile device and computer connections. Two versions of the Jabra Speak 810 speakerphone are available. The Jabra Speak 810 UC is designed for unified communications, while the Jabra Speak 810 MS is certified for Skype for Business. Similar speakerphones are often too small or not powerful enough to facilitate conferences in a large meeting room. Larger, more powerful conference phones usually require an IP or VoIP connection. The Jabra Speak 810 gives businesses a device as easy to use as a portable speakerphone, with the features of an enterprise-grade conference phone. For more information about the Jabra Speak 810, contact IP Phone Warehouse by phone: (888) 201-9056 or email: service(at)ipphone-warehouse(dot)com today.
