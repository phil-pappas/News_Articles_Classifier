Everything is underwater. We didn't get time to do nothing,\" said Patricia Harde, 48, who fled with her two adult daughters and their four small children, including a baby of four months, to a school-turned-shelter. \n\"The water was coming up to my waist when we left,\" she added. \"I went back to try to get things for the baby -- milk and Pampers -- but I couldn't. Everything was covered in water.\" \nFirefighters came to rescue them. But while some rode in the boat, others had to walk through the rapidly rising dirty water. \nThe water was still rising when they got to first shelter, so they moved on. \n\"I'd always seen this on TV, but I never thought it would happen to us,\" said Harde, whose birthday was Monday. \nThe Red Cross has opened some 30 shelters across South Carolina. \nEven residents who were able to remain home were rattled. \n\"It was traumatic, I've never seen anything like this,\" said Phyllis Jones, a fifty-year resident of Columbia, the state capital. \nJones lives in an upstairs apartment at complex called Willow Creek, whose namesake waterway completely inundated the ground-floor units Sunday with flash floods. \nThe water receded Monday, but Jones said she has not left her apartment \"for fear of looting.\" \nShe had stocked up on drinking water ahead of the flooding, but on Monday she found herself without electricity. \n- 'Everything is lost' - \nRescue and repair workers were hard at work, Haley said, adding that 25 helicopter evacuations had already been conducted. \nAcross the state, some 550 roads and bridges -- some of which were completely washed out by flash floods -- were closed to traffic. \nIn the historic coastal city of Charleston, population 130,000, more than 900 people were being housed in 25 emergency centers Monday, she said. \nHaley said she had spoken with President Barack Obama and that he had declared a federal state of emergency for the state, authorizing additional federal aid. \nEva Gadsen, 72, heard someone at her door Sunday morning saying she needed to get out. \n\"When I opened the door, the water was at my waist,\" she said, and when she opened it, it rushed in. \n\"When we got around the corner I saw the fridge coming out of my apartment, going across the water,\" she said. \n\"Thank God I am still alive and I have a place to stay. People who went back to the building say everything is lost.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:37:46.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
