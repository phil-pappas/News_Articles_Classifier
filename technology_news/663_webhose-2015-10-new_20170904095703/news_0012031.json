It also contains a built in bridge excitation supply which can be configured either as a 0-10 V constant voltage source with optional remote sensing or as a 0-25 mA constant current source. In addition, the module supports constant current line drive transducers which are ideal for general vibration measurements such as automotive parts.\nAnother new tool is the PULSE Reflex Acoustic Camera, which provides a complete system for stationary and non‐stationary measurements. The camera is easy to set up - even for non-experts - providing noise source identification, troubleshooting and leak detection, as well as buzz, squeak and rattle detection in vehicle cabins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:50:48.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
