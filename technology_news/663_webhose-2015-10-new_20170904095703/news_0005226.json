(NASDAQ:IVTY), an advanced medical technology company, today announced the results of a company-sponsored retrospective analysis performed by leading surgeons and validated by an outside healthcare consulting firm. The study demonstrated clear clinical and economic benefits for the use of the company's Eikon™ illuminated retractor system with integrated Intelligent Photonics™ during Nipple Sparing Mastectomies (NSM), an advanced surgical approach to breast cancer surgery.\nThe chart review study is the first in a series of planned analyses designed to determine if enhanced intracavity illumination and visualization can help improve patient outcomes while also reducing anesthesia and operating room times and overall procedural cost. A previously conducted breast surgeon thought leader survey indicated that the Eikon™ illuminated retractor system with Invuity's integrated Intelligent Photonics™ reduced surgical challenges and potential complications of NSM.[1] To further validate and quantify the results from the prior survey, a participating breast center and hospital conducted a chart review to determine if reductions in anesthesia time or complications could be achieved upon transitioning to the Eikon™ system.\nThe retrospective chart review assessed NSMs followed by breast reconstructions performed by breast surgical oncologist Beth DuPree , MD, FACS, Holy Redeemer Health System ( Meadowbrook, PA ) and by plastic surgeon William Scarlett , DO, FACS, FACOS, FAACS, Bucks County Aesthetic Center ( Bensalem, PA ) prior to and after adopting the Eikon™ system.\nThe results suggest the introduction of the Eikon™ system improved surgical efficiency and safety, and reduced complications for patients, as well as contributing to better economic outcomes for the hospital:\nAnesthesia time was reduced by an average of 31 minutes (10 percent) in bilateral NSM cases.[2] Overall complication rates decreased, including a statistically significant 70 percent reduction of epidermolysis (blistering or pealing of the skin or nipple-partial thickness).[3] Overall potential cost savings associated with using the Eikon™ system were estimated to be between $580 and $2,000 .[4] \"We are pleased with these positive results, which show there are tangible and significant benefits to both patients and hospitals from the use of our Intelligent Photonics technology during advanced surgical procedures,\" said Invuity CEO Philip Sawyer .\nEach year, approximately 232,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer that requires surgery[5], but many are unaware of surgical procedures that can safely and effectively treat their cancer while still maintaining the shape and contour of the breast, including sparing the nipple, areola and surrounding breast tissue. With advanced surgical approaches such as NSMs, the cancerous tissue is removed through a single incision made in an inconspicuous or discrete area on or near the breast, resulting in less visible scarring. Patients who undergo this approach are at no higher risk of recurrence than patients who undergo any other surgical technique.[6]\n\"Nipple Sparing Mastectomies have become a desirable option for the oncologic treatment of breast cancer with excellent clinical and aesthetic outcomes shown in appropriate patients,\" said Beth DuPree , MD, FACS. \"Based on the positive outcomes of this analysis, we plan to conduct continued research to further confirm the benefit of advanced access and visualization technologies in enabling this innovative approach to breast cancer surgery.\"\n\"We look forward to continuing our research. Whenever possible, before surgery, patients should partner with their care team to learn about the breast reconstruction options available to them,\" said William Scarlett , DO, FACS, FACOS, FAACS. \"Having advanced access and visualization tools from the beginning not only helps reduce surgical time and complications, but enables us to give patients aesthetic results that can help boost their psychological and emotional recovery.\"\nFor the white paper on the study results, please click here: www.invuity.com/technology/evidence/ .\nAbout Invuity®\nInvuity, Inc. is a medical technology company focused on developing and marketing advanced photonics devices to improve the ability of surgeons to illuminate and visualize the surgical cavity during open minimally invasive and minimal access surgery.
