Reuters/Dado Ruvic 2 of 2 right \nTwitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) will lay off up to 336 employees, or about 8 percent of its workforce, as co-founder Jack Dorsey readies to revive growth in the microblogging service provider's user base in his second stint as chief executive. \nThe layoffs, primarily in the company's product and engineering functions, come a week after Dorsey took over as permanent CEO. ( 1.usa.gov/1Gbb31A ) \nShares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose as much as 6 percent in morning trading on Tuesday. \n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" Dorsey said in a letter to employees. \"And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.\" \nFBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, however, said the company needed to focus also on \"rationalizing sales\" along with engineering to achieve its margin targets. \nDorsey, who took over as Twitter's interim CEO in July after Dick Costolo resigned, has been candid about the company's problems. \nTwitter's second-quarter growth in average monthly users was the slowest since the company went public on Nov. 7, 2013. Its stock nearly tripled to a record high of $74.73 in December 2013, but has fallen about 60 percent since. \n\"The general thinking is that Twitter has a product problem, which is why they picked Jack to come in. You would normally not be cutting in engineering if you have a product problem. So I scratched my head a little bit on that,\" Seyrafi told Reuters. \nSince Dorsey took over as CEO for the second time, Twitter has rolled out a \"buy now\" button that allows users to make purchases and a feature that highlights the best tweets and content. \nThe company said it expected about $10 million-$20 million in severance costs and $5 million-$15 million in restructuring charges. Twitter expects to record most of these pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. \nTechnology news website Re/code first reported the planned layoffs on Oct. 9. \nTwitter also estimated its third-quarter revenue at or above the higher end of its forecast range of $545 million-$560 million, and adjusted EBITDA at or above the higher end of its forecast range of $110 million-$115 million. \nThe company will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 27. \nTwitter shares were up 5 percent at $30.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. \n(Reporting by Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar; Editing by Kirti Pandey) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:39:51.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
