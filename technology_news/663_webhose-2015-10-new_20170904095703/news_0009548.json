The news stunned traders, with the retailer’s stock plunging 10 per cent in response. It represented the worst daily performance for the firm’s shares since 1998.\nThe development guided a session that had earlier appeared destined to end around the flatline as traders weighed economic data in Europe, the US and China.\nIn all cases the numbers were a disappointment, but investors were seen looking on the bright side: the prospect of more stimulus in China and Europe and a slower rates lift-off in the US.\nIn the US, retail sales were shown to rise a meagre 0.1 per cent in September, below expectations for a 0.2 per cent lift. Auto sales represented the only show of strength in the figures.\nMeanwhile, producer prices slumped 0.5 per cent, much worse than projections of a 0.2 per cent drop and a further sign that cost pressures are struggling to develop in the US.\nElsewhere, the US Federal Reserve outlined “modest” growth through the release of its beige book of economic conditions. Growth was reported in 11 of the Fed’s 12 economic districts, but the strong US dollar has been weighing on the economy’s expansion.\nPut together the developments virtually rule out a rate hike this month, but are not weak enough to take a December move off the table.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surrendered 0.9 per cent, the S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.3 per cent.\nTraders also eyed earnings updates from key institutions JP Morgan and Bank of America , with the former’s earnings falling short of expectations and the latter’s topping forecasts. JP Morgan stock lost 3 per cent, while Bank of America gained 0.7 per cent.\nIn Europe, France’s CAC 40 gave back 0.7 per cent, while Germany’s DAX 30 tumbled 1.2 per cent.\nThe weak session followed a disappointing reading on eurozone industrial production , with output dipping 0.5 per cent in August. The soft report casts doubt on the prospects for a strong growth reading in the third quarter, though it could encourage the ECB to enhance its QE program.\nOutside the eurozone, the UK’s FTSE 100 shed 1.2 per cent despite the strongest reading on the labour market in seven years.\nThe jobless rate ticked down to 5.4 per cent in the three months to August, the lowest mark since July 2008.\nIn other market action:\n-- The Australian dollar surged as soft US data dragged on the world’s reserve currency. At 7am (AEDT), the unit is trading at US73.09c, up sharply from US72.42c on Wednesday.\n-- Iron ore extended its slide, yielding 1.1 per cent to $US54.30 a tonne.\n-- Copper edged up 0.5 per cent, while base metals on the London Metals Exchange ended mostly higher thanks to a weaker US dollar.\n-- US Nymex crude inched down 0.1 per cent to $US46.64, while global benchmark Brent crude lost 0.2 per cent to $US49.15 as oversupply concerns lingered.\n-- Gold hit a fresh three-and-a-half-month high after adding 1.2 per cent to $US1,179.80 an ounce.\n-- ASX futures are pointing up 4 points, or 0.1 per cent, as of 6.45am (AEDT).\nAhead: Local jobs data will be closely eyed amid rising expectations of an imminent RBA rate cut, while inflation numbers in the US are expected to show muted pressure on consumer prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:54:27.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
