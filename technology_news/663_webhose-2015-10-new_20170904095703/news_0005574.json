The blue-chip index rose as much as 173 points earlier.\nThe S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent.\nData released Wednesday showed crude oil stockpiles rose for the second week in a row. US oil prices fell close to 1.5 per cent after trading up 2 per cent earlier. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 still gained 1.3 per cent despite coming off highs.\n\"We're still in a nervous marketplace,\" Brett Mock, managing director at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services, said. \"People are still wary of the rallies that can't hold,\" he added.\nEven with Wednesday's pause, the S&P's energy sector has gained around 10 per cent this month as US oil prices have rallied 6.5 per cent. The S&P 500 has advanced 3.2 per cent so far in October.\n\"What we see in commodity markets is spilling into global equities,\" Chris Jeffery, a senior strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, said.\nLower commodities prices should normally boost global growth, but prices had fallen so much that investors were questioning the solvency of companies exposed to the sector, Mr Jeffery said. A rebound in commodity markets \"takes the pressure off those default risks,\" he said.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.1 per cent. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's DAX climbed 0.7 per cent, while France's CAC 40 added 0.1 per cent. Investors appeared to shrug off German industrial output coming in below expectations in August, a day after data showed manufacturing orders in Europe's largest economy slumped.\nStocks in Asia were mostly higher. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.8 per cent, recovering after stocks were pressured on news the Bank of Japan had decided to keep its policy unchanged. Many analysts still expect further easing measures at the BOJ's next meeting at the end of the month.\nShares in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 3.1 per cent after Chinese authorities reported that foreign-exchange reserves fell by a slower pace in September.\nThe slower pace of reserves falling \"provides some comfort\" to investors worried about the Chinese economy, said Edwin Gutierrez, head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, which oversees Â£307 billion in assets.\nThat, combined with a growing consensus among investors that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates until next year, has \"put a spark under risk assets,\" he said.\nThe moves in markets came after a rally in US stocks lost momentum Tuesday, with a sell-off in healthcare shares prompting the S&P 500 to snap its five-day winning streak.\nHealthcare stocks recovered sharply in the latest session.\nGlobal stocks had climbed earlier in the week after a disappointing US jobs report pushed back investors' expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates. Ultra-low interest rates have boosted global stocks in recent years.\nThe next major catalyst for Wall Street is expected to be results from the third-quarter corporate earnings season as companies grappled with a stronger US dollar and slowing economic growth overseas.\nThe yield on 10-year US Treasurys rose to 2.058 per cent from 2.033 per cent on Tuesday. Yields rise as prices fall.\nIn corporate news, SABMiller rejected a takeover offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev, saying it undervalued the company. SABMiller shares added 0.3 per cent, while those of Anheuser-Busch rose 0.6 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:57:50.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
