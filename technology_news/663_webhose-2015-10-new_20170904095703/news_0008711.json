The Simility SaaS platform is highly customizable and provides data visualization capabilities to help fraud managers quickly and accurately root out fraudsters while protecting customers. \n“We started Simility because online fraud was increasing in sophistication and volume, yet fraud detection technology was not keeping up,” said Rahul Pangam, CEO of Simility. “Fraud managers can benefit from machine learning that spots patterns in evolving fraudulent behavior not immediately obvious or intuitive to the naked eye. At the same time, human experience and intuition are essential to the successful application of technology to protect people from fraud.” \nIn closed beta, Simility has already caught thousands of fraudsters. Beta customers see an immediate uptick of 50-200% in prevented fraudulent transactions per week, while decreasing false positives and saving operational costs. \nTo request a demo please visit: https://simility.com/request-demo/ \nAbout Simility \nSimility is a cloud-based fraud prevention software solution that combines the power of machine learning and human analysis.
