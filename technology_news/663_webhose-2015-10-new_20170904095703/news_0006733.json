There will probably be a drone to do it. Pic: AFP/Jure Makovec\nAAP FORGET the selfie stick, those who love to take photos of themselves may soon be able to buy the selfie drone.\nA compact automated flying camera system is being developed by technology company Internet of Things (IoT), which plans to have it on sale by Christmas.\nIoT says the selfie drone can follow a person around to take photos of them surfing, snowboarding, skiing or riding a bike. The Sydney-based company is seeking to list on the Australian share market, a move it says would enable investors to cash in on the boom in mobile devices, smart technologies and gadgets.\nIoT chief executive Simon Kantor says the company takes existing technology, adds functions and improves it, then makes the product available to the public at affordable prices.\n“IoT is a developer of developed technology,” he says.\n“So we take innovation that is already out there, then we develop and tinker on top of it to add more functionality and make it more useful for the average Joe.”\nSelfie sticks were a huge seller in 2014, Mr Kantor said, and IoT has combined the purpose of the stick with a drone, which is usually expensive and hard to fly.\n“We’re developing an affordable selfie drone — maybe $150 or $190 — that will follow you,” he says.\n“It has a lot of smart software and sensors that we are able to source in volume at a good rate so that we can supply the product at an affordable price.” IoT has already launched a $99 smartwatch called the Viper Phone Watch which is available in some supermarkets.\nIt is also developing a GPS safety smartwatch for children, a rugged smartwatch designed for tradies, and smart clothing.\nSmart clothing includes shoes loaded with tiny sensors and devices that can provide information about the number of steps taken as well as the user’s posture and manner of walking.\nSmart singlets can measure blood pressure or pick up if the wearer is having a heart attack.\nMr Kantor says IoT can develop a product from concept and get it to market within three to four months.\nThe company intends to list on the share market through a reverse takeover of Ardent Resources.\nArdent Resources will acquire IoT in exchange for about 696 million shares in Ardent. The acquisition is expected to be completed in mid December.\nArdent shareholders will be asked to endorse a change in the nature and scale of Ardent’s activities, and the company will also issue a prospectus to raise $5 million.\nThe funds will be used to accelerate the development of IoT’s products and pursue business development opportunities.\nSubject to shareholder approval, Ardent will consolidate its shares on an indicative basis of one for four.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4f93e368d09c58fff219a5481bd0bc7f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-23T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:34:05.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
