Surviving SOX9+ cells proliferate (red) to repair the damaged nephron, restoring kidney function. Credit: the McMahon Lab \nIn the kidney, injured cells can be kicked into reparative mode by a gene called Sox9, according to a new paper published in Cell Reports . \nFirst author Sanjeev Kumar, M.D., Ph.D., a Keck School of Medicine of USC postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of Andy McMahon, Ph.D., provost professor and W. M. Keck Professor of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at the Keck School, found that surviving injured cells switch on the Sox9 gene as a response to kidney damage . This regenerates the injured cellular lining of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney , and repairs the kidney after acute kidney injury (AKI). \nBy recruiting the majority of the surviving cells of the epithelium to aid in the timely repair of a severely injured organ, the kidney's Sox9 strategy contrasts with the stem cell-based repair strategy of many other organ systems. \n\"Currently, no treatment exists to treat AKI per se. Identifying the kidney's intrinsic mechanisms of repair is critical for developing treatments to kickstart the kidneys after AKI, a serious condition with an in-hospital mortality rate exceeding 50 percent,\" said Kumar. \nIn sections of the kidney that fail to repair, Sox9 remains activated thereby, demarcating regions of inefficient repair responses. Further interrogation of such regions could provide a crucial link between AKI and its transition to chronic and end-stage kidney disease. \nSox9 also plays a key role in the normal development of the kidney. Study provides insights on enzyme that helps direct the immune response to kidney injury February 12, 2015 \nAn enzyme known to be important in the body's response to kidney injury exerts its protective effects, in part, by affecting the immune system, according to a study appearing in an upcoming issue of the Journal of the American ... Researchers identify protein needed for repair of injured kidney cells March 18, 2015 \nCardiovascular researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have shown that a protein known as MG53 is not only present in kidney cells, but necessary for the organ to repair itself after acute injury. Results ... Researchers reveal a genetic blueprint for cartilage July 2, 2015 \nCartilage does a lot more than determine the shapes of people's ears and noses. It also enables people to breathe and to form healthy bonesâ€”two processes essential to life. In a study published in Cell Reports, USC Stem ... Age-related self-destruction of cells makes kidney prone to injury July 7, 2015 \nAs advances in medicine allow individuals to live longer, people are facing unique age-related health challenges. As they age, organs such as the kidneys become more susceptible to injury, and their ability to self-repair ... Newly discovered protein may protect kidney cells from injury September 2, 2015 \nA new discovery by Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) researchers may change how kidney disease is treated in the future. How kidney injury during combat affects the long-term health of today's soldiers September 3, 2015 \nAcute kidney injury (AKI) leading to an abrupt or rapid decline in kidney function is a serious and increasingly prevalent condition. While little information is available on the effects of AKI in military personnel who are ...
