It has built-in atmospheric humidity and pressure compensation for maximum repeatability.\nMeanwhile, the airflow C Grid is an interface tool designed for measuring airflow across a planar area, with simultaneous polling of multiple sensors. It provides up to 200 air velocity and temperature sensors per unit for HVAC evaluation. “Technicians would place this in the passenger or driver seat to run measurements on the vents. It represents what a human would actually feel like when sitting in that position,” explained Jim Bishop, sales executive, embedded products. The C Grid frame can be built to customer specification and it includes data acquisition software for logging real-time velocity and temperature of air flow.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/CPort3600.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:40:14.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
