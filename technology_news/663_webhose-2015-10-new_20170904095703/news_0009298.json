The report was presented in a closed session.\n\"The emphasis on 'the ANC can no longer allow prolonged processes that damages its integrity' has been put aside and leaders closed ranks in defence of individual leaders who have appeared before the integrity commission,\" Mantashe said in the report.\n\"The [national executive committee - NEC] has not implemented many of the recommendations of the integrity commission, because comrades feared admitting guilt by stepping aside.\"", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/gwede-mantashe-5142-5142", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=5142"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:36:19.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
