Often forgotten is an external examination of threats happening across an organization’s industry and the likelihood those threats will hit you. Adam Meyer, chief security strategist at cyber threat intelligence firm SurfWatch Labs , will present how to effectively collect and use cyber threat intelligence as part of your overall risk management program from 3:30pm – 4:15pm at the Cyber Maryland Conference. He is available for in-person interviews on October 29 immediately before and after that time. In the session, Building Your Light House: Cyber Risk Intelligence in Your Risk Management Program participants will learn why threat intelligence is the missing link in their risk management program as well as tips for communicating and using cyber intelligence insights across the organization to business leaders. Meyer, a former CISO for the 2nd largest transit authority, will share practical examples of how attacks against other organizations can help businesses be more proactive in their defenses and reduce the impact of threats from a fraud and legal liability perspective.\nCyber Maryland is held at the Baltimore Convention Center, One West Pratt Center in Baltimore. Event registration is available online until October 27.\nSupporting Resources:\n Read the 2015 Mid-Year Cyber Risk Report Learn about the Threat Intelligence Suite\nAbout SurfWatch Labs\nSurfWatch Labs helps organizations and service providers quickly establish a strategic cyber threat intelligence operation that drives more effective use of their tactical defenses.
