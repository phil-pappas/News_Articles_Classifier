Last month, NASA scientists confirmed current water flows on Mars.\n“It’s clear that the Mars of billions of years ago more closely resembled Earth than it does today. Our challenge is to figure out how this more clement Mars was even possible, and what happened to that wetter Mars,” said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA’s Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nBefore Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012, scientists proposed that Gale Crater had filled with layers of sediments. Some hypotheses were “dry,” suggesting that sediment accumulated from wind-blown dust and sand.\nOthers focused on the possibility that sediment layers were deposited in ancient lakes.\nThe latest results indicate that these wetter scenarios were correct for the lower portions of Mount Sharp.\nBased on the new analysis, the filling of at least the bottom layers of the mountain occurred mostly by ancient rivers and lakes over a period of less than 500 million years.\n“During the traverse of Gale, we have noticed patterns in the geology where we saw evidence of ancient fast-moving streams with coarser gravel, as well as places where streams appear to have emptied out into bodies of standing water,” Vasavada said.\n“The prediction was that we should start seeing water-deposited, fine-grained rocks closer to Mount Sharp. Now that we’ve arrived, we’re seeing finely laminated mudstones in abundance that look like lake deposits,” he said.\nThe mudstone indicates the presence of bodies of standing water in the form of lakes that remained for long periods of time, possibly repeatedly expanding and contracting during hundreds to millions of years.\nThese lakes deposited the sediment that eventually formed the lower portion of the mountain.\nThe research was published in the journal Science.\n 09, 2015 7:06 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:19:54.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
