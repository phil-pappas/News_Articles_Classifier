Covering more spaces than ever before, iQ Granit is a system of high performing products that work together in commercial spaces, making it easy to transition from one room to another with the same design and color. Inspired by nature, iQ Granit Micro’s tonal, smaller chip design makes it ideal for healthcare, education, retail, hospitality and corporate applications. Available in twelve colors, Micro is designed to work together with the rest of the iQ Granit line, creating a cohesive look with top of the line performance.\nUnlike other products that have a factory applied and cured surface coating, iQ Granit and iQ Granit Micro, like all iQ Collections, have a through-and-through construction that allows the product to be dry buffed for the life of the product without any need for harmful chemicals. “Its unique construction makes it possible to restore to the floor’s original, natural beauty, even after years of wear, without resurfacing. Just dry buff,” Jeremy Salomon, product manager, Tarkett, explains.\nIn addition to its natural design and cost saving maintenance features, iQ Granit and iQ Granit Micro are both Certified asthma & allergy friendly™ by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), phthalate free, TVOC ≤ 10 µg/m, and FloorScore® certified. iQ Granit Micro also has Platinum Certification – the highest level possible – on the NSF 332 Sustainability Assessment Standard for Resilient Floor coverings.\n###\nAbout Tarkett\nTarkett is a global leader in innovative and sustainable solutions for flooring and sports surfaces.
