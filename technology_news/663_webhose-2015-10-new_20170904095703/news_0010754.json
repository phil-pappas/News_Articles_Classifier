SMN was developed for applications requiring real-time synchronization and control, such as hardware-in-the-loop simulations, test and measurement, industrial automation, and automotive systems simulations.\nTypical networks contain protocol overhead that limits transfer speeds, especially for small data transfers like 4, 8 or 16 bytes, which constitute the majority of network traffic. SMN has no protocol overhead. It was designed specifically to move small amounts of data efficiently, mimicking applications that write to local memory. The result is that data is moved over the network close to line rate speed, effectively decreasing communication time by 75%, reducing simulation time, and minimizing network size. This all of adds up to saving the end user a considerable amount of time and reducing their investment in network hardware.\nNetworks also lack a fast way to interrupt remote applications or move data immediately upon events. SMN was designed to allow event-driven interrupts for prompting instantaneous actions as required in hardware-in-the-loop simulations. Time critical interrupts associated with these simulations benefit from immediate fault status and fault information that is sent simultaneously over the network. SMN is essential for networked safety critical applications, where an immediate notification is required in order to minimize the time that could cause system failures.\nFurthermore, SMN is easy to implement. It treats networked computing as application threads that share common memory used for storing application data structures – similar to multi-threaded applications using local memory on a single system.\nTo learn more about SMN, visit http://aviftech.com/products/shared-memory/\nAbout SMN\nSMN is an optical, high-speed (2.125 Gbps), ring-based network that uses a replicated memory concept. Network interface connections can be up to lengths of 10 km between systems. Each SMN module has 256 MB of memory and is available in several hardware form factors including: an XMC module, PXI Express, PCI Express, and PCI modules. All SMN modules are equipped with a full set of software drivers supporting Windows, Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS), VxWorks, LabVIEW, and LabVIEW Real-Time.\nAbout AIT\nAvionics Interface Technologies, a division of Teradyne, Inc.
