The combination of slower job growth and persistently low inflation mean even if the Fed raises its benchmark rate in December, the path of tightening monetary policy will be very gradual.\nThe Reuters survey forecast the mid-point of the fed funds target rate at 0.375 percent at the end of December, which implies a quarter point hike from the current zero to 0.25 percent range, unchanged from a Sept. 11 survey.\nThe mid-point was seen at 0.625 percent at the end of the first and second quarters. In September, economists had forecast an 0.875 percent mid-point at end-June.\n\"This creates a much more gradual glide path for interest rate normalization as moderate growth continues and other central banks around the world either ramp up monetary accommodation, or keep their monetary taps wide open,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.\nJob growth over the past two months averaged 139,000, the weakest two-month rise since January last year. The slowdown is puzzling given job openings are at record highs and consumer spending is quite robust. U.S. auto sales surged in September to their strongest in more than a decade.\nThe survey forecast non-farm payrolls averaging 190,000 in the fourth quarter, and dropping to an average of 189,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2016. In a poll conducted in July, economists forecast an average job growth of 225,000 in the fourth quarter and 215,000 jobs in the first.\n\"We have a dichotomy. The U.S. consumer is carrying the load but firms are being cautious in their hiring,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. \"Another explanation is that companies are trying to hire but they are not finding workers with the desired skills who are willing to take the pay being offered.\"\nThe unemployment rate was forecast averaging 5.3 percent this year and 4.9 percent next, unchanged from July.\nEven with the jobless rate forecast in a range most Fed officials think is consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation, price pressures are expected to remain benign.\nThe survey forecast the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, averaging 1.3 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2016. This compares to 1.4 percent and 1.8 percent respectively in the last survey. Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.\nThe U.S. economy, which expanded at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the second quarter, was forecast to have grown 2.0 percent in the third quarter, down from the 2.5 predicted in September. It will expand 2.7 percent in the current quarter.\n(Polling by Siddharth Iyer and Krishna Eluri; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:22:59.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
