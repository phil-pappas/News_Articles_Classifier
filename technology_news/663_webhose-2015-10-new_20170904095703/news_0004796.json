That disclosure triggered the worldwide cheating scandal engulfing the world’s largest automaker.\nThe newly revealed software makes a pollution control catalyst heat up faster, improving performance of the device that separates smog-causing nitrogen oxide into harmless nitrogen and oxygen gases.\nVW spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said the new issue with the 2016 diesel models, known as an auxiliary emissions control device, was revealed last week to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California regulators.\n“This has the function of a warmup strategy which is subject to approval by the agencies,” Ginivan said. “The agencies are currently evaluating this and Volkswagen is submitting additional information.”\nAutomakers routinely place auxiliary emissions control devices on cars, though they are required by law to disclose them as part of the process to receive clean emissions certifications required to sell cars in the country.\nThe EPA and the California Air Resources Board are investigating “the nature and purpose” of additional software on the new VW models.\nRegulators have not yet determined whether the code is a defeat device installed specifically to cheat on emissions tests, said Janet McCabe , acting assistant EPA administrator for air quality.\n“We have a long list of questions for VW about this,” she said Tuesday at a dedication ceremony for a new heavy-duty truck testing lab in Ann Arbor, Mich. “We’re getting some answers from them, but we do not have all the answers yet.”\nMcCabe wouldn’t say if VW’s failure to disclose the software in its 2016 application for emissions certification was illegal. “I don’t want to speak to any potential subjects of an enforcement activity,” she said.\nThe revelation is bad news for Volkswagen dealers, who had been anticipating delivery of the new models to replace older inventory, which they can no longer offer to customers. Thousands of 2016 Beetles, Golfs and Jettas will remain quarantined in U.S. ports until a fix can be developed, approved and carried out. Diesel versions of the Passat sedan manufactured at the company’s plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., also are on hold.\nVolkswagen already faced an ongoing criminal investigation and billions in fines for violating the Clean Air Act for its earlier emissions cheating, as well as a raft of state investigations and class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of customers.\nIf it is determined the new issue is a second defeat device, that would call into question recent assertions by top VW executives that responsibility for the cheating scheme lay with a handful of rogue software developers who wrote the original code installed with the company’s diesel engines starting with the 2009 model year.\nThe separate device included in the redesigned 2016 cars would appear to suggest a multiyear effort by the company to influence U.S. emissions tests that continued even after regulators began pressing the company last year about irregularities with the emissions produced by the older cars.\nA congressional staffer briefed on the issue last week said VW probably didn’t need the additional software to meet government emissions standards, but that the device appears intended to ensure the 2016 cars would pass by wider margins. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the ongoing investigation.\nVolkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn announced in congressional testimony last week that the German automaker had withdrawn applications seeking certification of its 2016 diesels because of on-board software that hadn’t been disclosed to regulators.\nMeanwhile, the German executive Volkswagen tapped to take charge of its North American operations in the wake of the cheating scandal has quit just weeks after taking the post.\nVW said Winfried Vahland resigned from the company Wednesday over “differing views on the organization” of the automaker’s North American business. His resignation was “not related” to the ongoing scandal over VW rigging software to cheat emissions tests of its diesel cars, the carmaker said. \nThe Los Angeles Times contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:53:17.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
