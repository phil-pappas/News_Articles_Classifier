The problem is that a lot of companies don't spend enough time building experiences that are unique to mobile and instead just import solutions built for the desktop Web. This means an app will have FAQs that are not searchable (crucial on a small screen) and will require the user to leave the app to perform basic functions like sending a message to the customer service representative. This report presents a range of examples in four distinct categories of mobile app - Merchant, Prepaid, Mobile Wallet, and Mobile Banking. For this research, these apps were downloaded onto an Apple iPhone 6 and evaluated in August and September of 2015. Our evaluations are summarized in a table at the end of each section, with a consolidated set of findings at the end of the report. \nMany of these apps were featured in an earlier iteration of this report titled Comparing the Customer Support Delivered in Mobile Payment Applications, released in April 2014. The present report builds on the findings of that report, reviewing the key changes to some of the apps since last year. Again the focus of this report is exclusively the mobile app channel and not the desktop Web experience, which in many cases is far more full-featured. \nMerchant Mobile Applications \nThe first category of applications reviewed here is retail apps built by merchants, namely Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, Amazon, and Walmart. This is an important category for payments because each of these players has the power to influence consumer behavior by introducing new technology solutions to their customers. Starbucks is the leader in in-store mobile payments thanks to the success of its app, a feat that Dunkin' is trying to replicate. Amazon is the online retailing juggernaut that is a major force driving the growth of card-not-present transactions through its mobile and online properties. Walmart, the giant of traditional big box retail, is making a renewed push to be the leader in e-commerce by leveraging its stores as distribution centers. Its mobile app is a great example of omnichannel retail execution; the app does everything from pinpointing exactly which aisle contains the next item on the user's shopping list while in-store to letting the user arrange for home delivery. \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:47:24.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
