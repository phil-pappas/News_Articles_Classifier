Stabilized rental prices will put Boston in a competitive position to lure newbies and also help preserve the diversity that is the lifeblood of our city. Redfin reports the Silicon Valley exodus is already driving up home prices in Boston, and that could backfire on us.\n• Incentivize the type of big bets by venture capitalists that are still much easier to secure on the West Coast than in Boston. This comes down to money and ego-stroking. Tax breaks, publicly sponsored office space, matching grants and more should be on the table. Name streets and buildings after them. Chisel their personages into marble and limestone.\n• Kill all remaining blue laws and let bars stay open as long as they want. MBTA hours are a moot point now that UberPool and Lyft Line basically guarantee ridiculously cheap and reliable rides home for the late-night crowd.\n•  Keep the fun and excitement going. From District Hall to the Lawn on D and the Boston Public Market, Boston continues to shed its stodgy heritage.\n• Send a Massachusetts delegation to the West Coast just as former Gov. Deval Patrick did in Israel. Meet with every unicorn company in the market for commercial space.\nThe new HBO documentary “San Francisco 2.0” touches on the dynamic, showing how everything that once made the city hip and cool is being driven out as prices soar.\nFor all its gorgeous vistas and the temperate climate, the San Francisco area is so expensive that even the gentry want out of gentrification. The median home price has reached $1 million in Silicon Valley, double that of Boston.\nThose housing prices coupled with equally insane commercial rents have put a chokehold on startups. Yet as impossible as it is to find space as a bootstrapping startup, it’s almost trickier if you’re a so-called unicorn company — startups that have soared to a $1 billion valuation — with lots of employees in need of lots of space. The next Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Google or Apple may very well not come out of the West Coast. If we act soon, it could happen here.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Booting+Up%3A+Boston+needs+to+cash+in+on+Silicon+Valley+exodus"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:26.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
