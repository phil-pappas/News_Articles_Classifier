Under their agreement, Wang Xing, chief executive officer of Alibaba-backed Meituan, and his counterpart at Tencent-backed Dianping Zhang Tao will run the new company as co-chairmen and co-CEOs.\nThe deal creates a dominant player in China’s crowded online-to-offline services market, as consumers increasingly use smartphones and tablets to book everything from hotel rooms to car rides to grocery deliveries. The alliance poses a threat to Baidu Inc., the nation’s biggest search company, which is investing $3.2 billion over three years in its own provider of local services.\nChina’s three largest Internet companies are vying for a slice of an “O2O” or location-based services market expected to grow to 7.2 trillion yuan ($1.13 trillion) by 2017, according to Internet researcher IResearch.\nFierce Competition “The external competition is fierce and the business is constantly changing, yet O2O is just getting started,” Meituan’s Wang said in a statement posted on the company’s Weibo microblog. “This tie-up allow us to lift the entire industry to a new level. We’ll have the energy and the resources to invest in new product innovation, improve the user experience and carve out new businesses.”\nThe merger marks a rare instance of cooperation between Alibaba and Tencent, which still go toe-to-toe in entertainment, e-commerce, even banking.\nThe separate brands and management structure of Meituan and Dianping will be maintained, the companies said. That structure is similar to the creation of Didi Kuaidi this year via a merger of two taxi-hailing apps that China’s two largest Internet firms separately backed.\nAlibaba and Tencent have competed for acquisitions and driven the value of Internet deals involving Chinese companies to $58.4 billion in the year through Wednesday, already almost double the amount for 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nPursuing Capital A larger, more established player can pursue more avenues for capital-raising. Venture financing is becoming more difficult to obtain in a slowing economy and wobbly stock market, and many Web startups that had been burning cash through big incentives to draw customers are facing pressure to cut their losses.\nMeituan and Dianping are among the larger players in the increasingly crowded online-to-offline space. A growing number of companies, Alibaba and Tencent among them, are betting rising incomes will drive online and mobile ordering of everyday services despite a decelerating economy.\nMeituan.com is a group-buying site similar to Groupon Inc., where people can get discounts on goods and services by making purchases together. It held about 52 percent of the 77 billion yuan ($12.1 billion) market in the first half of the year, according to a report by researcher Analysys International.\nDianping.com, which also runs a consumer review site like Yelp Inc., accounted for about 30 percent. Baidu’s Nuomi is the third-largest player in group buying with 13.6 percent of the market, according to Analysys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:42:33.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
