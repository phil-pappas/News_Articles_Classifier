( amzn.to/1L97w0x )\nThe beta version of the service is available from Thursday, Amazon's Chief Technology Officer Werner Vogels said at a company event in Las Vegas.\nThe connection to the cloud will be fast and lightweight, making it a good fit for devices that have limited memory, processing power, or battery life, Amazon said.\nThe global market for \"Internet of Things\", the concept of connecting everyday devices to the Internet, will nearly triple to $1.7 trillion by 2020, research firm International Data Corp has estimated.\nTechnology firms including Google Inc, Intel Corp , Cisco Systems Inc, Samsung Electronics and telecoms majors such as Vodafone and Verizon are betting heavily on the relatively new technology to drive revenue and profit in the future.\nMicrosoft Corp also launched an IoT suite last week.\nAmazon said on Thursday there were no minimum fees for AWS IoT and customers using the service will have to only pay for what they use.\nThe prices will be determined on the number of messages, defined by Amazon as a 512-byte block of data, exchanged between devices and AWS IoT.\nAmazon said it would offer customers 250,000 free messages per month, for 12 months. Prices start at $5 for every million messages, the company said.\nFortune reported on Monday that Amazon planned to announce a cloud-based service for the \"Internet of Things\".
