Man, they have to start from the bottom - Grade R - never mind about introducing Mandarin - concentrate on what is the basic requirement for life after school the three R's reading writing and arithmetic.\nSo it was and so it ever shall be. I don't agree with the violence though - come on guys pull yourselves together and show the world that you are mature enough to study and get that degree and then our country will be strong, Right now it is no better than during apartheid.
