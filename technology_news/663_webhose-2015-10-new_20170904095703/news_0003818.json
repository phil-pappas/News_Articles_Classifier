A 2014 report from Cisco adds further validation of mobile computing’s \ndominance, stating that global mobile data traffic is projected to grow tenfold between 2013 and \n2018 — from 1.5 exabytes per month to 15 exabytes per month. \nAs if it weren’t challenging enough to reach today’s consumers, Google’s introduction of AMP \n(Accelerated Mobile Pages), an open-source program designed to speed up mobile website load \ntimes, has some marketers up in arms. Put simply, faster load times equals less time for ads to \npopulate mobile web pages. In fact, Google admits that it is not sure exactly how advertising will \nwork within AMP, and it admits that pages will load content before advertising. \nAlthough several details still need to be worked out, Google stressed that publishers using AMP \nwill be free to use Google’s ad tools — as well as third-party companies’ tools — to sell \nadvertising alongside their content. “Publishers control their business model and who they work \nwith to sell ads,” said Richard Gingras, Google’s senior director of news and social products. \nNot everyone sees the new project as a death knell for mobile advertising. There are some, like \nJellyfish Online Marketing (www.jellyfish.net), that view things differently. One of the biggest \nmobile marketing challenges in recent years has stemmed from consumers using ad-blocking \ntools on their mobile devices. Such tools are largely used for the purpose of speeding up web \nloading times, which are a top concern for those on 3G networks and/or using legacy \nsmartphones or tablets. \nThe Google AMP project will eliminate the need for bandwidth workaround tools, such as ad \nblockers, and will lead to new opportunities for marketers to reach their target audiences. As a \nleading, multinational, digital marketing company that’s been around for more than 16 years, \nJellyfish Online Marketing understands the needs of mobile users and marketers alike. In fact, \nwe’ve developed our own responsive design technology to facilitate an improved user experience \nacross a range of mobile devices. \nFurther, we work closely with Google, which is evidenced by our co-hosted mobile event earlier \nthis year and by the various thought leadership articles we’ve produced that speak to a myriad of \nGoogle topics ranging from algorithm updates (e.g. Panda 3.0) to analytics. Anytime Google \nmakes an update or change — especially one that directly affects SEO best practices — you can \nexpect doomsayers to lament the good ‘ole days when marketing was so much simpler. While \ntheir claims may be partially true, the reality is that with the right attitude (and some expert \nguidance), simpler times can lead to better times — and better results for marketers and \nconsumers alike.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:39:58.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
