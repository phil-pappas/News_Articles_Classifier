That can include a person's birthdate, place of birth, or the answers to other common security questions. Such scams can usually be prevented with multi-factor authentication, or the use of a secondary device to confirm login attempts.\n  Hackers announced this week that they accessed CIA Director John Brennan's personal AOL email account through a similar social engineering scheme. Instead of using social media, they contacted Verizon and tricked workers into providing a few details on his personal life.\nThe threat of password theft through social engineering is incredibly potent following the breach of the Office of Personnel Management by hackers linked to the Chinese government. Experts have suggested they expect China is going to begin an aggressive campaign to hack the more than 21 million people whose information was included in the database.\nExperts have pointed to Brennan as an example in how a person can lose their credentials from even an unsophisticated social engineering scam. \"Attacks against personal email aren't new – going back to 2008, a vice presidential candidate's email account was compromised by an attacker who social engineered the password reset features,\" said Ed Cabrera, the VP of cybersecurity strategy at cyber firm TrendMicro. \"Social engineering is a common means to target webmail accounts.\"\nCabrera also emphasized the simple steps that could be taken to protect against such attacks. \"Users should use two-factor authentication where they can and select security questions that can't be answered based on easy-to-find information,\" he said.\nBrennan's email was allegedly accessed by teenagers, at least one of whom claims to be as young as thirteen. In an an interview with Vice Friday, he said he had not told his parents about his activity, but said government officials \"are pretty mad lol.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Lois Lerner escapes as press focuses on baby Hitler The press was far more interested in the fate of baby Adolph Hitler than that of the IRS's Lois Lerner.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/23/15 5:30 PM The ability to \"hack\" America's top spy using a technique that requires no technical ability may be helpful in illustrating the comparative power China now possesses to hack those whose information was included in the OPM breach. For intelligence officials who had their information stolen and who continue to provide excessive information about themselves online, the eventual theft of their virtual credentials is almost a certainty.\nHowever, the threat doesn't end with victims of the OPM breach. It extends to every individual listed on the SF86 forms that applicants for security clearances are required to submit. That includes family members, neighbors and other associates.\nIn an interview with the Washington Examiner , National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina pointed out the implications of that fact. \"Their kids are on those forms,\" Evanina said. \"Our foreign adversaries and hackers who are looking to obtain our information do not have to be very sophisticated. They just need to be successful with some spearphishing attacks.\"\n\"We hope that this awareness campaign will make you think twice, and provide some tools to protect against clicking links that could potentially manifest in malware, whether it be in the private sector, in the government, or in your home,\" Evanina concluded.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574468 The NCSC provides support to the counterintelligence and security activities of the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. government, and U.S. private sector entities against threats of intelligence collection or attack by foreign adversaries.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner WH Correspondents chief gets a raise despite complaints The Association has been criticized for not giving enough money to scholarships to young reporters.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/23/15 6:22 PM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:43:17.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
