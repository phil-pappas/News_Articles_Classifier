Govender’s wife and sons watched in horror as he was gunned down in his Killarney Isles home while he tried to protect them.\nA police source previously told The Witness that seven men entered the property after cutting through its electric fence. Once inside, the family was woken up and a struggle ensued, with gunshots being fired by both parties.\nGovender died at the scene while the men, two of them with minor gunshot wounds, retreated from the house with R300 worth of items.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:02:49.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
