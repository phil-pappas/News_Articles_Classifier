Another threatens to contact family and friends using social media, suggesting their passwords are not secure.\nSgt Blundell says the Ashley Madison scam is among a number of dodgy operations causing concern, including one where an elderly woman was duped into paying almost $500,000 to a bogus government department.\nThe woman, aged in her 70s, received letters from Reclaim Department Australia telling her she was entitled to various sums of money once she made a final payment for application charges.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:46.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
