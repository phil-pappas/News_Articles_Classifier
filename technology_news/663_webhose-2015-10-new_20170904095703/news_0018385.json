You may have heard that they're trending right now. \"Adult coloring books\" are flying off the shelves, reaching new audiences left and right. The reason? Somebody (in France, in 2013) thought to slap the label \"anti-stress\" onto something that has existed forever. \nFrance is one of the most depressed countries in the world . According to a study, more than 20 percent of French people have depression. Following them is the United States. Is it any wonder that a beloved childhood activity rebranded as a stress fighter is succeeding in these two countries? \nAnd succeeding it is. As I write this, four of the top 20 bestselling books on Amazon US are coloring books. Earlier in the summer, there were multiple coloring books all in the top ten. August 2 of this year was named the first ever National Coloring Book Day. Parade devoted an issue to them. Michael's is gearing up for coloring books to be the hot Christmas gift of choice for those in the know this winter. Adult coloring books are crazy popular right now. \nSomething that has been really interesting to me as I follow this hobby (and, I admit, participate in it) is how such a low-tech hobby can coexist – even thrive – with our high-tech world. Coloring Meetups \nColoring is, by its very definition, a solitary hobby. That's part of the stress-relieving appeal. You slow down, switch off your smart phone, pull out your books and colored pencils or markers and quietly create something. \nOr is it? Coloring clubs are popping up all over the United States , in cafes and in libraries, in bookstores and community centers. Some are free events that are BYOB – bring your own (coloring) books – and others are extravagant, paid \"coloring and cocktails\" events promoted in the same way as those wine and paint night events you've probably seen your Facebook friends participating in. People are using social sites like Facebook or Meetup to organize events and bring together people from all backgrounds for a friendly night of coloring and conversation. Coloring Communities \nStill, some people prefer the quiet nature of coloring on their own, and that's fine. But that doesn't mean they're cut off. There are whole coloring communities appearing on sites like Reddit. One particularly active group, /r/Coloringbookspastime , has over 400 subscribers who regularly share works in progress and finished works of art. \nPinterest, of course, is also emerging as a leader in the coloring books space – a quick search will reveal just how popular coloring books are on the social network. Makes sense, for a female-dominated, craft-related activity. Digital Coloring \nDigital coloring programs have existed for as long as I remember – in fact, I seem to remember that one of my favorite computer games as a 5 or 6 year old child was a click-to-color Mickey Mouse Windows game. (I know, I'm going way back!) But, with the recent coloring craze, it makes sense that one of these programs would become an app aimed at adults, and indeed it has! \nColorfy is a free app for both Android and iOS . It offers in-app purchases to unlock more coloring pages and – in a move that was met with skepticism from a lot of users – unlock more color palettes. The app gives you ways to share your completed work with friends or over social media, which its users love. See some of the things you can do with this app by checking out their Twitter hashtag . A Coloring Book for Everything \nDover Publishing used to be the one major publisher of adult coloring books. They had major lines ranging from fashion to history; Creative Haven, another line of theirs, was geared more towards art hobbyists, with thicker pages and single-sided printing fit for markers. \nNow, the selection has expanded immensely. While I am still a huge fan of Dover and Creative Haven, there is truly an adult coloring book for everything – from imaginary cities to Grumpy Cat to sea monsters. There are even coloring books coming out for Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, and Harry Potter. \nOverall, adult coloring has clearly made a very successful jump to reach a brand new generation. It is interesting to see where this mix of high tech and low tech will take us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:05:47.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
