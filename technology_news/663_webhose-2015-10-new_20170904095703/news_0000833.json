The feature, previously available to move data to the Cloud on Office 365, will now allow IT Administrators to experience unprecedentedly fast data transfer when migrating SharePoint locally. With transfer speeds up to 10x the previous records, Sharegate states once again its position as a major industry player. This puts the company's offering in direct line with Microsoft recent announcements around SharePoint 2016 and the upcoming migrations to this new version.\nTo Quote: Simon De Baene, Sharegate's CEO: \"Microsoft made it clear that on-premises SharePoint environments are here to stay. With the hybrid deployment model, it was only logical we'd double our efforts to provide the fastest migration possible both locally and to the Cloud.\"\nThis removes a major pain point, as the time required for a SharePoint upgrade or deployment is a primary concern when undertaking a migration project. With this announcement, along with their exponential growth, market acquisition and close work with Microsoft over the last year, there is every reason to believe that Sharegate is the go-to management tool for SharePoint and Office 365 alike.\n\"We want to provide the simplest solution to move and secure SharePoint to spare IT unnecessary hassle. Because their migrations are running smoothly and rapidly, they can get back home in time and sleep tight.\" added Simon De Baene.\nAbout Sharegate\nSharegate simplifies management tasks for SharePoint, Office 365, and OneDrive for Business for thousands of administrators and IT professionals around the world.
