Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $14.83 billion.\nThe semiconductor giant's shares, up 1.8% over the past year, added 2 cents to $32.06 in recent after-hours trading.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif., company's biggest business remains chips that power PCs, a sector that continued to struggle in the latest quarter, with IDC and rival Gartner both reporting that shipments declined in the period and received little help from the release of Microsoft Corp.'s new Windows 10 operating system.\nBuyers also may be putting off purchases until the arrival of PCs built with Skylake, a long-awaited overhaul of Intel's flagship Core line of microprocessors, which aren't expected to reach many consumers until later this fall.\nIn the latest quarter, revenue in the company's client computing group, which includes PCs, fell 7.5% to $8.51 billion.\nIntel continued to post sales growth in its data center group and Internet of Things unit, which includes chips for just about everything but computers.\nData center segment sales grew 12% to $4.14 billion, while sales in the Internet of Things unit increased nearly 10% to $581 million.\nOverall, Intel reported a profit of $3.11 billion, or 64 cents a share, down from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue decreased 0.6% to $14.47 billion from $14.55 billion.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 59 cents and revenue of $14.22 billion. The semiconductor giant in July projected revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.\nGross margin fell to 63% from 65%.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 13, 2015 16:33 ET (20:33 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:07:12.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
