But what if that officer is responding to a report of a sexual assault? \n\"That police officer is in a position to capture incredibly important evidence that can be used in a prosecution — that can be used against whoever it was who violated this person,\" Hoffman said. \n\"But that police officer may be asked by someone who has just been victimized, 'Please turn the camera off.' What does he do? That is a difficult question.\" RELATED: What you need to know about police body cams and your rights in N.J. \nHoffman's comments came during a discussion dubbed \"Law and Justice in the 21st Century,\" which brought together the state's top law enforcement officials, including the attorney general, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, state director of the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness Chris Rodriguez and Richard Frankel, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark field office. \nThe four addressed hot-button issues, from body cameras and challenges created by new cell phone encryption technologies to the debate between surveillance and protecting civil liberties. \n\"I do think there is a tension (between liberty and security), but I don't think it's an irreconcilable tension,\" Fishman said during the panel, later adding: \"The law enforcement officials I deal with on a daily basis are very attuned, and very sensitive to those concerns.\" \nHe said technology is always shifting the playing field, however. \nFishman said it has long been \"an accepted and lawful constitutional technique for law enforcement\" to obtain warrants to wiretap a phone or read text messages. But amid concerns over government snooping, many telecommunications companies have made it so they're not even capable of cooperating with police. \nRodriguez raised the example of Apple's iPhone, which uses technology that makes it difficult even with a warrant to monitor messages sent between devices. \n\"Not only is there end-to-end encryption on iMessaging, but Apple actually throws away the key,\" he said. \nLaw enforcement officials nationally have been raising alarm bells about the dangers of encryption, but technology experts — including scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — have argued against handing over the keys to communications systems to law enforcement, claiming it would make those same systems vulnerable to hacking. \nLaw enforcement's surveillance of civilian activities has also become controversial since the revelations of National Security Administration documents leaked by former security contractor Edward Snowden , who revealed widespread government spying programs. \nBut Frankel, of the FBI, claimed law enforcement agencies do their homework to make sure investigations pass constitutional muster. \n\"We must get court orders, warrants, subpoenas, going through the U.S. Attorney's Office, going through a judge, on those type of surveillances,\" Frankel said. \"We don't just do it willy-nilly. We will make sure when we go out there, that this will stand up to a review at a later time.\" \nS.P. Sullivan may be reached at ssullivan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter .
