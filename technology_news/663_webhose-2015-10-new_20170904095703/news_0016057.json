ACE, the major coordinating body for all the nation’s higher education institutions, seeks to provide leadership and a unifying voice on key higher educa¬tion issues and to influence public policy through advocacy, research, and program initiatives. “After the American Council on Education recommended our CISSP course in August, we’re pleased that another one of (ISC)²’s award-winning educational courses – the Official (ISC)² CBK Training Seminar for the SSCP – is now eligible for college credit,” said David Shearer, CEO, (ISC)². “Both SSCPs and CISSPs speak the same cyber, information, software and infrastructure security language, yet each have unique perspectives that complement each other across various IT departments, business lines and businesses. Security practitioners with more hands-on technical, operational security roles now have the opportunity to learn and prepare for the SSCP examination, while simultaneously earning credit towards their degree. This accomplishment is part of our overarching goal to continually enhance educational offerings from the organization for global professionals.”\nACE CREDIT helps adults gain academic credit for courses and examinations taken outside traditional degree programs. More than 2,000 colleges and universities consider ACE CREDIT recommendations in determining the applicability of coursework and examination results to their courses and degree programs.\nFor 40 years, colleges and universities have trusted ACE CREDIT to provide reliable course equivalency information to facilitate their decisions to award academic credit.
