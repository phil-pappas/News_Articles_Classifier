As far as race goes,It is easy to define, blacks, whites,Indians because their origins are from a single race. However the coloured race originates from mixed race interactions between various groups including blacks, the Dutch, the Khoi and San people.\nOfficially classified as a race group in South Africa, majority of coloured people see themselves as exactly that \"COLOURED\". Some define themselves as black and that is perfectly fine. Coloured people were treated a little better than black people in apartheid South Africa, that was the way the system was designed; it was law to have people of different races be separated geographically and economically.\nTo the white people in the apartheid era, coloured people were not white enough;and sadly in a democratic South Africa, they are either not black enough OR \"they think they are white\" OR \"they must just accept that they are black just like us\". WHY...WHY must coloured people \"realise they are black\"? I find the latest need to want the coloured people to define themselves as black, quite disturbing. Why bring the ugly racism into it, they are South African, they are coloured and that is perfectly fine. Why the need to define themselves the way OTHERS want???\nThe fact that some of us as black people want to define them along the black and white lines has racial undertones, and that must be called to order. There are many,many different types and shades of coloured people. Physically some look just like any black person you can meet, and some look completely white,but there are many variations of coloured person in-between. The coloured people I have spoken to don't even define themselves as coloured because of their skin tone or the texture of their hair; they define themselves as coloured because of their being...Being coloured is in them, they don't identify with any blackness or whiteness. They are coloured and THAT'S THAT.\nThey may speak Afrikaans, the language which many black South Africans have an issue with,that is the language they inherited...not by choice.We have our vernacular languages, whether we like Afrikaans or not, it is the mother tongue for majority of the coloured people.\nThe apartheid government used the divide and conquer tactic, now it looks like the same is happening in the new South Africa.\nLet coloured people define themselves as they wish. It is a free country after all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:08:10.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
