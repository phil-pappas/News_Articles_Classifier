Every other capital city in Australia has the service.\nTen months later and Google and PTV are both blaming each other for a stuff-up with the data.\n\"The data provided by PTV doesn't currently meet the quality requirements for Google Transit,\" a spokesman for Google told The Age .\nAdvertisement \"PTV and Google continue to work together to fast-track the availability of transport information in Victoria.\"\nIn March 2015, some six months ago, Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Reddit Google Maps integration was on its way.\nIn correspondence this month with user Phillip Malone, who was complaining about the lack of public transport directions, Google expanded on the problem. Mr Malone later posted the exchange on Facebook .\n\"The folks from PTV have provided us with their transit information. However, currently we are facing a block due to which the process to integrate their data on Maps is being shelved temporarily.\n\"We are trying our best to improve the quality of the GTFS (general transit feed specification) feed and to ensure that it conforms with the GTFS. At this point, it is difficult to assume when the feed will be ready for production. But please understand, we are exploring options to make the data live soon.\"\nGTFS is a data format for public transportation timetables and associated geographic information.\nPublic Transport Victoria has a very different take. The agency says it's all Google's fault.\n\"It is Victorian government policy to release relevant data in a format that is accessible for everyone, not in formats specified by individual organisations and developers,\" a spokesman for the agency told The Age .\n\"PTV released its timetable data in GTFS format on 1 April, 2015, and this is being used by Triptastic, Travic, Bing and here.com in their digital applications and websites.\n\"Google has additional data requirements beyond GTFS for its transit application, and PTV is working with Google to provide that data in a timely manner.\"\nWhoever is at fault, the impasse is depriving Victorians of access to a service the rest of Australia takes for granted.\nGoogle uses the GTFS data format to allow timetable data – stop locations, timetables, route maps – into Google Maps, which comes standard on many mobile phones.\nWith Melbourne's GTFS incorporated, Melburnians would be able to select two points on a map and have Google plan a bus, tram and train journey for them.\nMelbourne has had a long and troubled relationship with GTFS data. Public Transport Victoria for years refused to release the data in GTFS format, claiming that other data formats were just fine.\nThen, finally, the new Labor government announced the data would be reformatted to GTFS and released. But it seems even that has not been enough.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/mollyfud/posts/10153806360287481?utm_source=ausdroid.net", "http://i.imgur.com/c0EPbUP.png", "https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/30s21q/weve_released_the_ptv_data/"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:03:06.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
