Two rambunctious young stars are destroying their natal dust cloud with powerful jets of radiation. “The seemingly random fluctuations we see from the black holes and white dwarfs look remarkably similar to those from the young stellar objects,” said Dr Vaughan. “It is only the tempo that changes.” To explain, the team targeted accretion discs as their object of study as it produced brightness variations around astronomical objects and provided a common ground of study. The instruments put to use were NASA’s Kepler/K2 and ULTRACAM – a superfast camera taking 500 pictures per second in three colours. ESO’s Very Large Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope were also involved in the process.
