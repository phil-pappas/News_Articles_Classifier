(www.nest.com) makes it possible for the products and services that people use everyday to interact with Nest devices. \nBy connecting their Nest Learning Thermostat ® through the WeatherBug Home Connect feature in the popular WeatherBug app, customers can access personalized insights that show how hard a home’s HVAC system is working to keep them comfortable given the weather -- a key driver of heating and cooling use. WeatherBug Home’s thermostat temperature analytics estimate daily and monthly HVAC costs, as well as energy use, by thermodynamically modeling energy used against current and forecasted weather – the only outdoor and indoor weather analysis on home energy usage. These analytics leverage patent-pending algorithms that integrate WeatherBug’s hyper-local weather data with information from Nest APIs to seamlessly provide new insights to Nest customers in the WeatherBug app, so the daily check of the weather can now include a home comfort and energy usage assessment. \nTo get these real-time weather-energy analytics, Nest customers must download the WeatherBug app, and activate the WeatherBug Home Connect feature for Nest. \n“With our new Works with Nest integration, Nest customers will have immediate insight into how the current weather is impacting their energy usage, costs and carbon footprint– turning the smart home into a smarter home,” said Bob Marshall, chief executive officer, Earth Networks. “By empowering consumers to make informed home energy management decisions through real-time analysis of how weather impacts their energy usage, WeatherBug Home can provide customers with a whole new level of energy efficiency and comfort.” \nAbout Earth Networks: Powering WeatherBug & WeatherBug Home \nFor 20 years, we have been Taking the Pulse of the Planet® using the world’s largest weather, lightning and greenhouse gas monitoring networks.
