The animals wait patiently as he pulls a wooden trough from a nearby thicket and then starts digging in the sand.\nAfter about five minutes Lekula hears a splash. The sound is now so familiar to his goats that they circle around him as he scoops water from the hole in the sand into a trough for them to drink.\nFor the pastoralists of Lemishami in Ol Donyiro ward, which lies 115km from the town of Isiolo in Kenya's arid eastern region, the sand dam is a lifesaver.\nBuilt across the Raap River, the simple wall catches water and silt that flows down from a nearby mountain range. As sand accumulates at the wall, it traps water and holds it through much of the dry season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:12:42.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
