One of these new land-use concepts is to develop a platform above part of the container port on which port-related and industrial developments, such as container freight stations, logistic hubs and other facilities, can be developed to intensify land-use. \n“The above-ground space development over part of the new mega container port could create significant land area for the development of a cluster of maritime and port business activities, including amenities and possibly commercial-residential areas for those working in the area to form a component of the future Tuas Maritime Hub.” \nThe MPA recently announced the construction of the terminal, which is anticipated to cost around US$1.8 billion and involves reclaiming around 300 ha of land in order for dredging work to begin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:16:06.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
