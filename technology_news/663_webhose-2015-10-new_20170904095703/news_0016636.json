Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by David Ramli ï»¿\nAmaysim chief executive Julian Ogrin is confident the company's low-cost offerings and larger download allowances will allow it to meet and possibly beat its target of 1 million mobile customers by 2019, despite rising competition in the telecommunications market.\nAmaysim is a mobile service reseller that has enjoyed steady share price growth since its launch onto the Australian Securities Exchange in July. The company has over 718,000 customers using the Singtel-Optus network with a market capitalisation of $408 million.\nSpeaking to Fairfax Media in his first interview since Amaysim listed on the ASX, Mr Ogrin said organic growth would be the main focus for the next 12 months along with major marketing pushes and new offers, rather than growing through acquisition.\n\"We've got 160 full time employees in our three floors and that includes our contact centre,\" he said. \"We only need a handful of extra staff - and I'm talking less than 10 - to manage 1 million extra customers.\n\"We've now built a [cloud based IT system] that can manage three time the customer base, so well over 2 million customers ... so we're at a point where it's all about scale now.\"\nShifting goalposts Amaysim co-founder Rolf Hansen had previously set the target of hitting 1 million customers by mid-2015. But the company's prospectus to potential investors reduced these forecasts to 875,000 by mid-2016 and 1 million by mid-2019.\n Mr Ogrin said that the earlier claims were part of aggressive internal goals set by Amaysim's management, which had to be reduced as part of the shift to being a publicly listed company.\n\"When you're a private company you have very big internal ambitions and goals,\" he said. \"You get excited about your growth and you set big, hairy goals and essentially you're not accountable to anyone, only yourself.\n\"It's part of us now growing up - we're now the fourth-largest mobile carrier in Australia and we have to go into public life.\"\nThe prospectus targets remain the benchmark for judging Amaysim's success. But Mr Ogrin described them as \"conservative\" and said the company remained confident it could match and beat them over the coming years.\nLow-cost rivals TPG Telecom recently signed a deal with Vodafone Hutchison Australia to launch low-cost mobile services across Australia and the main carriers such as Telstra and Optus are both raising the amount of data and quality of content being offered to subscribers.\nBut the Amaysim chief executive said he was confident the junior telco's niche of the market was sustainable thanks to its highly-automated customer service systems and partnership with Optus, which recently raised its network investments .\nA key to the company's growth is the rise of Bring-Your-Own (BYO) device plans where customers buy smartphones and shop around for mobile service plans. This reduces the customer's loyalty to any one telco and makes users more willing to switch providers.\nMr Ogrin said bigger telcos like Telstra and Optus would pass on the rising cost of smartphones like Apple's iPhone 6s to consumers, which in turn would make them less attractive.\n\"When we launched here BYO was less than 20 per cent [of the market],\" he said. \"Now it's sized at 45 per cent of the market and in two years it'll be the most dominant product category in the market with people moving to month-to-month plans.\n\"I just can't see it being sustainable [for telcos] to subsidise $1300 devices.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.watoday.com.au/business/the-economy/telstra-ceo-andy-penn-to-sacrifice-profits-for-growth-20150930-gjyjal.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/vodafone-hutchison-australia-announces-1-billion-15year-deal-with-tpg-telecom-20150929-gjxs3c.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-10-12T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:21:24.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
