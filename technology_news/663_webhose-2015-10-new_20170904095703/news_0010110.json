The consulting services will help organizations tackle the complexity of data lake management and take full advantage of big data. Many organizations have found that it is relatively easy to download Hadoop software for free, and then load their data. What is far more difficult is to gain a competitive advantage from analyzing big data. The problem is compounded as a result of the current shortage of talented individuals with Hadoop skills. Organizations need individuals who understand the complexities of building and operating distributed systems, and have experience with managing systems at scale. Think Big consulting teams can manage data lakes and build applications with their highly trained and field-tested engineers, developers, and data scientists. \"Think Big Managed Services for Hadoop help customers drive business results by building an analytical ecosystem that ensures data quality, reliability, and day-to-day completion of operational tasks,\" said Ron Bodkin , president, Think Big. \"Hadoop is a maturing technology with a range of challenges. Think Big offers world-class service to help customers address the common Hadoop platform and application challenges. Think Big Managed Services for Hadoop provide experienced operations and application support for the major Apache™ Hadoop® distributions, including Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, as well as, Spark, Kafka, NoSQL, and other open source technologies. The comprehensive set of Think Big Managed Services includes staff augmentation, administration, monitoring, and support for Hadoop platforms on commodity hardware, a Teradata appliance, or cloud infrastructure. Think Big offers flexible support options ranging from an eight-hour shift to complete 24x7 coverage. In addition, Think Big services can develop new and custom applications that explore and derive value from big data in new ways. \"A concise search on a popular career development site shows more than 26,000 job openings requiring some level of Hadoop knowledge or experience, but it's very unlikely these positions will be filled any time soon,\" said Robin Bloor , chief analyst and co-founder, Bloor Group. \"I consult with organizations all the time that have embarked on a big data adventure, but lack guidance to make their journey successful. Think Big Managed Services for Hadoop provide that guidance for administration and development.\" The managed services are available worldwide from Think Big, and jointly offered with Teradata Professional Services.
