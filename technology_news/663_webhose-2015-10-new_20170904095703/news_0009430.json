Read full disclaimer . Before trading FX/CFDs you should be aware of all the risks associated with trading FXCM AU's products and read and consider the Financial Services Guide , Product Disclosure Statement and Terms of Business issued by FXCM AU, none of which have been updated to reflect the content of the above announcement. FXCM AU is regulated by ASIC [AFSL#309763]. \nExecution: FXCM aggregates bid and ask prices from a pool of liquidity providers and is the final counterparty when trading forex on FXCM's dealing desk and No Dealing Desk (NDD) execution models. With NDD, FXCM's platforms display the best-available direct bid and ask prices from the liquidity providers. In some circumstances, FXCM may add a markup to NDD spreads, based on account type. In addition to the spread, the trading cost with NDD is a fixed lot-based commission at the open and close of the trade. With dealing desk execution, FXCM can act as the dealer on any or all currency pairs. Backup liquidity providers fill in when FXCM does not act as the dealer. FXCM’s dealing desk has fewer liquidity providers than NDD. There are many other factors to consider when choosing an execution model (such as conflict of interest, trading style or strategy). See Execution Risks. Note: Contractual relationships with liquidity providers are consolidated through the firm's U.S. affiliate, Forex Capital Markets, LLC, which, in turn, provides technology and pricing to the group affiliate entities. See Execution Risks . \nMini Accounts: Mini accounts offer 22 CFD instruments and up to 19 currency pairs (GBP/AUD is only available on AUD denominated accounts). Mini accounts default to dealing desk execution where price arbitrage strategies are prohibited. FXCM determines, at its sole discretion, what encompasses a price arbitrage strategy. Mini accounts utilising prohibited strategies may be switched to No Dealing Desk execution. Mini accounts with equity less than 10,000 CCY have 400:1 forex leverage; between 10,000 and 20,000, have 200:1; more than 20,000, have 100:1 leverage and No Dealing Desk execution.
