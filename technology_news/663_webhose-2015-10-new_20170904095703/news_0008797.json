In addition to providing relevant news to our consumers, it provides sought-after video placement opportunities for our advertisers.\" \nAfter a successful trial run on the website of its Memphis-based station, WMC Action News 5, Raycom sought a larger distribution of Newsy videos across its properties. Now, the agreement secures placement of multiple Newsy videos in the daily video module on each of Raycom's news channels' websites. Raycom Media stations cover 13.1% of US television households. \n\"Raycom Media has a strong reputation for serving consumers and advertisers with relevant content in its local communities,\" said Blake Sabatinelli, general manager of Newsy . \"Partnering with Newsy is a natural next step in delivering the stories that consumers are seeking from today's news providers in a compelling digital experience.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:59:08.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
