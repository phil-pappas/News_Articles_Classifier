This year Production Resource Group L.L.C. (PRG) is showcasing cutting edge developments that continue to provide practical yet inventive solutions to the unique challenges of production. PRG understands that true innovation must enable producers, designers, gaffers, cinematographers and technicians to work smarter - to accomplish more, with greater efficiency, at lower costs. Those visiting the PRG Solutions Studio at booth #1438 during LDI will be among the first to experience such solutions. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151023/279934 \nOne of the innovations making it's debut at LDI is the PRG GroundControl((TM)) Remote Followspot System((TM)). Followspot control hasn't changed for decades. It's time to take the truss spot operator out of the truss and put him on the ground where it's safer and more efficient to operate the followspot. \nThe PRG GroundControl System allows a technician to remotely operate a high output PRG Bad Boy(Â®) Spot automated luminaire as a followspot from up to 2,000' away. Designers now have total creative freedom to put followspots in places that were either previously unusable or involved complex rigging. With the GroundControl Remote Followspot System, the operator is on the ground so the physical footprint of the luminaire is just 30 inches round and weighs only 172 lbs. Because of this small footprint and low weight, luminaires can now be placed in a wide variety of positions. \nWith regards to scenic automation, PRG has two new innovations: the V-Command((TM)) Automation Controller and the SpeedStar((TM)) Variable Speed Chain Hoist. \nThe PRG V-Command Automation Console has a smaller footprint but all of the power and funstionality of the PRG Commander Automation Console, As a full-featured addition to the PRG Stage Command System, the V-Command adds precision tactile control with keys, faders, and encoders to any computer running the new PRG Commander V6.x software. Programming and execution of motion is intuitive to new users, yet familiar to the more experienced programmer. \nPRG is also introducing the SpeedStar Variable Speed Chain Hoist. Working closely with Columbus McKinnon, PRG has added variable speed control, built-in load cells, and fast, smooth, and quiet operation. The SpeedStar has the quality of CM paired with the power of PRG's Stage Command System, which has been performing flawlessly for over 25 years on Broadway, in corporate projects, television productions, and concert touring. The SpeedStar motors are available for use with metric 1/2 and 1 ton loads. (500 and 1,000 Kg / 1,102 and 2,204 Lbs.) As it's name implies, the SpeedStar is built for speed - The 1/2 ton is 0-22 inches per second (0-110 feet per minute) and the 1 ton is 0-11 inches per second (0-55 feet per minute.) \nFor film and television projects, PRG will be demonstrating the OverDrive((TM)) Digital Lighting Solution. The PRG OverDrive system offers cinematographers and lighting directors the flexibility to use LED video modules and luminaires to create digital lighting effects, reflections, and skies in an easy and flexible way, live with performers. By using LED panels to provide digital fill light on talent or vehicles paired with a high-resolution LED screen for the background allow filmmakers the ability to create lighting and motion effects in camera while shooting. There's no need to fix it in post with time-consuming and expensive visual effects technologies. \nAlso at LDI will be the PRG RH+A will be introducing the new Line Dim ReNEW((TM)) LED Retrofit Assembly in booth #1830. Now the well regarded ReNEW can be controlled from any standard dimmer, without the need for DMX control. Perfect for retrofits, the Line Dim ReNEW can be dropped onto any ETC Source Four lens tube assembly and controlled quickly and easily. \nRH+A will also show new features and improvements to their popular LED Bullet((TM)) line of compact LED luminaires. The line, which includes a daylight and tungsten white light version and a powerful UV blacklight spot, has been installed in a wide variety of themed entertainment, retail, and architectural lighting projects. New power supplies for the LED Bullets let designers and technicians mix and match different fixture types on one power supply as well as outdoor rated versions are available. \nThe main PRG booth, #1438 will be hosting Spanish language demonstrations with professional translators at each of the three product areas of the our booth on Friday Oct. 23(rd) and Saturday Oct. 24(th) from 2:00pm - 3:00pm. \nThe PRG Solutions Studio at LDI 2015 is all about true creative freedom and will highlight technology that interacts and enables production technology to not simply be a creative tool but an active element of the audience experience. PRG's work smarter solutions were designed to address today's complex practical production needs with truly uncompromising commitment to innovation, value, and performance. \nFor more information on PRG, please visit www.prg.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:22:56.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
