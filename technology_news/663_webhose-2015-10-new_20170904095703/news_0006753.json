Reuters/Tobias Schwarz \nInternational Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) posted a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue for the fifth straight quarter, hurt by a strong U.S. dollar, and cut its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares lower. \nIt was the 14th quarter in a row that IBM has posted a reduction in revenue, as the world's largest technology services company gets rid of low-margin businesses and looks to expand its more lucrative cloud computing business, helping companies manage their data remotely. \nShares of IBM fell 4.8 percent in after-hours trading to $141.95. \n\"This is another example of the massive headwinds that large-cap traditional tech stalwarts are seeing in this ever-changing environment, as more customers move to the cloud,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. \nChina was particularly hard hit, with fewer big deals causing revenue from that country to fall 17 percent, IBM's chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts. \nIBM lowered its full-year 2015 operating profit forecast to a range of $14.75 to $15.75 per share from $15.75 to $16.50. Analysts on average were expecting $15.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company is shifting away from hardware to the cloud, much like established rivals such as Oracle Corp ( ORCL.N ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ). Each is striving to boost Internet-based software and services sales to compete with Salesforce.com Inc ( CRM.N ) and Amazon.com Inc's ( AMZN.O ) web software unit. \nIn August, IBM said it would buy medical image company Merge Healthcare Inc MRGE.O in a $1-billion deal and combine it with its newly formed health analytics unit, which is powered by its famous Watson supercomputer. \nRevenue from what the company calls \"strategic imperatives,\" which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 17 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30. \nYet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. The company known as 'Big Blue' has been selling low-margin businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services. \nThe sale of these businesses and a strong dollar ate into revenue. IBM's total revenue fell 13.9 percent to $19.28 billion in the quarter, while analysts on average were expecting $19.62 billion. \nArmonk, New York-based IBM gets more than half its revenue from overseas. The average value of the dollar .DXY against a basket of currencies in the third quarter was about 17 percent higher than the same quarter last year. \nEven adjusted for currency and divestitures, the company's revenue fell 1 percent. \nIBM's net income from continuing operations fell to $2.96 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $3.46 billion, or $3.46 per share, a year earlier. \nConsolidated net income rose to $2.95 billion, or $3.01 per share, from $18 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. \nLast year profit was hurt by non recurring pre-tax charge of $3.3 billion, net of tax, for discontinued operations. \nExcluding items, IBM earned $3.34 per share from continuing operations in the latest quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of $3.30 per share. \nUp to Monday's close, IBM's shares had fallen about 7 percent this year. \n(Reporting by Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Writing by Bill Rigby ; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Christian Plumb ) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:40:48.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
