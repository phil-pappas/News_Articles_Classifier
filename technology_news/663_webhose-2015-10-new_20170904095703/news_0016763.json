Mr. Jason C.S. Chang , Chairman of Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (TAIEX stock code: 2311, NYSE: ASX) (\" ASE \" or \" we \"), together with Chief Operating Officer Mr. Tien Wu and Chief Financial Officer Mr. Joseph Tung , met with Mr. Bough Lin, Chairman of Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd (\" SPIL \"), to exchange ideas on the trends and developments in the global semiconductor industry as well as ASE's tender offer for SPIL common shares and American depositary shares (the \" Tender Offer \"):\nASE is regretful for not being able to discuss the Tender Offer with SPIL beforehand due to certain legal restrictions, which may have prohibited SPIL's management team from fully understanding the purpose of our Tender Offer. We sincerely hope that Chairman Lin and SPIL's management could understand our difficult position. With SPIL's employees and shareholders' rights and interests in mind, we are looking forward to building a foundation to explore avenues of cooperation with SPIL in the face of raising challenges from intensifying global competition and the trends of consolidation within the global semiconductor industry. On this note, we would like to reiterate that we will not intervene in SPIL's operations. We sincerely hope that both companies' management can build on their hard work over the past thirty years, and work towards enhancing the competitiveness of the Taiwan semiconductor testing industry as well as the overall economic development of Taiwan for a better future. ASE is not able to comment on the potential strategic benefits of the strategic alliance and vertical integration between SPIL and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (\" Hon Hai \"), as we do not have knowledge on the specific details of the strategic alliance arrangement. However, we believe that SPIL's proposed issuance of new shares to facilitate the share exchange with Hon Hai (the \" Hon Hai Deal \") would be dilutive for SPIL's existing shareholders. As we will not be able to exercise our voting right at SPIL's extraordinary shareholders' meeting scheduled on October 15, 2015 , we would like to express to Chairman Lin our strong objection against the Hon Hai Deal. We trust that Chairman Lin and SPIL's management team will take into account shareholders' rights and interests when the management seriously re-evaluates whether the Hon Hai Deal was truly necessary and appropriate, and whether the actions to implement the Hon Hai Deal were in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.
