(Nasdaq: LXRX ) today announced that data from the TELESTAR Phase 3 clinical study of telotristat etiprate has been accepted for presentation at the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society annual symposium to be held from October 15-17, in Austin, Texas . In addition, data from interviews with patients who completed the randomized treatment portion of the TELESTAR study will be presented for the first time in a poster session. \nTelotristat etiprate, which has received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is in development for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome in cancer patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by long-acting somatostatin analog therapy, the current standard of care. \nThe oral presentation, entitled \"Results of TELESTAR: A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Telotristat Etiprate in Patients with Carcinoid Syndrome Not Adequately Controlled by Somatostatin Analog,\" will be presented at the Clinical Science Symposium at 8:30 a.m. CDT, on October 16, by primary investigator, Matthew H. Kulke , M.D., Director, Program in Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors and Senior Physician, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School. \nThe poster, entitled \"Assessing Treatment Benefit of Telotristat Etiprate in Patients with Carcinoid Syndrome: Patient Exit Interviews,\" will be presented during the poster session at 6 p.m. CDT, on October 16. \nAbout Telotristat Etiprate \nDiscovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, telotristat etiprate is the first investigational drug in clinical studies to target tryptophan hydroxylase, an enzyme that triggers the excess serotonin production within mNET cells that leads to carcinoid syndrome. While existing treatments for carcinoid syndrome work to reduce the release of serotonin outside tumor cells, telotristat etiprate works at the source to reduce serotonin production within the tumor cells. By specifically inhibiting serotonin production, telotristat etiprate seeks to control this important driver of carcinoid syndrome and, in turn, provide patients with more control over their disease. \nLexicon retains rights to market telotristat etiprate in the U.S. and Japan , and is building the in-house commercial infrastructure to serve the U.S. market. Lexicon has a license and collaboration agreement with Ipsen to commercialize telotristat etiprate in Europe and other countries outside the U.S. and Japan . \nAbout Lexicon \nLexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions. Through its Genome5000â„¢ program, Lexicon scientists have studied the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes over the last 20 years and have identified more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a range of diseases. Through the precise targeting of these proteins, Lexicon is pioneering the discovery and development of innovative medicines to safely and effectively treat disease. Lexicon has a pipeline of promising drug candidates in clinical and pre-clinical development in oncology, diabetes and metabolism.

In addition, this press release also contains forward-looking statements relating to Lexicon's growth and future operating results, discovery and development of products, strategic alliances and intellectual property, as well as other matters that are not historical facts or information. All forward-looking statements are based on management's current assumptions and expectations and involve risks, uncertainties and other important factors, specifically including the risk that clinical studies of telotristat etiprate may be halted, delayed or otherwise not demonstrate safety or efficacy, the risk that Lexicon and its licensees may be unable to file for regulatory approval of telotristat etiprate with the FDA and other regulatory authorities in accordance with its currently anticipated timelines, the risk that the FDA and other regulatory authorities may not grant regulatory approval of telotristat etiprate in accordance with Lexicon's currently anticipated timelines or at all, and the risk that such regulatory approvals, if granted, may have significant limitations on the approved use of telotristat etiprate. As a result, telotristat etiprate may never be successfully commercialized. Other risks include Lexicon's ability to meet its capital requirements, successfully conduct preclinical and clinical development and obtain necessary regulatory approvals of its other potential drug candidates, achieve its operational objectives, obtain patent protection for its discoveries and establish strategic alliances, as well as additional factors relating to manufacturing, intellectual property rights, and the therapeutic or commercial value of its drug candidates. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause Lexicon's actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
