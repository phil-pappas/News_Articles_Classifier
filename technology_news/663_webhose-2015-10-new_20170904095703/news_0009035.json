These are the first sound bar and TV speaker base models that support Yamaha’s MusicCast wireless multiroom audio system unveiled in August. Both models allow linking to other MusicCast speakers, AV receivers and Hi-Fi gear in other rooms, allowing music sources to be shared throughout the home.\nWith MusicCast, users are able to effortlessly stream music from mobile devices and computers, as well as from services such as Pandora®, Spotify and Rhapsody®. Additionally, they allow access to external sources – such as a TV set-top box or media player connected by HDMI – so that content can be played in other rooms in which MusicCast devices are located.\nBoth models employ Yamaha exclusive Digital Sound Projector technology, delivering a more immersive and realistic listening experience compared to the virtual surround processing used in most other sound bars. In addition, they offer HDMI® connectivity with 4K Ultra HD and HDCP 2.2 support for compatibility with today’s 4K TVs and sources.\n“A great sound bar should make it easy to add amazing sound to your TV, and both of these models deliver on this front. However, what makes them especially remarkable is the integration of MusicCast,” said Bob Goedken, general manager, AV division, Yamaha Corporation of America. “Now you can use the MusicCast Sound Bar in one room and link it to a MusicCast Wireless Speaker in another to listen to music or TV audio in both places—so you don’t have to miss out on the game or news when you’re away from the TV. Yamaha has finally made it a breeze to do this.”\nThese models also support Bluetooth as an input or an output. Bluetooth input enables them to play content streamed from mobile devices or re-stream this audio to other MusicCast devices over Wi-Fi. Bluetooth output makes it possible to re-stream MusicCast network audio content from these models to other Bluetooth devices, such portable speakers and headphones.\nBoth models have space-efficient single-body designs that are ideal for those seeking an easy way to enhance their TV sound without having to connect multiple speakers.\nThe MusicCast Sound Bar uses eight speaker drivers to deliver true 5.1-channel surround sound. Its slim 2.5”-tall design can be placed in front of a TV without blocking the picture. The MusicCast TV Speaker Base features 10 speaker drivers in a solid wood MDF enclosure that fits neatly under most 32-inch to 55-inch TVs. Both models feature dual, built-in subwoofers with ported designs which provide deep, rich bass without the need for a separate subwoofer enclosure, though both also offer a subwoofer output allowing for the addition of an optional subwoofer.\nTo learn more about the Yamaha MusicCast Sound Bar (YSP-1600) and MusicCast TV Speaker Base (SRT-1500), please visit http://4wrd.it/MUSICCAST_SOUND_BARS .\nPricing and Availability\nThe Yamaha MusicCast Sound Bar and MusicCast TV Speaker Base are available exclusively at authorized Yamaha dealers for MSRPs of $499.95 and $599.95, respectively.\nEND\nAbout Yamaha\nYamaha Corporation of America (YCA) is one of the largest subsidiaries of Yamaha Corporation, Japan and offers a full line of award-winning musical instruments, sound reinforcement and home entertainment products to the U.S. market.
