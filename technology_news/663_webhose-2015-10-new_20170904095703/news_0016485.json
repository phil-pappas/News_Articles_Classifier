Nano-crystal technology is a picture quality technology which distributes nano-sized particles on sheets and controls them, allowing optimal expression of color, brightness, and contrast.\nIn particular, nano-crystal technology has played a crucial role in enhancing the SUHD TV’s picture quality. Nano-crystal technology was a source technology that the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology began developing in 2002. In 2010, VD GBM decided to commercialize nano-crystal technology, and utilize it for TV production. In early 2012, Samsung began TV production using nano-crystal technology,\nIt took 14 years to perfect and has about 150 critical patents. One of the things that the SUHD TV development team has focused on is the creation of immersive picture. Film editing is usually completed using the brightness standard of 100 nit, which is ideal for a dim movie theater. However, the average living room is not lit like a movie theater — it is typically much brighter. The SUHD TV is set at 1,000 nit (JS9500), which is optimal to deliver the best picture quality in your home.\nTo achieve its superior picture, the SUHD TV has gone through a rigorous design and development process. It is not only powered with HDR and nano-crystal technology, but every aspect of the TV such as the panel, BLU, algorithm, and nano-crystal material are new technologies.\nThe SUHD TV Re-mastering Engine analyzes content properties such as brightness and contrast, so viewers enjoy a premium viewing experience not only with SUHD content, but also standard images become 2.5 times clearer than UHD and can fully utilize the improved expression features of the SUHD TV. Moreover, the SUHD TV expresses lights and a wider color gamut that could not be distinguished on older models, delivering the picture that content producers originally intended.\nActually, the team decided to create movie content optimized for SUHD, and collaborated with 20th Century Fox on a movie re-mastering project, specifically for the SUHD TV. Viewing the re-mastered movie ‘Life of Pi’ on the SUHD TV, a viewer can see dreamlike colors such as the fluorescent blue, the way it is shown in movie theaters.\nThe TV should deliver a complete entertainment experience that fully engages the senses – and the key to that is picture quality. Samsung strives to provide consumers with a one-of-a-kind viewing experience unlike anything they’ve seen before. We want to provide consumers with a TV that is constantly adapting to their ever-changing needs.\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. inspires the world and shapes the future with transformative ideas and technologies, redefining the worlds of TVs, smartphones, wearable devices, tablets, cameras, digital appliances, printers, medical equipment, network systems and semiconductors.
