Man-made origins \nAs confirmed by experts at ESA’s NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC), ESRIN, Italy, the object, dubbed WT1190F, is thought to be a discarded rocket body; it is orbiting Earth every three weeks in a highly ‘eccentric’ – that is, non-circular – orbit. Detecting space hazards \n“NEO experts have used observational data to estimate the object’s density, which turns out to be much less than that of the solid rocky material that comprises many asteroids,” says Detlef Koschny, responsible for NEO activities at ESA’s Space Situational Awareness (SSA) programme office. \n“This density is in fact compatible with the object being a hollow shell, such as the spent upper stage of a rocket body or part of a stage.” Forecast reentry next month \nIt is now predicted to reenter Earth’s atmosphere in a few weeks, around 06:19 GMT (11:49 local; 07:19 CET) on 13 November 2015. \n“The object is quite small, at most a couple of metres in diameter, and a significant fraction if not all of it can be expected to completely burn up in the atmosphere,” says Tim Flohrer, acting head of ESA’s Space Debris Office at ESA’s ESOC operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany. \nWhatever is left is expected to fall into the ocean about 100 km off the southern coast of Sri Lanka. Its mass is not sufficient to cause any risk to the area, but the show will still be spectacular, since for a few seconds the object will become quite bright in the mid-day sky. \nTim says this object is rather special as it is likely man-made, but was discovered by an NEO monitoring system and its orbit has many similarities with an NEO orbit. \nThis enables ESA experts to predict the impact time and location quite precisely, well in advance, which is usually not possible in comparison with reentering space-debris objects. The more observations, the better \nDuring the next few weeks, the NEOCC will implement observational campaigns to collect as much data as possible on this object, explains Marco Micheli, as astronomer working at the NEOCC. \n“The first goal will be to better understand the reentry of satellites and debris from highly eccentric orbits,” he says. \n“Second, it provides an ideal opportunity to test our readiness for any possible future atmospheric entry events involving an asteroid, since the components of this scenario, from discovery to impact, are all very similar.” \nAstronomers who may wish to observe the object are welcome to contact ESA’s NEOCC for further information. About Space Situational Awareness \nThe objective of ESA’s SSA programme is to support Europe’s independent utilisation of, and access to, space through the provision of timely and accurate information and data regarding the space environment, especially regarding hazards to infrastructure in orbit and on the ground. In general, these hazards stem from possible collisions between objects in orbit, harmful space weather and potential strikes by natural objects, such as asteroids, that cross Earth’s orbit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:28:40.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
