They also called for replacing coal with cleaner-burning natural gas in power generation.\nGreenpeace said the companies' offer \"contains nothing meaningful\" and accused them of undermining effective climate action.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:27:46.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
