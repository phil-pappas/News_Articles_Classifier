It's a collection of fun and interesting information, resources and videos tailored to a variety of ages and experience levels,\" an official release said.\n\n\"Our goal is to spur interest in CS and programming, and motivate people from all backgrounds to pursue careers in tech. We believe through exposure and access, parents, guardians, and other influencers can enable their children and learners can gain the skills they need to have a technical career,\" it added.\n\nOn the importance of programming, \"Computers are everywhere around us: in our cars, cell phones and televisions. But here's a secret: they need a program to tell them what to do. Programmers are the people who dream up new things and then write the instructions that bring their ideas to life,\" the TechPrep page said.\n\nWe want to help people understand what programming is, different jobs programmers can have, and how to gain the skills they need to become one someday, the Facebook page added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:05:06.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
