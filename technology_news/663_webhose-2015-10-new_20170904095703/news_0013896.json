The app’s most notable change, the “Broadcast Message” feature, allows users to send messages to groups within their contact list simultaneously. Recipients quickly receive the group message, granting fast and easy updates on projects and collaborations among employers and co-workers. The conversations are then archived in the local chat history as well as the history on the server for future access.\nOther notable additions include:\n Updated themes. Updated splash image and setup icon. Passive mode for plug-ins.\n“We take great pride in listening to client feedback. This is why we added a variety of new features to version 3.7.5, including Broadcast Message,” said Brosix CEO Stefan Chekanov. “With this new feature, it will be easier for anybody to share a message with a large number of recipients. It is yet another way for users to improve the way they communicate at their place of employment.”\nUsing Brosix Version 3.7.5, clients can now enjoy the ease and functionality of new features, bringing communications within the workplace one step further.\nDownload the newest version of Brosix at Brosix Personal or Brosix Enterprise.\nAbout Brosix:\nBrosix was founded in 2006 to develop easy-to-use, secure communication tools for home and enterprises.
