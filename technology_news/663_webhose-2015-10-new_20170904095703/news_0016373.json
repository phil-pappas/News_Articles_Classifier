(NYSE MKT: IG), a New Jersey-based specialty generic pharmaceutical company, announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. \nThird Quarter 2015 Highlights Total revenues of $11.6 million in the third quarter of 2015, an increase of 74% over the same quarter in 2014 Total net revenues generated from the sale of IGI label generic topical pharmaceutical products for the third quarters of 2015 and 2014 of $8.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively Gross margin for the third quarter of 2015 equaled 52% as compared to 39% in the same period in 2014 IGI filed four Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) in the third quarter of 2015 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Operating income was $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to an operating loss of $0.1 million in the same period in 2014 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled to GAAP below) for the third quarter of 2015 and 2014 was $1.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively Adjusted net loss per fully diluted share (as defined and reconciled to GAAP below) for the third quarter of 2015 and 2014 was $0.00 and $0.00, respectively \nFull Year 2015 Financial Guidance The Company now expects total revenue between $41.0 and $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company anticipates gross margin of 49% to 50% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company intends to submit 15 to 17 ANDAs in total with the FDA for the full year 2015. In order to complete all of the development work required for the 2015 filings, the Company continues to expect to spend between $13.0 and $14.0 million in research and development by the end of 2015. As a result of the expected sequential increase in research and development costs in the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company intends for its operating margin to approach break even for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nIGI's President and Chief Executive Officer, Jason Grenfell-Gardner, stated, \"We are proud of our team's continued ability to deliver and our financial results reflect solid execution this quarter. In addition, our announcements thus far in October have included the addition of Steve Richardson, our new Chief Scientific Officer, the acquisition of three commercialized injectable products in the US, for which we have already shipped orders in October, and the execution of an agreement to acquire Alveda Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a generic sterile injectable business in Canada.Today in the US market, we now market seven products in twelve presentations in the generic topical market, and another three products in seventeen presentations in the generic injectable market. \nOn the regulatory front, we have submitted ten ANDA submissions so far this year, including today's submission,'' Mr. Grenfell-Gardner continued. \"We also received the FDA's final approval for our diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution in July, which we launched later that month. Our long-term vision continues to focus on the creation of a diversified product portfolio, built around our topical, injectable, complex and ophthalmic, or TICO, strategy.\" \nMr. Grenfell-Gardner continued, \"As we have discussed, we are optimistic regarding the continued positive momentum that we are seeing in our interactions with the FDA, especially with regard to applications filed in Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (\"GDUFA\") Year 3, which began on October 1, 2014. We believe that this increased rate of review is evidence that the implementation of the GDUFA of 2012 is working. In an attempt to shorten our potential review times, and ultimately obtain approvals more quickly, we have chosen to withdraw four of our applications from the FDA and resubmit them in 2016. Based on August IMS Health data, the addressable market for our pipeline of now twenty-eight ANDAs is estimated at $1.4 billion, excluding our four partnered submissions.Therefore, over 59% of the total addressable market in our pipeline relates to submissions filed in GDUFA Year 3 or later. \n\"As a result of the increased FDA activity around our filed pipeline, we determined it was necessary to make significant adjustments during this year to allocate the appropriate amount of our team's time to responding effectively to the FDA's accelerated deadlines for applications currently under review. While we have been expanding our team throughout the year, we believe that addressing the FDA's accelerated response times had to take priority in the last few months. As we reallocate resources, we now plan to submit a further five to seven ANDAs with the FDA this year, for a total of fifteen to seventeen new topical submissions in 2015. The remaining planned 2015 submissions will be filed in the first half of 2016. We believe this is the right strategy to maximize the potential of our current and future pipeline.\" \nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 4:15 pm ET to discuss third quarter 2015 results.
