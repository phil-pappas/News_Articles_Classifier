At his time, everyone referred to him as the Afrika's Che Guevara. He was 33 when he took over the country's presidency (and still had time too). This is what he did in 4 years in power of Burkina Faso (what the ANC presidents failed in 21 years).\n· He sold off the government fleet of Mercedes cars and made the Renault 5 (the cheapest car sold in Burkina Faso at that time) the official service car of the ministers.\n· He reduced the salaries of well-off public servants, including his own, and forbade the use of government chauffeurs and 1st class airline tickets.\n· He redistributed land from the feudal landlords to the peasants. Wheat production increased from 1700 kg per hectare to 3800 kg per hectare, making the country food self-sufficient.\n· He opposed foreign aid, saying that \"he who feeds you, controls you.\"\n· He spoke in forums like the Organization of African Unity against what he described as neo-colonialist penetration of Africa through Western trade and finance.\n· He called for a united front of African nations to repudiate their foreign debt. He argued that the poor and exploited did not have an obligation to repay money to the rich and exploiting.\n· In Ouagadougou, Sankara converted the army's provisioning store into a state-owned supermarket open to everyone (the first supermarket in the country).\n· He forced well-off civil servants to pay one month's salary to public projects.\n· He refused to use the air conditioning in his office on the grounds that such luxury was not available to anyone but a handful of Burkinabes.\n· As President, he lowered his salary to $450 a month and limited his possessions to a car, four bikes, three guitars, a fridge and a broken freezer.\n· A motorcyclist himself, he formed an all-women motorcycle personal guard.\n· He required public servants to wear a traditional tunic, woven from Burkinabe cotton and sewn by Burkinabe craftsmen\n· He was known for jogging unaccompanied through Ouagadougou in his track suit and posing in his tailored military fatigues, with his mother-of-pearl pistol.\n· When asked why he didn't want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other African leaders, Sankara replied \"There are seven million Thomas Sankaras.\"\n· An accomplished guitarist, he wrote the new national anthem himself\n· Sankara was the first African leader to appoint women to major cabinet positions and to recruit them actively for the military\nAntonio de Figueiredo had this to say about Sankara: \"Africa and the world are yet to recover from Sankara’s assassination. Just as we have yet to recover from the loss of Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah, Eduardo Mondlane, Amílcar Cabral, Steve Biko, Samora Machel, and most recently John Garang, to name only a few.\n\"While malevolent forces have not used the same methods to eliminate each of these great pan-Africanists, they have been guided by the same motive: to keep Africa in chains.\"\nMAYIBUYE!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:22:38.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
