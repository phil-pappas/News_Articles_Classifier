CBC's Anand Ram finds out By Anand Ram, CBC News Posted: Oct 14, 2015 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: Oct 14, 2015 10:06 AM ET Through Chromecast Audio, Google is betting on the customer who doesn't want to get new speakers in order to enjoy their music streaming services at home.

Related Stories Apple Music: What its debut means for the competition \nFew devices escape the ever-shrinking upgrade cycle, but speakers do. The quality of a good pair isn't necessarily taken away by newer models with the latest features. \nBut the way we listen to music at home is changing. Gone are the docks where iPods sat loaded with thousands of songs. These days, those thousands of songs are streamed across various services. Now, Google is competing to get that music playing wirelessly. Apple, Spotify offer more music, less dusting \nThrough Chromecast Audio, the company is betting on the customer who doesn't want to get new speakers. Launched a couple of weeks ago , it hopes to build on the success of its popular Chromecast video streaming device. But when many other companies, like Sonos, also offer wireless home audio solutions, how does Google stack up? Simple setup \nA small and light plastic cookie, Chromecast Audio supplies the cables for its two ports: micro-USB for power and a 3.5- millimetre jack for sound. The former goes into a wall outlet, the latter into a line-in/AUX port. This is found on most speakers or home audio receivers.

(Anand Ram/CBC) \nSmartphones control the rest of the experience. While you use the Chromecast app (on both iOS and Android) to set it up, apps like Spotify, PocketCasts and TuneIn Radio take over from there. \nThe only downside is how unsightly it can look to a home audio setup. It's a dongle — an accurate, if inelegant way of saying it's an attachment. So, it'll stick out, especially with its need for power through that USB cable.

(Anand Ram/CBC) Cheap upgrade \nThe original Chromecast did the same thing for TVs. It plugged into to a presumably internet-less TV, allowing it to stream Netflix, YouTube and other services. 5 TV streaming devices that will let you cut the cord \nSure, practically anything connected to a TV these days allows that. But millions of Chromecasts sold because they're a cheaper solution than buying an Apple TV, PS4 or a new \"smart\" TV. Amazon recently banned the sale of Chromecasts , speaking to the device's popularity and threat to the company's own Prime Video service. \nAt $45, Chromecast Audio is taking the same route, undercutting the competition to make speakers \"smart.\" Crowded airwaves \nHome audio isn't Google's wheelhouse, and there are plenty of other good options out there. Logitech, Bose and Denon all offer great home-streaming products, either through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. California-based Sonos makes speakers and an app that connect to existing music services. Its highly rated Play line of speakers also uses Wi-Fi, delivering great sound as well as a tuned experience (Sonos) \nCalifornia-based Sonos is a leader in this field too, making its own speakers and app that connects to existing music services. Its highly rated Play line of speakers also uses Wi-Fi, delivering great sound as well as a tuned experience. It also offers multi-room support, and is much kinder on the decor of those rooms than a puck with dangling wires. \nHowever, it comes at a cost. A top-of-the-line Sonos Play:5 speaker, with its more powerful sound range and premium look, costs $500 more than a Chromecast Audio. \nCompetition in this space is always healthy, but compatibility can cause headaches. For example, at the moment, an iPhone can't stream Apple Music to a Chromecast Audio. Neither can the service Tidal, though it does work with Sonos. Sonos is getting Apple Music support soon. It can get confusing. \nSo where your music is may dictate what you buy to play it — which can make the simple act of listening to music at home complicated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:51:53.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
