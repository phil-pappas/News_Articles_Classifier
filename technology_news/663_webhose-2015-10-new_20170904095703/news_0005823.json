Reuters/Pichi Chuang \nBRUSSELS U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp is set to get the go-ahead from EU antitrust regulators for its $16.7 billion offer for Altera Corp, its largest ever deal, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. \nThe world No. 1 chipmaker is looking to Altera to reinforce its portfolio of higher-margin chips used in data centers and to focus on chips for cars, watches and other devices in a future \"Internet of Things\". \nThe highly fragmented chip industry has seen a wave of consolidation this year as companies beef up their capabilities and try to squeeze more technologies onto chips in response to demand for integrated suppliers. \nThe European Commission will clear the deal without requiring concessions from Intel as it does not see any competition issues, the people said. A decision is scheduled by Oct. 14. \nCommission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy did not immediately reply to an email for comment. \nAltera makes programmable chips used to speed up web searches and update social networks, among other uses. \nThe Commission is now reviewing Avago Technologies' $37 billion offer for Broadcom Corp, the biggest ever deal in the sector. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop ) \nOur top photos from the past week.
