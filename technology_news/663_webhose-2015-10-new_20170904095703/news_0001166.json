(Twitter) 10 PM Follow @htsuka For its devoted users, Twitter is a torrent of information in which to splash around to pick up everything from the latest news to the latest meme. But for those who aren’t die-hard tweeters, the social network and its reverse timeline of micro-messages can be daunting. Enter a new major feature of Twitter: Twitter Moments. Moments uses human curators to highlight the hottest stuff on the network and delivers it in a neat package.\nThat said, Moments has its limits. Yes, it is way easier to flip through a handful of tweets and videos to get into a story than it is to sift through what Twitter serves up in the raw. But it can still be tedious to flip through a Moment — more editing may be required. Still, if you’ve been too scared of Twitter until now, this could be an easy on-ramp for you. Just tap the lightning bolt section of the normal Twitter app. Free, for iOS and Android users.\n— Hayley Tsukayama", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@htsuka"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:21:46.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
