This new design IP enables the development of single-chip solutions for combining video, audio, USB and up to 100W of power on a single external connector. The integration of the IP as a single-chip solution is important for mobile and cost-sensitive consumer devices where a single connector, lower bill of materials (BOM) costs and reduced board size can provide significant competitive advantages. The subsystem components are pre-verified, which enables designers to mitigate project risk and ease system-on-chip (SoC) integration. The complete subsystem includes: USB 3.0 xHCI Host and Device certified controller IP, which can be combined into a Dual Role Device Controller USB Type-C Port controller (TCPC) IP DisplayPort 1.2a Transmitter (Tx) controller IP Embedded Tensilica® Xtensa® CPU Multi-protocol USB 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2a PHY IP for 28nm USB 2.0 certified PHY IP for 28nm Drivers for embedded systems and Linux OS For more information on Cadence IP for USB offerings, please visit [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdVkyRmtaVzVqWlM1amIyMHZibVYzY3k5VlUwSkRYQ0lnY21Wc1BWd2libTltYjJ4c2IzZGNJaUIwWVhKblpYUTlYQ0pmWW14aGJtdGNJajVvZEhSd09pOHZkM2QzTG1OaFpHVnVZMlV1WTI5dEwyNWxkM012VlZOQ1F6d3ZZVDQ9fA==]]. Today's devices typically require many disparate connectors, which consume the limited space available on product edges and increase overall cost. USB Type-C addresses this challenge and enables reversible plug orientation. The new universal connector is starting to replace legacy connectors in all existing USB applications. By combining audio, video, USB data and USB Power Delivery, it enhances the USB functionality, which is especially beneficial in complex products, like mobile phones and laptops. One of the most appealing and important features of the USB Type-C connector is its built-in capability to utilize other high-speed serial technologies within the same connector, giving designers the ability to use one port for high-speed interconnects. Cadence's USB Type-C IP enables users to take advantage of DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB Power Delivery, allowing them to implement a whole IP subsystem that supports USB and DisplayPort protocols, as well as USB Power Delivery. \"Cadence's USB Type-C integrated IP subsystem enables users to design products that better meet their performance and power targets,\" said Hugh Durdan , vice president of product marketing for Design IP at Cadence . \"Designers can spend less time ensuring the individual components are verified and work well together, helping them get to market faster.\" \"As one of the first major IP suppliers to offer an integrated IP subsystem for USB Type-C, Cadence's support is beneficial to the widespread adoption of the USB single-cable solution,\" said Jeff Ravencraft , USB-IF President and COO . \"The availability of IP supporting the new wave in connectivity is an important milestone in the industry and offers solutions for companies looking to develop flexible and innovative products.\" About Cadence Cadence enables global electronic design innovation and plays an essential role in the creation of today's integrated circuits and electronics.
