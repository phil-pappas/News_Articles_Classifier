But it was an experimental feature and not easy to do. You had to enable the feature by typing \"chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting\" into your browser and clicking \"enable.\" \nIn a more recent update to the Chrome browser, Google decided it would longer allow sounds and videos to load in background tabs. You will have to click on a tab to load a video or streaming media file -- even if it is set to auto-play. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
