But scientists on Wednesday unveiled the most comprehensive account of the avian family tree ever formulated, detailing how modern bird groups are connected based on genome-wide data from 198 living bird species.\nThey focused in particular on understanding the group called Neoaves, encompassing more than 90% of all birds, the exceptions being large flightless birds like ostriches and a group including ducks and chickens.\nThey found Neoaves comprised five distinct sub-groups, and were surprised to learn that one of these, the water birds, spanned all diving, wading and shorebirds like pelicans, albatrosses, gulls, flamingos and storks, although not the duck lineage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:30:49.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
