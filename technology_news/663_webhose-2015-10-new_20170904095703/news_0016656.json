Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices rose 0.2 per cent.\nEconomists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected overall prices to drop 0.2 per cent and core price to rise 0.1 per cent.\nOver the year, overall prices were unchanged. Core prices were up 1.9 per cent on the year.\nAn annual drop in a separate inflation measure in the third quarter from a year earlier means Social Security recipients will not receive a cost-of-living adjustment next year. That will mark just the third time in 40 years with no adjustment. The others were 2010 and 2011.\nAs in previous months, lower oil prices weighed down inflation in September. Economic slowdowns in China and commodity-exporting emerging markets, combined with the anticipation of a Fed interest rate increase have also made the US dollar stronger, which makes imports cheaper.\nThursday's report showed an index of energy prices fell 4.7 per cent in September led by a seasonally-adjusted 9 per cent fall in gasoline costs. Over the past year, energy prices are down 18.4 per cent and gasoline has fallen 29.6 per cent.\nOther prices went up. The cost of food rose 0.4 per cent in September and 1.6 per cent on the year. Shelter prices have risen 3.2 per cent over the year and the cost of services excluding energy services is up 2.7 per cent.\nPersistently low inflation has posed a problem for Fed officials, who are debating whether to raise interest rates this year after keeping them pinned near zero since 2008. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and other officials have said they are looking for inflation to pick up as a sign that the economy is finally strong enough to absorb higher interest rates.\nAnd even though the Fed prefers a different inflation gauge, the index of personal consumption expenditures, Thursday's report could still raise alarms. PCE inflation has not hit the central bank's 2 per cent target in more than three years.\nFor now, Ms. Yellen has said she believes an improving labor market would eventually nudge inflation higher. The low inflation readings of the past few months reflect temporarily lower oil prices, according to Ms. Yellen.\nBut other Fed officials are increasingly raising doubts about that projection. This week, two Fed governors, Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo, said they were worried inflation would remain depressed even as the labor market improves. That would suggest the Fed should put off raising interest rates until there is \"tangible evidence that allows one to develop that reasonable confidence that inflation will return to target,\" Mr Tarullo told CNBC Tuesday.\nThe unusually public disagreements among prominent Fed officials has brought increased attention to government inflation statistics an heightened the uncertainty surrounding the central bank's October and December meetings.\nIn a separate report, the Labor Department found Americans' inflation-adjusted weekly wages fell 0.2 per cent in September.\nFrom a year earlier, real average weekly earnings are up 2.2 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:53:14.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
