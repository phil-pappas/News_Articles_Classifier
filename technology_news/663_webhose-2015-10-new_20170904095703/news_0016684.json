Hence we can see the Samsung Z3 set to take center stage once again to take it further. - Advertisement - \nYes, we have the Z1 that was released earlier this year for just $89 USD. But back then, it only had a 4-inch screen, dual-core processor, and 768MB RAM. It copped a lot of heat; some say it was unfairly treated. But that mistake is finally being rectified with the Z3 that seems to be able to carry its own weight this time around. \nWhat is Tizen anyway? Now in its version 2.3, Tizen provides a quick and intuitive user interface that lets you do more. The most used apps are accessible at the touch of your home screen. And all the other apps are just a swipe away. With the Z3 you can now also customize the UI with different themes. You can choose and change a theme that defines your style or mood for the day. Personalize it accordingly to suit your needs. \nWith a metal body that comes in a measurement of 141.6 x 70 x 7.9 mm (5.57 x 2.76 x 0.31 in) and weighing in at just 137 g (4.83 oz), you will be getting quite a decent device in terms of its look and feel. It won’t feel like anything cheap. \nThe Z3, which is expected to be released by the end of this month, will be sporting a 5-inch HD Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 720 x 1280 pixels or ~294 ppi pixel density, you get to feel the moment in every scene. Enjoy crisp detail, true to life colors and vibrant tones, in your movies and images. With an excellent contrast ratio, you can now see clearer deeper images and get an immersive viewing experience every time. - Advertisement - \nIn terms of performance, the Z3 will have the Spreadtrum chipset, Quad-core 1.3 GHz processor, and 1GB RAM. This ensures you can run most of the apps and games out there comfortably enough. But once you get into multi-tasking mode, you can expect it to start showing some lag and slow down quite considerably. \nCamera-wise, the Z3 has a rather entry-level 8 Megapixel primary camera which comes with a brighter lens of F2.2 aperture size. Be known for taking the perfect shot no matter how dark it is with the LED flash. Capture best moments with Quick launch. Now, let your selfies be different and better with the 5 Megapixel secondary camera with wide-angle selfie. \nThe Z3 comes with just 8GB of internal storage that surely is not enough. Therefore, it can be further expanded up to a maximum of 128GB via its microSD slot. \nTo power up the Z3, there will be a Li-Ion 2600 mAh battery supplying juice to it. The Ultra Power Saving Mode ensures that you can stay on even after the other phones are long gone. Even if your phone is at 10% battery, switching to Ultra Power Saving Mode (UPSM) will give you up to 33 hours of standby time. It shuts down unnecessary functions, switching the screen to a battery saving monochrome mode to give you the extended standby time that you require. Surely it is more than enough to be able to find a power socket somewhere. Or if you don’t, you can always get yourself a decent power bank just in case. \nPlus, it has dual sim capability that adds a bit more value to it. \nFinally, do take note that the Z3 does not have 4G LTE – it is still somehow still stuck on 3G this late in 2015. But at least it comes with a rather innovative Ultra Data Saving Mode that compresses data and let you save up to 40% data on your favorite apps. It also lets you restrict background data so that you can browse, read and watch more of what you love. Talking about data, it also allows you to have easy offline access to everything you wish to get back. Simply download and save your favorites, so you can go through them even when the data connection is shaky or unavailable. - Advertisement - \nThe Samsung Z3 continues, and further improves the previous Z1, which has been out for almost a year. It went from having just a 4-inch screen, dual-core, 768MB RAM, 3.2MP-VGA camera, 4GB storage and a lowly 1500 mAh battery to at least something much more decent this time around. A better 5-inch screen with metal body, Quad-core with 1GB RAM, 8MP-5MP camera, 8GB storage and 2600 mAh battery is quite a jump to be honest. But the lack of 4G LTE is quite a turn-off. \nThe Samsung Z3 is expected to be release by the end of October 2015 for approximately $129 USD and will be available in Black, Silver and Gold.
