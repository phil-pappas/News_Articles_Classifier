They are realising nearly 2.5 times gross profit growth than their peers. THE ECONOMIC TIMES | 09 October 2015, 9:35 AM IST By Sandy Carter But why is innovation speeding up so significantly? In a word: technology. There are two technologies that play this critical, speed-enabler role: the Cloud and the mobile. Successful businesses are using the Cloud to accelerate competitive differentiation. They are realising nearly 2.5 times gross profit growth than their peers. Cloud Weds Mobile When you couple these two technologies with talent, a winning innovation strategy is created. Therefore, countries and companies alike need to build on a solid foundation of technology interwoven with an ecosystem of talent.In the old days, venture capitalists (VC) would fund startups and the fun would begin. Usually, a company would take the funding and spend the next two years building a beta or a prototype of their offering. Many claimed these were VCs funding science experiments.Today, with the Cloud, the cost of infrastructure is lower, enabling more innovation with less funding. Since the introduction of SaaS (software as a service) and PaaS (platform as a service), a scalable and easyto-use platform drives more immediate betas, or proof of concepts, that can be tested with 'clients' in a lean startup way.The 'as a service' facilitated by the Cloud era allows startups to just pay for what they use. This enables them to grow their client base and then pay as their clients ramp up on the solution. Because of this, many new startups are born that never would have received funding in the past.Take Yipeedo, a mobile-only platform for helping urban dwellers discover things to do in a city, recommending activities based on a user's taste and preferences. Headquartered in Bengaluru and completely self-funded, Yipeedo is trying to help people plan their day in the city with ease.This 'as you go' model means that what's critical to a business development, monitoring or even marketing is now consumed through a set of on-demand services. KlickDoc is a Bengaluru company established in 2014. Its vision is lofty and admirable: to provide specialised healthcare 24x7 to all parts of India at the click of a button. KlickDoc produced an innovative Cloud-based healthcare platform that connects patients with doctors, pharmacies and diagnostic centres with the facility to store and access the medical records in the Cloud.The Cloud allows the delivery of this solution to market in less than half the time it would have in the past. KlickDoc was able to experiment and test the solution, so that when released, it met the client's needs quickly.Stelae from Chennai began with the vision to help companies extract insight from content. Its solution, Khemeia, has enabled almost every imaginable document to become searchable, reusable and interoperable. Built on a Cloud platform, Stelae is able to quickly add features and listen more closely to clients while successfully building a business.The world is migrating from the desktop to mobile, using apps. The mobile market is global in a way that the desktop market never was. So, it requires the strength of the Cloud to make it the go-to platform to serve the audience. Mobile is the King For most of us, our mobile device is within arm's reach most of the time. And in the race for mobile mindshare, it's tempting to prioritise speed over scale and security. About 65% of companies admit that the security and scalability of mobile apps is sometimes put at risk to meet customer demand. A mobile-first approach is reliant on an enterprise-grade Cloud robust enough to ensure that apps, devices, data and transactions involved in interactions are trustworthy.For instance, GlobalS developed an innovative mobile solution for Bengaluru citizens who rely on buses. The commuter app is able to take massive data points, including bus routes, stops, points of interest and fares, and create a dynamic solution that can help guide users to the nearest bus stop based on their location, getting them where they need to go in the easiest way possible.Ecosystems today are the way that these startup innovators derive value. The ecosystem requires the new kingmakers and queenmakers that write the Cloud. With software and startup ecosystems disrupting and powering the much-needed innovation our complex world is desperately in need of, India is a leading force driving this change.Ask any VC and they will tell you that the competitive weapon of the future will be talent.As such, this is the perfect time for India. We have seen innovations in cricket, in software outsourcing, and now is the time for the Indian startup ecosystem to take up the challenge.
