The deal could be announced early next week, said people familiar with the talks. \nThe privately run PC maker controlled by founder Michael Dell has been working on raising about $40bn of bank loans to back the deal. On top of that, EMC shareholders are set to be offered new securities tied to the value of VMware , the data centre software maker that EMC controls. More Apple Pay rollout gathers pace in US \nIf it succeeds, the unusual structure would enable Mr Dell to pull off an audacious buyout of EMC while retaining majority control of VMware and paying EMC’s shareholders a premium. \nThe Dell founder took his own company private in a controversial $25bn buyout two years ago, and has since made it clear that he has no wish to operate as a public company. That has complicated his pursuit of EMC, which has also considered several alternative transactions since coming under pressure from activist shareholder Elliott Management last year. \nEMC obtained a separate stock market listing for VMware in 2007, but still owns 80 per cent of the company. The stake is EMC’s most valuable asset, worth nearly $27bn at the current share price, presenting an opportunity for Dell to monetise part of the investment to help pay for its purchase of EMC. \nDell is planning to offer $27.25 per share in cash to EMC shareholders, said people informed about the matter. In addition, it would issue a tracking stock tied to part of EMC’s VMware stake, though it is unclear exactly how this new security would be valued or how it would differ from the VMware shares that are already publicly traded. \nCNBC and ReCode reported that the cash and tracking stock together should value EMC at about $30 per share. Bloomberg reported that the total value per share would be $33, valuing the tracking stock at $8 per share. \nAt $30 a share, the deal would represent a premium of some 15 per cent to EMC’s share price before news of the buyout negotiations broke earlier this week, and would be above the price of about $27 a share that Elliott paid for its stake. \nMr Dell was in New York on Friday to finalise the deal with his advisers and a deal could be completed over the weekend, said one person. Negotiations to raise $40bn to finance the deal were being conducted with several banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Barclays, among others. \nRather than giving investors a direct stake in a business, tracking stocks are generally tied to the underlying performance of a particular segment of a company’s operations, making it possible to realise their value separately without carving them out as separate businesses.
