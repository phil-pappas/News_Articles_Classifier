Possibly tweets will stay at 140 characters while larger slabs of text will be able to be embedded in a tweet.\nThe motivation for the change is money. As Twitter is looking to evolve into a more mainstream communication, allowing longer tweets is seen as a lure for advertisers.\nThe reaction to the news on Twitter has been short and sharp — tweeters don’t need 140 characters to say anything more than 140 characters is a bad idea.\nYES @mims Making #tweets longer is such a categorically terrible idea. Making mentions, links, images not count toward 140 is a great one.\n— Stephen E. Wright (@sewrighter) September 29, 2015 Twitter to launch longer tweets. Twitter clearly has no idea how to grow, just blatantly following FB at this point. http://t.co/y1s0BmjpxQ\n— Micah Allen (@neuroconscience) September 29, 2015 In all reality nobody tweets gonna be read if they&apos;re longer than 140 characters\n— Charles BARKley (@_MikeSinatra) September 29, 2015 #Twitter will no longer require tweets to be under 140 characters.
