By enabling HotSpot 2.0, the existing networks deployed by the City of San Jose and the San Jose Marriott now support roaming with dozens of major service providers. When attendees step off a plane, go to a downtown restaurant, relax in their room or attend a Wi-Fi Global Congress (#WGCSJ) session, HotSpot 2.0 will be there to transparently and securely connect them to the network. \"HotSpot 2.0 is the future of Public Wi-Fi. It elegantly solves the issues of connection frustration and lack of security inherent to legacy Public Wi-Fi,\" said [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQnpPaTh2ZEhkcGRIUmxjaTVqYjIwdlMyRnphRk5vWVdscmFGd2lJSEpsYkQxY0ltNXZabTlzYkc5M1hDSWdkR0Z5WjJWMFBWd2lYMkpzWVc1clhDSStTMkZ6YUNCVGFHRnBhMmc4TDJFK3w=]], vice president of marketing and business development at Ruckus Wireless. \"We thank the City of San Jose and San Jose Marriott for their partnership in demonstrating the potential applications and business opportunities with HotSpot 2.0. The implications for the hospitality industry are profound, both for their loyalty program members and also to support inbound roaming for operator partners.\" With HotSpot 2.0, an identifier is used to match a client credential – such as the cellular SIM card or a username/password pair – with supported hotspots. When there is a match, the client device automatically connects and then uses the credential to authenticate and encrypt the airlink. This means users don't have to figure out which SSID to connect to, nor do they have to manually authenticate via a captive log-in page. In this way, HotSpot 2.0 makes the Public Wi-Fi connection experience similar to cellular – and allows one seamless experience across Wi-Fi networks hosted by hundreds of different entities. Wi-Fi Global Congress also hosted the 2015 WBA Industry Awards. Ruckus won two, for the Best Wi-Fi Enabled Consumer Electronics Device and/or Service for causing a Ruckus with HotSpot 2.0 Release 2, and the WBA Chairman Award – Technology Partner Category. The awards were judged independently of the WBA by a panel of prominent experts. In addition to the two awards won, Ruckus was a finalist for three others, including Best High Density Wi-Fi Deployment in a Venue, Best Wi-Fi Deployment in a City or Public Area, Best Wi-Fi Device/Application. Wi-Fi Global Congress runs Monday through Thursday at the San Jose Convention Center, and is hosted by the WBA. More than 500 operators, analysts, media and key influencers from around the world will attend. Speakers include Mayor of [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCdmJtTnNhV05yUFNkc2FXNXJUMjVEYkdsamF5aDBhR2x6S1NjZ2FISmxaajFjSW1oMGRIQTZMeTkzZDNjdWMyRnVhbTl6WldOaExtZHZkaTl0WVhsdmNsd2lJSEpsYkQxY0ltNXZabTlzYkc5M1hDSWdkR0Z5WjJWMFBWd2lYMkpzWVc1clhDSStVMkZ1SUVwdmMyVXNJRk5oYlNCTWFXTmpZWEprYnp3dllUND18]]; Ruckus SVP and GM of Emerging Technologies Steve Martin; senior representatives from AT&T, BT, Cisco, Sprint and iPass; and CIO-level representatives from San Francisco , San Jose and New York .
