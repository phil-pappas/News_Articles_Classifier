Around 150 thousand who are living in our region.\nLorraine has been living with diabetes for five decades, but recently her eyesight began to suffer.\nShe was diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy, a gradual loss of sight that would eventually cause her to go blind.\nBut she has been part of a trial using a special face mask, and has now her sight has been given the all clear by doctors.\nThere are a lot of side effects of diabetes but I think one of them that bothers people a lot is losing your sight.\nWith retinopathy you will eventually go blind it affects your peripheral vision and eventually you can't drive.\nI live right in the middle of the sticks I've got to be able to drive. I like playing the piano I enjoy sewing I like doing craft work anything like that that involves your sight really you can't do it without. It's changed my life - for the better.\n– Lorraine Helliwell It has been developed at NET park in County Durham.\nThe mask emits a green light which the patient is not aware of and it works by allowing more oxygen into their eyes so their sight doesn't deteriorate further.\nBut it does not affect sleep.\nThe mask is a bit of a game changer. It's important because the existing treatments are either based around a laser intervention which is basically cauterising the retina and you run out of area to keep treating and that leads to a lot of peripheral vision.\nIt's a dreadful disease - more than that it's a tsunami of cost facing the NHS.\nThere are 280,000 new patients registered every year. To put that in context it's the population of Newcastle going onto the diabetic register every single year and in many ways this is the manufacturing of the future - this is the next generation.\n– Richard Kirk, PolyPhotonix Diabetes is one of the most common causes of blindness and it is predicted this mask could save the NHS almost a billion pounds.\nThat will only be proved once it is rolled out, beginning in pharmacies next month. It will now be showcased at an exhibition of 100 objects that changed the world in London.\nBut Lorraine says even if it changes one person's life, the gift of sight is priceless.\nLast updated Tue 20 Oct 2015 Technology County Durham Blindness", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:08:10.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
