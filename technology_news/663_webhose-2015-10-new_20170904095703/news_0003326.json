AbbVie announced top-line findings from the trial in June 2015 showing that IMBRUVICA improved progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint) and multiple secondary endpoints including overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) in treatment-naive patients with CLL. IMBRUVICA is jointly developed and commercialized by Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company and Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n\"This submission highlights the expanded potential and strong value of IMBRUVICA as a treatment for CLL,\" said Erik von Borcke, President of Pharmacyclics. \"We are pleased treatment-naive patients may soon have an alternative to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.\"\nIMBRUVICA is currently approved for the treatment of patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy and CLL patients (including treatment-naive) who have del 17p, a genetic aberration that occurs when part of chromosome 17, the location of the tumor suppressor gene p53, has been lost or deleted.\nThe data have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and presentation at an upcoming medical conference.\nThe RESONATE-2 trial is a Pharmacyclics-sponsored study and its protocol and specific performance goals were established in a special protocol assessment (SPA) with the FDA. A SPA is an agreement with the FDA that a Phase III clinical trial design, its clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to the Agency to support a submission and potential approval. The trial enrolled 269 treatment-naive patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) aged 65 years or older in the U.S., EU and other regions. Patients were randomized to receive either ibrutinib 420 mg orally, once daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity, or chlorambucil on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. The starting dose for chlorambucil in Cycle 1 was 0.5 mg/kg and was increased based on tolerability in Cycle 2 by increments of 0.1 mg/kg to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as assessed by an Independent Review Committee according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iWCLL) 2008 criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis. Key secondary endpoints included ORR, OS and safety.\nAbout Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)\nThe prevalence of CLL/SLL is approximately 115,000 patients in the United States , i with approximately 16,000 newly diagnosed patients every year. ii As this orphan disease frequently progresses following treatment with existing first-line therapies, patients are faced with fewer treatment options and often are prescribed multiple lines of therapy as they relapse or become resistant to current standard of care treatments. iii\nIn CLL/SLL, the genetic aberration del 17p occurs when part of chromosome 17, the location of the tumor suppressor gene p53, has been lost or deleted. CLL/SLL patients with del 17p have poor treatment outcomes. iv Del 17p is reported in approximately 7% of treatment-naive CLL/SLL cases, v and approximately 20% to 40% of relapsed/refractory patients harbor the mutation. vi\nAbout IMBRUVICA\nIMBRUVICA is currently approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy, all CLL patients who have del 17p and patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. vii IMBRUVICA is also approved for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Accelerated approval was granted for the MCL indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. vii\nIMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily therapy that inhibits a protein called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). vii IMBRUVICA was one of the first medicines to receive U.S. FDA approval via the new Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway, and is the only product to have received three Breakthrough Therapy Designations.\nBTK is a key signaling molecule in the B-cell receptor signaling complex that plays an important role in the survival and spread of malignant B cells. vii,viii IMBRUVICA blocks signals that tell malignant B cells to multiply and spread uncontrollably. vii\nIMBRUVICA is being studied alone and in combination with other treatments in several blood cancers. More than 6,100 patients have been treated in clinical trials of IMBRUVICA conducted in 35 countries by more than 800 investigators. Currently, 13 Phase III trials have been initiated with IMBRUVICA and 67 trials are registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov .\nTo learn more about the medical terminology used in this news release, please visit http://stedmansonline.com/ .\nINDICATIONS\nIMBRUVICA is indicated to treat people with:\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy – accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Patients taking IMBRUVICA for CLL or WM should take 420 mg taken orally once daily (or three 140 mg capsules once daily).\nPatients taking IMBRUVICA for MCL should take 560 mg taken orally once daily (or four 140 mg capsules once daily).\nCapsules should be taken orally with a glass of water. Capsules should be taken whole. Do not open, break, split or chew the capsules.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nHemorrhage - Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® . Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® .\nThe mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. IMBRUVICA ® may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA ® for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.\nInfections - Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with IMBRUVICA ® therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 26% of patients. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® . Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly.\nCytopenias - Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® . Monitor complete blood counts monthly.\nAtrial Fibrillation - Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® , particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new-onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and benefits of IMBRUVICA ® treatment and dose modification.\nSecond Primary Malignancies - Other malignancies (range, 5 to 14%) including non-skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 3%) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA ® . The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to 11%).\nTumor Lysis Syndrome - Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with IMBRUVICA ® therapy. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate precautions in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., high tumor burden).\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity - Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA ® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking IMBRUVICA ® . If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common adverse reactions ( > 25%) in patients with B-cell malignancies (MCL, CLL, WM) were thrombocytopenia* (57%, 52%, 43%), neutropenia* (47%, 51%, 44%), diarrhea (51%, 48%, 37%), anemia* (41%, 36%, 13%), fatigue (41%, 28%, 21%), musculoskeletal pain (37%, 28%**, NA***), bruising (30%, 12%**, 16%**), nausea (31%, 26%, 21%), upper respiratory tract infection (34%, 16%, 19%), and rash (25%, 24%**, 22%**).\n*Based on adverse reactions and/or laboratory measurements (noted as platelets, neutrophils, or hemoglobin decreased).\n**Includes multiple ADR terms.\n***Not applicable; no associated ADRs.\nThe most common Grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse reactions (> 5%) in MCL patients were pneumonia (7%), abdominal pain (5%), atrial fibrillation (5%), diarrhea (5%), fatigue (5%), and skin infections (5%).\nApproximately 6% (CLL), 14% (MCL), and 11% (WM) of patients had a dose reduction due to adverse events.\nApproximately 5% (CLL), 9% (MCL), and 6% (WM) of patients discontinued due to adverse events. Most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were infections, subdural hematomas, and diarrhea in CLL patients and subdural hematoma (1.8%) in MCL patients.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nCYP3A Inhibitors - Avoid co-administration with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce the IMBRUVICA ® dose.\nCYP3A Inducers - Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers.\nSPECIFIC POPULATIONS\nHepatic Impairment - Avoid use in patients with moderate or severe baseline hepatic impairment. In patients with mild impairment, reduce IMBRUVICA ® dose.\nPlease see Full Prescribing Information: http://www.imbruvica.com/downloads/Prescribing_Information.pdf .\nAbout Pharmacyclics, An AbbVie Company\nPharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), is focused on developing and commercializing innovative small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune-mediated diseases.
