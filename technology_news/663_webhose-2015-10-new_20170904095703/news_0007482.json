They have fallen 26% this year.\nOverall, AMD swung to a $197 million loss, or 25 cents a share, from a year-earlier profit of $17 million a share, or 2 cents, as revenue fell 26% to $1.06 billion. Excluding $48 million in restructuring charges and other items, the loss was 17 cents a share.\nAnalysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected a 12-cent loss on $995.9 million in revenue.\nGross margin narrowed to 22.5% from 34.6% a year earlier and 24.6% in the third quarter. A $65 million inventory writedown, AMD said, accounted for about six percentage points of the drop.\nEarlier this month, the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company moved to lay off about 500 workers and outsource services as part of a broader realignment to boost computer and graphics chip sales.\nAlso on Thursday, AMD said it struck a deal with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics valued at about $436 million that's expected to close in the first half of 2016. Under the terms of the deal, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, the controlling partner, would take a 85% ownership stake in AMD's operations in Penang, Malaysia, and Suzhou, China. AMD said the deal would be cost neutral but significantly cut its capital expenses.\nAMD said revenue for the latest quarter in its computing-and-graphics segment declined 46% from the year-ago period and had a $181 million operating loss. AMD, which ended the quarter with $755 million in cash and $2.26 billion in debt, depends heavily on a few customers. In 2014, five of its customers accounted collectively for about 61% of its net revenue, with Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. each generating more than 13% of AMD's sales, according to a regulatory filing.\nFor the current quarter, AMD projects revenue to increase between 7% and 13% from the third quarter.\nAMD results follow Intel Corp.'s r eported 6.3% third-quarter profit decline on Tuesday, though higher chip prices and demand for larger computers helped soften Intel's shrinking PC business decline.\nIntel is the largest supplier of chips for personal computers, followed by AMD. The two companies use the same fundamental design, known as x86, that powers nearly all PCs.\nAMD has been trying to reduce its reliance on PC sales, developing chips for gaming systems and customized chips to order for other suppliers. But PC chips remain its biggest business.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com and Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 17:45 ET (21:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:18:41.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
