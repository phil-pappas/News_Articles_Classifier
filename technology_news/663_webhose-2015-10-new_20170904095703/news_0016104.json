The new platform is purpose-built to simplify how organizations find and manage technologies, expertise, and deals. Applications for Technology Scouting and Corporate Venturing are available today on the new software platform and additional applications will be available in 2016. This groundbreaking software framework, code-named “Anavo,” is the result of 18 months of research and development. The Anavo technology seamlessly integrates real-time search of internal and external databases with workflow, assessment, and routing tools.\nWellspring partnered with Deep Web Technologies to develop the Search Once Scouting™, technology that enables users to investigate new inventions, patents, publications, and expert profiles in over 30 authoritative databases simultaneously. Users can import relevant results directly with no data entry and immediately begin their opportunity evaluation process.\nThe new Wellspring software platform also includes a completely redesigned user interface developed for rapid and simplified data capture and insightful reporting and visualization tools.\nDr. Robert Lowe, Wellspring’s CEO, said, “I am thrilled to announce the new Wellspring platform today. The combination of powerful search capabilities, a new interface, and robust reporting tools in a single system empowers tech transfer offices, technology scouts, and corporate venturing units to quickly and easily manage their portfolios. Wellspring is a unified software system that replaces countless hours of manual searching, data management on spreadsheets, and ad hoc reporting. This simplified approach solves one of the greatest challenges in R&D and open innovation.”\n###\nAbout Wellspring\nWellspring delivers “Knowledge In Sight™” by providing purpose-built software to scout, manage, commercialize, and invest.
