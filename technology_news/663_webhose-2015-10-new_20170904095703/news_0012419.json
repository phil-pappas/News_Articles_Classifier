By validating and pre-integrating hardware and software offerings with Wind River Titanium Server, Titanium Cloud ecosystem partners deliver optimized solutions to help accelerate time-to-market for service providers and telecom equipment manufacturers (TEMs) deploying infrastructure based on NFV. Service providers and TEMs can confidently select these hardware and software products knowing that they are pre-validated with Titanium Server and ready for deployment in live networks.\nADLINK's Extreme Outdoor Server is the first high-performance mobile edge computing (MEC) platform specifically designed for extreme environments and outdoor telecom/networking applications. Based on the dual Intel® Xeon® E5-2400 v2 family of processors, the Extreme Outdoor Server provides IT and cloud-computing capabilities within the Radio Access Network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile subscribers. This offers a service environment characterized by proximity, ultra-low latency, and high-bandwidth that allows content, services, and applications to be accelerated, maintaining a customer's high-level Quality of Experience (QoE).\n“The Extreme Outdoor Server MEC platform provides computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity and access to user traffic and real-time radio and network information; this allows operators to offer context-related services that can differentiate and monetize the user experience,” said Yong Luo, general manager of ADLINK’s Embedded Computing Product Segment. “In addition, since the data is processed at the edge in the RAN environment, the Extreme Outdoor Server reduces backhaul costs and improves the infrastructure's efficiency with more intelligent and optimized networks. Running Titanium Server on this platform helps us to meet the ‘always on’ requirements and performance needs of our customers deploying NFV solutions.”\n“Through our Titanium Cloud program, we are partnering with leaders like ADLINK to create optimized, interoperable solutions for service providers and TEMs who are deploying NFV in their networks,” said Charlie Ashton, senior director of business development for networking solutions at Wind River. “While Wind River’s Titanium Server provides a foundation for Carrier Grade NFV infrastructure, by leveraging other pre-validated NFV elements service providers can quickly achieve their goals such as reducing OPEX while accelerating the introduction of new high-value services.\"\nTitanium Server is a carrier grade NFV infrastructure software solution that is designed to meet the stringent \"always on\" requirements of the telecom industry. With Titanium Server as the NFV infrastructure software foundation, the telecom industry can take full advantage of rapid service deployment while ensuring the Carrier Grade uptime and strict reliability mandated by telecom networks. Titanium Server is based on open software standards including carrier grade Wind River Linux, real-time Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), carrier grade plugins for OpenStack®, Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), and accelerated virtual switching, all optimized for Intel architecture platforms. And with the onset of NFV infrastructure, having data center performance at the edge of networks can enable specific virtualized network functions (VNFs) closer to the consumer, improving QoE.\nFor more information about the Extreme Outdoor Server, please visit http://www.adlinktech.com/\nAbout ADLINK\nADLINK Technology is enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) with innovative embedded computing solutions for edge devices, intelligent gateways and cloud services.
