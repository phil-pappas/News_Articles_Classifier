(Other reports put the death toll lower .) Saudi officials have denied responsibility for this incident as well as the one last week.\nWhile reliable information remains difficult to pin down in the ongoing conflict, a recent UN report estimates that more than 5,000 people have been killed in the six-month civil war. More than half of the dead are thought to be civilians. Last week, an effort to initiate an independent investigation into possible war crimes in the Yemen conflict was stymied at the United Nations by Saudi Arabia with the help of the United States and other coalition partners.\nAccording to CNN, this is the fourth time a wedding has been targeted by airstrikes in the past two months.", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/yemen-officials-131-dead-after-taiz-wedding-party-airstrikes/", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34471968", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/middleeast/yemen-violence/index.html", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/02/us-yemen-rights-idUSKCN0RW1ES20151002", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrike-said-to-kill-23-at-a-wedding.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:14:14.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
