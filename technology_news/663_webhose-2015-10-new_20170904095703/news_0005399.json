But we are not there.\"\nHe said some G20 countries could raise their ambitions — and didn't rule out improving the EU's own emissions target.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:43:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
