Dubbed the \"Share Happiness\" tour, this is the third year in a row that the famous snack brand is cleverly promoting their famous chocolate-dipped biscuit sticks - which are easily shareable amongst family and friends thanks to an easy-to-open, flip lid box. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151021/279420 \nThis year's \"Share Happiness\" tour officially launched on September 23, to the delight of millions of east coast enthusiasts, and will continue through the winter. Every Wednesday through Sunday, between now and the tour's end, N.J. and N.Y. Pocky fans can catch up to the \"Share Happiness\" truck by checking out a list of dates and locations, posted on the company's Twitter site and Facebook page - locations may change due to weather and traffic so be sure to stay up-to-date! \nDuring the tour, Pocky Ambassadors will be handing out full size boxes of the brand's most popular flavor, Chocolate Pocky, and occasionally offer other flavors, such as Strawberry, Matcha and the new chocolate Pejoy - which features a sweet filling inside a delicious cookie shell. The company expects to distribute over 600,000 boxes of Pocky and Pejoy. \n\"With the ice cream trucks hibernating for the winter, it's a great time for us to get out there and offer our delicious Pocky snacks - perfect for anytime of year,\" remarked Shunsuke Nakai, President of Ezaki Glico U.S.A. \"It is important for us to get up close with all the New York and New Jersey Pocky fans who have made our brand what it is today - and give back some happiness! We're confident they will continue to share that happiness with their family and friends.\" \nWith the \"Share Happiness\" tour in full gear, fans won't want to miss out on their chance to get up close with one of America's most popular treats! \nEzaki Glico U.S.A. corporate offices are in Irvine, CA and they adhere to the Ezaki Glico philosophy \"A Wholesome Life in the Best of Taste.\" Please visit the website glicousa.com or pocky.com . \nAbout Pocky and Pejoy \nPocky was developed in Japan when the idea was suggested of coating the already popular Pretz, a pretzel-like stick snack treat, with chocolate at one end so that they could be held without having to worry about the fingertips becoming soiled. At first the sticks were manually dipped. However, as demand increased, the innovation and creativity of engineers was fired up to develop a \"Glico-Original\" manufacturing plant. Pocky flavors in the U.S. are Chocolate, Strawberry, Matcha Green Tea, Chocolate Banana, Cookies & Cream, and Milk Chocolate. Pejoy, introduced last year in the U.S., are crispy cookie biscuit shells filled with rich, smooth creams: Chocolate, Matcha Green Tea, and Cookies & Cream. \nAbout Ezaki Glico \nEver since the launch in 1922 of the nutritious, fortified Glico caramel in its distinctive red box, the business activities of Ezaki Glico Co., Ltd. adhered to the corporate philosophy of \"Enhancing Public Health Through Food.\" Upon the 70th anniversary of the Glico Group in 1992, this same spirit and dedication was incorporated into the revised corporate philosophy of \"A Wholesome Life in the Best of Taste.\" \nGlico caramel - the company's first product - incorporates the innovative creativeness of Mr. Ri-ichi Ezaki, the company's founder. Ever since the beginning, the entire staff has likewise been heartily dedicated to further enhancing people's health and quality of life. This has led to the expansion of business lines beyond confectionery to include ice cream products, processed foods, desserts, milk products, baby formula, food ingredients, and raw materials for cosmetic and health products. \nMedia Contact: Beverly Steinberg, GBL Public Relations, 714-777-2760, Beverly@gblprgroup.com \nNews distributed by PR Newswire iReach: https://ireach.prnewswire.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:41:14.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
