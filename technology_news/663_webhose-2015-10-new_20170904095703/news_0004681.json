Standing at approximately 45.5-feet tall, 29.7-feet wide and 44-feet long; with the biggest eyebrows in all of Manhattan at 7-feet wide, in his trademark scowl, Red is one giant angry bird, ready to take on the challenge of a holiday excursion to the Big Apple. \nThe 89 th Annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade airs nationwide on NBC-TV, on Thursday, Nov. 26, 2015 from 9 a.m. – noon in all time zones.

But when the island is visited by mysterious green piggies, it’s up to these unlikely outcasts to figure out what the pigs are up to. Featuring a hilarious, all-star voice cast that includes Bill Hader (“Trainwreck,”“Inside Out”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids”), and Peter Dinklage (“Game of Thrones”), as well as Keegan-Michael Key (“Key & Peele”), Kate McKinnon (“Saturday Night Live,” next year's “Ghostbusters”), Tony Hale (“Veep,”“Arrested Development”), Ike Barinholtz (“The Mindy Project,”“Neighbors”), Hannibal Buress (“Broad City,” Why? With Hannibal Buress”), Jillian Bell (“22 Jump Street”), Danielle Brooks (“Orange Is the New Black”), Latin music sensation Romeo Santos, and YouTube stars Smosh (Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla); the Columbia Pictures/Rovio Entertainment film is directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis and produced by John Cohen and Catherine Winder. The screenplay is by Jon Vitti, and the film is executive produced by Mikael Hed and David Maisel. \nAbout the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade: \nWith more than 50 million viewers across the country and more than 3.5 million spectators that line up along the streets of New York City each year, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade is a national icon that has grown into a world-famous holiday event.
