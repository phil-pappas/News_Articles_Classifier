More Amazon shares jump 11% on sales surge \nCanalys did not give sales totals or detailed market share data. \nIn the second quarter Huawei and Xiaomi were neck and neck, with Xiaomi marginally ahead with 15.9 per cent of the market versus Huawei’s 15.7 per cent, according to Canalys. \nWei Lai, Xiaomi’s director of marketing, said in a post on Weibo on Friday that Canalys’s methodology was “unfair” to Xiaomi because it counts phones shipped, rather than solely direct sales to consumers, which may overstate sales for competitors that sell through distributors. \nInclusion of “the phones that are still in the distribution channels”, he said, “is unfair for Xiaomi, which mainly relies on ecommerce sales”. \nXiaomi said its product line-up had gone though a transition in the third quarter, with the launch of the Redmi Note 2 in August and the Mi 4c phone in late September. “We had to ramp up supply gradually to meet demand,” it said. \nHuawei has had huge success with its new Honor brand of smartphones, drawing heavily from Xiaomi’s marketing playbook. The company — better known for its telecoms equipment — has only been selling consumer devices for three years but has grown quickly , mainly at the expense of Samsung Electronics, formerly the China market leader before being dethroned by Xiaomi. \nXiaomi quickly became the darling of the China smartphone industry as it shot to the top just four years after launching its debut device, the Mi 1. As excitement swirled over the prospects of China’s rapidly growing mobile internet market, Xiaomi was valued at $45bn in a December funding round. \nBut that momentum has proved difficult to maintain and the market fickle, with numerous Xiaomi imitators snatching away market share. \nIn the second quarter, Xiaomi’s year on year growth was 11 per cent, while in the third quarter the absolute year on year decline was “in the single digits”, said Canalys, giving no specifics. \nThe drop in Xiaomi’s third-quarter sales will focus attention on the company’s perceived shortcomings, said Beijing-based tech blogger Zong Ning. “Xiaomi’s glory days are gone; it reached its peak this year, and as far as I can tell, there’s nothing stopping it on its downside.” \nHe said Xiaomi’s phones, once regarded as cutting-edge, now lag behind in technical details such as fingerprint recognition, a feature many Chinese phones in the Rmb1,000 ($157) price range include but is still not found on Xiaomi devices. \nAlarm bells first began ringing in July when Xiaomi revealed disappointing first-half numbers, with sales of 34m phones suggesting the company will struggle to hit its full-year target of 100m or even a revised goal of 80m. \nThe sales setback will focus attention on the approaching November 11 Singles Day, China’s largest online shopping day and traditionally Xiaomi’s single best sales day of the year.
