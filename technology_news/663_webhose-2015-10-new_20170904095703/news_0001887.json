They’re also sending orders directly from their stores and using sophisticated software that tells them the quickest, cheapest way to ship. And Amazon is cutting the time it takes to process an order from hours to minutes by using robots to pull items in its warehouses.\nIt’s a race by retailers as more people shop online. U.S. online sales are expected to increase 12 percent to $371 billion this year, accounting for 10 percent of overall sales, says Forrester Research. But as online shopping grows, so does the impatience of shoppers who want their orders fast.\nBrick-and-mortar stores are trying to catch up to Amazon.com, which set the standard for speed with its two-day delivery for members of its Prime loyalty program who pay $99 a year. But even Amazon feels pressure to please customers who have little tolerance for lengthy delivery waits.\n“I would like to plan ahead, but I’ve been able to wait until the last minute to get things done,” said Keri Early, a Clyde, Ill., resident who orders from Amazon frequently.\nFor many retailers, the goal to meet the demands of shoppers like Early is to make two-day delivery standard. That’s half the average for standard delivery for the top 40 online retailers, according to data company StellaService. But most are stopping short of guarantees.\nWalmart aims for two-day standard shipping for most of the U.S. this season. It now uses 83 of its more than 4,500 U.S. stores to ship to customers.\nWalmart also is spending $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in online investments this year and $1.1 billion next year. That’s up from last year’s $1 billion. The investments are squeezing profit: Walmart stock tumbled Wednesday after it warned earnings would be down as much as 12 percent next year in part because of its heavy spending on e-commerce.\nStill, Walmart is spending to stay competitive. Since last year, it has opened warehouses across the country in Bethlehem, Pa.; Fort Worth, Texas; Plainfield, Ind.; and Atlanta to handle online orders. Next year, Walmart plans to open another center in Southern California, one in Dallas and two more in Florida.\nOther retailers also have added warehouses:\n• Home Depot opened its third and largest warehouse in Troy, Ohio, in September to handle online orders. Together, the warehouses will allow it to ship to 90 percent of shoppers within two days.\n•Macy’s new facility, which recently opened in Tulsa, Okla., will enable the retailer to send 90 percent of packages in central western states within two days. By year’s end, Macy’s says the chain will be able to deliver packages within two days overall, faster than its standard of three to six days.\n•Target opened two warehouses this year. It also is now shipping products from 462 of its 1,800 stores, up from 150 a year ago. Target said online shoppers are likely to get deliveries within two days if the product is delivered from the store, compared with four days from the warehouse.\nTarget also launched a program to let shoppers know a precise delivery date. That’s instead of offering a delivery window of four to six days, for example.\n•Nordstrom opened a third warehouse in Elizabethtown, Pa., to handle online orders. That will eventually allow the chain to deliver orders to half of its customers in two days.\n“You know our friends in Seattle continue to set the standard,” Mike Koppel , Nordstrom’s chief financial officer, told investors in September, referring to Amazon. “In order to be an exemplar in that, you’re going to have to invest in that because that’s what people are going to expect.”\nFor its part, Amazon, which has 50 U.S. warehouses that typically house millions of products, is building a facility in Kent, Wash., that will house 20 percent more items.\nAmazon also acquired Boston robotics company Kiva in 2012 for $775 million. The robots pull shelves of goods out of storage areas and bring them to workers. Amazon now has more than 30,000 robots in 13 warehouses.\n“We’re using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think is more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate,” Amazon’s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky , said in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:00:50.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
