Created by Rob Feldman, Cyko KO (pronounced PSYCHO-KAY-O) is a fun, sci-fi adventure featuring a rebellious stunt motorcyclist forced to protect a very distant SuperEarth from giant monsters and the evil Baron Diablo! Its debut ushers in FX Toon technology, which incorporates sound and motion into the digital comic format to provide a completely unique reading experience. Fans can read the first three chapters of Cyko KO now here .\nGranted the power of enormous growth and a motorcycle that can change into his weapon of choice, rebellious stunt motorcyclist Cyko KO, along with his sidekick Peachy Keen and their pet Meemop, is the only one who can protect the colonies of SuperEarth from giant monsters! Follow Cyko KO as he tries to adapt to his new world, his new life and his new duties as the one and only Super Earth Battle Defender---and still make it home in time for a wicked game of pinball!\nCyko KO uses FX Toon to advance the story and bring a sense of speed while enhancing the comedic beats throughout the series. It follows the debut of thriller anthology Chiller, available to read here . Already the center of comics conversation in Korea, China and Taiwan, Chiller is a collection of suspenseful comics published twice weekly and focusing on a different thrilling plotline, often drawing on the idea that any of these terrifying situations could happen to you. The comics are enriched by immersive special effects and eerie soundtracks that play to enhance the suspense as the reader scrolls through the chilling tale, offering a brand new comic experience that truly amplifies the fright factor.\n“I’m an animator and a comic book creator and FX Toon blends both these worlds seamlessly providing me with a new creative platform to tell stories I think audiences will love,” said Feldman. “Cyko KO is a throwback to the Hanna Barbara and Filmation cartoons of the ‘70s and ‘80s, with a bit of Adult Swim humor sprinkled in, and I’m able to capture some of what made those series so memorable in this format.”\n“Cyko KO with its fast-spaced speed and action, along with quick hitting humor is the perfect story to showcase our FX Toon technology,” said JunKoo Kim, Founder and Head of LINE Webtoon. “We are looking forward to introducing more titles that use this technology and offer it to creators who want to expand the scope of their storytelling in unique ways.”\nAlready a huge success for more than 10 years in Korea, LINE Webtoon launched in the U.S. in 2014, and is rapidly expanding with the onboarding of new artists, partners, expansion of ways to interact with the content, and much more.\nFans can dive into Cyko KO now by visiting http://www.webtoons.com .
