But the tensions on the street are increasingly seeping through the hospital's sterile walls, with family members clashing in the hallways and causing the wounded even more trauma.\nHadassah's Ein Kerem campus is considered a rare model of co-existence in deeply divided Jerusalem, with a mixed Jewish-Arab medical team working together to treat the city's wounded and infirm.\nCoping with conflict is nothing new. More than 20 members of the hospital staff were either killed or lost first-degree relatives during the last decade's Palestinian uprising. They are accustomed to separating their own feelings from the task at hand and treating those on the other side of the region's decades-old conflict.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:08:22.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
