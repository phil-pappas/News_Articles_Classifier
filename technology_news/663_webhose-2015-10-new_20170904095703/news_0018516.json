Morgan Griffith may be the one most directly harmed by the company's emissions cheat.\nThe Virginia Republican recounts that when his mother could afford her first new car, she bought a Volkswagen Squareback with a manual transmission, the car on which he learned to drive. He inherited his grandmother's 1972 Super Beetle, which he still has. In the 1980s, he says he bought a Rabbit, and in the 1990s he bought a gas-powered Jetta.\n\"When it got close to 200,000 miles, my mother convinced me that even Volkswagens couldn't go on forever,\" the congressman says.\nSo he sold the Jetta and bought a 2003 gasoline-powered Passat, which he drove until this summer and racked up 376,225 miles.\nGriffith then bought a 2012 diesel Passat, one of the cars caught up in the scandal.\n___\n11:47 a.m.\nVolkswagen is looking at compensating owners of diesel-powered cars that have devices set up to cheat on U.S. emissions tests.\nU.S. CEO Michael Horn tells lawmakers that the company may pay customers for a loss in resale values because of the scandal.\nHe says the company doesn't know how much the cheating will cost Volkswagen. The cost depends on fines from government agencies, how much it costs to fix the cars and the price tag for any compensation to customers.\nVW has set aside $7.3 billion to pay for the scandal, but Horn says he's not sure that will be enough.\nUnder questioning from Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., Horn says the company isn't considering loaner cars because the U.S. government says the cheating diesels are safe to drive.\n___\n11:20 a.m.\nVolkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn denies that top corporate officials, either in Germany or the U.S., knew about the software on the company's diesel cars designed to cheat on emissions test.\nHorn says there was no discussion or decision by the company's board to install the defeat devices software.\n\"To my understanding this was not a corporate decision, this was something individuals did,\" Horn said.\nHe says \"a couple\" software developers in Germany were responsible for the cheat.\nRep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, asked Horn if he really believed that senior level corporate managers had no knowledge of the software, which was first installed on cars for the 2009 model year.\n\"I agree it's very hard to believe,\" Horn said.\n___\n11:11 a.m.\nVolkswagen says most of the 500,000 U.S. cars with diesel engines that cheat on emissions tests will need complex hardware and software fixes that will take several years.\nU.S. CEO Michael Horn is telling a U.S. House subcommittee that the cars will still get the window sticker fuel mileage when they are repaired. But the fixes might affect performance, including a one-or-two mile-per-hour drop in top speed.\nHorn says software changes alone will work for newer models, but 430,000 cars dating to 2009 will need mechanical fixes that are still being developed.\nHorn says software will repair about 90,000 newer Passat models, but they may need an additional sensor.\n___\n10:43 a.m.\nVolkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn is apologizing to lawmakers investigating his company's emissions cheat.\n\"On behalf of our company, and my colleagues in Germany, I would like to offer a sincere apology for Volkswagen's use of a software program that serves to defeat the regular emissions testing regime.\"\nHorn says he first learned VW's diesel cars had problems with dirty emissions in 2014, but says he was not told about the cheating software until the day before the scheme was revealed to U.S. regulators last month.\nHorn, a German who has worked at VW 25 years, says he did not think something like that would be possible at his company.\n\"These events are deeply troubling,\" he says.\n___\n10:34 a.m.\nLawmakers pressing Volkswagen's top executive on an emissions cheating scandal are fondly recalling owning vintage VW Beetles early in their lives.\nReps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and Tim Murphy, R-Pa., spoke about their cars with affection.\nMurphy says he owned a Beetle in the 1970s and was able to take it apart and put it back together.\nDeGette says her first car was a 1960 Beetle with a fabric sunroof that she inherited from her grandmother. She says she still misses the car and that it didn't need computer software to run.\nLawmakers are holding the hearing to investigate Volkswagen software that allowed its four-cylinder diesel engines to cheat on federal and California emissions tests.\n___\n10:16 a.m.\nRep. Fred Upton of Michigan wants Volkswagen's top executive to answer what he calls the most famous question in Congress: \"What did you know and when did you know it?\"\nUpton is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He says he has host of other questions, including why one of the world's largest automakers go to such lengths to avoid emissions requirements? Who was responsible for these decisions? How will VW fix the flaw and when? Will the fix affect vehicle performance?\nUpton says unraveling these questions will take time, but Volkswagen has a long way to go in rebuilding the public's trust.\n\"VW will inevitably pay a steep price for its dirty little secret,\" Upton says.\n___\n9:15 a.m.\nIt's early and the line is growing. By 8 a.m. - two hours before the start of the House hearing - a crowd already is waiting to get into the room where Volkswagen's top U.S. executive awaits tough question from lawmakers in the aftermath of the emissions-rigging scandal that's hit the world's largest automaker.\nA House Energy and Commerce subcommittee is set to hear from Volkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency.\nLawmakers are investigating after Volkswagen admitted it installed on-board computer software designed to cheat on government emissions tests in nearly 500,000 of its four-cylinder \"clean diesel\" cars, starting with the 2009 model year.\nAccording to an advance copy of Horn's prepared remarks, VW plans to withdraw applications seeking U.S. emissions certifications for its 2016 model Jettas, Golfs, Passats and Beetles with diesel engines. That's raising questions about whether a \"defeat device\" similar to that in earlier models is also in the new cars.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:44:53.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
