It works on all devices including desktop PCs, Macs, gaming consoles and mobile devices. \nThe Ghacks deal gets you three years of unlimited JustUnblock access for $49 which is less than $1.40 per month (the usual price for that is roughly $150) You may be interested in a lifetime Getflix subscription instead (for $39) or in a Private Internet Access account (VPN) for two years for $59.95.
