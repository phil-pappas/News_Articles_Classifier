The BIG Awards specialize in recognizing top–performing companies and organizations. Described as the only crowd sourced industry awards program for business, the BIG Awards use a proprietary judging process scored by well–known and experienced leaders and executives from around the globe. APT received recognition for one of its new products from the BIG Awards in 2014 as well, with the APT Index being awarded 2014 New Product of the Year. “Ambition, focus and execution are all characteristics of this year’s winners,” said Russ Fordyce, Managing Director of the Business Intelligence Group. “Our judges were inspired by the people behind the great performances and those who led these organizations to excel. We are so incredibly proud to reward each and every winner and finalist.”\nThe award is a testament to APT SPO’s powerful capability to generate significant profit improvement through rigorous analytics. Its ability to address the challenges retailers and manufacturers encounter when seeking to allocate their store space most effectively creates tremendous value for industry leaders. The SPO software pinpoints the relationship between space and key financial metrics to rapidly deliver optimal, localized space recommendations at the category or department level. SPO also employs APT’s rigorous test versus control methodology to measure the incremental impact of both micro and macro space changes.\nEarlier this year, APT released the latest version of SPO with several unique capabilities, including incorporating operational constraints into recommendations, delivering optimized and localized space allocations, and automating this rigorous analytic process to enable a fast and iterative approach to space optimization. This win for SPO comes just after its recent International Business Award accolade, where it was awarded Best New Product of the Year within the Big Data Solution Category.\nAPT CEO Anthony Bruce commented on the award, stating, “Space Planning Optimizer is truly unique in its abilities to generate actionable and profitable store space recommendations for retailers and manufacturers. We’re humbled to receive this award from an esteemed organization like the Business Intelligence Group, as we continually strive to introduce new analytic capabilities to address specific challenges our clients face, such as space optimization.”\nAbout the Business Intelligence Group (BIG)\nThe Business Intelligence Group was founded with the mission of recognizing true talent and superior performance in the business world.
