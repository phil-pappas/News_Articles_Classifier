Bits and strings of 8 bits called bytes are the foundation of all digital computers.\nImagine instead if a single entity like a bit could exist in multiple states at the same time, and you could measure this.\nImagine if you could perform multiple calculations on those different states of these quantum bits, or qubits, simultaneously. Imagine if something this complex was the fundamental new building block of computers, not just a simple one or zero.\nIt’s like comparing a world of two dimensions with one comprising five, 10 or 50 dimensions.\nProfessor Mark Hoffman, dean of engineering at UNSW, said quantum computing was “the kind of quality, world-leading engineering advance that we need — as a society, as an economy, and as a country — to believe in, to invest in and to support, if we are to create the kind of prosperous, innovative country Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been urging us to become”.\nPossibilities now in reach include searching vast databases, solving complicated sets of equations, and modelling atomic systems such as biological molecules.\nThe capabilities are expected to be enormously useful for the finance and healthcare industries, and for government, security and defence agencies.\nThe full-fledged quantum computer may still be theoretical but that hasn’t stopped corporations and governments, including those of the US, China and Russia, from investing in research and development.\nProfessor Dzurak said his team had patented a design for a full-scale quantum computer chip and will now seek industry partners to manufacture it.\nThe idea of using silicon as a base material for quantum computing was first proposed by former UNSW researcher Bruce Kane in 1998 and Professor Dzurak said the latest breakthrough is another illustration of Australia’s prowess in scientific research.\nThe quantum logic devices were constructed at the Australian National Fabrication Facility and the research is supported by The Australian Research Council, the US Army Research Office, NSW government, Commonwealth Bank and UNSW.", "external_links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature15263"], "published": "2015-10-06T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:16:22.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
