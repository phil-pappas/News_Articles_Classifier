Raters must log in using Facebook accounts with their real identities, and need only a name and matching mobile phone number of the person they are judging. \nThose targeted with unflattering commentary at Peeple are held for two days to give the involved parties time to work matters out. \nTwitter erupted with vitriol aimed at Peeple. A barrage of tweets condemned the idea of an app for rating humans as a nightmare that would be used as a weapon by bullies or stalkers with potentially tragic real-world results. \n\"At least, I signed up to have the world judge and grade me publicly,\" model Christine Teigen said in a tweet from @chrissyteigen. \n\"I f—-ing hate this app and the boardroom table it was created around.\" \n\"In an age where both truth and gossip on the Internet can literally ruin lives, this peeple app is horrible and scary,\" Teigen said in a separate tweet. \nIn a move critics pounced on as hypocritical, Peeple's founders blocked or condemned some of the unsolicited online criticism being fired their way.
