An important concept here is that expectations of the patient play a great role in his recovery and treatment. If there is expectation inside a patient that a pill or medicine can bring medical benefits for him, then it is very much possible that internal chemistry of body can start to produce effects that are caused by medication. At FSTE the main focus is to highlight and bring forward the relationship present between mind and body. Experts, mention that relationship is very much present, between what are the expectations of a person with a particular treatment and if the answer to question is evaluated then it can bring a great medical revolution. The placebo effect can actually be very much useful in treatment of patients and Foundation for the Science of the Therapeutic Encounter is finding the much needed connection by means of practical research.
