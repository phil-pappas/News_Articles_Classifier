The Mexican subsidiary OTRS S.A. de C.V. provides Jugos del Valle with consulting services to customize the OTRS solution to their specific needs and offers care-free administration services of the cloud-based solution managed in ISO/IEC 27001 certified data centers and saving own IT resources for one of the Mexican leading food, juice and beverage companies.\nWith the cloud-based issue tracking system OTRS Business Solution Managed PLATINUM, Jugos del Valle can record and handle requests from customers and different areas related to the retail market and its specific requirements. These range from supplying the main self-service stores with products, to tracking individual issues with each store for improving communication, thus giving the company a competitive advantage.\nThe Jugos del Valle IT and BI team explains why they chose a cloud-based issue tracking system: “OTRS Group convinced us not only thanks to their worldwide presence through subsidiaries and partners, but especially due to their subsidiary in Mexico, which gives us direct contact and access to their excellent services. In addition, their product OTRS Business Solution Managed helps us take a load off our own IT resources and concentrate on our business.”\nChristopher Kuhn, COO of OTRS Group, is proud about this recent acquisition as it clearly shows Mexican businesses as trend setters: “Since five years cloud-based service management solutions are announced as the future, but businesses around the globe have been reluctant to follow it due to doubts about data security.
