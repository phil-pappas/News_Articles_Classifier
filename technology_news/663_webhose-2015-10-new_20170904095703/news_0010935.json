(NASDAQ, TASE: ALLT) a leading global provider of intelligent broadband solutions that empower communication service providers to optimize and monetize their networks, enterprises to enhance productivity and consumers to improve their digital lifestyle, announced today that The Telecommunications and Information Technology Center of the Generalitat de Catalunya (CTTI) selected Allot to protect Catalonia's September 2015 elections from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) cyber-attacks. \nCTTI is a public entity created to integrate all of Catalonia's computing and telecommunication services under a single structure. CTTI is responsible for leading the direction, planning, management and control of all the computing systems and the telecommunication services of Generalitat de Catalunya. As the organization managing the IT operations for the September election, CTTI knew that it needed to deploy a security solution that could protect the infrastructure from \"hacktivists\" looking to disturb the region's political process. \nCTTI has been an Allot customer since 2009, first leveraging Allot Service Gateway to obtain network usage insights to deliver high quality of service (QoS) to various public administration agencies. To prepare for the elections, CTTI deployed Allot ServiceProtector as a service, a solution designed to detect and block DDoS attacks within seconds, before they have the potential to threaten or interrupt a network service. \nLluís Guillén Cabrera, TIC Services Director from Centre de Telecomunicacions i Tecnologies de la Informació de la Generalitat de atalunya \"I am very satisfied with the protection provided against DDoS attacks by Allot ServiceProtector throughout the critical operations that took place during the past elections, celebrated on Sept 27th in Catalonia, safeguarding our systems against the attacks encountered during that important event and the days prior to the elections\". \n\"Allot worked closely with CTTI to deploy an automated and robust security solution scalable enough to stop even the largest DDoS attacks,\" said Gary Drutin, Chief Customer Officer, Allot Communications. \"By inspecting 100 percent of the network traffic and surgically mitigating threats, Allot was able to ensure that the Catalonian elections could operate smoothly and without network disruption.\" \nAbout Allot Communications \nAllot Communications Ltd.
