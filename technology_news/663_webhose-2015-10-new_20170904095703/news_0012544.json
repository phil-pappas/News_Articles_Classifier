Whoever is responsible for this will be brought to book,\" Sonowal said.\nSAI DG Injeti Srinivas described the incident unfortunate but categorically stated that \"nobody asked us for accommodation\".\n\"You criticise SAI whenever it is due but this case is a complete distortion of facts. Nobody asked us for accommodation. The athletes are suffering because their federation - All India Sports Council of the Deaf - is in a mess. The body has not even settled the accounts for the previous trip but despite that we made an exception and cleared Rs 50 lakh for the trip,\" Srinivas told PTI.\n\"As far as the visa issue is concerned, I have found that the athletes visa was rejected earlier because they did not provide the invitation letter of the Taiwanese Embassy.\n\"Thereafter, we took up the matter to ministry level and MEA got involved. The MEA informed us that visa will be given by Thursday but it was not processed due to a server problem. So they were anyway going to get the visa today, in not today then Monday. Clearly it is a case of federation not taking care of its athletes,\" the DG added.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:27:04.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
