It makes a mockery of the very principles she ought to uphold in the eyes of the public,” said the statement.\nThe chief whip said that legal cases brought by the likes of the EFF and the Democratic Alliance were not about the defence of the rule of law and the Constitution as they claimed, but were “driven by oppositional political interests”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:06:17.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
