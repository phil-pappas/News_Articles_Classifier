Included in the Damen transport are two Fast Crew Suppliers 2610, one ASD Tug 2310, three ASD Tugs 2411 and three ASD Tugs 3212, all of which have been sold and will be delivered to clients upon arrival. Additionally, there are a number of completed vessels available for sale. These are, two Stan Tugs 1606, two Stan Tugs 1004, two Stan Tugs 1907, two Stan Pontoons 5213, two Stan Pontoons 3011, a further ASD Tug 3212 and two Stan Launches 1004.\nThe Damen stock vessels are ready for operation, and so can be swiftly delivered to clients upon purchase. However, they can still be equipped with options specified by the client. Having arrived in Rotterdam the vessels will receive final touch-ups and cleaning before being delivered, either to clients or to various Damen shipyards.\nHugo Hoekstra, Design Engineer Pontoons & Barges at Damen Shipyards, said: “The main reason for this transport is to bring our stock closer to customers who demand short delivery times. Damen is able to group globally-produced stock vessels together in a transport to minimise cost of shipment, making our vessels available for clients of all sizes and industries.”\nMr Buconić, Commercial Manager at BigLift Shipping: \"Damen Shipyards and BigLift Shipping go back a long time. With Happy Star in position, BigLift was able to offer Damen a practical solution to bring a large number of their stock vessels to Rotterdam in one shipment. We are happy that we could offer Damen our technical solutions.\"\nFact File: Damen Shipyards Group \nDamen Shipyards Group operates 32 shipbuilding and repair yards, employing 9,000 people worldwide.
