In fact if it hadn''t been for the persistent effort of his brother''s wife his memoir may very well have died with him. a good death is John Anthony Noonan''s memoir edited by Karen Noonan who also wrote the foreword. In her words:'' It seems fitting that he did not have to suffer from a long illness after having cared for his partner Christopher Clements through his six-year battle with AIDS. It had been eight years since Chris''s death but Chris and ''the good death'' were never far from John''s thoughts.''When John and Chris exchanged rings in an idyllic private ceremony on Martha''s Vineyard they didn''t suspect what their life together would become. A relentless round of hospital visits featuring a heartless receptionist and but one empathetic doctor; the giving and taking of multiple medications some with unexpected bipolar side effects; and that it would ultimately end as it began in their own private and extraordinary way.''Beyond a witty recollection of tender care-giving and negotiating the health care system John Noonan''s memoir reveals a unique perspective on life and love.''John Noonan was a talented musician and artist.a good death (16.00 ISBN: 978-0-6924-6782-4) a 126-page paperback published by Buffalo Arts Publishing is available at most major online book retailers and directly from the publisher at www.buffaloartspublishing.com.
