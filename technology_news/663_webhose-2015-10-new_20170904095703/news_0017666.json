An offering of the Qualcomm Reference Design (QRD) program, Global Pass reduces device manufacturers upfront development costs and accelerates device commercialization while maximizing the global potential of devices. Qualcomm Global Pass extends Qualcomm Technologies' collaboration with America Movil in modem technologies and certification to device commercialization. As America Movil begins migrating many of its 2G and 3G customers to 4G, Global Pass ensures that device manufacturers can create differentiated LTE products that comply with America Movil's unique regional specifications in a quick, efficient and affordable manner. With the Global Pass platform for America Movil , the operator will work closely with OEMs and ODMs in bringing a wide offering of high quality products to Latin America quickly.\nGlobal Pass integrates device specifications, modem configurations and operator-specific requirements into a hardware and software Qualcomm Reference Design offering when coupled with a Snapdragon processor. The program includes extensive regional and carrier testing, which provides operators with a pretested and consistent implementation of their specifications, as well as offers OEM's and ODM's commercialization advantages as they launch their differentiated products based on the platform in new regions.\n\"Our collaboration with America Movil represents the next step in the evolution of the QRD program and the Global Pass asset,\" said Larry Paulson , vice president of product management, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. \"We are able to better answer the needs of manufacturers and operators by making the process of device development and regional certification more affordable and significantly easier.\"\n\"We're excited to work with Qualcomm Technologies in implementing the Global Pass program.
