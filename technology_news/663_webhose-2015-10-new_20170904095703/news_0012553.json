With educational requirements now harder to meet, an already candidate-short market is under even more pressure. As a result there is very high demand for financial planners with their CFP or degree.\nHEALTHCARE\nAustralia’s growing aged care sector is creating demand for case managers and co-ordinators, clinical care co-ordinators, endorsed enrolled nurses and clinical managers. Restructures and growth in the disabilities market have increased demand for highly specialised service co-ordinators, home care assessors, case managers and client services facilitators.\nIn other areas of healthcare demand, experienced child protection workers, social workers, general practitioners, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists, radiographers, sonographers and speech pathologists are needed.\nINSURANCE\nThere continues to be high demand for skilled professionals in insurance as a whole but the market remains candidate short, especially for claims assessors in life insurance and general insurance, account executives and assistant account executives in broking, insurance administrators in life and general insurance and superannuation processing officers.\nLEGAL FIRMS\nCandidate shortage is a major challenge for employers, especially in transactional areas such as corporate and banking and finance. Senior associates and associates in commercial litigation, commercial law, corporate and finance are all in short supply, as are corporate mergers and acquisitions lawyers.\nMARKETING\nThe biggest trend within Australia’s marketing sector is the increasing need for digital professionals and this shows no sign of abating. Digital producers, content producers, paid search executives, digital campaign managers, and digital marketing co-ordinators and managers are all sought.\nThe market is also very competitive for general communications and marketing candidates, as well as candidates with niche skills such as internal communications, change communications and digital communications.\nSALES\nAs businesses add to their sales focus, the pool of proven and experienced sales candidates has reduced. From skilled outbound telemarketers to hungry sales representatives, sales managers and business development managers, sales professionals are in high demand.\nFive Jobs Robots Do Better Than You 2:11 Play video\nIt's hard enough to lose a job to someone more qualified than you, but probably even harder if that preferred candidate is a robot.
