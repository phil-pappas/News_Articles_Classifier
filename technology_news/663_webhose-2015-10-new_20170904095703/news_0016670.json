By Bailey Myers, Reporter Last Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015, 5:19 PM ORLANDO -- \nOn Saturday parents took a turn in the classroom, learning how their students are using brand new digital technology at school. \nIt’s called Orange County Schools Parent Academy. Parents can come out to see the latest technology being used to teach their kids. \nParents learned more about Edmodo, an online educational social media site for parents, teachers and students. \n“So we want to give parents all the tools that help them assist their child,” said Gavonne Aponte, the Family and Community Outreach coordinator for Orange County Public Schools. \nTheir hope is that parents will walk away knowing how to access Edmodo online, which allows them to access student assignments, keep track of how they are doing in class, and even enable them to talk directly with their children’s teachers. \n“It was great to see how I can access some of the educational assignments in her class so I can help her,” said Nutoshia Carr, parent of a Liberty High School student. \nEducating parents was also something their kids enjoyed getting to see. \n“As much as it’s a hassle to keep up and campaign, as long as parents know what their student is doing it’s helpful,” Said Freedom High School junior Matthew Elizale. \nWe were told Orange County Schools plans on having more of these Parent Academies throughout the year to keep parents plugged in. The event is completely free. The next academy will be Nov. 14 at West Orange High School. latest news: education", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:19:33.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
