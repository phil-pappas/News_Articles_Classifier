The company also announces the availability of its Wave Master, a wavelength tuning, configuration and BER tester for 100G applications. \nMenara DWDM 100G CFP is a dual-rate, full C-band tunable 100% MSA compliant CFP form factor with a standard CAUI interface. Menara DWDM CFP accepts either 100GE or OUT-4 client signal and provides 4x25Gbps or 4x28 Gbps DWDM wavelengths on the line side. Each DWDM channel can be independently tuned across the entire C-band 50 GHz grid and is transmitted using the dispersion tolerant optical duo-binary modulation format (ODB) for extended reach. Menara DWDM CFP integrates built-in PRBS generation and checking for link check and ease of deployment, consumes less than 24 watts and is compatible with all major routers and MPLS switches. \n“We are excited to announce General Availability and volume shipment of our Telcordia qualified DWDM 100G CFP solution,” announces Siraj Nour ElAhmadi, Menara Co-Founder and CEO. “With several hundred units shipped to date, we have successfully enabled our Internet Exchange Providers and Data Center Operator customers to quickly and efficiently turn-up 100G services between their data centers. The links ranging up to 300 km were often turned up on existing 10G DWDM infrastructure without the prohibitive cost, footprint and power of a coherent solution. In fact across Europe, USA and South America, our customers deployed our metro DWDM CFP directly into their routers without the need to dedicate valuable space in their data centers for 100G DWDM transponders resulting in an elegant, simple and cost effective solution consistent with Menara’s long standing position of simplifying DWDM networks.” \n“There is a genuine need for cost effective 100G solutions for the metro and data center interconnect markets,” observes Andrew Schmitt, Research Director for Carrier Transport Networking at IHS. “While coherent cost and power consumption continues to improve, there is definitely an opportunity for other approaches. We expect direct detection 100G and 400G solutions to play a significant role in the 80 km and below market in the coming few years.” \nMenara Networks is also introducing the Wave Master, a companion product to its DWDM CFP designed from the ground up with the operator in mind to simplify and streamline 100G links turn up and testing without the need for bulky and expensive 100G test sets. Menara Wave Master comes with a simple graphical interface to allow the user to tune each channel wavelength individually, run full diagnostics on the DWDM CFP and run BER tests for link characterization. \nMenara DWDM CFP, the Wave Master and the company’s comprehensive portfolio of transport solutions will be showcased at Menara’s booth #1008 on the exhibit floor of this year’s SCTE CableTec Expo taking place from October 14 through October 16 in New Orleans, LA.
