This means potentially $11 trillion dollars of assets are currently managed in manual spreadsheets, with all their inherent risk of inaccuracies and human error.\nIn addition, the report also reveals that three quarters of the CRE industry is managing its portfolios in “data silos.” This unconnected approach to managing information and assets, which often requires cumbersome data aggregation from multiple sources, can significantly hamper the timely data-driven decision-making and reporting transparency that investors are increasingly demanding. Without modern data management infrastructure and systems, investors could judge the industry participants as “behind-the-curve,” threatening their ability to attract trillions of dollars of additional institutional capital predicted to be allocated to the CRE industry in the next decade.\nRead Entire Article at: http://realstreettech.com/cre-firms-need-to-speed-up-technology-investment/\nAbout Us:\nTechnology’s impact on commercial real estate is moving at an exponential rate.
