That allows smartphones and wearable devices to be thinner, more energy efficient and more powerful. SiP design is used in the iPhone 6S and the Apple Watch, and analysts said Hon Hai, Advanced Semiconductor and SPIL are targeting billions in dollars in potential revenue and new orders from Apple.\nIn August, Advanced Semiconductor, the No. 1 player in the chip packaging industry, made a $1 billion tender offer for shares in SPIL and subsequently obtained a 25% stake, becoming its largest shareholder. The tender offer was an attempt to take control of rival SPIL after competition intensified in the chip packaging industry as fast-growing Chinese competitor Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Co. acquired No. 4 ranked STATSChipPAC Ltd. earlier this year, analysts said.\nTo fend off what was seen as hostile takeover bid from Advanced Semiconductor, SPIL announced an alliance with Hon Hai a week later and disclosed plans for a share swap that would have given Hon Hai a 21.2% stake in SPIL. A successful alliance with Hon Hai--which assembles the majority of the world's iPhones--would have diluted Advanced Semiconductor's stake in SPIL to 19.7%, knocking it down from its top shareholder status.\nThe alliance with SPIL was an important step for Hon Hai as it seeks new growth engines. Over the past decade, Hon Hai has been expanding in new markets beyond the labor-intensive device assembly by setting up several semiconductor units including printed-circuit-board maker Zhen Ding Technology Holding Ltd. and chip-packaging provider ShunSin Technology Holdings Ltd.\nSPIL, which failed to get enough shareholder votes to approve its share swap with Hon Hai, said Thursday it would continue to collaborate with Hon Hai to win new orders in the SiP market. The company's founders also plan to increase their stake in SPIL to fend off Advanced Semiconductor's influence on its business strategy.\nAdvanced Semiconductor said it respects the outcome of the meeting. Hon Hai wasn't immediately available for comment.\nWrite to Lorraine Luk at lorraine.luk@wsj.com\n 15, 2015 07:55 ET (11:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:52:09.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
