Providing very detailed insights into the performance, that was accessible earlier, of what has typically been very disparate processes will assist our customers in making faster, smarter decisions that can ultimately impact overall business performance,\" said Ashwin Goyal, Group Vice President, Oracle Financial Services. \"This new capability complements the hundreds of billions of dollars that the existing Oracle product currently prices and bills annually for more than 30 financial institutions across banks, insurers, payment providers, healthcare providers and fintechs.\" \n\"To address the transaction volume of the largest financial services institutions, Oracle recently benchmarked Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing to process over 1 billion transactions per day which is equal to four times the U.S. average daily debit and credit card transaction volumes,\" added Goyal. \nThe new version is written in Java and features key customer productivity enhancements including increased flexibility in dynamic parameters, value-based pricing, trial billing, tolerance reviews and Common Separated Values (CVS) document processing. Enhanced pricing features enable customers to incent their customer loyalty and effectively manage ever-changing interest rates. Trial billing enables customers to accelerate the monthly billing process and the use of business rules to define thresholds for automated and systematic monitoring of customer revenue variances as well as supports improved revenue management. Additionally, CVS document processing enables banks to upload documents and generate pricing and billing, giving banks choices as to how bills can be created. \nThe new offering, Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing Analytics, delivers detailed insights into operational performance trends that can significantly influence profitability and performance, such as time-based receivables dashboards segmented by customer type and currency, total number of priced events during a specific time period and how fees and transaction volumes affect the business and unrealized revenue, thereby unveiling error-prone, manual intensive processes that can be corrected. In addition, Oracle Financial Services Revenue Management and Billing Analytics can visibly show contract churn and revenue loss from contract closures as well as trends against recorded KPIs. This robust combination of features enables financial services institutions to take direct action to improve customer loyalty and competitive advantage. \n\"As a FinTech company in the payments space, we understand the need to not only get to the market fast with new products and services, but also to have complete confidence in our revenue management lifecycle.
