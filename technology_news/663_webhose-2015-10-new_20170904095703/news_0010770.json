Last fall the Cincinnati Fire Lt. was getting frustrated by the moment when collecting leaves in the very small leaf blower bag attachment and then having to transfer them to a much larger yard waste bag. \nAt his Springfield Township Glisson demonstrated how cumbersome it can be to have to fill up one bag and dump it into another. \nHe now has a solution to the problem. His invention is called \"The Eliminator.\" \nA hard plastic leaf screen fits over the yard waste bag and attaches to the leaf blower. The holes allow air to escape so the bag doesn't blow up. \nGlisson has a patent pending and is busy promoting his system at various trade shows. He is just back from Las Vegas.
