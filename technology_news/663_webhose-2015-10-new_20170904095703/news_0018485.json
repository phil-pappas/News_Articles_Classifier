In a recent report on the connected home, BI Intelligence predicts that the smart home market will grow at an annual rate of 67% between now and 2019, resulting in 1.8 billion accessories being shipped in that year. \nDialog's Bluetooth Smart development kit, based on its SmartBond(TM) DA14580 System-on-Chip (SoC), will help create accessories with the fastest response times, creating the best possible user experience. Initial pairing set up takes 4.5 seconds and pair-verify, which occurs whenever an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch issues a command, takes only 250 ms. The DA14580, which is available in a tiny 2.5 x 2.5 mm package, also offers the lowest power consumption in its class with a peak current of less than 5 mA, maximising battery life. \n\"HomeKit is unifying smart home accessories with a common set of controls, user interface elements and end-to-end encryption which is an important step for the home automation market, said Sean McGrath, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Connectivity, Automotive & Industrial Business Group at Dialog. \"We are pleased to be on board with our own Bluetooth Smart development kit that fully supports the HomeKit framework. Our kit enables developers to achieve differentiation and a competitive advantage through delivering a superior user experience and accelerating time to market for their smart home accessories.\" \nThe SmartBond development kits feature a power profiler for power-optimised coding and Dialog's SmartSnippets(TM) software development environment, based on Keil(TM) ÂµVision tools. \nThe kits are available now at https://mfi.avnet.com/MFI/ \nSmartBond and SmartSnippets are trademarks of Dialog Semiconductor.
