The case study was featured recently in Modern Materials Handling by Josh Bond, Senior Editor.\nThe 350,000-square-foot distribution center delivers wine and spirits to liquor stores, grocery chains and restaurants throughout the state. Shortly after the facility opened, Washington voters approved the privatization of the distribution and sale of distilled spirits. After the law change, SWS redesigned its facility with automation to enter the spirits market and quickly increase capacity.\nWith goals of expansion and efficiency in mind, the final system included four pick modules: one split case and three full case pick modules. Orders originate in one of the four locations, depending on whether full cases, split cases, or both are needed. From the pick modules, orders are conveyed to a central merge and released based on their route. A project this size would normally take nine months to complete, but SWS had only four months if it wanted to be the first to leverage the new law.\n“We were in a key position to take up some of that business,” says Jesse Perez, night manager at Southern Wine & Spirits of Washington. “We were only a wine distributor before, so our business was going to more than double. That meant the old ways of picking orders manually was not going to work, so the company decided to go full automation.”\nTo read the entire article, go to: http://bit.ly/1LvAYho\nAbout Bastian Solutions\nBastian Solutions (http://ow.ly/LaOTe), a global material handling systems integrator and expert in e-commerce fulfillment automation is an innovator in the fields of material handling automation, goods-to-person systems, wearable AR technology, supply chain software, and robotics.
