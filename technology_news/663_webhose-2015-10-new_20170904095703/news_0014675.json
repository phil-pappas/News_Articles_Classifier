His 30-year career includes executive sales & marketing positions with IBM and CA/Newtrend Software. At STEALTHbits, Mike will be responsible for all sales & marketing functions, including pre-sales, renewals and account management, and channel sales. \n\"Earlier in my career, I held a senior management position in a young, growing technology company very similar to STEALTHbits,\" added Mike, \"and I look forward to leading a dynamic organization like that again. Companies at our stage of development need just enough discipline to function effectively as we mature and take advantage of the myriad market opportunities available to us, but without stifling the creativity, energy, and innovation that gives us our competitive advantage over our less flexible competitors.\" \nABOUT STEALTHbits Technologies \nIdentify threats.
