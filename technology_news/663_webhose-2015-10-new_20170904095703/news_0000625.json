AHA Endorsement is awarded to products and services that help member hospitals and healthcare organizations achieve operational excellence. \nImprivata Cortext is a secure, HIPAA-compliant cloud-based healthcare communication platform that enables providers to communicate across their mobile device, tablet, or desktop to better coordinate care with colleagues. Imprivata Cortext allows clinicians to communicate in real-time, which streamlines clinical workflow efficiency, enhances staff satisfaction, and improves provider response rate. \n\"Today, while nearly all facets of healthcare have been or are attempting to be digitized, communication between clinicians still largely takes place through pagers and other outdated technologies-creating an epidemic of inefficient communication,\" explained Ed Gaudet, general manager of the Imprivata Cortext Products Group. \"We are pleased that the AHA has recognized the need for simple, secure messaging in and outside the hospital walls, and we are honored to be awarded with their exclusive endorsement.\" \nAccording to Imprivata research , care providers waste an average of 45 minutes per day using pagers and other outdated communications tools, which accounts for up to $1.75 million in losses per hospital, per year, or more than $11 billion industry wide. \n\"Imprivata Cortext provides clinicians with the tools necessary to efficiently and securely contact colleagues, driving a culture of safety and better quality care across U.S. hospitals,\" said Anthony Burke, senior vice president of AHA, and president and CEO of AHA Solutions. \nThe AHA Endorsement was awarded to the Imprivata Cortext secure messaging platform based on a number of key differentiators, including its ability to sync messges in real time; its centralized platform which supports clinical, broadcast and patient communication across multiple sites in the care continuum; and proven adoption. Unlike standard texting solutions, Imprivata Cortext is a healthcare-specific communications platform focused on helping to improve critical healthcare workflows - such as patient flow, transition of care notifications, medication order verifications, lab results and referrals - to optimize operational efficiency. \nAbout Imprivata \nImprivata® (NYSE: IMPR), the healthcare IT security company, provides healthcare organizations globally with a security and identity platform that delivers authentication management, fast access to patient information, secure communications, and positive patient identification.
