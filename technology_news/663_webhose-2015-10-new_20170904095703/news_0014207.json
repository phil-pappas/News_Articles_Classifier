The digitally simulated experience educates by using mind mapping approach to reinforce the healthy ritual of self breast exam, ultimately raising breast awareness, with the goal of empowering women to become their own breast health advocates, improving communication with their healthcare professional.\nComplete with full BSE instructions and interactive 3D illustrations, Know Your Breasts app also includes visual diagrams on breast anatomy and anomalies. The most intriguing aspect, however, is how it educates through memory mapping digital technology. Users move their hand across the tablet to “feel” various parts of the breast, and uncover anatomy under the skin, through an interactive experience of self breast exam.\n“We are thrilled to collaborate with BioLucid on this Breast Health Awareness Initiative, using their ground-breaking technology to make breast health visual for women,” Melissa Kirkpatrick, Founder of Circuelle Foundation, states. “If a picture says a thousand words; this app is a textbook in two minutes.
