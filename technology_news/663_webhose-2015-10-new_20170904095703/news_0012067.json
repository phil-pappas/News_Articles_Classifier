UBM Tech released the \"The Mind of the IT Pro: How The Tech Buy Goes Down\" research report. The report provides insight into modern day IT professionals, their organizations, the collaborative IT purchase process and successful vendor engagement.\nUBM Tech will host the webinar \"How The Tech Buy Goes Down\" on Tuesday, October 6, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET to discuss the research in detail. The webinar will be presented by UBM Tech's Kathleen Connolly , EVP, IT Event and Media Sales, Amy Doherty , Director of Research, and moderated by Brian Gillooly , VP of Events Content & Strategy. To register for the webinar, visit http://ubm.io/1KaN1SN .\n\"Our research shows that sustained brand awareness of a product or service is vital to get on an IT buying team's short list,\" said Amy Doherty , Director of Research, UBM Tech. \"With quick sales processes involving large teams of decision makers, tech marketers need to educate prospects early through an integrated marketing program that clearly conveys how a product or service provides more value than the competition.\"\nStudy highlights include:\nIT professionals are seasoned, educated and influential, with aspiration toward a C-level position and technology is engrained in both their work and personal lives. Tech marketers need to reach IT professionals at all titles and functions early in the tech buying process with messages that speak to business challenges and prove ROI. Sixty percent use a group approach or \"purchasing committee\" for technology decisions. Typically five to nineteen people are involved in a tech purchase. For smaller purchases of under $1 million , less than five people are involved. Fifty-eight percent of IT professionals involve three to five vendors in a formal RFP process. Tech marketers can help influence their decision making by taking these actions: demonstrate how their technology will solve the business problem, provide a clear ROI and develop a long term relationship with the prospect. The research report is based on a survey of 415 business technology professionals who are personally involved in the technology decision-making process.\nTo learn more about UBM Tech marketing solutions, contact:\nWinnie Ng Schuchman\nVP of Marketing, UBM Tech\nwinnie.ng@ubm.com\nAbout UBM Tech\nUBM Tech engages technology professionals live and online through its world-class brands, including Black Hat, InformationWeek, Enterprise Connect, Game Developers Conference (GDC), Dark Reading, HDI, GTEC, Network Computing and Interop.
