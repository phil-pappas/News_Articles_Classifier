This tool measures friction by braking one wheel independently of others on a vehicle. \nViaFriction was developed in 2006 using the experience that ViaTech gained through time spent working on RoAR friction meters. Continuous friction measuring systems for road vehicles \nThe ViaFriction is a piece of continuous friction measuring equipment (CFME). \nViaFriction can measure friction using fixed slip (i.e. the skiddometer principle), and the longitudinal percentage can be set to anything from 1% to 85%. The fixed slip measurement then gives a continuous record of friction levels on the road. \nViaFriction can measure friction levels using variable slip. The slip percentage is quickly moved from 0% through to 85%, with the corresponding friction level being recorded. This gives the complete friction-slip curve for the pavement surface. \nBoth vehicle tracks can be measured through use of the dual ViaFriction, which consists of two ViaFriction units combined in one friction system. The dual ViaFriction method can also find the split friction. Modular friction systems for trailers and vehicles \nThe ViaFriction consists of a friction measurement unit and a watering system. ViaFriction can be fitted on a trailer, together with a 1,000l tank, which allows for 30km of measurement. \nViaFriction can also be fitted on larger vehicles such as trucks, which allows for more water to be stored and longer stretches of measurement before a refill is required. Two ViaFriction units can be fitted on the same vehicle. This allows measurements in both wheel tracks, similar to split friction measurement. \nThe correct level of thickness for the water film in front of the measure wheel is vital for finding accurate friction levels. The ViaFriction watering system gives a computer-controlled film of either 0.5mm or 1mm in front of the measure wheel. \nWater is applied at vehicle speed, so will therefore not wash the road surface in front of the measure wheel. Advanced suspension to prevent influence to vehicle movement \nViaFriction uses an advanced suspension system for the measure wheel, ensuring that it has the correct vertical load on to the pavement surface at any time. The connection between the friction unit and the vehicle prevents vertical movements from influencing the friction unit's vertical load. High-speed cameras, temperature sensors and road texture scanners \nMore than 70 ViaFriction devices have been sold. Some even measure as many as 20,000km per year on uneven roads. The ViaFriction is made up of only a few parts, so is easily serviceable. The device also has a diagnostic system, pinpointing the parts that need to be serviced. \nViaFriction can be equipped with global navigation satillite systems (GNSS), high-speed cameras, temperature sensors (both road surface and air), and a texture scanner. The road-surface values are needed to determine values for the International Friction Index (IFI). \nViaFriction can also send live data and pictures through an attached camera to an internet server. The live data is placed on a map, and can then be monitored using a web browser. About ViaTech \nViaTech has many years' experience in the development, manufacturing and maintenance of friction devices. ViaFriction is assembled and tested in ViaTech's production facility. Software and development of the device is performed in-house. \nMost of the ViaFriction units are serviced annually by ViaTech. ViaTech is also responsible for the control software, maintenance and support of the ROaR friction equipment in Norway and the Norwegian Oscar friction device.
