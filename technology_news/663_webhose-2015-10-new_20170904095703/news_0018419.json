( bit.ly/1LnRAqt )\nAlibaba, however, has been struggling with slowing growth in recent months.\nIt warned in September that the total value of transactions in the second-quarter would be lower than previously thought, a fresh signal that China's slowdown was taking a bite out of consumer spending.\n\"Recently, signals of China's economic slowdown have triggered widespread concern and, I believe, overreaction around the world,\" Ma said in the letter.\nChina's economy grew 7 percent in the second quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, and the government expects full-year growth to be about the same, making it the weakest annual growth in 25 years.\nMa said the current GDP growth pattern was not sustainable.\n\"If China continues to pursue the high growth rates of the past, then China will pay a high price,\" he said, adding that the country's economic development should be focused more on quality than on quantity.\nAlibaba's shares were up 1.1 percent at $66.99 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
