Residents and visitors may submit ideas to the council through an evaluation process. \nSecond, the public can provide feedback on problems at facilities, such as parks, beaches and roads, by photographing them and specifying locations. Third, the Smart Majlis will periodically meet to conduct brainstorming sessions, it said.\nDubai Police chief Maj Gen Khamis Al Muzeina praised the new initiative and said: “The UAE is made of teams in all fields that will take our achievements to the peaks, because we are a people that doesn’t love life except when [on top].”\nDubai Police are also studying ways to implement four suggestions put forth by the council, Maj Gen Al Muzeina said. People can participate by using the MBRMajlis smartphone application or visiting www.MBRMajlis.ae.\nnewsdesk@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:12:24.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
