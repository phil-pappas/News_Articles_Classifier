Olympic Gold Medallist Ben Hunt-Davis, Aston Business School, and management consulting experts, Lumenia Consulting, will also be speaking at the event at The Royal Horseguards, Whitehall Place, London. \nThe conference is being held on November 11, just a few months after the CBI downgraded its growth forecast for the UK economy to 2.5% in 2016, down from 2.6% previously. In this figure, the manufacturing sector suffers the most with a four point drop in growth forecasts – the biggest fall since March 2013. With CCS Media predicting that three in four UK businesses will increase their spending on IT next year in order to remain competitive during difficult times, the message from Columbus is to embrace technology as a business opportunity rather than an IT project, and get as much advice and support prior to a large implementation as possible, which is what this event was created for. \nColumbus Managing Director, Mary Hunter, explained: \"We want to inspire business leaders to make 2016 their best year yet, but in order to achieve this, the planning, preparation and change starts now. \" \n\"Is your supply chain becoming more competitive? Are you concerned that technology is hampering your performance rather than accelerating it? Is your business suffering because of poor information flow? These are all issues that need to be resolved now in order for businesses to prosper. Our line-up of speakers have all experienced business change and helped companies to achieve growth by addressing all of these challenges and more, and they will be sharing their experiences on the day.\" \nA Microsoft Gold Partner and finalist of the Global ERP Partner of the year 2015, Columbus is a business that continuously grows, and recently revealed a group revenue increase of 26% throughout the first half of 2015. In the UK the company has had the external support of Ben Hunt Davis' Will It Make The Boat Go Faster programme – a performance improvement initiative that has taught Columbus how to use simple, consistent, everyday techniques, leading to measurable improvement and habitual excellence, based on the novel approach that Ben Hunt-Davis took with his training when preparing to win Olympic Gold in 2000. Ben Hunt-Davis will be sharing his advice at Transform 2016 and Mary Hunter said that Columbus can speak firsthand about the difference this approach has made. \n\"Sometimes, business leaders need to take time out of their company, in order to spend time on their company, planning and executing their growth strategy and that is what Transform 2016 is all about. The world is changing at a rapid pace, technology is constantly evolving and businesses need to be ready to embrace these changes and focus everyone in their team around the strategic goals of the business. Next year could become one of the most successful for UK businesses, but in order for that to happen, we need to start planning change now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:18:59.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
