October 23rd 2015 3 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ DEEP in the remote outback in Australia’s Top End lurk crocodiles so huge, one of them is said to weigh one massive tonne. \nLocals say they’ve been terrorised by this growing gnash of monster reptiles. The crocs have been snapping up horses and livestock, and a few years ago almost took a young boy’s life. \nCommunity elders know there is only one man to help: Matt Wright, a real-life Crocodile Dundee, who they’ve asked to hunt, capture and relocate the ferocious beasts. \nLast night on 60 Minutes , a gung-ho Peter Stefanovic joined Wright on his wild and risky mission to do just that. \n“It was incredible. These crocs are very big and very wild and very dangerous. We got a really close-up view of them all in action,” Stefanovic told news.com.au. \n“On the first day we caught about a 10-foot (three-metre) female, but then on the final couple of days we caught the giants — we caught a 16-foot (4.9-metre) male, and then the next day we caught a 17-foot (5.2-metre) male and that was the biggest.
