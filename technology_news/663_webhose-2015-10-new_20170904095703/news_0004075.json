The numbers probably look something a bit like the data set below. \nI have an example of monthly sales, and the difference month on month of those sales figures. The negative differences are easy enough to see in the data. \nMonth Sales Difference In Sales \nJan 0 \nJun 6 -49 \nJuly 56 50 \nSo, how about making the positive numbers just as identifiable with a + sign in front of the numbers?. It is really easy in Excel to create these formats using the custom number formatting feature in Excel. \nThere are varying monthly performances; the negatives are obvious so let's go ahead and make the positive ones just as obvious. \nWord of note... If we apply only the positive formatting to the data range in the above example we will wipe the original formatting of the negative values, (not exactly what we want), we therefore need to also take into account negative values and ensure we re- apply formatting for them as well. This is just as easy to do at the same time as applying the positive conditional formatting. \nSelect the range of cells you want to format. Home tab \nOr hit CTRL+1 to open the format cells dialog box \nSelect Custom \nHere is the same set of data with the new formatting - what do you think? \nMonth Sales Difference In Sales \nJan 0 \nJun 6 -49 \nJuly 56 +50 \nBoth the positive and the negative numbers are formatted (+0;-0)along with the blank cell reference having no formatting at all. This is the last;0 part of the formatting instructions to Excel, without this small part of the formatting, you would have a + sign formatting on your blank cells. I add the extra formatting into the expression as I do not like the + sign on the blank cells. But this is entirely down to your preferences \nHave you ever used this type of formatting?. Do you think that this makes a difference to the impact of the data at all? \nBJ Johnston has been an advanced Excel user for 15 years and is the creator of http://www.howtoexcelatexcel.com a site that shares Excel tips and tricks with it's enthusiastic members.
