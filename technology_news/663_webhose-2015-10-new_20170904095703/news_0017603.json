In addition to the regulatory requirement put in place by the FDA, accounting for human factors will help ensure a safer product and greater usability while also mitigating risks related to misuse and reducing training associated with the device.\nThere are several guidelines for assessing human factors for medical devices: IEC 62366-1:2015 which outlines the application of usability engineering of medical devices in Part 1; an FDA Draft Guidance document on applying human factors and usability engineering in medical device design; and ANSI/AAMI HE75:2009 on human factors engineering in the design of medical devices. To comply with these guidelines, there are several steps to take throughout the design process, once a general design brief is made.\n1. User Research\nMarket research, competitive analysis, complaints and other insights are evaluated to identify issues that may arise with the use of a device. Existing issues from a manufacturer or competitor, field research and assessments of anticipated use scenarios—including setting, user profiles, task analysis and intended use—are all considered to identify potential hazards and created mitigation specifications.\n2. Conceptual Design\nIndustrial designers and mechanical engineers develop the device’s concept based on product requirements, exploratory walkthroughs, testing and exploration to inform the design team. This will confirm the design direction, highlight fundamental usability issues and identify where training and labeling needs will emerge, as well as how those needs should be addressed.\n3. Requirements\nBased on the information gathered during the research and design phase, documentation must be updated and a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) must be performed. This entails a detailed analysis of each step of a device’s use, identifying: what could go wrong; the root cause for said failures; and measures/controls to reduce risk. Additionally, this is the point where usability specifications must be created by assessing interface requirements and the testing specifications to address potential issues.\n4. Detailed Design and Specification\nAt this stage, the designers and mechanical engineers review product requirements and findings from the previous stage to make more detailed design specifications. It will also be important to develop training and labeling requirements and undergo formative and partial system testing, as well as conducting expert reviews.\n5. Evaluation\nValidation is a critical step in human factors assessments. This entails summative testing that includes production-level devices, training and labeling. A detailed description of procedure, training and tasks based will incorporate findings from the tasks and risk analyses, as well previous studies’ findings, if applicable. It is also important to define what success looks like, so the evaluation can be done with that in mind. The summative testing must be done with more than 15 users per group, as identified in usability specification, who must be U.S. residents. It must look at realistic use conditions, not ideal clinical settings, to ensure successful use. After testing, consolidate the data, analyze errors and failures and identify residual risks in a report for the usability engineering file.\n6. Deployment\nUpon approval, the medical device is deployed in the field, but human factors assessments may not be finished at this point. It’s important to continue to study the device’s use for ongoing human factors concerns and continue to address any issues that arise. This will help ensure reputation and build a strong brand in the marketplace.\nAs you design, research and evaluate, there are several things to keep in mind.\nHuman factors evaluations are a good fit for the risk management stage, as human factors are one component of risk. Most device development includes a risk/benefit assessment where risk mitigation is required. Risk associated with human factors can be evaluated so that innovative, safe solutions can be identified. The data related to human factors must be collected separately from clinical studies, to prevent challenges that arise when trying to pull both data sets concurrently. It might be possible to conduct the evaluations in parallel to clinical trials; however, if dangerous tasks are introduced as part of the human factors analysis, it may be better to test after the clinical trials. Plan to have the analysis complete before submission to the FDA. The process should follow product development and include follow up evaluations to illustrate that risks were mitigated. Consider worst case user groups, as they are most likely to be negatively impacted, but remember to consider all identified user groups and evaluate accordingly with non-employee, U.S. residents. Even if a device will be sold outside the U.S., for the FDA’s purposes all participants must reside in the U.S. Participants in the evaluation phase should meet any qualifications set out in your user group, but also need to be unfamiliar with the device, in order to replace real world device scenarios. An hour learning decay may be acceptable between training on the device and validation; however, mirroring the real life setting is always preferred. Illustrating considerations for human factors into a device’s development process under IEC 62366 is an important step in bringing new medical devices to market in the U.S. These evaluations can be done by a manufacturer or an outsourced vendor. Regardless of who will undertake the process, compliance to this standard is necessary under guidance from the FDA. Seek out experts who understand human factors evaluations and work with them early in the process in order to better mitigate liability and speed to process, saving time and cost in the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:11:47.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
