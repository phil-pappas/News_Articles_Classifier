Derived from placental and adipose derived stem cells, to ensure consistent high quality, these new products are ideally suited for research involving wound healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Exosomes are small vesicles (30–150 nm) containing sophisticated RNA and protein cargos. They are secreted by all cell types in culture and are found to occur naturally in body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, CSF, and breast milk. The precise molecular mechanics for their secretion and uptake, as well as their composition, “cargo”, and resulting functions, are only beginning to be understood. Exosomes are now viewed as specifically secreted vesicles that enable intercellular communication and have become the focus of rapidly growing interest, both to study their functions and to understand ways to use them in the development of minimally invasive diagnostics. There is increasing evidence that exosomes are central and key mediators of stem cell repair and regeneration of diseased or injured tissues.
