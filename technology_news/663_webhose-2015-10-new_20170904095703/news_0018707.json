The combination of the two solutions, which will be demonstrated this week, at ARMA 2015 in Washington, D.C., can deliver at least a 66 percent reduction in the labour required to conduct records inventories and enables users to find lost folders without the need to physically see them. \n“Law firms and professional firms face enormous challenges managing their physical files, often spending inordinate amounts of times searching for specific files that can be easily misplaced,” said Dan Carmel, chief marketing officer at iManage. “Combining the power of iManage Records Manager, our industry-leading records management solution, with the RFID capability offered by iTech’s SmartLocate RFID, enables records managers to work smarter, while helping them run a more cost-effective program.” \niManage Records Manager enables professional firms to manage both electronic and physical client records in a client and engagement specific manner. With iManage Records Manager, you can create physical files, apply barcode labels and track these physical files from their creation all the way through final disposition. Files can be associated with boxes, sent to an offsite storage facility and continue to be tracked while offsite. iManage Records Manager provides a unified and scalable system to ensure that records are retained and disposed of according to each client’s retention policies—and that they can always meet audit and discovery requirements. \nSmartLocate uses RFID technology to tag each file, which eliminates the need for users to handle or even see the physical files. As a result, firms can quickly conduct file inventories in the office, storage areas and in boxes. The system also reduces the potential for human error, increases accuracy in determining the current location of items, and improves employee and timekeeper accountability. \n“Our RFID tags allow firms to conduct the same inventory for which they’ve conventionally used barcodes, but enables them to take a hands off approach in which they can easily find the location of the file without having to manually touch them,” said Paul Lemieux, Principal at iTech. “The proven integration with iManage Records Manager adds even greater efficiency to our automated, portable tracking technology.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:54:41.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
