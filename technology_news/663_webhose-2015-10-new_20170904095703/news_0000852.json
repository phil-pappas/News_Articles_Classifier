Jackie Speier, D-Calif., asked officials at a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2572545 \"I won't go into the specifics of what has been imposed,\" said Terry Halvorsen, the Chief Information Officer at the Department of Defense. \"We have upped the level of accountability on that, and actions have been taken on people who have misbehaved.\"\n\"We have increased the training frequency … and we have taken certain actions on the networks to eliminate the ability to click on links, and at a minimum we have a warning on there now that you must think about this link,\" he said. \"And in some cases, again, I won't specifically ... you can no longer click on links via any of our networks.\"\nMore from the Washington Examiner Attkisson: Media doing 'pretty good job' covering Clinton Attkisson said the aggressiveness in the reporting was due to Democrats leaking the information.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/01/15 11:07 AM Admiral Mike Rogers, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and head of the National Security Agency, added that agencies have taken extensive measures to remedy the problem. \"I've implemented nine specific technical changes where, quite frankly, I've told users now I'm going to make your life harder if this is what it takes to drive a change in behavior, I will make your user life harder to try to preclude this from happening.\"\nRogers did not describe what those changes were.\nPhishing is a method of hacking in which a perpetrator sends an email to a victim that appears to be from someone they know. The victim opens the email and usually clicks on a link, allowing hackers to access their system. The technique has enabled some of the worst system breaches in U.S. history.\nIt has become an especially critical problem since more than 21 million personnel files were stolen from the Office of Personnel Management earlier this year. The files include information on all of the friends, family members, and associates of applicants who applied for security clearances with the U.S. government.\n\"The OPM hack was devastating,\" Speier said. \"It's clear that China did it, they denied it, it's also very clear that they now have very personal information about many persons with top secret status … whether it's Russia or China, access to personal information is such that … they then can pretend they are your family member or next door neighbor.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Club for Growth warns about John Kasich's 'mixed record' The club's white paper took issue with Kasich's willingness to raise taxes as governor.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/01/15 11:05 AM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2572326 Earlier this month, Paul Beckman, a the Chief Information Security Officer at the Department of Homeland Security, mentioned at least one measure that officials have taken, which is phishing his own employees. \"I am sending their phishing emails,\" he said. \"I don't want to raise awareness; I want to raise paranoia.\" Yet based on Wednesday's proceedings, it remains unclear what happens to employees who fail.\nTop  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:12:26.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
