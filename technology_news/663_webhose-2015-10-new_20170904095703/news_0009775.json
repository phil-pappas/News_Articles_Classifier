And now Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure has the company on the verge of drastic cost cuts.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Sprint could slash as much as $2.5 billion over the next 6 months, leading to inevitable job reductions. USA TODAY confirmed that Sprint is indeed looking to slash costs but the firm didn’t specify dollar amounts or how many of the company's 31,000 employees might be at risk.\nBut a blood bath seems likely. In an internal memo cited by the Journal , Sprint chief financial officer Tarek Robbiati, wrote that cuts “inevitably will result in job reductions,\" and that employees must watch every expenditure.\n“The main thing to consider when requesting to spend money is to take an owner’s mindset by treating every dollar as if it were your own,” he wrote in the memo.\n\"This is cutting cost to the bone,\" says Roger Entner and analyst with Recon Analytics. \"The answer to Sprint's woes is not cost cutting. What Sprint needs is true market differentiation.\"\nClaure has been trying a number of measures to boost Sprint's standing. In April he announced an initiative in which Sprint technicians would make house calls to try and help people purchase and set up their phones.\nMore recently, Sprint announced aggressive iPhone pricing plans for as little as $1.\nThe company also said it wouldn't participate in the wireless spectrum auction slated to take place next year. Even sitting the auction out, Entner says that Sprint has more spectrum than its rivals, an area he says Sprint should focus on.\nWall Street seemed to support the move to rein in costs, with the stock up over 3.46% to $4.19 in mid-day trading on Friday.\nDuring the three-month period that ended on June 30, 2015, net postpaid subscriber additions were 310,000 compared to net subscriber losses of 181,000 in the same period in 2014. Sprint is expected to report earnings for its second fiscal quarter in early November.\nIt's been a rough 24-hour for T-Mobile as well. CEO John Legere announced a data breach through partner Experian that could impact the personal data of around 15 million customers or potential customers.\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.con; Follow USA TODAY personal tech columnist @edbaig .\n5 CONNECT 24 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1L8Vs2U TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787132855450544-AP-SPRINT-CEO-74506870.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1L8Vs2U&text=Sprint%20to%20cut%20up%20to%20%242.5%20billion%20in%20costs%2C%20layoff%20workers%20in%20next%20six%20months&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1L8Vs2U&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/62a77d55e7e0d77c989e7f6c07bb77dc7ab81079/c=0-488-3443-5078&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787132855450544-AP-SPRINT-CEO-74506870.JPG", "http://twitter.com/edbaig", "http://usat.ly/1L8Vs2U", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635787132855450544-AP-SPRINT-CEO-74506870.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:09:22.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
