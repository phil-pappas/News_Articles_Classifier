Campbell, President and CEO of CRDF Global, and long-time champion of international science collaboration, today announced her plans to step down in the spring of 2016, after 14 years with CRDF Global and 10 years as CEO. CRDF Global is an independent nonprofit organization that promotes cross-borders science and technology collaboration through grants, technical resources, training and services.\n“Leading CRDF Global has been a dream job. I believe so passionately in our mission,” said Campbell in an address to CRDF Global staff. “Our staff – both here and abroad – are exceptional and together we have made a difference in the lives of so many scientists and entrepreneurs. But after almost 10 years as your chief executive officer, it is time for me to hand over the reins to a new leader who will work with the incredible talent here to make CRDF Global an even stronger organization,” she said.\n“Science collaboration is as important today as it has ever been. I fully intend to stay engaged in international science cooperation and science diplomacy – just not on a full-time basis. Meanwhile, for the remaining time I will focus energetically on CRDF Global and help ensure a seamless transition,” said Campbell.\nThe CRDF Global Board of Directors has formed a search committee, and has retained Korn Ferry , a nationally recognized recruiting firm, to advise it during its CEO search. The search will start immediately. Paul Longsworth, Chair, CRDF Global Board of Directors and Vice President, International Environmental / Nuclear, Fluor Corporation, will lead the process working with the board search committee. Interested candidates should contact Lorraine Lavet at Lorraine.Lavet(at)KornFerry(dot)com. The job description can be found at http://crdfceo.ekornferry.com/ or please visit CRDF Global's career page .\n“Cathy’s commitment to international engagement is seen in her life’s work promoting international science cooperation,” said Longsworth. “CRDF Global benefited from her previous policy and research experience and from her unwavering determination to introduce CRDF Global to new markets. Her many contributions will be deeply missed, but we are confident of a successful transition that will enable us to continue making the world a better place by engaging scientists and entrepreneurs across borders,” said Longsworth.\nCampbell was appointed CRDF Global President and CEO in 2006. She joined CRDF Global in 2002 as Vice President for Programs. She has worked with and traveled extensively to Eurasia, the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America. Prior to joining CRDF Global, Campbell served from 1998 to 2002 as director of the Office of International Policy and Programs, Department of Commerce’s Technology Administration; as well as executive director of the U.S.-Israel Science and Technology Commission. From 1995 to 1997, she was a senior policy analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Campbell was the U.S. State Department’s program officer for Soviet/Russia science and technology affairs from 1989 to 1994.\nCampbell serves as a member of the External Advisory Board of the Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs; the Advisory Council for IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology); the Advisory Board, Muslim-Science.com; and the Innovation Index Advisory Committee, U.S.-Israel Science and Technology Foundation.\nAbout CRDF Global\nCRDF Global is an independent, nonprofit organization established in 1995 to promote international scientific and technical collaboration through grants, technical resources, training, and services.
