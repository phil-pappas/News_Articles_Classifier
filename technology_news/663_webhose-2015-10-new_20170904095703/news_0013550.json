While it has paused its marketing effort following the cyber attack it is likely to have to increase its spending in future to rebuild its brand.\nAnalysts said they did not have enough information to judge whether TalkTalk was at fault for the attack, but they did note that this was the firm's third such breach this year.\nUK data protection watchdog The Information Commissioner's Office, which examines whether a company has properly protected personal data, said it was aware of the incident and was liaising with the police.\nTwo years ago the ICO fined Sony 250,000 pounds after its PlayStation Network Platform was hacked in 2011, compromising the personal data of millions of its users. The maximum fine the ICO can impose is 500,000 pounds.
