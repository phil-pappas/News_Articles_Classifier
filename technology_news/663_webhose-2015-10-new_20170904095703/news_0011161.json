Gov. Sue Ellspermann, who chairs the Indiana Counterterrorism and Security Council, joined Purdue University Chief Information Officer Gerry McCartney and Intel Vice President Rick Echevarria to announce the opening of the state of Indiana Security Operations Center (SOC) near the Purdue campus. \nThe SOC is a project of the new Indiana Information Sharing and Analysis Center (IN-ISAC) – a joint mission of the Indiana Office of Technology, Indiana Department of Homeland Security, Indiana National Guard, Indiana State Police, Purdue University, Intel Security and other private sector partners. \nAt the outset, the IN-ISAC is focusing on serving Indiana state government and Purdue University through the sharing of threat information and collaboration on strategies. It provides real-time network monitoring, vulnerability identification and threat warnings of state government computer systems. \nAs much as anything, Ellspermann said, the new center in its current incarnation helps establish a more robust framework for mitigating cybersecurity threats going into the future. \n“We have seen repeatedly over the last several years that data and network security are vitally important,” Ellspermann said. “While it’s difficult to anticipate every potential threat to our networks, we must take every possible measure to be ready when attacks occur. This facility will significantly improve Indiana’s ability to defend Hoosiers’ information.” \nLocated in Purdue Research Park, the SOC is staffed by a combination of state employees and Purdue students who monitor security incidents across the state of Indiana’s computer network. The students are employed as part of the Purdue Pathmaker Internship Program, which provides career-relevant internships to students on or near campus. \nUnder the supervision of two managers, the students – with restricted access to information and resources plus the stewardship of Intel Security – will help resolve lower-level issues. This will enable security specialists at the Indiana Office of Technology in Indianapolis to devote more of their time and attention to higher-priority and more sensitive issues. \n\"We're pleased to add the State of Indiana to the Purdue Pathmaker Student Internship Program. Our students will get experience that will help them in their careers for years to come while working part-time,\" McCartney said. \"Purdue is a recognized leader in cyber security and forensics, and this is a first step in using our expertise to serve the citizens of Indiana in new ways.\" \nThe SOC will be staffed on-site by nearly a dozen employees. At startup, the SOC will only operate a first shift – from about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. In future phases, planners envision a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation. \nIntel has worked for years both with the State of Indiana and Purdue University as a provider of technology and expertise, Echevarria said. \n“As the SOC goes operational, our security technology provides the cyber security center with more tools to help them identify threats, defend their networks and prevent successful attacks,” he said. “We work with private and public entities all over the world, and our subject-matter experts will provide valuable knowledge to these Purdue students who will become their generation’s leaders in cybersecurity going forward. We are honored to play a role.” \nAbout the Indiana Security and Analysis Center | http://www.IN.gov/cybersecurity \nIN-ISAC is the primary hub for information sharing and analysis on cybersecurity issues in the State of Indiana. This will be done by implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity plan and promoting an environment in which the general public, private industry, local government and state government can work together to address cybersecurity issues in the State of Indiana. \nAbout the Purdue Pathmaker Internship Program | http://www.itap.purdue.edu/pathmaker \nPathmaker is a residential intern program at Purdue University. Participants perform entry-level engineering and computer science jobs for companies while still enrolled as full-time students. The jobs are located on campus, in the nearby Purdue Research Park, or in company offices in West Lafayette. Students involved in Pathmaker gain real-world work experience in their chosen field, which is one of the college experiences that have been identified by the Gallup-Purdue Index as contributing to success later in life. \nAbout Intel Security | http://www.intelsecurity.com \nMcAfee is now part of Intel Security. With its Security Connected strategy, innovative approach to hardware-enhanced security, and unique Global Threat Intelligence, Intel Security is intensely focused on developing proactive, proven security solutions and services that protect systems, networks, and mobile devices for business and personal use around the world.
