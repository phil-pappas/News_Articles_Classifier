PTI | 13 October 2015, 5:04 PM IST Share \nHyderabad, Oct 13 () Hyderabad-headquartered Kellton Tech which has developed 'mSehat', a mobile app that helps health workers to record maternal infant data in real- time, was launched in Uttar Pradesh by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. \nThe company was selected as the technology partner for this initiative by SIFPSA (State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency) earlier this year, it said in a statement here. \nmSehat is a cloud-hosted solution to facilitate remote access and enrolment from across the region through 2G-enabled mobile devices, it said. \n\"Since its predominant use would be in rural areas, the solution is optimised for low bandwidth and intermittent connectivity. It helps the health workers to record the maternal infant data in real-time and provide the best health care. The data will be stored in the cloud, which will serve as the central repository,\" the statement said. \nmSehat is an integrated mobile platform that will enable Uttar Pradesh to experience an improvement in the infant mortality rate outcomes, the company said. \n\"This application will assist health superintendents to maintain health reports of mother and the child, and ensure proper, timely medication for them. It leveraged its expertise in SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics, Cloud) towards the implementation and completion of this project,\" it said. \nThe initial implementation would be in five districts (Mirzapur, Faizabad, Sitapur, Bareilly and Kannauj), and it is expected to be extended to the entire state later, it said. The first phase involves equipping the health workers with mobile devices, i.e. smartphones to 10,252 ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) workers, and tablets to 1,719 ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) and 300 people comprising medical officers, medical officers in-charge & SIFPSA staff.
