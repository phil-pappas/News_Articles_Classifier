That’s the conclusion of a recent book by the British economist John Kay, Other People’s Money: The Real Business of Finance , which suggests that the overarching arrangement of finance hasn’t changed much in the wake of the crisis.\n“The global financial crisis was primarily caused by placing on top of the deposit channel an elaborate and largely impenetrable superstructure of trading activities … impenetrable even by the executives of the institutions themselves,” Kay writes. When that superstructure collapsed, he explains, it threatened the entirety of the banking system. And what was recklessly fragile then is still the core business of banks today, even with the reforms that have taken place and with the addition of capital to the system.\nLatest from Business The Story of Wall Street's First Black Millionaire\nKay argues that the “real business of finance” mentioned in his subtitle is the project of making the general economy much more opaque. The accounts of major banks are lengthy and impenetrable. No one really knows the profitability, year by year, segment by segment, or in aggregate of the banking system. “The proliferation of poorly understood complexity in the financial sector was intentional,” Kay asserts.\nKay’s assessment is worrying, especially when taken alongside with remarks made by Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen in 2013, in which she lamented the tremendous shortage of any data that might stave off another crisis. Yellen noted that “highly interconnected firms can transmit shocks widely, impairing the rest of the financial system and the economy.” She added, “Detailed and comprehensive data on the structure of financial markets is needed to understand the systemic risks facing the financial system and to gauge the contribution to systemic risk by individual institutions.” What’s more, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, warned in 2012 that there is still no way to “compare firms’ exposures against one another in a timely and effective manner.” He said that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules about financial disclosures and their frequency “[tend] to obfuscate as much as inform.”", "external_links": ["http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20130104a.htm", "http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/uploads/inline/docs/Regulatory_Reform_April_25_2012-final_0.pdf", "http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525952657"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:36:56.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
