Equipped with an improved microscope, the BI 900 provides a 10x and 16x magnification, as default. An optional set of oculars will extend this up to an impressive 40x magnification. A yellow barrier filter also provides additional contrast for fluorescein applications.\nThe BI 900 boasts an enhanced 14mm LED illumination. This allows the user to illuminate a larger area on the anterior segment, while retaining the homogeneity of the LED light. The maximised diameter size of the ocular view ensures fatigue-free examination, even on long working days.\nThe optional imaging set provides a fully-integrated, compact imaging solution for the BI 900. Designed to simplify the image capturing process, the system features a fast and accurate automatic exposure control, along with the well-established history trigger function. This allows simple image capturing while the user concentrates on the patient.\nSam Laidlaw, HS-UK Product Manager, said, “Haag-Streit slit lamps are integral to the diagnosis and treatment of multiple ophthalmic conditions in clinics all over the UK. The introduction of the BI 900 compliments Haag-Streit’s existing slit lamp imaging products and allows clinical findings to be digitally captured at every step along the patient care pathway.”\nFor further information on the BI 900, please visit contact Haag-Streit UK on (01279) 883807, email slitlamp@haag-streit-uk.com or visit http://www.haagstreituk.com/bi900 .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/HS_UK/BI900launch/prweb13037903.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.haagstreituk.com/", "http://www.haagstreituk.com/bi900", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/HS_UK/BI900launch/prweb13037903.htm", "http://www.haagstreituk.com/products/hsuk/slit-lamps/slit-lamp-bi-900.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:26:15.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
