It says it will not intterupt subscriptions but it will let customers know of the changes.\n“Although we’re changing the prices for auto-renewable In-App Purchase subscriptions, we won’t interrupt them,” the company said in a statement to developers.\n“We’ll send an email to your subscribers in Australia, Indonesia, and Sweden shortly before their existing subscription renews to let them know of the price increase. The email also includes a link to allow customers to turn their subscription off.”\nPrices are also changing in the Indonesian and Swedish markets.\nThe changes are expected to take place “within the next 36 hours.”\nApple is also adding new low-price tiers, enabling app developers to charge 99 cents for apps.\nThose low-price tiers were previously only available for emerging markets.", "external_links": ["http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/09/app-store-pricing-emerging-markets/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:28:43.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
