Early results announced by radio stations so far showed Conde in the lead.\nThe opposition candidates, including the main opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, told a news conference that there were numerous examples of fraud in the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:06:24.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
