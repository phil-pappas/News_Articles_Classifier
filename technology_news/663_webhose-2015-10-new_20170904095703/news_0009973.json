Developed by Facebook, Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes.\n\"The impact of having a JDBC connector to Presto is huge for the analytics community,\" said Tim Lang , Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, MicroStrategy Incorporated. \"MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise's optimized Presto Connector empowers our Big Data customers to query into their data quickly, interactively, at petabyte scale. It enables users to query and explore their immense amounts of data, sometimes spread across multiple data sources, without performance constraints. Having this connector in MicroStrategy Desktop and Web opens the door to build quick analytics to the masses who typically access Presto pragmatically and dump results in files or databases to connect with additional visualization tools.\"\nTargeted at analysts who expect fast interactive response times, Presto allows querying data where it lives, including Hive, Cassandra, relational databases or even proprietary data stores. A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, and supports data exploration across an entire organization. Presto breaks the false choice between having fast analytics using an expensive commercial solution or using a slow \"free\" solution that requires excessive hardware.\n\"Presto brings tremendous value to Big Data organizations,\" added Lang. \"Unlike Hive, Presto doesn't use the map reduce framework for its execution. Instead, Presto directly accesses the data through a specialized distributed query engine that is very similar to those found in commercial parallel RDBMSs.\"\nGenerally available in June 2015 , MicroStrategy 10 Secure Enterprise builds on proven enterprise capabilities to make sophisticated, high-performance analytics more accessible, easier to use, and faster.
