Co-developed by Workbooks and InvisibleSolutions, WESS builds on the company’s current ServerSide Sync application by offering a cloud based solution that provides the same functionality without the hassle of installation. “Customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance to us and Workbooks Exchange Synch Service allows us to continue building on our stellar reputation and take things to the next level by offering customers the seamless integration they need, now with the simplicity that comes with implementing a cloud solution.” - John Cheney, CEO of Workbooks. \nThis new technology integrates Exchange with Workbooks CRM and will support contacts, tasks, e-mails and calendar items. Extended features will also be offered in a later release that include support of recurrent meetings, attendees tracking, email alerts about synch summary and issues, and a conflict resolution UI. \nThe solution has been fully tested and is currently being rolled-out to a select group of customers through a Beta program. Roll-out to the entire user base is scheduled for mid-November. “We are proud to continue partnering with Workbooks to offer solutions that are intuitive and easy for customers.
