VMware and EMC announced plans to form a new Cloud Services Business, jointly owned 50:50 by EMC and VMware, and offering customers the industry's most comprehensive hybrid cloud portfolio. This new Federation business will bring together vCloud Air, Virtustream, object storage and managed cloud services into one company under the Virtustream brand. The transaction is expected to close in early 2016, and VMware expects to consolidate Virtustream's results into its financial statements beginning in Q1 2016. At VMworld 2015, VMware recently hosted over 32,000 customers, partners and influencers in San Francisco and Barcelona and announced a wave of new products, services and partner updates designed to help customers transform their businesses and embrace a new model for IT. VMware announced new public cloud offerings for VMware vCloud Air, including object storage services and a global DNS service. VMware vCloud Air Object Storage is a portfolio of highly-scalable, reliable and cost effective storage services for unstructured data powered by Google Cloud Platform and EMC. The company announced a major refresh of its Cloud Management Platform including vRealize Automation 7.0 and vRealize Business. Enhancements include the ability to deliver applications with application-centric networking and security across clouds and increased transparency and control over the cost and quality of IT services through a single dashboard. VMware added to its cloud-native technology portfolio with two new projects designed to meet enterprise IT requirements across security and isolation, service level agreements, data persistence, networking services and management. VMware vSphere Integrated Containers will enable IT teams to run cloud-native applications on-premises and on VMware's public cloud, vCloud Air. The VMware Photon Platform is a platform purpose-built for running Cloud-Native Applications. In the End-User Computing space, VMware announced support of Windows 10 with AirWatch Enterprise Mobility Management, which will support all the new capabilities introduced in Windows 10. Also announced was Project A2 which promises to be a new Windows management and application delivery technology that combines unified endpoint management and configuration with the ability to seamlessly move existing Windows applications into the new Windows 10 environment. Additionally, the company announced the acquisition of Boxer, a privately held company that offers a comprehensive and secure personal information management (PIM) solution for mobile devices to businesses and consumers. \nThe company will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PT/ 5:00 p.m. ET to review financial results and business outlook.

This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events. Due to the differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as the methodology applied to our estimated annual tax rates as described above, our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income may differ from our GAAP tax rate and from our actual tax liabilities. (2) Totals may not sum, due to rounding. Operating margin, tax rate and net income per weighted average share information are calculated based upon the respective underlying, non-rounded data.

This rate is based on our estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented above. Our estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that we believe materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events.
