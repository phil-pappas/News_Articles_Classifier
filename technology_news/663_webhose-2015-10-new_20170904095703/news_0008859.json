Founded by South Carolina agency Riggs Partners, CreateAthon has at least 15 agencies across North America participating this year.\nAs the sole metropolitan area firm participating, EGC will be working around the clock on free services such as Web design and social media campaigning for Hope for Youth, a provider of children's and family services, and L.I. Against Domestic Violence, a prevention and support resource for victims of abuse.\nWhile the company's roster of media planners and buyers, art directors, developers and social media strategists will be doing the work over 24 hours, planning for the project began weeks ahead of time, EGC officials said.\nSince its founding, CreateAthon participants have provided about $20.5 million worth of marketing services to more than 1,300 nonprofit organizations.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
