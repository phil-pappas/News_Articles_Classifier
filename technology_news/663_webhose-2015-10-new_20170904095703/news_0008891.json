Working in close collaboration with clients, Eutelsat completed on 30 September the job of bringing 210 television channels onto the new satellite from two other of its satellites located at 7/8 degrees West. Both satellites are now being relocated to 33 degrees East, enabling Eutelsat to further optimise its fleet. \nAs well as increased power, more coverage options and higher in-orbit security, Eutelsat believes that it has provided a future-proof infrastructure for HDTV and Ultra HD . The operator also claims that for the Arab and international broadcasting community the entry into service of EUTELSAT 8 West B marks a milestone in the growth story of the most popular satellite TV neighbourhood in the Middle East and North Africa for which the company has a Ku-band footprint stretching from Morocco to the Gulf. EUTELSAT 8 West B also introduces C-band capacity to 7/8 degrees West, connected to footprints covering the African continent and reaching west to South America. \n\"We are delighted to see this prestigious satellite take its place at the 7/8 degrees West neighbourhood and to be able to further enhance the service we provide broadcasters and service providers in one of the world's most dynamic TV markets,\" said Michel de Rosen, Eutelsat Chairman and CEO. \n\"EUTELSAT 8 West B, built by Thales Alenia Space, is one of the most sophisticated broadcasting satellites in orbit today and enables us to deploy new features that raise the game in terms of service, flexibility and signal quality.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:37:48.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
