Dr. John Burke , PhD, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Applied BioMath, will present \"QSP approaches enabling quantitative decisions in drug discovery from early research to clinical trials\" on Wednesday October 21st 2015 at 12:30PM. \nQuantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) approaches continue to gain momentum in pharmaceutical and biotech companies due to their potential to save companies significant costs and shorten research timelines. In this talk, Dr. Burke will highlight recent results from Applied BioMath's collaborations in biotech and pharma, including a case study in immuno-oncology. His talk will also demonstrate how Applied BioMath's modeling approach differs from existing QSP approaches, and how this unique methodology results in prediction approaches, which when validated in the clinic, were proven to be 10x more accurate than accepted industry standards. \n\"I look forward to sharing the value and benefits our partners have experienced by incorporating our QSP approaches into their drug invention workflow. I am excited to show that the right mathematics and technology, integrated with an iterative approach, can have a major impact on the decision making process in biotech and pharmaceutical companies.\" \nDr. John Burke , PhD, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Applied BioMath \nAbout Applied BioMath \nApplied BioMath ( www.appliedbiomath.com ), helps biotech and pharmaceutical companies reduce late stage attrition and accelerate best-in-class (BIC) drugs using quantitative methodologies.
