French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal addresses lawmakers during a session of questions to the government at the National Assembly on October 20, 2015 in Paris \nDuring the intervening four years, approval would be granted to cars even if the real driving emissions are up to 60 per cent higher than the emission standards currently in place. \nThe commission calls their proposal \"realistic\", but nonetheless, sources told AFP that powerful member state Germany, as well as Spain and Italy, were opposing it, drawing activist anger. \n\"Governments like Germany's must rise from under the wheels of the car lobby to put air quality before big business,\" Greenpeace energy expert Jiri Jerabek said. \nBut the auto industry warns that adopting tighter tests too quickly would hurt manufacturers and cost jobs. \nNot having \"realistic timeframes and conditions... could have repercussions upon consumer choice as well as employment in the wider automotive sector,\" the ACEA car lobby said in statement earlier this month. \nAccording to ACEA, the auto sector is responsible for about 12 million jobs across the EU. 8 hours ago 1 Germany: VW cars with suspect software in Europe too September 24, 2015 \nThe software at the center of Volkswagen's emissions scandal in the U.S. was built into the automaker's cars in Europe as well, Germany said Thursday, though it isn't yet clear if it helped cheat tests as it did in the U.S. Auto CO2 emissions 40% higher than claimed: report October 1, 2015 \nCarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars registered in Europe in 2014 were 40 percent higher on average than their manufacturers claimed, said a report prompting calls Wednesday for an investigation.
