Bioengineers there have developed a computer algorithm that can predict your intended actions, even if you accidentally change course. “We call it a psychic robot,” Justin Horowitz, a UIC graduate student research assistant and first author of a study appearing online in the journal PLOS One, said in a statement. This robot does have certain undeniable allures, it could prevent car accidents, industrial tragedies and even counteract movements that might sabotage a stroke victim’s intended movement. The process of development of the same is it a bit complicated at best. The team built a semi-transparent mirror and a virtual desk. This mirror created the illusion of the objects on top of the display, being on the virtual desk instead, i.e., on the same level as the subject’s arm. This way, while reaching for the objects, the subject’s arm would actually be gripping the robot, which measured the grip, movements and force applied.
