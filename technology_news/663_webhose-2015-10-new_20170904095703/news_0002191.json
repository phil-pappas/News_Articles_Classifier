The report covers the Americas, APAC, and EMEA; it also covers the landscape of the global hyperphosphatemia drugs market and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. \nThe market presents huge growth opportunities for vendors because of the growing incidence of hyperphosphatemia and associated high pill burden. Currently, many companies are investing in the discovery and R&D of drugs for the condition. For instance, Tenapor by Ardelyx and AstraZeneca is in phase II developmental stage. The entry of this drug will likely reduce the pill burden associated with the condition. Similarly, RDX002, a type 2a sodium phosphate cotransporter (NaP2b) inhibitor, is being developed by Sanofi. Ardelyx licensed the drug to Sanofi, but retained its co-promotion rights in the US. The launch of novel drug candidates with higher efficacy and safety profile, currently under different stages of development, will contribute to market growth.According to the report, diabetes and hypertension are the main causes of renal failure, which in turn leads to hyperphosphatemia. The USRDS reported in 2014 that 13.6% adults in the US had CKD, of which diabetes accounted for 44% of kidney failure cases. It also reported in 2012 that high blood pressure led to an increase of 7.7% of kidney failure cases from 2000 to 2010. The International Diabetes Federation reported in 2014 that 387 million people had diabetes in the same year, which is expected to increase by 2035. WHO reported in 2013 that currently over 1 billion people have high blood pressure and about 9.4 million people die from the condition annually worldwide.Further, the report states that non-adherence to treatment regimens is a major challenge faced by the market. \nTo calculate the market size, the report considers revenue generated from the sales of branded, generic, OTC, and off-label drugs used for treating hyperphosphatemia.Key vendors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:46:33.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
