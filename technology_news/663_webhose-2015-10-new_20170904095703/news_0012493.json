Krznaric , President and CEO of YOLO Medical Inc. \"YOLO remains resolute in protecting the years of work and dedication invested in establishing itself and its technology at the forefront of the medical and aesthetic industry. We take it very seriously when companies and individuals breech our patents and we will protect our Intellectual properties aggressively at all cost.\" \nKrznaric, goes on to say, \"we are pleased that Lila Enterprises realized that it was a losing proposition to breech our patents, and during negotiations, it was quickly determined and acknowledged that an agreement had to be reached. Both parties are pleased with the direction that the negotiations took and feel that the final agreement is beneficial for both entities moving forward\". \nMark Patterson , former President of LiLa Enterprise, LLC states, \"LiLa Enterprise, LLC filed Chapter 7 and issued all inventory and liquid assets as required by Chapter 7 guidelines.\" Patterson further acknowledges that LiLa Enterprise, a previous master US distributor for Strawberry Laser-Lipo, LTD (UK) and product distributor for Chromogenex US, Inc., officially dissolved all agreements and distribution rights with both manufactures in 2015. \"Our decision to cease all agreements with both manufactures was primarily based on on-going litigation surrounding YOLO's patent infringement claims.\" \nEven though LiLa Enterprise is not the manufacturer but a product distributor, the USPTO recognizes \"Patent infringement is the act of making, using, selling, or offering to sell a patented invention, or importing into the United States a product covered by a claim of a patent without the permission of the patent owner\".
