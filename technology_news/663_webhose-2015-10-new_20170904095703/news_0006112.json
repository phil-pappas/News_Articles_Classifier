She’s never developed friends, not even one at school. It’s always been a lonely, painful thing.\nShe’s a good student but has to eat alone and hang out by herself. She comes home and cries her eyes out. There are no extracurricular activities at her school at lunch time or after school, thanks to budget cuts, nor is there a guidance counsellor. Her only salvation is musical theatre at her high school.\nShe dresses very appropriately and is clean. She just seems to miss the “making friends” gene. Outside of school they’re a very sports-minded family so she’s played soccer, learned piano, skied, been in swimming classes, Brownies, etc., but has only one friend. They’re not very close.\nI’ve thought of counselling, but don’t want to add another possibility that she’d feel there’s something “wrong” with her. Her confidence is already so low.\nWith family, she’s affectionate and happy, but tends to be a bit withdrawn — e.g., reading, looking at her phone (nothing inappropriate).\nAny suggestions?\nConcerned Grandmother\nShe’s at an age and stage when everything in her social world could soon change — e.g. the possibilities of higher education bringing her in contact with new people.\nSome of them may be more like-minded than her high school community (teenagers tend to judge harshly). Also, with all the activities she’s done, she may find sports, music or reading clubs where she’ll make friends.\nMeanwhile, encourage her about who she is — her warmth in the family, her music interest, her capabilities, etc. Confidence-boosting is part of the answer to her sociability. She doesn’t have to have lots of friends . . . but she needs to feel good about herself.\nVolunteering with children might be a stimulus to honing her ability to make contact, say, with children who have special needs through disabilities. It’s worth suggesting if you find a program, but don’t push it. She has to show interest.\nAlso, let her lead your approach. If she’s crying about not having friends, then it’d be OK for you or her parents to gently ask if she would like to talk to a counsellor . . . so long as it’s clear it’s a learning experience regarding social skills, not a “fix-it.”\nShe’s a good student, does have one friend, participates in many activities, is otherwise happy . . . there’s nothing “wrong” with her.\nFEEDBACK : Regarding children and reading in your columns of Sept. 2 and 28:\nReader: “Both my kids are in their 20s and are avid readers. I did a few other things in addition to what your other readers outlined.\n“Books were made to be special. They were treated with great care. To borrow books rather than buy them was not considered. In our house we always had books.\n“When the children were young, I’d go to garage sales and buy children’s books for between $0.25 and $1.\n“We had, at one point, 250 books that the kids called their library.\n“I also told them that if there was a special book that they wanted, I’d buy it for them.\n“I taught both my children to read at night time. Admittedly, I taught them how to read forward, backwards (it’s great for practising decoding words) and upside-down, which I considered as a useful skill in later life to read memos on your boss’s desk.\n“I figured that for a maximum expenditure of $250 over a number of years, I created lifetime readers.”\nThe Book Collector\nTIP OF THE DAY\nWhen healthy, active young people develop self-confidence, their social skills also grow.\nRead Ellie Monday to Saturday.
