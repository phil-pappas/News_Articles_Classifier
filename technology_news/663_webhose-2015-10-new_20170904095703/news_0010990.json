The quandary involving the so-called \"defeat device,\" which allows cars to pollute up to 40 times the EPA's legal limit, has subsequently widened to include nearly 11 million cars globally.\nCredit Suisse's \"worst case scenario\" argues VW's tab could skyrocket because of uncertain costs associated with the recall of these polluting TDI diesel models, which could suffer reduced performance after a fix brings them into emissions compliance . The financial company believes that the German automaker may have to reimburse customers for related damages to the tune of $33 billion dollars.\nCredit Suisse's best-case-scenario number of about $26 billion is still well over triple VW's estimate -- in fact, that's more cash than the automaker has on hand altogether.\nIn the investor note referenced by CNNMoney, Credit Suisse also warned that VW's shares need to fall about 20% to about $92.60 a share to reflect their true value -- and that's on top of the 35% hit that its stock has already taken since the scandal first came to light. Indeed, as of this writing, VW's stock has plummeted to $92.16.\nIf Credit Suisse's high-end estimate is accurate, VW's total cost could easily eclipse the clean-up cost of an altogether different petrochemical emissions nightmare -- BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.", "external_links": ["http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/02/news/companies/volkswagen-scandal-bp-credit-suisse/index.html", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/25/9312f6dd-2d5f-4ca8-bdbc-8e164c233004/resize/270xauto/9be2000add4f252eb17f5956ece38bf5/2014-volkswagen-jetta-tdi-12.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:53:43.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
