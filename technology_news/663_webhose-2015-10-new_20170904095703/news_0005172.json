Photo: Liam Mannix\nAustralian premium restaurant delivery service Suppertime has been snapped by a major international company, as the local food delivery market continues to heat up.\nThe company, and its parent Foodora, were acquired for an undisclosed fee by Delivery Hero on Wednesday.\nSuppertime, which launched in Sydney in its current iteration two years ago, allows customers to order takeaway food from restaurants that don't offer takeaway.\nThe service's fleet of delivery drivers then pick up and ferry the meal to the customer's door, all for a small fee.\nAdvertisement Suppertime has in fact been acquired twice in the last few years. First, it was picked up by Foodora, a German start-up that launched at the end of 2014.\nThen, Foodora in turn was gobbled up by Delivery Hero â€“ an international company that has already bet big on food delivery's explosion in Australia.\nSuppertime's former owner Nathan Besser says the acquisition will allow Delivery Hero to get into a new growth market as the existing food delivery market matures and growth slows.\n\"What's interesting about our bus model is this allows for the big players like Delivery Hero and Menulog to keep growing, because ours is a difficult segment of the market.\n\"It's a young exciting new segment. Maybe food delivery itself is maturing, but our area of the market where we provide the logistics is booming.\"\nManaging director Toon Gyssels said Delivery Hero planned to pump new funding into Suppertime, which will allow for a big advertising campaign in Australian cities as the service seeks to rapidly grow its customer base.\n\"With the new funding from [Delivery Hero] a lot of the options are open. So in terms of marketing, the efforts we have done already and what we are planning to do, it's a different game.\n\"We will do outdoor, we will do above the line. So besides growing geographically, we can do much more within Sydney, within Melbourne, we can do much more.\"\nThe company's management declined to discuss terms of the deal, or reveal Suppertime's customer base or revenue, other than to say the service had \"tens of thousands\" of customers.\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/digitallife_au"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:39:34.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
