Jury selection in the case is scheduled to begin Monday in Summit County Common Pleas Judge Paul Gallagher's courtroom.\nConrad has threatened to grab a Summit County Sheriff deputy's gun and shoot people in the courtroom during the trial, according to a court filing by Assistant Summit County Prosecutor Angela Walls-Alexander.\nConrad has also threatened to kill defense attorney Don Hicks, who was appointed to assist Conrad in his defense, Walls-Alexander wrote. Walls-Alexander wrote that Conrad's movements should be restricted during the trial.\nGallagher responded with an order that says he will bar Conrad from the courtroom if he has any outbursts. He also ruled that the trial will be allowed to proceed if Conrad refuses transportation from the jail to the courthouse. Conrad has previously refused to be taken from the jail to scheduled court hearings.\nCourt records say Conrad confessed to murdering Russell during three different interviews with investigators.\n\"The statements made by the defendant are clear as to his motive, method and means of killing the victim,\" Walls-Alexander wrote.\nThe two dated but she reported Conrad viciously attacked her several times during their relationship. He also attacked and stalked her after Russell ended their relationship, according to court records.\nConrad, who has a criminal record that includes a 1995 rape in New York and a federal gun conviction in Cleveland, is accused of s tabbing Russell more than 50 times in the neck and back in the backyard of her home in the 3200 block of 8th Street.\nRussell's 14-year-old daughter found her dead after school and called police.\nConrad was arrested by Cleveland Metroparks rangers hours after the stabbing after a chase through the woods near Euclid Beach Park and into Lake Erie .\nConrad, investigators say, pointed a knife at rangers and Bratenahl police officers. An officer used his stun gun on Conrad three times in Lake Erie and arrested him. A dive team found the 10-inch hunting blade about 60 feet off the shore, according to the rangers' report.\nRussell had a protection order against Conrad that ran through 2017.\nConrad also faces an attempted aggravated murder charge . That charge stems from an incident in which Conrad is accused of fashioning a shank out of a plunger and stabbing a fellow Summit County Jail inmate in the head.\nThe incident may have started over racial insults, investigators said at the time.\nConrad also faces charges of rape, attempted murder and kidnapping in connection with the 2006 rape of a 30-year-old Cleveland woman who was homeless at the time of the incident.\nThe woman told police that she knew Conrad. He threatened her, took her to an abandoned home on Arcade Avenue and repeatedly beat and raped her over the course several days. She untied herself and escaped when he fell asleep, according to Cuyahoga County prosecutors.\nThe rape evidence collected from the woman was sent for testing in May 2014, months before Conrad was accused of killing Russell. The DNA test was returned as a match for Conrad in February, months after Russell was killed.\nConrad is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 22 on the Cuyahoga County charge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:25:46.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
