But not quite. For some, using computers and technology is like a foreign language. \nTake Rubye Stevens for example. \n\"Computers it's likeit's in control of everything, computers. And so I decided to stop being bored and I want to learn and go further with it,\" said Dougherty County resident Rubye Stevens. \nStevens is in this intro to computer class at the Dougherty County Public Library with other adults hoping to get more comfortable with the technology. \nThe library offers classes like this basic computer lesson from showing how to turn on a computer and use a mouse, all the way up to the ins and outs of using a tablet. \n\"Everything is going online now,\" said Reference Department Head at the library Rodney McElveen. \nMcElveen said that was his whole reason for pushing to bring these classes back to the library. \n\"Those are classes, skill sets that people need to be able to function in society,\" he said. \nMcElveen said that about Microsoft Word, internet, email and creating a resume which are all also free classes they offer. The classes are offered three times a week at the central branch on Pine Avenue. \nMcElveen said the classes can be a bigger service to the community than people might realize. \n\"I think a lot of that is priceless. Because you're impacting not just that person but the whole family, the kids, the grandkids [and so forth],\" said McElveen. \nAnd he may be right. A 2013 Census Bureau finding shows that more than 30% of households that bring in $50,000 or less per year don't have internet at home. Across the board, learning and having access to technology helps decrease the technology gap. \n\"Maybe the grandkids are in California and they send grandma a tablet but she doesn't know how to use it. Well where is she going to learn to use that? If she comes to the library and we show her the basics of getting started, getting e-books and if it's an iPad maybe she can do Facetime to see the great grandkids,\" McElveen explained. \nRubye may not be ready for Facetime yet. But she says she hopes the classes will help her land a better job in the future. For now, she's taking computers one step at a time. \n\"I'll keep coming [to the classes] and I'll learn it and get better at it,\" said Stevens. 0 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:49:28.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
