LHP serves as an expert partner, tackling tasks like creating embedded control systems and driving sustainable operation with tools that improve quality, schedule, and development cost. Products like Panthera are based on industry-leading technologies and are applied to create streamlined, effective development platforms . \nLHP process and technology changes are aggressive but sustainable. For the last two decades, LHP has transformed businesses - from automotive startups to billion-dollar industry names - with technology and processes. Collaboratively designed plans from LHP help automakers set a new standard for performance in the industry. \nCase Study: Accelerating Next-Generation Engine Development Recently, LHP created a solution that would allow multiple engineering teams to concurrently test engine controls and hone engine control applications . LHP integrated monitor and control interfaces to an ECU on a Desktop Test Environment (DTE) using National Instruments hardware and real-time FPGA software to create the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) solution. With a high-fidelity engine model that runs on the DTE, engineers could simulate the dynamic performance of the actual engine. \nBy partnering with experts at LHP and using flexible technology platforms, automakers don't have to invest in hardware IP, but can use customizable COTS hardware and wire it to the exact interfaces that the application requires, rapidly accelerating engine testing and development with the HIL solution. \nFor more information, readers can visit platform.lhpes.com. \nAbout LHP Engineering Solutions (LHP) LHP optimizes engineering resources for organizations, shifting companies from inflating staff to creating scalable, core technologies and processes that serve the business through growth, meet the challenges of increased complexities, and inform strategic staff decisions.
