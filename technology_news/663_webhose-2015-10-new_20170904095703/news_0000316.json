That breaks the previous record, 13 years and seven months in our house in Mount Airy.\nThere was much more to write about that rambling wreck. Except for the 50-year-old sump pump that went in the snow-melting rains of February 2002, the HVAC system glitch in 2005, and the squirrel family in the master bedroom in 2006, this house has been almost column-free.\nMore coverage Deed scam is not the worst, but it's still a scam Predicted housing shortage coming true? The other house, well, I could write a book or two - and actually did, as I vaguely remember.\nApparently, if you believe the data-crunchers at the website HSH.com, happy homeowners are not the rule in the United States these days.\nMany Americans are pretty upset about their homes, their neighbors, and their neighborhoods, according to HSH.com, the site of the mortgage data research firm HSH Associates, Financial Publishers.\nThe firm set out to determine the biggest annoyances by commissioning Op4G to survey 1,001 Americans on what upset them about their homes, neighbors, and neighborhoods.\nWhat annoys folks about their houses, per se?\nMost respondents said they either feel cramped or as if their houses are falling apart, with two-thirds being upset by a lack of storage or too much maintenance.\nMore than half those surveyed said the size or the age of their houses left them wanting more.\nMore than a third complained about the absence of central air-conditioning, which is, of course, a standard feature of new construction these days.\nMore than half complained about insects and wildlife. Although it wouldn't make me give up my house, being attacked by mosquitoes just stepping out to the garden or tripping over rabbits when I pick up the paper on the front lawn at dawn can get old really fast.\nThe survey's authors observed that, as home dwellers spend more time in their homes, the maintenance associated with older buildings became the primary concern.\nAbout 75 percent of respondents who lived in their homes for more than a decade complained about the maintenance hassles.\nMy wife keeps asking me whether there will come a time when I don't welcome the opportunity to clean the gutters and the downspouts, or paint the exterior when the need arises.\nI suppose she's feeling me out for condo or apartment living, so I tell her about E.K. Tomlinson of Seymour, Conn., who was still cleaning his gutters in the late 1960s when he was 106. (I wrote about him in the summer of 1968 as a very young reporter.)\n\"It keeps me in shape,\" E.K., who was still as sharp as a tack, told me.\nIf you like playing music at full volume or having parties that shake the walls, your neighbors probably don't like you very much, the survey said.\nThe PATCO High-Speed Line and NJ Transit trains to Atlantic City are noisier than our annual block parties.\nLikewise, if you have a neighbor who can see into your window, or have to set up a fence just to mark property lines, you aren't alone in your angst.\nFences keep dogs and children safely in yards.\nHave kids? There's a 1-in-3 chance that your neighbors don't like them.\nThe little kids in the neighborhood call me \"Mr. Al.\" The older kids get to call me \"Al\" when they graduate from college.\nStop complaining.\naheavens@phillynews.com\n215-854-2472@alheavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:52:36.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
