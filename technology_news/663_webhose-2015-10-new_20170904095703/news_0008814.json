But to underscore the degree to which the suit is motivated by Gross’ desire to correct the public record, he has promised to donate any money he recovers to charity, his lawyer, Patricia Glaser, said.\nA Pimco representative said: “This lawsuit has no merit and our legal team will be responding in court in due course. Our focus remains on our clients and their investment portfolios.”\nThe lawsuit presents a picture of Pimco — an asset manager based in California that is responsible for billions of dollars in retirement savings — as a den of intrigue riven by backstabbing and competing egos.\nThe first sentence of the suit says that Gross was pushed out by a “cabal” of Pimco managing directors who were “driven by a lust for power, greed, and a desire to improve their own financial position.”\n“Their improper, dishonest, and unethical behavior must now be exposed,” the opening paragraph concludes.\nThe suit takes aim at the man who was once in line to succeed Gross, Mohamed El-Erian, and at the man who has succeeded Gross as Pimco’s group chief investment officer, Daniel Ivascyn. El-Erian is now the chief economic adviser at Allianz, Pimco’s parent company.\nBoth men, the suit says, were eager to take Pimco away from its traditional focus on bond funds and into riskier investment strategies that would earn it higher fees and lead to bigger bonuses for top executives. Gross, on the other hand, is said in the suit to have consistently advocated for keeping the firm focused on lower-fee investment products.\nTheatrical language \nThe suit goes into detail about Pimco’s secretive bonus plan, saying that Gross was entitled to 20 percent of the firm’s bonus pool — a staggering $300 million in 2013. Gross’ overthrow was motivated, the suit says, by the desire of other top executives, such as Ivascyn, to take home more of the money. The suit says that Ivascyn told Gross that he “wasn’t a long-term player” and would leave for more money.\nWith its bold claims and theatrical language, the suit could end up playing into Gross’ reputation as a unpredictable and volatile character, something that was cited as part of the reason for his problems at Pimco. The tone of the document is reminiscent of some of Gross’ famous letters to investors, in which he often went on at great length about his personal life, pets and philosophy.\nThe legal challenge may become an unhappy and potentially costly distraction for Pimco, which has recently appeared to be recovering from the damage done by Gross’ departure.\nWhile investors pulled over $100 billion from the enormous Pimco bond fund that Gross used to run, those outflows have slowed and the fund’s returns have been relatively good.\nGross, by contrast, has attracted only around $1 billion to a new bond fund he created at the Janus Capital Group, the Denver company he joined immediately after leaving Pimco.\nThe new Janus fund has significantly underperformed both its benchmark and the Pimco fund Gross used to lead, data from Morningstar, the mutual fund rating service, shows. While Janus’ stock rose more than 60 percent in the months after Gross joined the company, it has since given back over half of those gains.\nEven before he left Pimco, Gross’ results were lagging partly as a result of bad calls on the timing of when the Federal Reserve would end its huge stimulus programs and begin raising interesting rates. The uneven returns led investors to pull money from the fund.\nThe lawsuit locates the beginning of the problems in Gross’ decision to bring El-Erian to Pimco in 2007 to groom him as a potential successor. El-Erian was at Pimco previously, but in 2007 he was running Harvard University’s endowment.\nWhen El-Erian returned, the suit says, he was eager to push Pimco beyond the bond funds that had traditionally been its strength and wanted to use “a host of high-risk derivative asset classes” he had learned about at Harvard. The suit says the returns on the funds that El-Erian ran at Pimco were “abysmal.”\nAccording to the suit, Gross offered to step back from everything but his bond funds, but this scared El-Erian and led him to “abruptly” announce his resignation in early 2014.\nAt the time, El-Erian said he was stepping back to write another book and spend more time with his family. Almost immediately after El-Erian’s departure, leaks to the news media attributed the blame for his departure to Gross.\nProbing the leaks \nAn internal Pimco investigation determined that the leaks had come from Andrew Balls, a fast-rising star at Pimco who previously worked as a journalist at the Financial Times, the suit says. When confronted, the suit says, Balls initially denied that he was responsible but then, when shown the evidence, changed his story.\nAccording to the suit, Gross pushed for Balls to be fired, but instead Pimco executives had him sign a document suggesting that he had only given out general information about Pimco and agreed that Balls would remain at Pimco. Balls is now one of five co-chief investment officers under Ivascyn.\nGross, the suit says, was eventually forced from the firm after Ivascyn and a few others threatened to resign if Gross was not forced to leave.\nUltimately, Gross was given an offer to leave the firm but in a way that would “conceal the news from investors, the press, and the market generally.”\n“Mr. Gross could not agree to participate in this deceit on investors and the public by accepting this so-called offer of his effective termination,” the suit says. “As a result, he was forced out of the company he had founded and led for over 40 years.”\nGross’ lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, asks for a jury trial, for his lawyers’ fees and for damages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:28:39.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
