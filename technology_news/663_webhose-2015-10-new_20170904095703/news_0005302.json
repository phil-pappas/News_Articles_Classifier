Watsoft, a professional software distributor, is set to add AppRiver’s entire security suite to its portfolio.\n“This agreement highlights the importance of delivering comprehensive security and productivity solutions to our reseller community,” said Oleg Bivol, President of Watsoft. “With more than 2,800 resellers in France, we want to make sure that our product offerings help resellers build profitable IT businesses. AppRiver is the perfect fit because we’re seeing increased demand for email security, encryption and hosted exchange. Add to that the flexibility of offering monthly commitments and award-winning customer support, and we have two great differentiators that we know will be a winning combination.”\nAppRiver currently protects 47,000 businesses around the globe from today's most sophisticated IT threats. The company's cloud-based security suite includes email hosting, email security, archiving, encryption, Web protection and the popular Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. All services come with a 30-day free trial and are backed by AppRiver's signature Phenomenal Care.\n“As new cyber threats and security requirements emerge, customers look to their solution providers for guidance on how to best protect their systems,” explains Rocco Donnino, EVP, AppRiver. “Our technology was designed to keep businesses productive and information secure. And, we’re pleased to be offering the Watsoft partner community choice, enhanced functionality and greater overall value.”\nAppRiver redefines two-tier partner programs by making them simple; the partner can set the price, bill their customers and cancel their service any time, while AppRiver can handle supporting and troubleshooting any issues that may arise. Additionally, AppRiver understands how annual contracts can become a barrier to many partners and their customers with the fear of costly cancellation fees if the program or solution is not the best fit. That is why AppRiver offers affordable per-user, pay-as-you-go services that give partners greater flexibility and more control without hidden charges under the surface.\nTo further streamline its partner program, AppRiver offers its partners a management console, designed with the two tiers needed – a portal where Watsoft can manage its partners, and then a separate portal where resellers can create end users and manage their services. Both portals can be branded according to partners’ and resellers’ needs.\nWatsoft will make AppRiver solutions available to their reseller community beginning on November 1, 2015.\nAbout Watsoft\nWatsoft is a value added distributor whose mission is to provide SMBs with professional software solutions to help them manage and secure their information systems.
