Weiner and Sordello cite the newest federal statistics, which they call \"a shocker: 23 million need but do not receive treatment.\" \nWeiner and Sordello wrote an oped in today's Chicago Daily Herald, \"Rewriting Drug Policy: Presidential Debate Issue\". \nWeiner and Sordello contend, \"Addicts can get well and rejoin the taxpaying work force if they have the means. With the new attention from Presidential campaigns and debates, and with the sad reality of increased drug-related murders, both Congress and Illinois have a rare opportunity to take important action on a bipartisan, conservative-liberal issue and reverse public perceptions of gridlock.\" \nThe authors recall: \"When Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was President Clinton's crime advisor, he was so enthusiastic about Four-Star General/Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey's proposal to increase drug treatment by a billion dollars that he did his famous stand-on-his-desk in his cubicle in the West Wing. Emanuel exclaimed, 'Treatment keeps the crime off the streets!' Emanuel made the point that treatment isn't just a liberal good-for-people action, but a cost-effective counter to crime.\" \nWeiner and Sordello explain, \"During the GOP Republican Debate on September 16, while butting heads over government drug laws, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) stated, 'I'd like to see more rehabilitation, and less incarceration. I'm a big fan of the drug courts, which try to direct you back towards work and less time in jail.' Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush , after joking that 'my mother would not be happy' that he now is admitting to marijuana use '40 years ago,' added: 'We're the state that has the most drug courts across every circuit. Drug courts give people a second chance.' Carly Fiorina said, 'My husband Frank and I buried a child to drug addiction. We must invest more in the treatment of drugs. We have the highest incarceration rates in the world. Two-thirds of the people in our prisons are there for non-violent offenses, mostly drug related.'\" \nThe writers point out, \"From Rand Paul to Hillary Clinton , all sides now have proposals to improve substance abuse treatment. Paul, together with Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), aims to increase the yearly number of patients that providers can help. Clinton, with the most comprehensive plan of any candidate, would add $10 billion to federal-state spending on addiction, help first responders provide antidotes to opiate overdoses, and steer low level offenders away from incarceration to rehabilitation.\" \n\"Here's the shockerâ€”rarely reported: 23 million addicts \"need but do not receive treatment,\" according to HHS.\" They added. \nThey show, \"According to the most recent data (through 2013) on the HHS Substance Abuse Administration website, 8.73 percent of people in Illinois ages 12 and up, or almost one million people (934,000) are using illicit drugs at least monthly. In the Joliet -Naperville-Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area, according to HHS, an annual average of 1.1 million persons aged 12 or older used any illicit drug in the past year. That is a lot of people. The report lists 'illicit drugs as 'marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription-type psychotherapeutics used nonmedically.'\" \nThe pair adds, \"A Roosevelt University report shows that Illinois substance abuse treatment funding has been cut by almost 30 percent over five years. Chicago itself has already exceeded the somber benchmark of 1,000 people shot this year. According to the 2013 Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program report by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 83 percent of Chicago male arrestees tested positive for illegal drug use.\" \nThey write, \"According to the Illinois Alcohol and Drug Dependence Association (IADDA), Governor Bruce Rauner is aiming to cut $27.6 million dollars from the current $127 million budget for the Illinois Department of Human Services Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse for FY 2016. This 22 percent budget cut, out of the current 47,000 addicts receiving treatment 'would mean 7,473 individuals would lose access' according to IADDA. Keep in mind that the Illinois -based Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities program (TASC) costs $4,425 yearly per person, while prison costs taxpayers $25,000+ per person.\" \nThe authors say, \"There were 8,500 heroin overdose deaths nationally last year, an extraordinary 5,000 more than 2001. With inaction and budget cuts, the rise in drug-related deaths will continue. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that heroin ranks first in substances for entering publicly funded drug treatment in the Chicago area. David Cohen , former heroin addict, current Vice President of Substance Use at Insight Behavioral Health in Chicago , stated, 'We are increasing usage at the same time the state is decreasing our ability to treat it.'\" \nThey remark, \"The Illinois Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse's website shows treatment reduces drug use by 40-60 percent. The agency states that each dollar spent in treatment equals $4-$7 in savings on crime and criminal justice costs alone.\" \nThe authors conclude: \"Addicts can get well and rejoin the taxpaying work force if they have the means. With the new attention from Presidential campaigns and debates, and with the sad reality of increased drug-related murders, both Congress and Illinois have a rare opportunity to take important action on a bipartisan, conservative-liberal issue and reverse public perceptions of gridlock.\" \nRobert Weiner is the former spokesman for the White House National Drug Policy Office, the U.S. House Government Operations Committee, and the House Narcotics Committee.
