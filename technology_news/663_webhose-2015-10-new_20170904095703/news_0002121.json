Allowing clients to use analytics on an unlimited amount of data, across all users and on all projects – without the additional per-gigabyte charges of other review products – provides much needed predictability to project budgets. The change will further allow iCONECT's hosting partners to provide both cost savings and additional value. \"The ability to include analytics, specifically predictive review with every project will mean real savings for our clients,\" says Gavin W. Manes, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avansic, an iCONECT hosting partner. \"iCONECT continues to add value to the XERA platform, and now with near-dupe, threading and predictive review included in licensing, our clients will benefit immensely. We're excited to be able to offer it on all our projects.\" Integrated analytics pricing will also provide much-needed predictability. Estimating costs can be difficult when licensing is done on a per-gigabyte basis because the quantity may be an unknown at the outset of the project. For example, if the data set is richer than expected, more data survives the early case assessment (ECA) phase, and the use of analytics is questioned because of additional unsuspected costs. Based on this new licensing model, guesswork is eliminated allowing hosting partners and law firms to more clearly estimate pricing. All new iCONECT-XERA license pricing includes all the features and benefits of iCONECT's analytics tools: Easy-to-use setup wizard Streamlined issue identification and review Near Duplicate identification", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:59:55.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
