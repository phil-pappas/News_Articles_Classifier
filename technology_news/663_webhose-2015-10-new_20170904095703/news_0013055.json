Scheduled to go into effect in 2018, the legislation creates the framework to issue permits, tax and regulate the medical marijuana industry, and also lays the groundwork for for-profit medical cannabis operations in California .\n\"The Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act laws are a true milestone for the industry,\" continued Mr. Peterson. \"They mark the beginning of a new era for the IVXX brand, Terra Tech and the medical cannabis sector as a whole.
