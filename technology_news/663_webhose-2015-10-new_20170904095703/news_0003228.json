An incredible 65% of Cal Poly’s students began building their ePortfolios within just 7 days of the campus-wide rollout. Due to the positive buzz among students, over 80,000 students from the CSU system have joined and started their portfolios organically outside of the formal CSU partnership.\n“We are very pleased with the ease of implementation of Portfolium and their entire team’s responsiveness before, during, and after the launch. Preparation was minimal. We are very excited for our students and alumni to have a competitive tool that will help them translate their academic preparation to a career or promotion,” said Neal Hoss, VP Advancement, Cal State San Marcos.\nStudents and alumni access Portfolium via the exclusive network for their CSU campus. Through this network, they create a digital portfolio of their academic and professional accomplishments including projects, presentations and papers. The interface highlights talents and achievements that aren’t easily captured in a traditional resume, and their work is showcased in a collaborative environment that connects them directly to companies, recruiters, internships and jobs.\nPortfolium: The clear choice in a competitive space\n“After having our students test multiple ePortfolio options over last summer, Portfolium was chosen as the ideal platform to showcase the work and projects of Cal Poly students and alumni,\" said Charlotte Rinaldi, Assistant Director, Career Services, Cal Poly SLO.\nStudents and faculty alike have attributed Portfolium’s high marks and adoption success to its unique social networking feel, user-friendly interface, high level of accessibility, and rapid onboarding and implementation portal.\nAn exciting journey forward, together\nThe partnership with Portfolium highlights the CSU’s commitment to high-impact practices that support student success and expand opportunity. The tool helps students focus on outcomes including career readiness, skills planning, assessment and reflection, and employer engagement, while integrating with pre-existing Learning Management (“LMS”) tools such as Blackboard and Canvas.\n“I couldn’t be more proud to partner with the world’s top university system, not only because of CSU’s sheer size or history of academic excellence, but because of the system’s commitment to working with us to map the new college-to-career journey for millions of new graduates over the years to come,” said Adam Markowitz, Portfolium’s founder and CEO.\nAbout Portfolium\nPortfolium, a San Diego-based startup, has quickly become the partner of choice for colleges and universities looking to help students get a better start to their careers. Students from over 2,000 schools including top engineering schools like Cal Poly and UC San Diego are using Portfolium’s cloud-based platform to create an instant portfolio that conveys a clear picture of abilities beyond what can be displayed in a resume, transcript or LinkedIn profile. Students can get their portfolio of work on the radar of corporate recruiters by following companies, entering talent challenges, and applying directly to jobs on Portfolium’s job board.\nAbout the California State University\nThe California State University is the largest system of senior higher education in the country, with 23 campuses, 47,000 faculty and staff and more than 460,000 students.
