(AP) - A New Hampshire police department that recently pulled up some marijuana plants has offered the pot grower counseling in a Facebook post.\nMonday's post on the Danbury Police Department's site says if the pot grower gets home, goes for a walk in the woods, finds the summer's \"horticulture project\" gone and wants to talk about it he or she should call.\nIt says, \"We will offer you some counseling to get through your loss.\" It says a business card was left.\nAccompanying the Facebook post was a photo of marijuana plants on the hood of a police car.\nThe town of about 1,200 residents is about 30 miles northwest of Concord.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
