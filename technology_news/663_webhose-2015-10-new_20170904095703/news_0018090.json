Google’s intention is not to manufacture hardware; that’s why you can see them focusing so much on Android OS. With the collaboration with LG, the Nexus 5X is set to become the flagship of choice for the budget-conscious. What is even better is that it sees the debut of Google’s latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow together with this device. \nThe Nexus 5X will have a body measurement of 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 136 g (4.80 oz). This means that it is indeed slim and light indeed. In terms protection, there is Gorilla Glass 3 and oleophobic coating to protect it from harm. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the back of your device to complement the way you naturally hold it. Nexus Imprint will turn on your screen with one touch, unlock your apps quickly and easily, and let you breeze through checkout lines. And, by incorporating measurements each time you use it, Nexus Imprint gets smarter with every touch. \nSporting a 5.2-inch Full HD screen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density, it will make viewing a pleasure. But is sure pales in comparison against the Nexus 6P, which has an enormous 5.7-inch Quad HD screen. \nUnder the hood of the Nexus 5X will be the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset, a Hexa-core processor Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 & Dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 418 graphics, and 2GB RAM. Somehow there’s a feeling that it could have been better with 3GB memory, but there must be a reason they opted for 2GB instead. It has a lot to do with the optimized software that the latest update brings to the table. Let’s wait and see then. - Advertisement - \nAs always with other Google phones, the emphasis is not that great on the camera side of things. On the Nexus 5X, comes equipped with a 12.3 Megapixel primary camera and a 5 Megapixel secondary camera. It does, however, shine especially in low-light conditions. Its larger 1.55μm pixels capture more light even in the dimmest of conditions; that is able to produce stunning details and sharp images. With a faster Google Camera app, you will never miss a moment - and with the smart Google Photos app, your memories are easy to relive and always at your fingertips. \nIt does come with an app called Google Photos, which is a new way to store, search, and share all of your photos and videos. Store an unlimited amount of photos and videos at high quality for free, and access them anywhere. Automatically organized and searchable by the people, places, and things in them, your memories are always easy to find and share. \nAlso another feature of Google devices (or disadvantage to some) are the unavailability of an expansion slot. This is where you get to choose to go with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage only. \nBattery-wise, there’s a non-removable Li-Po 2700 mAh battery that should help in powering up the device for at least a day in between charging. \nThe best part is definitely on the software. Built to get the best out of the world's most popular OS, Nexus is the ultimate Android experience. You're always among the first to receive software and security updates. And you'll have the freshest, fastest version — Android 6.0 Marshmallow — working for you right out of the box. \nNexus 5X also comes with the best Google apps pre-installed, so it's ready to use right out of the box. Search, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Gmail, Drive, and so much more-ready for you to enjoy on your phone. And with Google Play Store you can access your favorite digital entertainment. Choose from millions of apps, books, songs, movies, and games. - Advertisement - \nThe LG Nexus 5X is not for everyone, especially for camera lovers. You have to make do with its limited storage that is another turn-off. But if you can live with these few constraints, then it makes for a great pure vanilla experience, exactly how Google wants it to be. No bloatware, no unnecessary apps installed – the fastest device yet without the need for extremely high specs. \nLG Nexus 5X is expected to be on sale in the middle of this month, and the 16GB version is expected to be available for $399 USD. Is will be available in Carbon, Quartz and Ice colors. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:34:05.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
