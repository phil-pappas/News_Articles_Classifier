He held a Thursday night showing for agents and two weekend open houses. He received 13 offers. “After a few rounds of negotiations it finally sold without any conditions,” Mr. Roy said. “There were over 300 people who attended, so they were crawling over each other.”\n2709 Victoria Drive, Vancouver VANCOUVER 2709 VICTORIA DRIVE, PH3 Renovated condo’s Trout Lake location appeals to young families news Vancouver condo sale sets building record What They Got: This 2,301-square-foot house has three bedrooms on the main floor and two bedrooms in the basement. Built in 1961, the bungalow is across from a park and close to SkyTrain, shops, Highway 1 and schools. The roof is six years old and the appliances are fairly new. It also has a mountain view.\nThe Agent’s Take: “The market for housing in East Vancouver is largely driven by a sense of fear that if you don’t buy a house now, you’ll be priced out of the market forever,” Mr. Roy said. “By leveraging that sense of scarcity, we were able to limit showings, drive lots of traffic and get our clients a very healthy return on their investment. Whenever we see [an opportunity] in the market for our clients, we encourage them to take advantage of it.”\nFollow us on Twitter: @globeandmail\n More Related to this Story VANCOUVER 2709 VICTORIA DRIVE, PH3 Renovated condo’s Trout Lake location appeals to young families\nVancouver condo sale sets building record\nBidding war for Vancouver home, but ‘nobody looked at it to live in’\nTopics: Vancouver, British Columbia Vancouver Home Sales Comments A A", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@globeandmail", "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/e8f/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/article26434587.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/7.jpg", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1445623552597!6m8!1m7!1swIeub8DWqEV8-mo0pRsdZw!2m2!1d49.24335358230719!2d-123.0351468955937!3f313.64077536275863!4f-3.063422180241332!5f0.7820865974627469", "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/879/life/home-and-garden/real-estate/article26549934.ece/ALTERNATES/w140/bc-deal-victoria0925re01.jpg", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2604.736096141351!2d-123.0376624843119!3d49.243492479327095!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x548676bfeeb538b3%3A0xa90a08c5b0c0bbab!2s4595+Rupert+St%2C+Vancouver%2C+BC+V5R+2J4!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1445623511042"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:36:22.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
