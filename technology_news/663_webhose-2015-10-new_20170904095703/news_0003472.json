Myers found several instances of people storing these files publicly on their websites, however. \nJeffrey Goldberg, 1Password's \"chief defender against the dark arts\", said the service has a new way of storing data that does not have the vulnerability, but that it was not easy to move users onto it. So I found something interesting about 1Password: http://t.co/hbEM9ZZyzk — Dale Myers (@Vel0x) October 17, 2015 \n1Password's software, available for Windows and Mac PCs as well as iOS and Android devices, stores encrypted information including passwords, software licences and bank account details. \nBut it also has a web-based manager - 1PasswordAnywhere - that can be used to access passwords provided you have the required keychain files available. 1Password recommends that its users store these on Dropbox, iCloud or possibly on a USB stick. \nTo access usernames, passwords and so on, the keychain must be decrypted with a user's 1Password master password. However, these files also contain unencrypted, plain text data on what services users have stored logins for have, and the links used to access the services. \nMany of these may be obvious, such as Facebook and Gmail, but others could be more private - revealing what bank and credit card users' have, or revealing that they have credentials for adult sites, for example. Gaining access to this information could, in theory, allow a malicious actor to blackmail the victim, claiming they have more information than they do. \nMore seriously, some of the stored logins could be password reset links, many of which do not expire after they have been used once, Myers said. \nWhile most people who use 1PasswordAnywhere will not have their keychain files publicly accessible, they could be available on a desktop version of Dropbox, so a person having access to the user's computer may be able to access it. Myers also said several people had public links to their keychains on their own websites, which were searchable from Google. \n1Password lets users store confidential log-in information Photo: 1Password \n\"By looking at one of these it was a simple matter to identify the owner of the keychain and where he lived. I know what his job is,\" Myers wrote. \n\"I even know the names of his wife and children. If I was malicious, it would be easy to convince someone that I had compromised their account and had access to all of their credentials. Not to mention the fact that they have revealed their location online which may put their personal safety at risk. \nThe potential vulnerability lies with a format called \"Agile Keychain\". AgileBits, 1Password's developer, offered an alternative to this format in 2012, introducing a new OPVault format which is more secure. Many users are still on the Agile Keychain format, though. \nMyers urged 1PasswordAnywhere users to switch to OPVault. 1Password's Jeffrey Goldberg said this hadn't been made the default option because AgileBits wasn't sure that it would work on every platform. \n\"Obviously we would love to see everyone on the new data format. It is a big improvement over the old one in an enormous number of respects, but until we can be confident that everyone is running clients on all of their platforms that can handle the new format, we are treating migration as an 'expert only' thing,\" he said . \n\"Rolling out a data format change when you have one \"product\" and one platform is easy. But we need to make make sure that people are using versions (and that such versions are available) of 1Password that handle the new format on all of the devices that they sync with.\" This response by @jpgoldberg is an example of why I trust @AgileBits and @1Password https://t.co/A2665J3qlT — Ryan Lackey (@octal) October 19, 2015 \nDave Teare, 1Password's co-founder, said ideally users would all move to OPVault, and that it hoped to be able to do so soon. @Vel0x It's a good post, ty for writing it. Yes, we documented this clearly but ideally we would have forced everyone to move to OPVault. — Dave Teare (@dteare) October 18, 2015 @Vel0x The unencrypted url is a throw back to slower machines. We’re pretty much at the point now where we can switch everyone over. — Dave Teare (@dteare) October 18, 2015 How to protect yourself if you think you might be vulnerable Never store your 1Password files anywhere you don't trust completely. 1Password recommends storing it in Dropbox, which offers additional security measures such as two-factor authentication. To make your metadata more secure, you can switch to the OPVault service. Instructions for this are here 1Password has iOS and Android apps, which allow you to access your passwords and data without using the 1PasswordAnywhere service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:51:35.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
