There was also a video recording of Silicon Valley executives such as Mark Zuckerberg praising Grove. \nA very frail looking Grove, 79 years old, took to the stage to thank everyone and spoke briefly. \nGrove is credited with building a tough talking and hard working culture at Intel that propelled the company from a failing memory chip maker to a microprocessor manufacturer that dominates desktop and server markets. \nGrove escaped from Hungary to the US after surviving the German occupation of the Second World War and then the Hungarian revolution against the communist government and invasion by Soviet forces in 1956. \nHis migrant status was mentioned by Horowitz in regards to closed borders and the migrant crisis in Europe and in the US, which would likely have kept Grove out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:20:02.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
