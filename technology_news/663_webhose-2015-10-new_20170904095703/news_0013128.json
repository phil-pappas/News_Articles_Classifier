A-J MEDIA \nThe procedure begins with anesthesia. \nAs the patient sleeps, Dr. Jeff Headrick, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon for The Center for Orthopedic Surgery with privileges with Grace Health System, makes an incision and analyzes the problem causing the pain — often arthritis — and gauges whether the patient is a good candidate for a partial knee replacement. \n“That means that I find arthritis on just one side of the knee or the other,” he said. \nIt’s the most common issue that leads to knee replacements, Headrick said. \n“Arthritis means that the cartilage on the joint at the end of the bone has worn away — usually from wear and tear,” he said. \nIt’s common for people with joint issues to walk into his office with advanced knee deterioration — especially farmers, he said. \nAfter the incision is made, pins are attached to the leg that create a digital map of the knee and relay the morphed model to a computer screen so Headrick can begin the process of replacing the knee. \n“I’ve done some partial knee replacements over the years, but I’m so excited about the robot because it’s a very accurate way of doing a partial knee replacement,” he said. “A partial knee replacement is actually a harder surgery than a full knee replacement. It’s more technically demanding.” \nThe Navio Surgical System, a robotic tool created by Blue Belt Technologies, helps make the routine procedures easier and aids in precision, Headrick said. \nGrace Health System began talks with the company to bring a robot to Lubbock about 10 months ago, said Randy Nichols, COO of Grace Health System. About two months ago, the robot was introduced to Headrick. \nJustin Wells, regional manager for Texas for Blue Belt Technologies, said there about 45 installed nationwide and the next closest one to Lubbock is in El Paso. \nThe average cost for a Navio robot is $425,000 to $450,000, he said. \n“So the technology, as it stands right now, is used for partial knee replacements only,” Wells said. \nHeadrick said the technology is innovative because it helps guide him through the procedure and minimizes recovery time. \nWhen the image of the knee is projected on the screen, Headrick begins flexing the patient’s knee until he finds the perfect position to begin the replacement procedure. The robot then generates a series of plans and allows Headrick to choose one. \nOnce processed, Headrick can begin the procedure of cutting the bone. \n“It will only let me remove the bone that needs to be removed,” Headrick said. “It uses the mechanism that moves in and out to assist me in removing the proper amount of bone in the right location. If I get outside of the line, it pulls it back.” \nShorter hospital stays are possible, he said. \nA partial knee replacement done right can make any necessary future adjustments easier, Headrick said. \nWells said the Navio robot is a stepping stone for the next project. \nPlans are currently underway for the release of a robot for full knee replacements in 2016, he said. \nHeadrick has performed five partial knee replacement procedures since he was introduced to the robot. \n“Those patients are doing great,” Headrick said. “They’re coming back at two weeks with really great flexion. They’re not hurting that much.” \nEach procedure has included a representative from Blue Belt Technologies helping in case Headrick has any questions, Wells said. \nEventually, Headrick will begin training others on how to use the robot designating Grace Health System as a Center of Excellence for the technology, he said. \nellysa.gonzalez@", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:11:23.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
