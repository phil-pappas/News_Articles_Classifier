However, this increase appears to have been driven more by fairly significant ASP declines from June through August than the hype surrounding the end-of-support deadline. To that end, there was a 6.2 percent drop from June in average selling prices for servers during July and August.\n“To the surprise of most, a continued demand-based spike in unit shipment growth—as a result of the hype of the Windows Server 2003 end-of-support deadline—just didn’t happen the way people anticipated,” said Michael Diamond , Director, Industry Analysis, Commercial Technology, The NPD Group . “In fact, it appears that much of the sales volume in July and August was spurred by aggressive pricing in the channel.\n“There are a number of factors that have coalesced to account for these less-than-projected results, including a switch by many firms to alternative systems,” Diamond added. “Some firms have moved to cloud computing, and others have opted to virtualize their infrastructures, leaving thousands of servers in a ‘comatose’ state. Still others are outsourcing more and more of their server-based operations, further segmenting the marketplace.”\nAbout The NPD Group\nThe NPD Group provides market information and analytic solutions that drive better decision-making and better results.
