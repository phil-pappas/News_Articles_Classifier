Key Facts: Level 3 Secure Access Cellular is now available in North America and will be available winter 2015 in Europe and spring 2016 in Latin America . Level 3 Secure Access Cellular service provides a cost-effective, reliable, secure alternative to purchasing diverse network paths. This solution is cellular carrier-agnostic. Level 3 manages the connection with mainstream cellular providers. Product Information: Level 3 Secure Access Cellular uses multi-vendor cellular connectivity to provide customers a back-up network connection for remote or branch locations, if a customer's normal fiber connection is disrupted. If a disruption occurs, the solution is designed to switch from a dedicated Level 3 MPLS/IP Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to cellular backup connectivity through a LTE network. This cellular backup, the Secure Access Site product tunnel (IPsec), runs over a cellular 3G or 4G network instead of a broadband or DSL connection.
