The old SYNC system was innovative, but was beginning to get a bit dated. That is why Ford developed the all-new SYNC 3 system and it is now launching in several new 2016 Ford vehicles. Bell Ford, a Phoenix Ford dealer, is letting drivers know which vehicles this new technology will be found in. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278814 \nThe first new vehicle that is set to have SYNC 3 available to drivers is the 2016 Ford Escape . While the 2016 Escape did not receive any major design changes, the addition of the SYNC 3 system is certainly one aspect that will appeal to drivers. With its all new interface and voice-recognition software, the SYNC 3 system is revolutionizing the connectivity that drivers have with the outside world while they are behind the wheel. \nAnother vehicle that is adding the SYNC 3 system to its list of available options is the 2016 Ford Focus. This compact car will once again be available as either a hatchback or a sedan and will have two performance options for 2016. The 2016 Ford Focus RS will join the Focus ST in the Ford performance lineup, and with 350-horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque , the RS is gearing up to be one of the most exciting performance cars on the track and on the road. \nIn addition to the 2016 Escape and Focus, there are several other vehicles that are anticipated to add SYNC 3 connectivity this year. A few of them include the Ford Mustang, the F-150 and the Fusion. \nAnyone interested in learning more about Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system and what vehicles it will be available in are encouraged to contact a Bell Ford sales professional by calling 888-711-0056.
