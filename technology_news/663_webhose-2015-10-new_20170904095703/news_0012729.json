Kearney, a global strategy and management-consulting firm.\nLong known for its office software products, Microsoft has been expanding its consumer lineup that includes such items as its Xbox videogames and consoles, tablets, its new Surface Book laptop and its new fitness device Microsoft Band.\nMicrosoft has been pondering a U.S. flagship location since it began opening stores in 2009, waiting for the right time and opportunity, company executives said.\nIn the early years of establishing stores, the company encountered some customers who didn't realize the Xbox game system was a Microsoft product, said David Porter, corporate vice president of world-wide retail and online stores. The stores are designed to bridge those gaps and provide a connection between the company and its consumer.\nMicrosoft's Fifth Avenue store, which is located between East 53rd and East 54th streets, is designed to do that on a larger scale. \"We believe that they will leave with an experience of understanding who we are,\" Mr. Porter said.\nLED digital panels line the sides of the store's first floor with a two-story digital wall rising at the back of the store. The company's newest products are front and center presented on wood tables with stools. Most of the items in the store, which also include devices made by Microsoft's partners, aren't tethered, so shoppers can hold and test them and, in the case of its fitness bands, try them on for size. Customers can play Xbox games on an 84-inch monitor in \"the living room, \" a space at the front of the store that is visible to passersby.\n\"Experiential retail is the wave of the future,\" said Robert K. Futterman, chief executive of real estate services firm RKF. The firm specializes in retail real estate. \"Keep the customer in the store, keep them engaged. The longer they stay, the better chance you have they will buy stuff.\"\nThe second floor features large areas for playing Xbox games as well as an answer desk and community theater, where community-development specialists program 70 hours of workshops a week. The third floor will showcase an extended selection of Dell products, an area dubbed the \"Dell Experience at the Microsoft store.\"\nThe fourth floor provides space for employees and other back-store operations. And the fifth floor holds a space to host meetings and events.\nOne signature feature will be the store's culture wall, an exterior display of noncommercial digital imagery that will change and complement the architecture and facade of the building. The wall is 40 feet wide and 20 feet high.\nMicrosoft, which has a specialty store at the Shops at Columbus Circle, had an opportunity to test the Manhattan market with a temporary store in Times Square during the 2012 holiday season, noted Richard Hodos, vice chairman of real-estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. Mr. Hodos worked with GCD Consultants to secure Microsoft's Fifth Avenue location. The store tested well and gave the company confidence it could do a significant amount of business in Manhattan, he said. But ultimately the company opted for the high-end cachet of Fifth Avenue.\nAsking rents for the stretch of Fifth Avenue between 49th and 60th streets were $3,350 a square foot during the third quarter, according to real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.\n\"You're going to get all those tourist eyeballs,\" Mr. Hodos said, \"and you get the New Yorker.\"\nWrite to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com\n 25, 2015 21:52 ET (01:52 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:17:02.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
