But proper licensing does. \nBy Randolph P. Johnston, Leslie Garrett, and Brian F. Tankersley The Accounting Firm Operations and Technology Survey \nSoftware is the reason that firms make investments in computer hardware, yet many firms seem to avoid upgrades until they are forced to make a change. For example, when asked to identify their preferred word processing application, more than 50 percent of respondents in both groups are using a version of the software that is over five years old (e.g. Office 2010 or earlier), and a significant number of solo practitioners are using Word 2007, which is eight years old as of June 2015.

Soloists, Small Firms Relate \nWhile we do not think that practitioners should jump the newest version of a product immediately, we also do not think they should be more than two releases behind the current version of their applications for an extended period of time. \nWe are seeing an effort by the software publishers to move users to subscription-based offerings instead of perpetual licenses that are purchased. Most software publishers, including Intuit, Sage, Microsoft, Thomson Reuters, Wolters Kluwer and Adobe Systems, are offering their applications on a subscription basis. Practitioners should not just jump to these offerings because they are new – they should analyze the purchase options for software just as they might compare the financial benefits of leasing versus owning a hard asset like a car or a copying machine. \nTechnology consultants to the profession should also verify that the user license held by a user entitles them to deploy the software as it is currently being used. Many publishers require special licensing to deploy desktop software in a hosted environment, and without very specific kinds of licenses, running some software with GoToMyPC, on Remote Desktop Services (Terminal Server), Citrix XenApp/XenDesktop or VMWare Virtual Desktop Infrastructure may be prohibited. \nWe saw a significant increase in the number of respondents to the survey who reported that they used some applications in 2015 as compared to 2014. We noted more changes to tax applications in firms during 2014 than we have seen in decades. While we believe that some publishers did pick up some market share from other publishers in 2015, we also believe that part of the large year-over-year increases are due to a change in the mix of participants from year to year. \nWe noted that the desktop version of QuickBooks is the dominant tool for small business accounting in the US, and we estimate that the product has a market share well over 50 percent in most segments of the market. We noted that the cloud-based accounting products lagged well behind the desktop solutions, and while many users can have their needs met using cloud solutions without third-party add-on products, there is still a feature gap between many cloud-based solutions and the more mature and feature rich on-premises applications. \nWhile the benefits of cloud-based applications are well known (access from anywhere, server-based failover, integration in real time with other applications and tools from anywhere), manufacturing, job costing and multiple currency support are three key needs that are not possible in most cloud-based accounting solutions. We would caution readers to not infer that we are “anti-cloud,” as we believe the cloud should be investigated where those who avoid cloud-based solutions will lose many opportunities to serve self-employed millennials and startups led by those under 40 years of age. \nWe think every firm that intends to be in business in 10 years should investigate and perhaps use some client-facing cloud applications so that they do not miss out on the long-term client opportunities from young entrepreneurs who prefer to work in this way with their accounting professional. It is the young entrepreneurs who will make the future of the solo and small firm practitioner possible. \nWe are starting to see many publishers sunset the sales and support of some of their older products in favor of newer products. The publishers are giving plenty of notice of the discontinuance of most of the products. Firms are being told of these plans as far as two years in advance. While there may be a temptation to wait until the last minute to make the change, we believe firms should start planning for these conversions immediately so that they can work out any workflow problems with the new tool before its widespread deployment. \nWe also have seen too many situations where procrastination left a small number of people trying to convert a sea of client data to a new tool at the last minute. Proactively evaluating the impact of software changes as early as possible and developing new procedures and training before they are deployed to a large number of clients is essential to any change in platform from one product to another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:23:45.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
