One of the world's largest and most respected network security and backup companies once again turns to Violin Memory to provide the FSPs necessary to develop and maintain peak readiness for its mission critical solutions. \nToday's headlines are full of news about critical often sensitive data sets being hacked or stolen outright. As more and more personal and confidential data is stored online, the risks and potential damage rise daily, making data and network security critically important. \nThe value of data is increasing as the ability to gain insight and monetize useful business intelligence grows. At the same time, study after study shows that the growth of data will continue, and in fact is expected to accelerate, as the internet of things (IoT) continues to evolve. More data. More value. \nIT is charged with storing and protecting both with seamless back up strategies, online data protection, and data efficiency capabilities. For these reasons the Violin 7300 FSP represents the ultimate enterprise storage solution, the shortest path to the all-silicon data center while delivering continuous data protection and the highest performance storage at the lowest CAPEX and OPEX possible today. \n\"Mission critical IT functions in the biggest companies around the world are beginning to realize the value of moving to flash today as they evolve toward the all-silicon data center, and can now do it without risking downtime, or sacrificing the data protection of legacy platforms,\" said Kevin DeNuccio, president and chief executive officer, Violin Memory. \"In today's dynamic global business environment, our Flash Storage Platform is increasingly the enterprise flash solution of choice.\" \nThe Violin customer maintains a very active development program to tune, optimize and prove interoperability for a very sophisticated global customer list. \n\"We are gratified that our customers are driving their ecosystem partners to integrate flash storage platforms into the fabric of their development and test environments,\" said Susan Scheer Aoki, vice president, customer experience at Violin. \"This enables our customers to enjoy the rich innovation of the All Flash Array and 7300 Flash Storage Platform.\" \n\"The DevOps environment at this customer supports the widest range of I/O activity imaginable because they need to establish interoperability across the full range of workloads their customers will run. This is where the 7300 FSP's Flash Fabric Architecture (FFA™) really shines. Our architecture reaches deep into the flash capabilities at the chip level. The company's Flash Storage Platforms were designed without caches, or other unpredictable mechanisms, so that between supporting true random I/O and providing lots of performance headroom, it easily handles multiple heterogeneous workloads simultaneously. It was a good fit,\" said Jon Bennett, chief technology officer at Violin. \nRELATED LINKS AND CONVERSATIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:10:39.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
