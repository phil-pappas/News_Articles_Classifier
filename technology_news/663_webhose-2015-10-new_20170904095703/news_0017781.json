Credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project \nInfrared data from NASA's Aqua satellite showed Hurricane Joaquin weakening over cooler waters and transitioning into a post-tropical cyclone.An infrared image of Hurricane Joaquin was taken from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite on Oct. 7 at 15:41 UTC (11:41 a.m. EDT). The infrared data, which shows temperature, showed the highest, coldest clouds and the bulk of cold clouds were being pushed from the center to northeast of the center by westerly winds. Cloud top temperatures had also warmed since the previous day indicating weaker storms and less uplift in the air. AIRS infrared data also showed the sea surface temperatures were colder than the 80F (26.6C) required to help a tropical cyclone maintain intensity. \nBecause Joaquin lacked sufficient organized deep convection (and developing thunderstorms) to qualify as a tropical cyclone, at 11 p.m. EDT on October 7, the National Hurricane Center declared Joaquin as a post-tropical cyclone. \nAt 11 p.m. EDT on October 7 (0300 UTC, Oct.8), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Joaquin was located near latitude 42.0 North, longitude 37.0 West. That's about 595 miles (960 km) west-northwest of the Azores. The post-tropical cyclone was moving toward the east near 35 mph (56 kph), and this general motion is expected over the next couple of days. Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 kph) and additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours. The estimated minimum central pressure was 977 millibars. \nNational Hurricane Center forecaster Pasch said \"Satellite imagery indicates that the system no longer resembles a tropical cyclone, with a disorganized area of multi-layered cloudiness sheared off well to the northeast of the ill-defined low-level center. However, model analyses and surface data indicate that the cyclone is not yet embedded within a frontal zone, and therefore is not extratropical at this time.\" \nA visible image of Joaquin was taken from NOAA's GOES-East satellite on Oct. 8 at 1145 UTC (7:45 a.m. EDT) as it sped through the northern Atlantic Ocean. The image showed that most of the clouds associated with the post-tropical cyclone were northeast of the center. The image was created by the NASA/NOAA GOES Project at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. This infrared image of Hurricane Joaquin was taken from the AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite on Oct. 7 at 15:41 UTC (11:41 a.m. EDT). The bulk of cold (blue/purple) clouds were being pushed northeast of the center.

That would take Joaquin's remnants toward Portugal and Spain over the weekend of October 10 and 11. NASA shows upper-level westerly winds affecting Tropical Storm Fred September 3, 2015 \nUpper-level westerly winds have been affecting Tropical Storm Fred in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean and continue to do so today, September 3.

Satellite view of remnants of post-Tropical Cyclone Niala September 29, 2015 \nPost-Tropical Cyclone Niala faded under a hostile atmospheric environment and an infrared satellite image shows the torn-apart storm's remnants southwest of Hawaii. NASA sees wind shear affecting Tropical Storm Joaquin September 29, 2015 \nDespite being battered with vertical wind shear, Tropical Depression 11 strengthened and organized into Tropical Storm Joaquin. NASA's Aqua satellite and NOAA's GOES satellite both captured images of the slightly elongated ... Aqua and Terra satellites analyze Hurricane Joaquin near Bermuda October 5, 2015 \nHurricane Joaquin maintained its comma shape as it brought heavy rains, strong winds and ocean swells to Bermuda on October 5 when NASA satellites passed overhead. Satellites see Hurricane Joaquin moving through Northern Atlantic October 6, 2015 \nNASA and NOAA satellites have been watching Hurricane Joaquin move to the northeast through the northern Atlantic Ocean. Although Joaquin is moving away from the U.S. and Canada it is still generating dangerous surf conditions. NASA provides an infrared look at Hurricane Joaquin over time October 7, 2015 \nA series of NASA infrared images of Hurricane Joaquin from October 1 to 6 show the development and movement of the storm, and its moisture stream into South Carolina.
