It has quarter-finals and semi-finals and finally, a final. At the quarter-finals we took Hlaudi to the Western Cape High Court and we beat him there,\" Maimane said at a rally outside the ANC's investment arm Chancellor House on Thursday.\n\"In the semi-final [Motsoeneng] took us to the SCA saying that the public protector's powers don't apply to him. Where did he learn that from but number one [President Jacob Zuma ]?.\n\"When he went to the SCA, the judge said 'Hlaudi, you can cook your matric but you can't cook the court, therefore Hlaudi must be suspended immediately',\" said Maimane.", "external_links": ["http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=627451", "http://whoswho.co.za/hlaudi-motsoeneng-627451", "http://whoswho.co.za/mmusi-maimane-44612", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=927", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=44612", "http://whoswho.co.za/jacob-zuma-927"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:08:06.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
