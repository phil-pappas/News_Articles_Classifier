In tandem with a recent investment by Aktion Partners , CloudCraze’s new hires aim to help the company scale quickly and fill the void in the growing B2B commerce space for agile and scalable cloud solutions.\nRay Grady has been appointed executive vice president, where he will use his nearly 15 years of executive experience in the B2B commerce space to spearhead company growth and investments. Previously, Grady was senior vice president and general manager of Acquia , one of the fastest-growing SaaS providers in the world. He is also co-founder of Acquity Group, which was acquired by Accenture Interactive for $316 million in 2013.\n“I am thrilled to be working again with my fellow Acquity Group co-founders as part of the CloudCraze executive team,” said Grady. “The existing team has already made ground-breaking changes in the B2B commerce space, and I’m excited to contribute to the company’s continued growth and development.”\nJohn Wallace, global director of alliances and channels, joins CloudCraze after more than six years at Accenture Interactive , where he served most recently as global alliance lead. His role will include alliance management recruitment and formation, field and inside sales alignment, and partner performance management.\nLes Kismartoni will serve as product architect for CloudCraze after nearly seven years as chief technology officer for Appiphony , where he oversaw all technological development and implementation. Similar to CloudCraze, Appiphony is integrated into the Salesforce platform, so Kismartoni brings a wealth of knowledge of Salesforce integrations and capabilities to the company.\n“With some of the brightest minds in the industry at the helm of the company, the new additions to our leadership team positions CloudCraze at the forefront of the B2B commerce space,” said Chris Dalton, CEO of CloudCraze. “We are uniquely positioned in the industry with the expertise, scale and agility behind our platform, and we know there are great things in CloudCraze’s future.”\nThese three strategic hires reinforce the company’s focus on strategic investments, product development and growth in market share in 2016.\nFor more information, visit http://www.cloudcraze.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBpcGhvbnkuY29tLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jbG91ZGNyYXplLmNvbQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNxdWlhLmNvbS8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWNjZW50dXJlLmNvbS91cy1lbg==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2FrdGlvbnBhcnRuZXJzLmNvbS8="], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:22:27.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
