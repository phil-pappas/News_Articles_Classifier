(NYSE:SSNI) announced Streetlight.Vision 6 (SLV6), its new street light and smart city control and management platform. With more than 100 new features, SLV6 provides cities, utilities, and energy services companies with a comprehensive platform to support their smart city needs and create more value from their existing street light networks. SLV6 is commercially available today. \nToday, Silver Spring also opened early access to its smart city developer program and App Store, which allows software developers and device manufacturers to build new smart city applications and devices for the SLV6 platform, accelerating innovation for customers and providing partners with new routes to market and revenue opportunities. \n“In partnership with Silver Spring, Florida Power & Light (FPL) has initiated what is believed to be the largest networked street lights project in the world — nearly 500,000 lights across FPL’s Florida service territory,” said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light. “Establishing a smart street light network will continue the advancement of our smart grid and deliver benefits to our customers, including more reliable and efficient service. We welcome the enhancements of SLV6 to help us achieve these benefits for our customers.” \n“As an international smart city solution partner with presence in 20 countries, Bouygues Energies & Services has decided to include the new SLV6 city control and management platform in our Citybox solutions for our global public lighting, cities, and energy customer base,” said Christophe Grattarola, Director of the Smart City Market at Bouygues Energies & Services. “Cities around the world are leveraging technologies to help them conserve energy, improve economic competitiveness, and deliver better services to citizens. We are happy to partner with Streetlight.Vision and Silver Spring Networks to bring our customers the advanced solution.” \nSLV6: Advanced Smart City Platform Includes More Than 100 New Features \nSilver Spring delivers SLV control software for smart city and smart lighting networks in more than 500 cities in 16 countries. As public lighting can consume as much as 40% of a municipality’s energy budget, cities across the globe are looking to remotely manage their lighting networks to lower energy consumption, improve lighting reliability and public safety, and establish a smart city platform upon which future applications can be deployed. \nWith the introduction of SLV6, customers will be able to benefit from more than 100 new features, including: Expanded Smart City Device Support: A broad set of smart city device support, including integration with more than 50 light point control system vendors and an expanded range of smart city devices such as electrical vehicle charging stations, traffic cameras, parking kiosks, environmental sensors, solar panels, electric, water and gas meters, and more. Asset and Inventory Management: Improved asset management to create, import, export, and modify a wide array of devices, develop custom inventory attributes, and run analytics and reports. Work Order Management: Automated device monitoring and data analytics of attributes, advanced alarm mechanisms, report-based and map-based failures detection, creating improved cross-departmental coordination on maintenance activities, and helping to increase customer/citizen satisfaction, reduce the number of onsite operations, and deliver cost-savings on maintenance budgets. Advanced Analytics: Data analytics to identify and anticipate possible faults on the grid and to reduce call-center load by leveraging crowd-sourced information on device failures and other issues in the field. New User Interface: User-friendly interface including user-configurable web desktop, easy-to-deploy Apps and Widgets from the new SLV App Store, and an optimized experience on mobile devices such as tablets for simple and convenient use in the field. Simplified Integration with Existing Business Processes : The SLV6 extended North Bound Web Service API allows Work Order Management system tickets to be created from the data collected and analysed by SLV6, and also enables easy interface with Billing and Geographical Information Systems. Near Limitless Extensibility: Ability to leverage the SLV6 platform to help drive new business models and grow revenue. For example, cities can add cameras to their existing street light network to deliver traffic data to third-party devices and applications, unlocking new services for citizens. \n“Cities and utilities are looking to not only more effectively manage their street lights but to also leverage their lighting networks to connect a wide range of additional smart city devices,” said Christophe Orceau, Director for Streetlight.Vision, Silver Spring Networks. “With more than 100 new features, SLV6 pushes the capabilities of smart city control platforms to the next level. It continues its heritage of multi-network support, and now adds the option for third-party developers, customers, and integrators to add new functionality on the platform via the SLV App Store, providing network operators choice and flexibility as their needs evolve.” \nEarly Access to SLV6 Smart City Developer Program and App Store is Now Open \nSilver Spring also announced early access to the SLV6 developer program and App Store. The SLV6 App Store will include new applications from Silver Spring and third-party application developers and device manufacturers leveraging the SLV6 open data platform, the SLV6 Software Developer Kit (SDK), and RESTful APIs to drive development of innovative smart city solutions: The SLV App Store and SLV6 SDK provides software developers with the ability to easily build applications and widgets that plug into the core SLV6 management software and can be downloaded and displayed on the SLV6 secured Web Desktop. The new applications will be available and easily deployable via the SLV6 App Store, creating even more value and choice for customers.
