These spyware programs leave the user extremely vulnerable to the kinds of security attacks we’ve been seeing on a growing basis. The Librem laptops do not have this ‘mystery code’ in the kernel, operating system, nor software,” said Purism CEO Todd Weaver.\nBuilt chip by chip, app by app, for privacy and security\nThe goal of the Librem is to offer a simple, out of the box, privacy-enhancing computing experience, with the best privacy and rights-protecting free/libre and open source software preinstalled.\nThe Librem has an anodized aluminum case, combining the benefits of the MacBook Air and high-end Lenovo laptops. Librem laptops come with privacy kill switches to sever the hardware circuit to the camera, microphone, Bluetooth and WiFi, deterring data thieves, snoops and hackers. Additionally, the Librem runs on a custom-compiled Linux kernel.\nUnlike most other computers on the market today, the Librem’s hardware, operating system and applications do not “phone home” and never send data back to the parent company. “Backdoors,” spyware, binary blobs and other vulnerabilities in the kernel, operating system and applications have been completely removed.\nThe following privacy-enhancing software comes preinstalled on Librem laptops:\nPureOS Operating system — Purism's custom-built GNU/Linux based operating system with a clean user interface, offers easy access to applications, documents, and media.\nLibreOffice office suite — A preinstalled office suite is file-compatible with Microsoft Windows Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, Visio, and Outlook, as well as Apple files. LibreOffice protects your freedom and privacy, is completely free/libre and open source, and never sends data to the parent company.\nPureBrowser – PureBrowser is a Firefox-based browser specifically designed to ensure privacy and security.\nTor Browser — Tor Browser is an anonymizing browser that uses encryption and anonymous routing to protect users' rights.\nEFF Privacy Badger — The EFF Privacy Badger is a PureBrowser plug in which blocks spying ads and invisible trackers.\nHTTPS Everywhere — HTTPS Everywhere is a PureBrowser extension that encrypts communications with many major websites, making browsing more secure.\nLibrem 13 hardware features:\nThe following privacy-enhancing hardware features come with the Librem laptops:\nHardware kill switches – Physical toggle switches shut off the camera and microphone to disable remote access.\nPop-down 1 Gigabyte RJ45 Internet jack\nPurism Key — The Purism key on the Librem 13 is a powerful key for searching all files and applications.\nEasily upgradable — The user can unscrew the back of the LIbrem easily with a standard Phillips-head screwdriver to expand and add additional RAM or storage.\nNo visible logo – By request from backers, the Librem 13 laptop has no visible logo.\nOther Librem 13 features include:\nSlim, solid aluminum case with dark gray anodized finish.\nExtra-strong, reinforced hinges.\nLarge, multi-touch trackpad.\nGlare-proof, matte 13” display screen.\n5th Generation, 2.2 gz Intel Processor.\n4 GB memory, expandable to 16 GB.\nM.2 (NGFF) PCIE SSD.\nCROWD FUNDING ENABLES RAPID DEVELOPMENT\nThe Librem 13 was funded using a crowdfunding website, Crowd Supply, and designed and developed in less than 5 months. The Librem 13 crowdfunding campaign was initially announced June 21, 2015 and reached its $250,000 funding goal on September 17, 2015.
