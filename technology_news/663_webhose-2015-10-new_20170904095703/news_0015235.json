We're glad you called, but what's the deal with your flip phone? The British songstress debuted her music video today for her new single \"Hello.\" The ballad is part of an album, titled \"25,\" scheduled to be released on Nov. 20. \nWhile fans agreed Adele could do no wrong, they also couldn't stop talking about the ancient early-2000s flip phone she used in the music video. \n\nSinger Adele Premieres Much-Awaited New Single 'Hello' \n\nIf Adele had an iPhone that song & video would have never happened.
