It has been criticized for not telling customers for more than a day. \nIt is the third known cyberattack in a year on Talk Talk, which provides mobile phone, broadband Internet and pay television services. \nShares in the company plunged more than 7 percent Friday morning to 248.4 pence ($3.83) on the London Stock Exchange. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
