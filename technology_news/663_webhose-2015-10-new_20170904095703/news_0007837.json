The world is more interconnected today than ever before. Government, private industry, educators, law enforcement, and everyday users are needed to make the Internet a safer, more secure, environment. October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM) and National CyberWatch Center is joining with the Department of Homeland Security and its partners across the country to highlight the importance of cybersecurity and online safety.\nUnderstand the risks, learn how to spot potential problems, and consider how online actions can impact everyone’s collective security. Online safety and security are shared responsibilities, and everyone has an obligation to protect theirs and others identities and information online.\nTake these simple actions to protect online identity:\n Set strong passwords with eight or more characters and a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols Don’t share passwords with anyone Keep operating systems, browsers, and other critical software optimized by installing updates Limit the amount of personal information shared online Use privacy settings to avoid sharing information widely Be cautious about what is received and read online; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\nNational CyberWatch Center is participating in NCSAM to make the Internet safer for everyone.
