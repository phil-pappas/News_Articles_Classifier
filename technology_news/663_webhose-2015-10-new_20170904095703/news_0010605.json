Phillip Messing, Jamie Schram and Bruce Golding news.com.au Share Email a friend \nHILLARY Clinton’s email scandal didn’t stop the head of the CIA from using his own personal AOL account to stash work-related documents, according to a high school student who claims to have hacked into them. \nCIA Director John Brennan’s private account held sensitive files — including his 47-page application for top-secret security clearance — until he recently learned that it had been infiltrated, the hacker told The Post. \nOther emails stored in Brennan’s non-government account contained the Social Security numbers and personal information of more than a dozen top American intelligence officials, as well as a government letter about the use of “harsh interrogation techniques” on terrorism suspects, according to the hacker. \nThe FBI and other federal agencies are now investigating the hacker, with one source saying criminal charges are possible, law enforcement sources said. \n“I think they’ll want to make an example out of him to deter people from doing this in the future,” said a source who described the situation as “just wild” and “crazy.” \n“I can’t believe he did this to the head of the CIA,’’ the source added. “[The] problem with these older-generation guys is that they don’t know anything about cybersecurity, and as you can see, it can be problematic.” \nIn a series of phone conversations with The Post, the hacker described himself as an American high school student who is not Muslim and was motivated by opposition to US foreign policy and support for Palestine. \nHe wouldn’t reveal his name or say where he lived but made good on a promise to tweet “CWA owns John Brennan of the CIA” as a means of verifying his control over the @phphax Twitter account. Hello guys this Twitter account is going now as things are starting to get hot, we will still be getting our words out though. ;)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:16:11.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
