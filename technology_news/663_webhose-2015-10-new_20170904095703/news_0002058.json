Now the passengers can be stacked up in a conscious effort to reduce space consumed and maximise profit earned. The patent, entitled “Passenger Arrangement for Vehicles,” explains that the seats would be stacked up and the passengers allotted the top bunk can get to it by climbing a few stairs. An excerpt from the document reads “In modern means of transport, in particular in aircraft, it is very important from an economic point of view to make optimum use of available space in a passenger cabin.” These seats have adjustable height, and can be completely flattened to resemble a bed. But still, we reckon, it’s going to be a tight squeeze.
