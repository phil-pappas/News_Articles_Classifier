The AZA association is a non-profit group of accredited leaders that are dedicated to protect endangered species and promote the education of science, recreation and conservation. This private event is geared towards educating Chief Financial Officers about technology, security and the best business practices and solutions for their company. The Santa Barbara Zoo is one of One Step Retail’s customers and recently installed NCR Counterpoint in all of their sales locations around the zoo. It has been a thriving partnership so One Step was very excited to be asked to be part of the 11th Annual CFO AZA Conference in Santa Barbara.\n“We successfully installed NCR Counterpoint this year around our Zoo, with One Step Retail guiding us through the process. It was a huge task and our team was able to rely on the expertise of One Step Retail, and the strength and support from NCR, for a smooth transition. This is the kind of company that I would recommend to my colleagues to help them with their POS needs. I appreciate the support from Scott Kreisberg to ensure our successful implementation and to speak at this conference. I feel all attendees will benefit from Scott’s expertise as well as from understanding the value of One Step Retail as a resource for their own Point of Sale and general technology questions and problems. “– Carol Bedford, Chief Financial Officer of the Santa Barbara Zoo\nWhen animal lover, CEO of One Step Retail Solutions, Scott Kreisberg, was asked about speaking on POS/Inventory Management at the event he replied, “Having the opportunity to work with the Santa Barbara Zoo with their POS/Inventory Management system is a real treat. I’m amazed by the level of intricate details the Zoo staff goes through to ensure the animals are well cared for. I’m honored to be speaking about outsourcing and I look forward to presenting information on how other Zoos can implement outsourcing to be more efficient.”\nThis three day private conference will be held at the Santa Barbara Zoo and include educational talks about cyber security, financial factors, fraud protection, retail technology and conservation and education.
