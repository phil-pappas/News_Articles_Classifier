Datamyx serves customers in industries ranging from banking, credit unions and mortgage providers to alternative finance, insurance and others. Utilizing a proprietary technology platform, Datamyx's marketing analytics solution helps grow customer's revenue through strategic targeting, lead optimization, retention and cross-selling services. The seller in the transaction was Halyard Capital, a New York based private equity fund. \nDeluxe paid approximately $160 million in cash for the acquisition, with the purchase price subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The purchase price was funded through an expansion of the existing credit facility which now provides total financing capacity of $525 million. After the acquisition, there was approximately $428 million outstanding on the expanded facility. \n\"We believe the acquisition of Datamyx creates a tremendous strategic opportunity for us as we continue to grow our marketing solutions and other services product offerings,\" said Lee Schram, chief executive officer of Deluxe. \"Datamyx's expertise in transforming data into actionable marketing information provides valuable insight and helps customers grow their business. These added data analytics and modeling capabilities provide our Financial Services segment with another robust marketing offering for our customers.\" \nDuring the remainder of the fourth quarter of 2015, Datamyx is expected to contribute approximately $7 million in revenue and is expected to be approximately $0.06 dilutive to earnings per share, including approximately $0.02 per share for transactions costs.
