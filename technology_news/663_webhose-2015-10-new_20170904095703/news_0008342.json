To meet the increasing demand for mobile bandwidth, especially to support video, the larger mobile operators are in the process of upgrading their LTE networks and densifying the cellular architecture with small cells and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS). \nMobile operators will not simply add more macro cell sites to meet the demand. Instead, they will deploy new sites on rooftops and street poles and other locations that are not a tower. The operators will use a combination of metrocells, remote radio heads and DAS to provide the necessary coverage and capacity. \niG R, a market research consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile industry, forecasts that the LTE market will continue to grow and dominate the U.S. mobile landscape for the foreseeable future. iG R also expects that subsequent versions of LTE and the associated new features will form the basis of new 5G networks in the next few years. To support additional LTE capacity, mobile operators are increasingly refarming 2G spectrum, as well as acquiring additional spectrum resources through auctions and private transactions. \nThe total LTE network build and operating costs are forecast to rise over the next five years, as more consumers use LTE, more devices are added to the networks and more bandwidth is consumed. iG R forecasts the total five-year spend to reach $212 billion. \n\"Mobile operators will be increasingly more creative in where they deploy with LTE network dollars,\" said Iain Gillott, president and founder of iG R. \"This expenditure will include more on solutions that densify the network, thereby increasing the available capacity at a given location. This means more spending on DAS, remote radio heads and other small cell solutions.\" \niG R's new market study, U.S. LTE Network Infrastructure Spending Forecast, 2014-2019 provides a five-year forecast for the LTE infrastructure build investment and network operating costs per operator in the U.S.. It also forecasts the spending split by network component and by macro cell sites, DAS and small cells. The study also provides a detailed status of U.S. mobile operators' LTE networks. \nThe following key questions are addressed in the new research study: How much mobile data will the LTE networks carry in the U.S.? How will the amount of data traffic carried on LTE networks grow in the U.S. in the next five years? What is the forecast for the number of LTE subscribers in the U.S. in the next five years? How much mobile data is each LTE subscriber expected to consume and how does this change? Which operators are investing the most in LTE networks? How much of the LTE network build and operating spending is for macro cell sites, DAS and small cells? What is the impact of densification on LTE spending? How much are U.S. operators investing in LTE both individually and in the aggregate? How big is the LTE infrastructure opportunity in the U.S. in the next five years? What is the share of LTE infrastructure spending on the network components in the next five years? How big are the LTE operating costs in the next five years? How do the network build and operating cost forecasts vary by operator? \nThe information in this market study will be valuable for: Mobile network operators Small cell and DAS OEMs Financial analysts and investors. \nThe new report can be purchased and downloaded directly from iG R's website at www. i GR-inc.com . \nAbout iGR \niG R is a market strategy consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile communications industry.
