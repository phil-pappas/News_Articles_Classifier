Today’s automakers and suppliers want to deliver an in-car experience that keeps drivers connected and informed. An experience where they can leverage a range of devices, services and where drivers can extend their work and their home into their vehicle through the connected car. Software technology is shaping the future of automotive and the user experience is what is in focus. By combining proven components and tools used in the industry into a single offering, The Qt Automotive Suite meets the needs of automotive software solution providers with a ready-made offering. The solution is built on the Qt toolkit which encompasses libraries, tools, hardware adaptation and ready-made components. Qt is already a tried and tested mature tool within the industry powering the IVI systems of millions of cars on the road today. This new automotive development product will make it even easier and faster for OEMs and Tier1’s go to market. Built upon the need of the automotive industry to consolidate an ever growing and complex supply chain, the Qt Automotive Suite aims to unite and simplify the tools and software components needed to create stunning, highly-performing and quickly adaptable IVI user interfaces devices. “When building IVI systems, we see that many automotive manufacturers and providers are facing similar challenges with managing their technical solutions. The Qt Automotive Suite provides readily available components promising productivity and a high level of quality through world-class tools. This solution promises to make automotive development effortless where the UX and hardware and operating system flexibility is at the core, in turn allowing OEMs and Tier1’s concentrate on adding end-user value instead of tackling technical details.” says Petteri Holländer, Head of Product Management for the Qt Company.

Built on top of and aligned with the widely used GENIVI automotive platform architecture and leveraging the cross-platform nature of the Qt technology, there is a significant base of developers ready to take advantage of the new offering. Qt Automotive Suite will be available under a dual-license scheme, both open source and commercial versions. The Qt Company also invites all interested parties to participate in defining related APIs under the Qt Project governance model. “Qt Automotive Suite delivers a modern multi-process architecture enabling stunning fluid 2D and photo-realistic 3D user experiences in combination with cloud services. The dual licensing scheme enables car makers to develop an eco-system of innovation around their IVI offerings – from concept to production. We are proud to be a key contributor to Qt Automotive Suite.” says Alwin Bakkenes, CEO of Pelagicore. “Platform-independent IVI and cluster software is a huge opportunity for the whole automotive industry. KDAB's and Pelagicore's experience with the leading industry platforms, together with the tried and true foundation that is the Qt framework, deliver an opportunity to unify the development of automotive applications, instead of doing them on a project-by-project basis,” says Kalle Dalheimer, CEO of KDAB.
