Reverdia has estimated that these bio-based Desmopan products have reduced carbon impact by around 65% more than petrochemicals products. \nCovestro, formerly known as Bayer MaterialScience, is engaged in manufacturing high-tech polymer materials, and the development of innovative solutions for various daily-used products. \nThe company mainly serves the automotive, electrical and electronics, construction, and sports and leisure industries, and currentlty employs 14,200 people in its 30 production sites across the world. \nIn a separate deal with Polymaker, Covestro recently unveiled a new line of polycarbonate-based 3D printing materials. \nThe first two products in the new line are known as Polymaker PC-Plus and PC-Max.
