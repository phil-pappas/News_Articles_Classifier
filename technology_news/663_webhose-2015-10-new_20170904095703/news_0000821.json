Mark Lykken of the Fargo Police Department. \nNew research by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety says that potentially unsafe mental distractions can last for as long as 27 seconds after using any kind of hands-free technology. \nBut if you think you are safe from these new statistics, Fargo police say think again. \nLykken says, \"Sending text messages, or thinking about what your going to text or what your conversation was can lead you to go down the wrong path and get in a crash.\" \nAAA conducted a phase of their research and looked into mental distraction. Drivers used hands-free technology and attempt to drive at the same time. They found that new hands-free technologies can mentally distract drivers even if their eyes are on the road and their hands are on the wheel. \nLykken continues, \"The new cars now a days, unless you are proficient using the hands free technology, I'd suggest you don't until you can learn how to do it in a safe enviornment.\" \nEven going 25 mph, drivers traveled the length of nearly three football fields during this time. When using the least distracting systems, drivers remained impaired for more than 15 seconds after completing a task. \n\"Technology is a good thing but sometimes it can be overwhelming,\" Lykken adds. \nNow if you want to become more proficient with your hands-free technology in your car, Sgt. Lykken suggests practicing in your driveway or in a parking lot, somewhere where you're not driving your car.
