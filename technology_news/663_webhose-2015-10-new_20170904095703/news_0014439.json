With new biopic \"Steve Jobs\" in theatres soon, we look back at 1999's \"Pirates of Silicon Valley\".\n\"Pirates\" focuses on the heated personal rivalry between Steve Jobs of Apple and Bill Gates of Microsoft, recounting the parallel and often intertwined stories of the two companies and their tempestuous founders. Written and directed by photojournalist and documentary-maker Martyn Burke, the TV movie was based on the book \"Fire in the Valley: The Making of The Personal Computer\" by Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine. It was first shown on TNT in June 1999.\nNoah Wyle, then in the middle of his role as Dr. Carter in \"ER\", plays the hippie-turned-executive Jobs. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is played by Anthony Michael Hall, relegated to TV after his '80s teen movie heyday but soon to have something of a career revival as the lead in \"The Dead Zone\".\n15 surprisingly mean Steve Jobs Quote: s...and...", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEyrivrjAuU"], "published": "2015-10-17T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:20:12.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
