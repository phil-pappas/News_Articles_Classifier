And therefore, the British police have no reason to spend so much money to deploy so many police and vehicles outside the embassy.\" \nHe recalled that Sweden and Ecuador are negotiating what he called an international criminal assistance accord. \nSweden wants this accord finished by the end of the year so it can question Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London. \nPatino said no deadline for the agreement has been set. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:10:28.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
