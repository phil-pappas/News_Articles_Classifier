During the conference, attendees will have the opportunity to meet with today’s top security solution manufacturers. ISONAS will be showcasing its PowerNet™ IP Bridge hardware at booth #407. The PowerNet™ IP Bridge, like the encoder, offers customers using a Wiegand panel system a simple transition path to a Pure IP Access Control solution without a rip and replace. This gives end users the opportunity to convert panel-based access control to a Pure IP solution. Customers can now seamlessly and cost effectively expand legacy systems to operate within an ISONAS Pure IP environment. ISONAS will also be displaying their latest software addition, EasyWeb 2015 . This browser-based software allows users to manage their credentials and monitor access points in real-time across the globe.\nThe Secured Cities Conference will focus on issues that affect public safety and will bring together law enforcement professionals, emergency management, security and government officials to collaborate and discuss real-world solutions. ISONAS has been instrumental in providing Pure IP Access Control Solutions to cities across the globe. This is evident by receiving the prestigious 2014 Security Innovation Award – Municipal Sector, for its work with the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut at the 2014 Secured Cities conference. The City of Bridgeport installation involved integrated security solutions to protect properties throughout the city, including historic Pleasure Beach, a recently re-opened public park with close proximity to many high-target security risks, as well as the city’s 40 public schools.\n“As one of last year’s award winners, we are very excited to be exhibiting at the Secured Cities Conference this year and have the opportunity to showcase our PowerNet™ IP Bridge hardware along with our other Pure IP-based solutions that can help cities across the globe improve safety,” states Rob Mossman, CEO of ISONAS.\nISONAS is continuing to focus its efforts on protecting our cities by unlocking simpler solutions to a Pure IP world.
