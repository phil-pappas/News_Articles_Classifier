More Uber hitches lift on ride-sharing bandwagon \nThe service officially launched on September 15, unveiling tie-ups with McGraw Hill Financial , which will supply financial information from S&P Capital IQ, and News Corp ’s Dow Jones unit, which will provide a live news feed to the platform. \n“I think it speaks for itself,” said Robert Rubino, an early investor in Symphony. “Google is one of the most forward looking companies in the world. It speaks to what we have got started at Symphony if the biggest names in tech are putting money in it, in not an insignificant way.” \nSymphony and Alphabet declined to comment. People familiar with the matter said the deal was yet to be finalised but one confirmed a WSJ.com report that the new funding round would value Symphony at about $650m. \nThrough Google Ventures and Google Capital, the internet company has become one of Silicon Valley’s most active investors, backing companies in a range of industries. An investment in Symphony would mark a departure, revealing an interest in supplying services in the financial markets, a field it has not targeted directly before. \nLate last week Google bought Jibe, a mobile messaging company, as it builds out its own messaging platform. The technology supported by Jibe is aimed at bringing more features to consumers, such as group chat and high resolution pictures, rather than the type of service planned by Symphony. \nGoogle’s investment will add a heavyweight technology name to a line-up of big banks and investment companies, spearheaded by Goldman Sachs . \nMr Rubino hinted at the possibility that other investors would be joining Google. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there are other big players,” he said. \nRegulators were initially wary of Symphony’s claim to encrypt messages between users but the New York State Department of Financial Services struck a deal in September with a group of banks for their data to be stored for seven years. \nDecryption keys for four of the initial consortium of investors — Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank , Credit Suisse and BNY Mellon — will be stored with independent entities. It speaks to what we have got started at Symphony if the biggest names in tech are putting money in it, in not an insignificant way \n- Robert Rubino, Symphony investor \nAt only $15 a month per user, Symphony is a cheaper alternative to the $1,850 per month per user charged by Bloomberg for one of its terminals. \nOthers also competing for Wall Street’s messaging and data business include Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg’s biggest rival, and Money.net, a start-up created by a former Bloomberg executive to offer financial information through a web browser.
