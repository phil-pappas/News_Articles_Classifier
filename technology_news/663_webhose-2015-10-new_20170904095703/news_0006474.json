October 8, 2015 \nMONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — The Montgomery County (Md.) council, on Oct. 6, approved Bill 52-14, which bans the use of pesticides on county-owned and private lawns. More details about Bill 52-14 and related amendments are available here . A press release issued by the Montgomery County Council noted that the county has become “one of the few jurisdictions in the nation to have such restrictions.” Also in the press release, Council President George Leventhal said, “Today’s action is another step in the ongoing effort to make Montgomery County the healthiest, safest county in the country.” More than 600 letters in opposition to the bill were submitted to the council by residents and local businesses, and approximately 100 individuals opposing the bill attended the final vote on Oct. 6. RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment), stated in a press release that Bill 52-14 “takes away many common insect and weed control products frequently used and relied on by residents, such as weed-and-feed lawn products.” Karen Reardon, vice president of public affairs for RISE, worked with residents, local businesses, and professionals to create a shared solution with the council. “Lawmakers have spent nearly two years on a bill that provides no benefit to the citizens of Montgomery County,” said Reardon. “This bill is so extreme that it’s unenforceable. It’s also unnecessary. It puts the community’s health and workers’ livelihoods at risk. The council is going against federal and state regulatory guidance on what is safe and necessary for pest control, and also goes against the opinion of the National Cancer Institute, which says the scientific evidence to support such a ban is not conclusive.” Earlier this year, the Maryland Attorney General advised a general ban on pesticide application is likely preempted by state law. The bill can be vetoed by the county executive within 10 days of Tuesday’s vote.
