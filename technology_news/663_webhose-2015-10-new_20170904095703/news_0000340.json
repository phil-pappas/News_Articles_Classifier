Russell Hickey has become the company's new Implementation Manager, and Jarad Ennis assumed the position of FBA Participant Support Manager. Both men live in Coldwater with their families and are active in the community. They are looking forward to applying their skills and experience to help deliver exceptional human capital management solutions for Infinisource client companies. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140911/145485 \nRuss Hickey has a twenty-year background in small-team leadership, business management, project management, administration and finance. Having graduated from Coldwater High School, Russ went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Hospitality Management from Michigan State. His return to Coldwater found him working in hospitality and other industries, where his positions mainly involved accounting, finance and payroll duties. \"I enjoy guiding teams of people and seeing them take pride in their work. The opportunity to lead a customer service team at Infinisource feels like a great fit.\" \nJarad Ennis utilizes his exceptional communication skills in the areas of customer service and employee motivation. He graduated from Pennsylvania's East Stroudsburg University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and served as Assistant General Manager of a Philadelphia restaurant franchise for about five years. One of Jarad's former supervisors praised his value to the company by telling him: \"If I could clone you, this place would run smoothly every day.\" \nMoving to the Coldwater area in 2002, Jarad was employed by the Branch Intermediate School District, working with high school students with disabilities. His colleagues from the district noted that Jarad always went above and beyond what was expected. He was also nominated in 2015 for CrossFit Coach of the year by national publication SWEAT magazine. Jarad's dedication and discipline will come in very handy in his work at Infinisource. \nRuss and Jarad are joining Infinisource at an especially opportune time, as the company continues to experience rapid growth in Michigan and throughout the country. \nAbout Infinisource, Inc.
