This rugged probe comes in a standard 8” length and features a PRO-Shield to guard against false readings from material buildup on the probe. \nThe wide diameter of the probe increases the surface area for maximum sensitivity and performance. It is suitable for use in temperatures up to 500°F (260°C), making it appropriate for challenging applications such as fly ash or clinker. Because the probe is solid and 1” in diameter, it is resistant to bending and extremely durable. It can be used for low or high level detection in heavy materials such as coal, aggregates, grains, or other materials with a high bulk density. \nLike all BinMaster capacitance probes, the heavy-duty (HD) probe offers fail-safe operation and \"Quick-Set\" calibration. BinMaster capacitance probes provide interference-free operation – working far below the RF level of 9 KHz at just 6 KHz – and will not interfere with two-way radios or other equipment operating in the radio spectrum. \nThe PROCAP I and PROCAP II capacitance probes feature a triple-thread, screw-off cover that allows easy access to internal components and an FDA-recognized powder coat finish. The housing also has dual conduit entries to simplify wiring and installation. A dual time delay feature allows the user to set flexible time delays up to 30 seconds for covered and uncovered conditions. \nAbout BinMaster \nBinMaster is a division of Garner Industries – an ISO 9001:2008 certified company established in 1953 and headquartered in a 75,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.
