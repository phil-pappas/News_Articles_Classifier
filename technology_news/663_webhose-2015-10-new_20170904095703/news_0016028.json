In order to protect prospective sellers, the Realbighits.com portal is secure, restricting access to only prequalified potential buyers. Buyers have a new source for content and ideas that are not available in the public realm. Real Big Hits has now expanded to support distribution of previously broadcast content into new regions and new markets. The new service can meet the needs of creative people or rights owners of any kind to connect with potential buyers or funders through an alternative channel. The company will leverage longstanding industry relationships and its technology to bring both sides together. Real Big Hits founder Wendy Wang commented, “Our mission is to open doors and facilitate opportunities that were previously not available. We are excited to now offer additional revenue streams to the creative community.”\nThe RealBigHits.com platform is built on eMAM technology ( http://www.empressmam.com ). Buyers or sellers may also set up their own sites to produce content, to setup development platforms or contests, or to run web portals with OTT, VOD, subscribers, advertisements, and ecommerce options. The eMAM system is used by leading companies and organizations worldwide to produce, edit, collaborate, share, and distribute content. eMAM will be showcasing its expanded options for multiplatform, multidevice delivery including automated delivery profiles, branded subscriber sites, publishing to Brightcove, Encoding.com, and Katapy, and delivery to Roku, iTunes, Hulu, YouTube, and Netflix. Vice President Chuck Buelow said, “Our customers large and small have been looking for effective solutions to monetize and deliver content to the wide range of devices and platforms. We are excited to offer completely integrated workflow systems to effectively produce, manage, and deliver content.”\nAbout Real Big Hits and eMAM.\nBoth companies are part of the Empress family of closely held companies, with offices in New York, Los Angeles, and India.
