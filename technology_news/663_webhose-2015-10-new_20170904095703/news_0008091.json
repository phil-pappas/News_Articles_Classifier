Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Tech giant Microsoft is due to host a major product event in New York this Wednesday, which will be of big significance to the tech giant as it aims to get consumers excited enough by its mobile devices to bring them on board with Windows 10. However some tech analysts believe even a revamped Nokia Lumia will be too little too late for it to make any significant smartphone market share gains against Apple or Android.\nAt the October 6 announcement in New York Microsoft is expected to unveil the Nokia Lumia 950 and 950 XL. Windows Central reports that the Lumia 950 will come in matte white or black polycarbonate, sport a 20-megapixel rear facing camera and have 32 gigabytes of internal storage which can be expanded to 2 terabytes.\nThe megapixel count far exceeds Apple's latest iPhone 6s, which has 12 megapixels, although this measure does not always equate to increased quality of the images.\nTelsyte senior analyst Alvin Lee said Microsoft's biggest challenge was that 90 per cent of the smartphone market is already held by its competitors.\nLeaked images of the Nokia Lumia 950, which Microsoft is expected to unveil at it event in New York on Wednesday Evleaks \"The smartphone market is also fast maturing with less first-time users which have traditionally been the target for Nokia branded devices,\" he said.\n\"Microsoft needs a hero smartphone product like it has with the Surface in tablets if it's going to make an impact.\"\nWeak performance Telsyte figures revealed that for the first half of 2015 about 170,000 Windows phones were sold in Australia, comprising 5 per cent of all sales.\n \"This relatively weak performance was due to the lack of new handsets and Microsoft's transition away from the Nokia brand,\" Mr Lee said.\n\"Our research late last year showed that 40 per cent of Windows phone users were attracted to the Nokia brand, not necessarily the platform to start with.\"\nTelsyte estimated that Microsoft would sell 300,000 Windows phones in the second half of 2015.\n\"We estimate 4.5 million smartphones will sell in total in the second half of 2015 [in Australia],\" Mr Lee said.\nHe predicted that phablets (screens 5.5 inches or larger) would be a key growth segment for Microsoft.\nNew products on show At the October 6 announcement Microsoft is also likely to introduce new Surface tablets, Microsoft Band 2, Windows 10 on Xbox One, HoloLens and accessories such as speakers and a device known as Continuum that turns smartphones into PCs.\nThe Surface is expected to be released in both a 12 inch and 14 inch version. The 12-inch version is expected not to have a fan and to have an improved battery life.\nThe 14-inch Surface is expected to have up to a terabyte of storage, facial recognition and a 4K display.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:28:31.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
