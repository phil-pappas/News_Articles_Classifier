Twitter cuts 336 jobs from workforce in its struggle for growth, and one employee finds out very abruptly October 14, 2015 8:33am Job cuts ... Twitter has laid off 336 employees, amounting to eight per cent of its global workforce, to streamline the organisation. Picture: AP/Richard Drew Sophie Aubrey, AFP News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nTWITTER has slashed eight per cent of its global workforce as newly returned chief executive Jack Dorsey outlined his “roadmap” to boost users and revenues at the money-losing social network. \nThe cuts — which amount to 336 jobs — come less than a week after Dorsey, one of the Twitter’s co-founders, returned to the top job permanently as part of an effort to revive growth at the San Francisco-based business. \nDorsey tweeted to publicly announce the plan: Made some tough but necessary decisions that enable Twitter to move with greater focus and reinvest in our growth. http://t.co/BWd7EiGAF2 — Jack (@jack) October 13, 2015 \nIn a letter addressed to employees, Dorsey said the company’s executives were streamlining the organisation and “restructuring our workforce so we can put our company on a stronger path to grow”. \nHe said it was “an extremely tough decision” to let go of 336 people — mostly in the product and engineering departments. \n“We are doing this with the utmost respect for each and every person,” he wrote. \n“This isn’t easy. But it is right. The world needs a strong Twitter and this is another step to get there.” Tough decision ... Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey said “this isn’t easy, but it is right.” Picture: AP/Richard Drew Source: AP \nHe said his team was working “to produce a streamlined roadmap” for Twitter and its other services including video-sharing platforms Vine and Periscope. \n“The roadmap is focused on the experiences which will have the greatest impact,” he wrote. \n“The roadmap is also a plan to change how we work, and what we need to do that work.” \nBut for one unlucky ex-employee, the grim news could not have come more abruptly. \nSenior software engineer Bart Teeuwisse revealed on Twitter he found out he had been sacked when he was barred from logging onto his work email account from home. He tweeted the screenshot. I've been impacted by $TWTR 's layoffs. This is how I found out this morning. pic.twitter.com/MbjFwYLcU2 — Bart Teeuwisse (@bartt) October 13, 2015 \nHe then later clarified that Twitter’s HR team had rung him, but the news landed in his voicemail. Evidence of that voicemail message is in his screenshot, received about two hours after an earlier inbox message saying: “You’ve been removed from Twitter”. Please note that @twitter also called to tell personally I was laid off. Found out differently though before I could get that voice mail. — Bart Teeuwisse (@bartt) October 13, 2015 \nThe messaging platform, which has not yet turned a profit, has struggled to expand its user base above 300 million, lagging rival networks such as Instagram and well behind the much larger Facebook. \nTwitter said the lay-offs will result in $10 million to $20 million in severance costs, and total restructuring expenses are estimated at $5 million to $15 million. Copping it hardest ... Workers in the product and engineering teams were most impacted by the cuts.

The stock had jumped above $70 two years ago but slumped this year below the 2013 offering price of $26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:51:08.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
