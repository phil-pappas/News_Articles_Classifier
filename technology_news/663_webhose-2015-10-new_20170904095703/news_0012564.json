The news that he’ll be hosting Saturday Night Live on November 7 was greeted with the kind of attention Trump could only have dreamed of a year ago, when his NBC show The Apprentice was sagging in viewership. In June, the network announced it had cut ties with him due to “derogatory statements regarding immigrants” in his presidential campaign. But on TV, ratings matter more than anything, meaning Trump will come roaring back on NBC, if only for a week.\nRelated Story Is Donald Trump's Campaign 'News' or 'Entertainment'?\nPoliticians appear on the show all the time—Hillary Clinton had a cameo on its 41st season premiere earlier this month—but it’s comparatively rare for them to land a hosting gig while they’re campaigning for office. Jesse Jackson did in 1984, as did Steve Forbes in 1996 and Al Sharpton in 2003. Like Trump, they were all “outsiders” (whether anointed as so by themselves, the media, or both), and their candidacies had an appealing edge of unpredictability. But Trump is a little different in that he’s hosted the show before and been a television personality for years, and has brought that bizarre showman energy to the stump. As it’s progressed, his candidacy has seemed more and more like an SNL sketch—unhinged and surreal. So why not bring the whole thing full circle?\nIt’s worth noting that Trump was a surprisingly good host on his last SNL appearance in 2004. He repeatedly spoofed The Apprentice , met his on-show doppelganger (then played by Darrell Hammond), and was the star of a strangely on-point commercial parody for a restaurant called “Donald Trump’s House of Wings,” complete with catchy jingle set to the Pointer Sisters’ “Jump.” Trump mocked his mid-aughts status as glorified pitchman with relish, donning a gold blazer and tie and introducing the sketch by saying, “Cock-a-doodle-doo, folks, I’m Donald Trump.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcuniversal.com/press-release/nbc-statement-regarding-donald-trump", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jh2n5ki0KE", "http://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-the-long-lost-donald-trumps-house-of-wings-sketch/", "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/256239-trump-i-want-to-plateau"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:35:44.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
