Solid-state hydrogen storage materials, including novel sorbents and high-density hydrides, are the focus of this project because of their unique potential to deliver hydrogen at lower pressures and higher onboard densities. \nFor its part, the Lawrence Livermore team, headed by Brandon Wood , is receiving nearly $1 million per year for three years from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office (link is external) within in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (link is external) . Livermore will focus primarily on the theoretical and computation component of the proposal, with additional contributions from the Lab’s synthetic and characterization expertise.

The total project award is $9 million over three years. \nThe consortium will address the gaps in solid-state hydrogen storage by leveraging recent advances in predictive multiscale modeling, high-resolution in situ characterization and material synthesis. \n“By focusing on the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of storage materials, we will generate fundamental understanding that will accelerate the development of all types of advanced storage materials, including sorbents, metal hydrides and liquid carriers,” Wood said. \nThe Lawrence Livermore team, which includes Wood, Tae Wook Heo, Miguel Morales, Stanimir Bonev, Ted Baumann, Jon Lee and Keith Ray, will use its capabilities in world-class supercomputing facilities (two of the world’s 10 fastest) and petascale materials modeling codes; expertise in large-scale simulation of hydrides and sorbents using quantum and continuum methods; synthesis of lightweight, tunable porous graphene-derived sorbents; and in situ X-ray spectroscopy. \nCombined with materials informatics, this strategy embodies the approach highlighted within the recent Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) Strategic Plan for accelerated materials development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:52:47.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
