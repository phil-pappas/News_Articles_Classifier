Comedy programming will be updated with new content every day, new episodes of exclusive, original comedy each and every week, live-streamed stand-up every month, and curated acquired series and films throughout the year. \nAdditionally, Seeso staff and guests will handpick on demand playlists of recommended content each month. Original shows include shows from leading comedy lights such as Dan Harmon, Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Ian Roberts and Matt Besser. Beyond its originals, Seeso will curate an 'artisanal' selection of great comedy, featuring for the first time ever on SVOD and exclusively on Seeso, Monty Python's Flying Circus, re-mastered to HD for the first time, along with the Python films, and the complete collection of Python documentaries and specials. \nIt will offer a variety of SVOD features, including an auto-play function designed to offer immediate viewing satisfaction. Additionally, a 'hunt while you watch' function will allow viewers to continue watching while they look for what to watch next; and the free-forever front porch, will enable viewers to enjoy a subset of Seeso content, no credit card required, by entering only an email address. \n\"Big streaming services have created a paradox of choice â€“ they're great if you know exactly what to watch, but if you aren't in the middle of a binge, the search can be near endless,\" said Evan Shapiro, executive vice president of NBCUniversal Digital Enterprises explaining what the package will offer. \"By focusing on a specific, yet large niche, and providing a curated experience, we can help viewers find good stuff they might not or cannot find. Seeso is your neighbourhood comedy eatery, with daily specials from a chef you trust.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:02:32.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
