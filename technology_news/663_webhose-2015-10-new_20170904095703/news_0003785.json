AWS IoT, a new platform that makes it easy for devices to connect to AWS services, will expand the connectivity, capabilities and services of Philips’ HealthSuite digital platform, an open IT infrastructure that supports the secure management of data related to a person’s health and lifestyle, as well as large scale clinical data.\n“The digital health revolution and the power of the Internet of Things offer tremendous opportunities to positively transform how care is delivered,” said Jeroen Tas, CEO of Philips Healthcare Informatics, Solutions and Services. “By unleashing data from connected devices and health records, combined with analytics, valuable insights into how we can live and age well can be uncovered. At Philips, we seek to empower consumers to be active participants in their own health. For example, by giving them access to and control over their own health information, making that data more actionable, and by facilitating better collaboration between patients, clinicians and caregivers.”\nHealthSuite IoT Architecture based on AWS Philips is collaborating with world-class technology companies such as AWS, academic medical centers, and patient advocates to achieve global scale and accelerate the realization of connected care across the health continuum from healthy living and prevention, to diagnosis, treatment and home care.\nTo drive this new type of care, Philips developed the HealthSuite digital platform, running on AWS. It securely collects, aggregates and analyzes data from a variety of apps and medical devices and systems such as EMRs. This platform has a secure device cloud that is already managing more than seven million connected devices, sensors and mobile apps – fully embracing the potential of the Internet of Things.\nWith AWS IoT, Philips will enhance its platform with a future proof, secure and scalable IoT environment. The technology will create added value for customers in terms of smarter and more personalized solutions for healthier living and care coordination, and allow products – like medical alert systems and baby monitors – to grow smarter over time.", "external_links": ["http://www.philips.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:01:57.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
