The company said it would carry out a strategic review of government information technology and technical services businesses in two divisions with total estimated 2015 revenue of $6 billion, with the goal of spinning off the units or selling them to outside investors.\nThe sources cautioned that there was no certainty that the RMT option would be chosen, and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.\nLockheed, Booz Allen Hamilton and Leidos declined to comment, while CACI and Science Applications International did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nLockheed makes F-35 fighter jets, naval ships and government satellites. It has been expanding its weapons-making capabilities and moving away from more commoditized services.\nThe programs being reviewed for sale or spinoff are mainly in Lockheed's information systems and government services business, but also include units in its missiles and fire-control division. The programs, which have more than 17,000 employees, have been struggling due to reduced government spending, increased competition and delays in new contracts.\nBethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed has forecast sales at the information systems unit to decline in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2015. It plans to cut about 500 jobs there by mid-November.\nLast month, Lockheed said U.S. officials had approved its acquisition of Black Hawk helicopter maker Sikorsky. That deal is expected to close before the end of the year, possibly by late November.\n(Reporting by Mike Stone in New York; Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:32:23.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
