This is evident from the large investments received by these sectors over the last fiscal year, which account for more than half of the US$8 billion[1] pumped into the country in total.It is ever more critical for companies in these sectors to not only invest and update their technologies, but also level up on knowledge and capabilities to improve productivity and enhance their competitiveness in the Myanmar market and beyond. Backed by successful debuts in 2014, the second editions of Manufacturing Myanmar 2015 and Oil & Gas Myanmar 2015 have gathered a pool of international exhibitors to showcase a wide range of quality machines, tools and equipment that are most appropriate for Myanmar. More than 100 companies from 17 countries and regions are exhibiting at the two events, opened today in Yangon at the Myanmar Event Park from 15 to 17 October. \"Ensuring the continued development and competitiveness of the manufacturing and oil & gas industries is one of the top priorities for the government. Our reform programmes to improve infrastructure and the business environment have been positive for both local and international companies. The Ministry of Industry welcomes the continued efforts of Manufacturing Myanmar and Oil & Gas Myanmar to further enhance local industries. These events are timely and add on to our efforts to advance industry know-how and skills,\" said His Excellency U Nyan Tun Oo, Minister, Ministry of Industry, Energy, Science & Technology, Yangon Regional Government. International showcase of quality manufacturing solutions and best practices Increasing productivity and enhancing efficiency in Myanmar's manufacturing industry is crucial to its continued growth. Manufacturing Myanmar 2015 is the gateway for the country's manufacturers to source for the latest technologies, equipment and services. The show gathers leading brands from around the world in one place, highlighting best-selling products in the region for the Myanmar market. Local manufacturers can source for the latest innovations and equipment to meet their needs, as well as capitalise on networking opportunities to seek and enhance business opportunities. For the international manufacturers, Manufacturing Myanmar provides an in-depth perspective into the country's manufacturing landscape. Prominent returning exhibitors include Assurich Industries, Benign Enterprise, Chii Long Iron Works, Hup Hong Machinery, MG SRL, Olympus, Optical Gaging, Sky Mahar, TRUMPF, Volkel and YG-1 Tools Asia.

This year's Manufacturing Myanmar features four international group pavilions from Germany, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. The biggest group is Singapore, led by the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association (SPETA). \"The manufacturing scene in Myanmar holds plenty of potential, and this is a good time for Singapore companies to gather market information and learn more about the business environment. At the same time, we hope that the technologies we bring in to Myanmar will help the local companies improve their productivity and efficiency. We think there is no better platform to do this than at Manufacturing Myanmar, as our group exhibitors will have the opportunity to network with Myanmar manufacturers and work on prospective business partnerships,\" said Ms. Agnes Wee, Executive Director of SPETA. Catering to needs of Myanmar's oil and gas sector As Myanmar's oil & gas industry continues on its development path, building the supply chain is vital to the sector's growth. Featuring technologies, services and solutions ranging from exploration to production, Oil & Gas Myanmar 2015 provides international exhibitors with a single point of entry to the Myanmar market. Local industry professionals will get to meet with companies that specialise in Exploration and Development, Seismic Data Acquisition, Natural gas distribution, Pipeline Engineering, Engineering Design and Construction. First time exhibitors include Total, Daewoo, 3X Engineering, Ashcroft Instruments, Blue Capital, ESAB Asia Pacific, Hydac Technology, Kingseal, PT. Gamma Buana Persada, Smart Technical Services, Southern Cable, Tencate, Thai Construction & Building Manufacturing and TMK. Kheng Cheong, Mech Marine Engineering, Schulz, Toll Offshore Petroleum Services, Wartsila and WNA Control and Automation are some of the returning exhibitors. ESAB, a world leader in welding and cutting solutions, will be highlighting its welding equipment and consumables for Myanmar's oil & gas sector for the first time. Commenting on their participation, Mr. Victor Toh, Channel Sales Director Asia said, \"Myanmar presents an exciting opportunity for us to expand our presence in Asia. We foresee real customer needs for our welding and cutting solutions in the oil and gas industry as activities ramp up in the next one to two years. Oil & Gas Myanmar is the ideal platform for us to introduce our products and solutions to this new market, as well as extend our network and partnerships in the country. We strongly believe that with 110 years of experience, ESAB Welding and Cutting Products will meet and exceed customers' expectations in Myanmar and help them address business challenges with confidence.\" Mr. Philip Seah, Managing Director of Assurich Industries, a supplier of machine and tooling technology to the oil and gas, marine, fabrication and manufacturing sector in Myanmar commented, \"Myanmar is a growing market and as with all growth related issues, we have a significant sense of confidence and belief that the investment we put in will produce the desired results in future. We see business in Myanmar as a long term venture and we are optimistic that the investment climate will be favourable to Myanmar. We continue to return to Oil & Gas Myanmar because it is a good platform and presents the business opportunities for Assurich to expand our partnerships and network in Myanmar.\" Addressing the knowledge gap With the high levels of activity expected to hit the oil and gas industry in Myanmar, the need for varied range of technical knowledge in seismic and drilling solutions and services over the next five years is more urgent than ever. In addition, knowledge is also required for areas such as regulation and compliance to logistics and even insurance. The Oil & Gas Myanmar 2015 Conference, held in conjunction with the exhibition, serves to plug the gaps in industry knowledge. Delving deep into topics related to Myanmar's oil and gas industry, the tracks will focus on investment, development and financial aspects of the market. Key highlights include an overview of Myanmar's onshore and offshore markets by speakers from MOGE, and panel discussions on the investment and economic aspects impacting the oil & gas industry. Speakers from GE Oil & Gas, Yoma Strategies, PT Brunei, TOTAL, United Engineering, Sapura Kencana, amongst others, will also be present to share their expertise with local delegates. Facilitating networking opportunities that extend beyond the show floor, the Myanmar Oil & Gas Services Society in conjunction with Oil & Gas Myanmar 2015 will stage a MOGSS Golf Tournament. To be held on 18 October at the Royal Myanmar Golf Club in Nay Pyi Taw, the Tournament aims to facilitate greater interaction between Myanmar's government representatives and a mix of international and local industry players. Ms. Lindy Wee, Chief Executive of organiser Singapore Exhibition Services, commented, \"Both the manufacturing and oil and gas industries represent two key pillars that help push the country into the next phase of industrialisation. At Manufacturing Myanmar and Oil & Gas Myanmar, local companies involved in these sectors will get to acquire new knowledge, level up on their technological capabilities and extend their business partnerships, all of which will help them play a bigger role in Myanmar's path towards economic success.\" [1] The Irrawady: Foreign Investment Soars to Record $8B in 2014-15 Events At A Glance: Date: 15 - 17 October 2015 (Thursday – Saturday) Venue: Myanmar Event Park, Yangon Opening hours: 0900 hrs to 1700 hrs Admission: Business and trade professionals only Oil & Gas Myanmar 2015 Exhibition & Conference Date: 15 - 17 October 2015 (Thursday - Saturday) Venue: Myanmar Event Park, Yangon Opening hours: 0900 hrs to 1700 hrs Admission: Business and trade professionals only Website: http://ogmyanmar.com/ About Singapore Exhibition Services Pte Ltd Singapore Exhibitions Services organises a portfolio of international tradeshows serving the Communications, Engineering, Machinery and Lifestyle industries.
