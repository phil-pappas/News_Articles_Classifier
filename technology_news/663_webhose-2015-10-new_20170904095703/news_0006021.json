(NYSE: TRV ), will host a Small Business – Big Opportunity symposium in Riverside, California, today, giving special attention to cyber security for small and medium-sized businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration Santa Ana District Office, Small Business California and the Inland Empire Small Business Development Center are partnering with the Travelers Institute on the event. \n“Cyber risks are very real for all businesses, particularly small organizations, which may be considered easy targets by hackers,” said Joan Woodward, President of the Travelers Institute and Executive Vice President of Public Policy at Travelers. “During this National Cyber Security Awareness Month, we are pleased to join our partners and provide information that can help entrepreneurs protect their operations.” \nJohn Farley, Vice President and Practice Leader, Cyber Risk Management Services, Risk Services Division, HUB International, added, “Studies indicate it takes nearly 200 days, on average, to detect an advanced cyber threat – enough time for hackers to do significant damage and access very sensitive data, including trade secrets. This could be enough to shut a small business down.” \nOpening remarks will be given by Rusty Bailey, Mayor of Riverside, and J. Adalberto Quijada, Director, Santa Ana District Office, U.S. Small Business Administration. The keynote address will be delivered by Garner Holt, President of Garner Holt Productions. \nThe event also will feature a panel discussion, “Finding Solutions to Small Business Challenges.” Participants will include: Moderator: Joan Woodward, President, Travelers Institute; Executive Vice President, Public Policy, The Travelers Companies, Inc.
