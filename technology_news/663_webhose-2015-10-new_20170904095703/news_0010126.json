As part of her education through Drexel, Karli was required to participate in a 6-month Co-Op internship in her field with a small Interior Design firm located in Orlando, FL.\nMs. Kronmiller had part-time availability and was chosen for the Ashford Global internship where she dedicated two days each week to the program. She used her experience in several software platforms including Microsoft® Office, Adobe® Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to enable Ashford Global to enrich and market its new brand as Ashford Global Training and Consulting. Efforts were also focused on creating the recently released Consulting and Training Specialist (CATS) Campaign .\n“Graphic design is a passion of mine and my Ashford Global experience allowed me to explore branding, logo design, brochure making, and more. Through development of the CATS marketing campaign, I also got to dip my feet into commercial cinematography and editing through iMovie. I quickly realized I didn’t have to be an IT specialist to work for Ashford Global! Overall, I enjoyed my experience and was happy to utilize my design skills in real world applications!” said Ms. Kronmiller.\nTo find out more information about the Ashford Global Training and Consulting internship or learn more about Ashford Global’s training and consulting offerings please visit https://www.ashfordglobalit.com/.\nAbout Ashford Global Training and Consulting\nAshford Global offers a wide range of online courses and training seminars that focus on technology skills development, IT security and business technology .
