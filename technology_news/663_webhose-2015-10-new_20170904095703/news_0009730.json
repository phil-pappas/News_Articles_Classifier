Very much out of favor in 2012 over his courtship of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader habitually on a collision course with Beijing, Cameron has now moved up comprehensively in the friendship stakes — all part of a determined U.K. government bid to woo Chinese trade and investment.\nIn a Chinese TV interview at the end of last week, Cameron attempted to deflect complaints that Britain is kowtowing to China. “We see no conflict with having that very special relationship, with wanting to be a strong partner for China as the Chinese economy continues to grow and China emerges as an enormous world power.”\nWhat's Dragging China's Economy Down (1:09) China’s economy decelerated to its slowest pace since the global financial crisis, adding to concerns about the global economic outlook. The WSJ's Alex Frangos talks about three things you need to know.

Yet these links are becoming relatively less important as a result of weak economic growth on the Continent. They would be further damaged if Britain leaves the EU under the planned referendum in 2016 or 2017. China represents a useful hedge against such eventualities.\n• As China intensifies efforts to internationalize its currency, the City of London will benefit from increased trading and transaction volumes.\nThe Beijing authorities look set to issue government debt in renminbi in London, marking out the U.K. as the first overseas financial center where China opens a sovereign-debt market. The British government, which has been criticized for turning a blind eye to imports of cheap Chinese steel that are costing thousands of jobs in the U.K. steel industry, may however be accused of valuing City financial employment higher than that in the mainly Northern steel sector.\n• The green light for Chinese investment in London and across British infrastructure has positive repercussions for inward flows by other large state and private-sector investment agencies, whether from Asia, Europe or North America.\nSome foreign sovereign funds and pension companies have been irked by changes in U.K. government regulations affecting investment pricing in fields like utilities and airports. Yet London’s open-door policies toward international sovereign funds go back many years before the Cameron administration.\n• Chinese multibillion-pound investment in Britain’s next generation of nuclear power stations , which has attracted controversy on security grounds, is part of a decades-long chronicle of U.K. retreat from home-grown nuclear technology. China National Nuclear Corp. and China General Nuclear Power Group are expected to take minority stakes in Hinkley Point C, a nuclear plant in southwest England, with EDF, the French state-controlled utility, the main investor.\n• British intelligence officials are seeking assurances from China that Beijing’s nuclear involvement — which sets new standards in China’s relations in sensitive technology with Western countries — will not give China a perilous strategic hold over the U.K. at a time of international tension, for example, in Sino-U.S. or Sino-Japanese relations. In essence, this is a similar dilemma for the U.K. authorities as that already posed to the U.S. by China’s large holdings (which it is now seeking to diminish) of U.S. Treasury bonds.\n• Like other international central banks, the People’s Bank of China appears in recent years to have extended holdings of sterling GBPUSD, +0.2850% , now the world’s third most important reserve currency, a long way behind the dollar DXY, +0.30% and the euro EURUSD, -0.3172% , but ahead of the yen USDJPY, -0.01% (out of favor in China).\nThis reflects relatively high interest rates on U.K. investments and generally favorable assessment of U.K. economic prospects. The U.K. Treasury has no overt policy on sterling’s use as a reserve currency, but officials probably regard Chinese interest in acquiring sterling as on the whole a positive development.\n• Behind the U.K.’s courtship of China — and willingness to sidestep international complaints that it is ignoring China’s blemishes in human rights — may lie a U.K. exercise in historical atonement.\nMany years of complaints by Chinese officials and scholars that Britain’s imperial trade practices in the 19th century turned millions of Chinese citizens into opium addicts — and led to two wars — may be at last producing an effect, by lowering British propensity to intervene in what the Chinese consider internal affairs.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-courtship-of-china-draws-criticism-1445203943", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/david-cameron-dismisses-risk-of-rift-with-us-over-china", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-price-of-friendship-1444938945"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:11:51.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
