Jerry Brown has signed legislation that requires California to phase out the use of microscopic beads in personal care products sold in the state starting in 2020 to protect fish and wildlife. \nPrevious versions of the ban passed the Assembly but failed in the Senate. Republicans say late amendments to the measure prompted many business critics to drop their opposition to California joining several other states in eliminating the so-called microbeads. \nThe exfoliating beads found in soap, toothpaste and body washes are so small that they are showing up in the bodies of fish and other wildlife after passing through water filtration systems without disintegrating. \nA number of companies are replacing microbeads with natural substances such as ground-up fruit pits. California becomes first US state to ban plastic bags September 30, 2014 \nCalifornia became the first US state Tuesday to ban single-use plastic bags, as Governor Jerry Brown signed the measure into law. Ban on microbeads offers best chance to protect oceans, aquatic species September 16, 2015 \nAn outright ban on the common use of plastic \"microbeads\" from products that enter wastewater is the best way to protect water quality, wildlife, and resources used by people, a group of conservation scientists suggest in ... Billions of pieces of tiny plastic litter found in San Francisco Bay September 22, 2015 \nSan Francisco Bay is contaminated with widespread pollution from billions of tiny pieces of plastic in greater concentrations than the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay and other major U.S. bodies of water, according to a groundbreaking ... Recommended for you Study restores consensus after controversial 2014 paper questioned direct effects of climate change October 8, 2015 \nAn international research team led by UCLA life scientists has, for the first time, quantified the direct influence of climate on the growth of ecosystems around the globe. New study indicates Earth's inner core was formed 1 - 1.5 billion years ago October 7, 2015 \nThere have been many estimates for when the earth's inner core was formed, but scientists from the University of Liverpool have used new data which indicates that the Earth's inner core was formed 1 - 1.5 billion years ago ... History shows more big wildfires likely as climate warms October 5, 2015 \nThe history of wildfires over the past 2,000 years in a northern Colorado mountain range indicates that large fires will continue to increase as a result of a warming climate, according to new study led by a University of ... The warmer the higher: Sea-level rise from Filchner-Ronne ice in Antarctica October 5, 2015 \nThe more ice is melted of the Antarctic Filchner-Ronne shelf, the more ice flows into the ocean and the more the region contributes to global sea-level rise. While this might seem obvious, it is no matter of course for the ...
