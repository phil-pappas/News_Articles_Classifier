Working with NNS we have done a tremendous amount of work up [on the flight deck] and achieved a tremendous amount of success in maintaining our timeline.\" \nIn May, NNS installed the covers for catapult one on the flight deck. \nThe catapult covers bridge the trough in order to deliver a smooth, continuous flight deck, and also offers support for the shuttle that launches aircraft. \nIn another development, the shipbuilder reinstalled the AN/SPS-48 primary air search radar antenna on the aircraft carrier. \nImage: USS Abraham Lincoln is the fifth ship of the Nimitz-class to undergo an RCOH.
