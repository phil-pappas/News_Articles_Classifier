ANN ARBOR Mich. - Oct. 11 2015 - PRLog -- Two new LCD display soldering stations provide wide temperature ranges and ESD-safe reliability for use with SMT components audio equipment and radio-controlled devices. Each workbench station from Aven Inc. offers self-contained convenience by incorporating an iron holder tip cleaning and supply storage in compact units. ''These additions to our soldering supplies are designed for electronics engineers repair technicians and hobbyists'' says Mike Shahpurwala president of the precision tool and optical instrument supplier. ''The larger station is suitable for design prototyping limited production PC board repair and other maintenance.''Here''s a summary of the products'' features and benefits: Three-piece Lead-free soldering station: This three-piece digital set has a blue-backlit LCD display for easy temperature reading. The ceramic heat exchange system has a range of 160-480 degrees Celsius (320-900 Fahrenheit) regulated by a microprocessor to assure precision. The slim iron which has a rubber grip and comes with a replaceable pointed tip goes from room temperature to 350 Celsius in about 30 seconds. The 60-watt tool with a four-foot cord nests safely in a secure holder between uses. That detached storage stand has a coiled brass cleaner and recessed area for removing tip debris as well as a pull-out sponge tray. Portable soldering station: This compact set weighing less than two pounds uses minimal bench space and can be rotated easily among work stations. The 30-watt iron has a rubber grip pencil-style tip and four-foot power cord. It''s stored atop the ceramic heater in a holder with safety guard. That unit also has a LCD display with blue backlight plus a mini-drawer for extra tips and parts. The temperature range is 160-550 degrees Celsius (320-1020 Fahrenheit). Five styles of replacement tips including chisel conical and knife choices are available at nominal cost. ''ESD safety is a critical advantage of Aven''s new models'' notes Shahpurwala. ''Static discharge while soldering can cause device failure or undermine the reliable lifespan of delicate electronics.'' The Michigan-based company also offers lead-free or regular solder in rolls and tubes a 550-watt soldering pot tool kits an adjustable circuit board holder and desoldering wicks and pumps.
