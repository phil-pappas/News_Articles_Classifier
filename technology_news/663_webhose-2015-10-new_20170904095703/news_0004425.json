The most visible progress since then has been in the realm of environmental protection.\nThe plan announced after two years of work with the U.S -based Environmental Defense Fund commits Cuba to recording shark catches by fishing vessels. It will also eventually implement stricter rules to limit shark fishing and protect shark nurseries.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:41:31.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
