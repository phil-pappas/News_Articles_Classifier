(Flickr/Forgotten Fotos) NEW YORK (AP) - Areas of Ellis Island not included on regular tours can now be visited in a virtual tour there. The tour includes the hospital complex where immigrants with illnesses were treated before being allowed to enter the U.S. The 22-building site housed wards to treat contagious diseases, assess mental conditions and provide care for expectant women.\nThe National Parks Service launched the virtual tour of the south side of Ellis Island on Thursday. The 40 interactive photographs are created from detailed 3-D scans and supplemented with historic images of the same buildings as they once looked.\nThe abandoned hospital and wards have not been restored. The nonprofit Save Ellis Island offers hard-hat tours of the area that require reservations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:38:54.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
