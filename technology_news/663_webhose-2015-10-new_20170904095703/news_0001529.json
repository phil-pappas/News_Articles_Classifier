The world's most populous nation will boost the share of non-fossil fuel in its primary energy consumption from 11.2 percent in 2014 to 20 percent, and increase the volume of CO2-absorbing forest stock by about 4.5 billion cubic metres. \n2) United States - 15.5 percent of GHG \nHas pledged a 26-28 percent reduction in emissions from 2005 levels by 2025. Power plants would cut carbon dioxide pollution by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. \n3) European Union - 10.8 percent of GHG \nThe 28-member bloc intends to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and push for 27 percent targets for renewable energy supply and efficiency gains. Explanation of how permafrost thawing could radically accelerate global warming \n4) India - 6.4 percent of GHG \nPlans to reduce its carbon intensity by 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, pledging also to generate 40 percent of its electricity from renewable sources within 15 years. \n5) Russia - 4.9 percent of GHG \nHas mooted a possible cut of 25-30 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels, conditional on the pledges of other \"major emitters\". \n6) Japan - 2.9 percent of GHG \nHas pledged a cut of 26 percent in emissions from 2013 levels by 2030, with nuclear energy—offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster—providing 20-22 percent of electricity by then. Renewable electricity production, including hydro power, would be expanded to 22-24 percent of the total from 11 percent for the year to March 2014. \n7) Brazil - Two percent of GHG \nWith 2005 as a baseline, Brazil has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 37 percent by 2025, and 43 percent by 2030. The country would recover degraded pastures and make available five million hectares (12 million acres) of \"integrated crop-livestock-forest area.\" Scientists warn that if global warming is not limited to an average two degrees Celsius ever-more violent storms, droughts and sea-level rises will bring catastrophe \n8) Iran - 1.6 percent of GHG \nNo pledge to date \n9) Indonesia - 1.6 percent of GHG \nIndonesia has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent by 2030 compared to a \"business-as-usual\" scenario, by boosting forest protection and renewable energy. With financial and other help, the pledge can be raised to 41 percent. \n10) Canada - 1.5 percent of GHG \nCanada will seek to reduce emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. \nSources: Country pledges submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:27:22.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
