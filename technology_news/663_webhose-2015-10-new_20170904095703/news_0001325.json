Apple’s lawyers argued the amount should be a fraction of the $110 million Intel Corp. paid in 2009 to settle an earlier dispute over the same patent.\nThe patent, issued in 1998, relates to the design of a processor chip to improve its performance. The Wisconsin foundation claimed that Apple was using the invention in its A7 processors for the iPhone 5s and iPad. A separate suit was filed in September claiming newer models of the iPhone also use the invention.\nThe federal jury in Madison found Tuesday that Apple infringed the patent and rejected claims it was invalid. The case is now in the second phase, to determine how much Apple should pay. Closing arguments in the case are likely to be heard Friday.\nThe foundation argues that it’s entitled to about $2.74 for each device, which it said is based on the contribution to the value of Apple’s integrated circuits. Apple contends the figure is closer to the 7 cents per unit that Intel paid.\nThe Intel settlement was based on 1.5 billion processors sold while Apple has sold 150 million, Apple’s lawyer, William Lee of WilmerHale, told the jury. The partial transcript doesn’t include the exact amount Apple contends is fair.\nSignificant Advancement The university claimed that its invention marked a significant advancement in chip design to increase speed and efficiency. Apple argued that it was one of about 70 that covered the specific technology to select the order of processing, including one the iPhone maker received.\nApple asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the patent. The agency in April denied that request, saying the Cupertino, California-based company hadn’t shown it was likely to win the challenge.\nThe Wisconsin foundation, which gets licensing fees for things like drug, plant and computer research, received $178 million in income from 2012 to 2014, according to a survey of schools by the Association of University Technology Managers. Some of the money is returned to the inventors, who can be faculty, staff or students at the Madison campus.\nThe case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc., 14-62, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin (Madison).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:57:35.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
