And, sadly, there is no denial that they are loved for their space and style, rather than old fashioned off-road capability. Now they carry dogs and shopping and some of them do not even have all wheel drive anymore. And as their style has defeated the original purpose, they are evolving into something rather interesting. Now legendary SUV manufacturer Land Rover is testing its new Range Rover Evoque Convertible. Range Rover Evoque Convertible may look like just a tarmac toy, but engineers ensure that customers receive all the off-road capability they expect from the luxury brand. They say it is world’s first luxury compact SUV convertible. Image credit: newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com \nEven though idea of convertible SUV seems to be something of a gimmick or a statement of fashion, this one actually will have impressive off road capability. In fact, brand is already saying that the new Range Rover Evoque Convertible is going to be the most capable convertible in the world as now it is going through extreme Land Rover’s all-terrain proving ground before its official debut in November. And it is not just a concept, made to showcase new design he car will go on sale on spring next year. Convertible SUV is not entirely a new thing as some brands were toying with the idea or even sold some models. But it never really caught on. At least, until now, since Range Rover Evoque is a very popular model in the brand’s line-up and feels at home in the city. So it is expected that we will actually see convertible version on the streets. \nAlthough official debut is still ahead, now brand released a video, demonstrating that new Range Rover Evoque Convertible will not be just a tarmac animal. In the video the car, which by the brand I already being called “world’s first luxury compact SUV convertible”, is completing the final phase of testing at Land Rover’s legendary Eastnor Castle estate, in Herefordshire, UK. The aim of this campaign is to show that although it is a convertible, engineers of Land Rover have put tremendous efforts into making it as capable as other cars of the brand are. \nMike Cross, Land Rover Chief Engineer, Vehicle Integrity, said: “Land Rover prides itself on being a class leader when it comes to all-terrain capability and the Evoque Convertible is no different. Thanks to a combination of innovative engineering and the application of advanced technologies, Evoque Convertible will deliver a dynamic and assured SUV experience that has been tested around the world. We call it ‘The Convertible for all Seasons’.” \nThe creation of such car was announced back in at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2015. It is another addition to Range Rover brand model line-up, but it is also a completely new segment. We can only wait and see if other car manufacturers will follow this path and we will see more SUV convertibles. We also do not know for sure if it is going to be such a hit, since it will certainly be more expensive and less practical than usual Range Rover Evoque, which may mean it will not be very popular either. We will see public reaction to the new Range Rover Evoque Convertible on its launching at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:37:42.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
