But her communications may not have been any more secure had she used a State Department email address, judging by years of independent audits that excoriated the department over poor cyber security on Clinton's watch. \nThe State Department's unclassified email system was breached by hackers linked to Russia last year who stole an unspecified number of emails. The hackers hit a department that was among the worst agencies in the federal government at protecting its computer networks while Clinton was secretary from 2009 to 2013, a situation that continued to deteriorate as John Kerry took office, according to independent audits and interviews. \nThe State Department's compliance with federal cybersecurity standards was below average when Clinton took over but grew worse in each year of her tenure, according to an annual report card compiled by the White House based on audits by agency watchdogs. Network security continued to slip after Kerry replaced Clinton in February 2013, and remains substandard, according to the State Department inspector general. \nIn each year from 2011 to 2014, the State Department's poor cybersecurity was identified by the inspector general as a \"significant deficiency\" that put the department's information at risk. The latest assessment is due to be published in a few weeks. \nClinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has apologized for her use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. The FBI is investigating whether her home server was breached. \nState Department officials don't dispute the compliance shortcomings identified in years of internal audits, but argue that the audits paint a distorted picture of their cybersecurity, which they depict as solid and improving. They strongly disagree with the White House ranking that puts them behind most other government agencies. Senior department officials in charge of cybersecurity would speak only on condition of anonymity. \n\"We have a strong cybersecurity program, successfully defeating almost 100 percent of the 4 billion attempted intrusions we experience each year,\" spokesman Mark Toner said. \nTwo successive inspectors general haven't seen it that way. In December 2013, IG Steve Linick issued a \"management alert\" warning top State Department officials that their repeated failure to correct cybersecurity holes was putting the department's data at risk. \nBased on an audit by Linick, State scored a 42 out of 100 on the federal government's latest cybersecurity report card, earning far lower marks than the Office of Personnel Management, which suffered a devastating breach last year. State's scores bested only the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. State Department officials complain the grades are subjective. \nThe hack from Russia was so deep that State's email system had to be cut off from the Internet in March while experts worked to eliminate the infestation. \nClinton approved significant increases in the State Department' information technology budgets while she was secretary, but senior State Department officials say she did not spend much time on the department's cyber vulnerabilities. Her emails show she was aware of State's technological shortcomings, but was focused more on diplomacy. \nClinton's campaign staff did not respond to repeated and detailed requests for comment. \nEmails released by the State Department from her private server show Clinton and her top aides viewed the department's information technology systems as substandard and worked to avoid them. \n\"State's technology is so antiquated that NO ONE uses a State-issued laptop and even high officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly and effectively,\" top Clinton aide Ann-Marie Slaughter wrote in an email to Clinton on June 3, 2011. \nUnder Clinton and Kerry, the State Department's networks were a ripe target for foreign intelligence services, current and former government officials say, echoing the situation at OPM, which last year saw sensitive personnel data on 21 million people stolen by hackers linked to China. \nThe Russian hackers who broke into State's email system also infiltrated networks at the Defense Department and the White House, officials say, and no clear line can be drawn between their success and State's dismal security record. \nBut as with OPM, State's inspector general identified many of the same basic cybersecurity shortcomings year after year, and the department failed to correct them, records show. \nState Department officials say that only email was taken in the hack, and that no sensitive databases were breached. The National Security Agency conducted a classified assessment and deemed the breach significant and severe, two officials say. \nThose officials, and many others interviewed for this story, declined to be quoted because they were not authorized to address the matter publicly. \nAlthough the hacked email system was unclassified, State Department personnel regularly use it communicate very sensitive information. It would be valuable intelligence for a foreign adversary, officials say.
