After a meeting in Geneva this week of WHO's vaccine advisory group, chair Jon Abramson said if health workers can't give children four shots of the vaccine within 18 months \"we're not going to be using it.\"\nThe experts also made recommendations for a new Ebola vaccine, but those are contingent on regulatory approval. Abramson said they provisionally advise vaccinating health workers in an outbreak but noted any regulatory decision is probably several months away.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:52:20.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
