A look at the supplements Odom took 1 / 4 Back to Gallery LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” NBA star Lamar Odom took over-the-counter sexual performance enhancement drugs before he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, authorities say. The Food and Drug Administration , Mayo Clinic and others have warned against taking the supplements, sometimes called herbal Viagra. Here is a look at these products:\nWHAT ARE THEY AND HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM VIAGRA?\nViagra is a prescription medication approved by the FDA and used to treat erectile dysfunction. Herbal Viagra and other over-the-counter sexual performance enhancement products often are marketed as a cheaper alternative to Viagra but are not regulated by the FDA and can be purchased without a prescription. Many are sold online.\n___\nARE THEY DANGEROUS?\nThe FDA has warned that some of these products contain hidden ingredients, including undeclared prescription medications, which can be harmful. The products also can cause dangerously low blood pressure, especially if the user takes nitrate medications for heart problems, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.\n___\nWHAT DID ODOM TAKE?\nThe Nye County Sheriff's Office said he took up to 10 pills over three days. A spokesman for the Love Ranch brothel where Odom was found unconscious said the former NBA star bought Reload and Libimax Plus brand capsules from its shop on site, the latter costing $14.99 each.\n___\nWHAT ELSE WAS IN HIS SYSTEM?\nAuthorities have taken a blood sample to determine if Odom overdosed on drugs or alcohol. The results could take several weeks.\nThe Love Ranch's owner said Odom drank alcohol at the brothel bar, but no one at the house saw him use drugs other than the herbal performance enhancers.\nHowever, Odom told people at the brothel that he did cocaine before he arrived Saturday, Love Ranch spokesman Richard Hunter said.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791818/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791817/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/37/8792022/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791819/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791818/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791819/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/37/8792022/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/34/8791817/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:40:36.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
