Tiger Sheds\nLast year, Tiger Sheds in the UK introduced plans for a zombie-proof log cabin with a delightfully unenforceable 10-year anti-zombie guarantee.\nIt offered to actually provide the kit for a motivated buyer, but nobody showed up with a spare £69,995 (about $113,000, AU$129,000) to fund the project. Now Tiger Sheds is hoping a whole bunch of people will pitch in to make the cabin real.\nTiger turned to Kickstarter with a campaign called \" The World's First Zombie Proof Cabin .\" Again, that's a claim that can't be tested anywhere except in a fictional universe like \"The Walking Dead\" where zombies (excuse me, I mean \"walkers\") roam.\nUnfortunately, none of the pledge slots will get you a zombie-proof cabin in your backyard. The project is in conjunction with Zombie Infection , a UK zombie survival experience company. The idea is to build the Tiger Sheds cabin on Zombie Infection property and bring customers in to battle zombies in heart-thumping fashion. A £60 pledge (roughly $95, AU$130) gets you a preview tour of the infection site and cabin. A £200 pledge ($310, AU$425) gets you a couple of tickets for a special launch night event. Pricier pledges involve overnight zombie events.\nEverything you need to zombie-proof your...", "external_links": ["https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1824039043/the-worlds-first-zombie-proof-cabin", "http://www.tigersheds.com/", "http://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/14/6b86e04f-0c08-465e-b932-0ed982a51fb0/resize/570xauto/60a4c2f3adc613b151cf6ab5c8342361/zombiecabin.jpg", "http://zombieinfection.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:14:59.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
