Meetings and events planners can organise with staff and volunteers by uploading their roles, shifts and details to the app. The technology also allows meetings and events planners to send out bulk emails, staff to sign up and check in for shifts, provides automatic reminders and updates on schedule changes, recommends replacements for shifts with shortfalls, has a one-tap communication system and filtered broadcasts for targeting specific groups of people.\nThe Canadian based company beat 60 other international entrants whose submissions were judged on innovation, completeness of concept, and the value of the product to the meetings industry.\n“This annual award was created over a decade ago and is the longest running award that recognises technology and innovation in the global meetings industry. We invest heavily to ensure that the winner makes the most of all the benefits attributed to ibtm world as the international platform from which to gain awareness of their product and that includes a range of promotional opportunities plus a live showcase of their product within the ibtm world Innovation Zone on the show floor,” said Graeme Barnett, Senior Exhibition Director of ibtm world.\nThe judging panel, chaired by Corbin Ball, Corbin Ball Associates – Meetings Technology Headquarters included Stefania Conti-Vecchi, Founder and CEO EVENTagist; Michelle Bruno, Bruno Group Signature Events; Christine Fuchs, Founder of the social fox; Ruud Janssen, Founder | co-founder EMG; James Morgan, Founder Event Tech Lab; Paul Hussey, Director at The Conference Doctor and Padraic Gilligan, Managing Partner at SoolNua.\nInitLive was founded in 2013 by Debbie Pinard, Melissa Pinard and Scott Bamford, a mixture of software designers and event planners. InitLive aims to improve the experience for event planners, event staff, volunteers and attendees by providing both a real-time communication system and comprehensive scheduling service in place of excel spreadsheets, emails and walkie-talkies.\nCorbin Ball, Chair of the judging panel, commented, “This product rated highly in all three categories: innovation, the soundness of the business model and the value to the meetings/tradeshow industry. This novel product addresses and streamlines the significant task of managing onsite volunteers and staff for events.”\nDebbie Pinard, Chief Executive of InitLive, commented, “Everyone was extremely pleased to hear the news, including our mentors and investors. We are thrilled that we have this high value opportunity to present our product on stage to a large audience. There is no better way to connect with people than to see InitLive in action.”\nProfessionals interested to learn more about their solutions can visit ibtm world’s Innovation Zone ( www.ibtmworld.com/izone ) where InitLive will feature as one of the Top Innovations showcased this year.
