Are we seeing just a hyper growth phase now? But for right now, AWS is driving the train, and it's going to for the near future,\" Gillis said.\nIn July Amazon, the world's biggest retailer, said customers had ordered 34.4 million items worldwide during the one-day sale for members of its $99 per year Prime subscription service.\nAmazon has consistently recorded strong revenue growth but has put most of it into investments to expand its distribution network, add original media content to Prime, and develop devices such as the Fire smartphone.\nThe company forecast net sales growth of 14 percent to 25 percent, to a range of $33.50 billion and $36.75 billion, for the holiday shopping quarter.\nAnalysts, on average, had been expecting revenue of $35.16 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAmazon reported a profit of $79 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of $437 million, or 95 cents per share, a year ago.\nTotal net sales rose 23.2 percent to $25.36 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected a loss of 13 cents per share on revenue of $24.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAmazon's shares rose to $625 in after-market trading after closing at $563.91 on Thursday.
