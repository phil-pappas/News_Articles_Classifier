Theme areas include architecture, communications, energy, food, materials, medicine, transportation, and water. \nAt least six universities are participating this academic year, including University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), New York University (NYU), the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), School of Visual Arts (SVA), and the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc). \nIn June 2016, the winning teams will be invited to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) to showcase their designs in front of leaders from academia, industry, and design at the Biodesign Summit. \n\"Design plays an integral role in the development of any technology. As the science finds its way into our products, our future designers need a full understanding of the implications, so that in the future when they are asked to design with biology, they do so creatively, thoughtfully, and ethically,\" says Daniel Grushkin , program director of the Biodesign Challenge. \"We firmly believe that university students, working under the guidance of scientists and designers, will show us the way forward with their visions.\" \nTo learn more about the Biodesign Challenge, visit the website at biodesignchallenge.org or contact Alison Irvine at airvine@cutpastegrow.com . \nTo learn more about BIOFABRICATE or to purchase tickets, visit biofabricate.co . \nAbout Biodesign Challenge Biodesign Challenge is a university competition that asks students to envision how biotechnology could be used in the future. By partnering design students with top-tier scientists, Biodesign Challenge provides a platform for envisioning new applications for biology. The participating schools explore biological designs around themes, including architecture, water, food, materials, energy, medicine, and others areas where biological design could make a difference. The winning projects will be displayed at the Biodesign Summit 2016, where internationally eminent speakers from industry and academia will gather at MoMA to celebrate the winners. \nAbout BIOFABRICATE BIOFABRICATE 2015 is the annual summit for the emerging world of grown materials. From yeast and bacteria to mushrooms and mammalian cells, international attendees will discover the disruptive research and companies literally growing the materials of the future. The conference brings together a truly unique and unlikely global audience comprised of designers and scientists, artists and engineers, global brands and startups, investors and policy makers, trend-forecasters and media.
