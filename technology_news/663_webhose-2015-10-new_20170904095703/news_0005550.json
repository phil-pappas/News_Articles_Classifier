Whether it is shipment to the U.S. West Coast or her inland destinations, time-sensitive shippers can now take advantage of the superior transit times and on-time assurance offered by APL’s Eagle Express service.” \nConnectivity at Los Angeles is anticipated to benefit shippers through the discharging of containers via APL’s Global Gateway South. \nContainer volumes from Northeast Asia to the US have grown by almost 4% over last year in the first eight months of 2015, with the rate of East Coast volume growth recently surpassing that of the USWC. \nGreg Howard, CEO of CaroTrans, said: “Asia-Europe is deteriorating and saturated, and Asia-Latin America market conditions have worsened,” he said. “This has redirected NVOs [non vessel operators] to focus on the US. The Asia-U.S. trade is a bigger market with greater volumes and better revenue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:55:53.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
