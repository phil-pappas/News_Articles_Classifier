But, one group called @igersdurban take more than just selfies: their images of Durban are seen around the world. \nSocial media guru Andy Carrie (@andycarrie_on) said he had spearheaded the Durban Instagram community along with Dane Forman (@dane_forman), Dylan Royal (@d_oyal) and Brad Joyce (@bradjoyce86). \n“We were all into photography and loved that Instagram allowed us to share our passion with the world. We joined a global community called @igers, founded by Instagram pioneer Phil Gonalez. \n“Igers (short for Instagrammers) is a community-based group of people passionate about exploring their cities and documenting their journeys through the medium that is Instagram. Nov 1, 2014 at 11:09pm PDT \n“We started @igersdurban because we wanted to show Durban to the world.” \n”Instagram is incredibly powerful. It allows you to share your pictures and videos at the push of a button. \n“Not only is the sharing capability so great, there’s a global network of brands, people and places creating amazing content. \n“We’ve all heard the saying that a picture says a thousands words. Well, Instagram allows you to create a place for you, your brand, your city to showcase just how incredible you are,” he said. \nCarrie said group meetings (Instameets) were important as they bridged the online world with the physical world. \n“We have meets fairly often. \n“I will post details on my Instagram account saying where we will be meeting and what for,” he said. \nThe biggest event was held in Graaff Reinet, when 400 Instagrammers met over the recent Heritage Day weekend for @SouthAfrica’s first national Instameet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:27:05.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
