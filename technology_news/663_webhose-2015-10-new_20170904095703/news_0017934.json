But new cases in the semi-autonomous Chinese city have fuelled public suspicions over cosy links between authorities and business leaders. \nConcerns have also been raised about the role of the Chinese system of personal connections, or \"guanxi\", which greases the wheels of business. \n\"The ICAC has been criticised for dragging its feet over the Donald Tsang case, so it's a way to improve the ICAC's image that they are picking on what the Chinese call the 'big tigers',\" said political analyst Willy Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \n\"But there are still cases pending.\" \nThere are questions over why a complaint lodged with the ICAC against current leader Leung Chun-ying has not progressed, said Lam. \nThat case relates to a payment to Leung of HK$50 million by an Australian firm just before he took office. \nThe fact that the ICAC is overseen by the chief executive has also raised concerns, added Lam, who said any prosecutions would likely have been sanctioned by Beijing. \nChinese President Xi Jinping has launched a wide-ranging anti-corruption drive on the mainland. \n\"One theory is that Beijing wants to demonstrate that it is in charge of Hong Kong... they have decided to come down hard on the former chief executive,\" said Lam. \nSecretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen said there was no political motive. \n\"I can unequivocally clarify there is absolutely no political consideration,\" he told reporters. \n\"We should not view the incident negatively... it shows Hong Kong's existing rule of law and the legal system are still intact,\" he added. \nWhile serving as chief secretary for administration, Hui was Tsang's deputy from 2005 to 2007. \nHe was jailed in December for seven and a half years on a total of five graft charges, making him the highest-ranking official in the city's history to be found guilty of taking bribes. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:38:59.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
