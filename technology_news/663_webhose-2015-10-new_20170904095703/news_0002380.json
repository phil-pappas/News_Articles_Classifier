This prevents the user from missing calls and texts. It saves time and effort when responding to calls and texts. The unit also stops the phone from being dropped or left behind. This reduces the risk of the phone getting damaged, misplaced or stolen. Additionally, the invention provides added peace of mind.\nThe original design was submitted to the Rochester office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
