Rome, it turns out, is not the place to be taken seriously in a tiny glass vehicle.\nDid we command respect on the cobblestone roads of the Eternal City? No, our goldfish bowl-on-wheels drew honks, stares, glares, the attention of a terrifying clown and, finally, a threateningly pincer-like movement from two converging buses…\nJust reliving the most terrifying moment of my hols with a fun gif! #RomeWithGoogle #cantsleepclownlleatme pic.twitter.com/eYpIUzNydE\n— Suchandrik rgh (@SuchandrikaC) October 22, 2015 We were in Rome because Google had invited a group of us to try out their travel-friendly apps, such as Translate , Maps and Photos . While those functions might sound familiar to most of us, they contain lesser-known features that can take the rough edges off an impulsive trip through a new place, or help you curate your memories of the holiday. After all, half the point of travelling is having a story to tell.\nThe car ride was a crash course in using these apps to get us from A to B. We were shown a map with all the stops we needed to make, and saved them to our phones by placing a star on each location in Maps. This meant that we could see the traffic between each point, avoiding jams where the route showed up red.\nDaily Mirror Tiny glass car + cobblestones + angry drivers = TERRIFYING\nThis came in very handy when we encountered one of Rome’s specialities, the randomly-closed road. We had to be guided gently away from the river bank by the soothing tones of Google Maps. The spoken directions enabled Zayna, bravely at the steering wheel to leave the navigation to technology, and concentrate on shooing away the windscreen-washing clowns while skirting round multi-faceted potholes.\nMy role in that car was to document the ride through the clear doors. On my phone, Maps joined forces with Photos to create a timeline of my journey each day, gifting me with a visual holiday journal. The Romans I managed to snap as we whizzed past were as interesting as the ruins, and the guesswork of placing the photos after the event has been removed.\nYou can also use Maps to retrace your steps, thanks to Timeline, which plots your day’s moves on a single line. It enables you to return to a place you spotted earlier, leading you back to that promising-looking gelateria off the beaten track. I took some photos in the beautiful La Casa Del Caffe Tazza D’Oro (84, Via degli Orfani), by the Pantheon, and now have them alongside the address and directions in the app, all in one place. Technology, it’s a wonderful thing.\nDaily Mirror Taking a selfie with chef Fabio Buongianni of Fabiolous Cooking Days\nScrolling back through that first day in Rome, the app tells me we managed to visit the Theatre of Marcellus (with stunning views over Tiber Island), Buco di Roma (to steal a glimpse of the dome of St Peter through a keyhole) and the Pantheon (the most-copied ancient building, set in a lively square), in between coffee stops and emergency u-turns outside the Colosseum. A well-spent day in the City of the Seven Hills, and - bonus - we lived to tell the tale, despite the best efforts of Rome’s bus drivers.\nAfter the cultural highlights, we went in search of the culinary treats, which involved more interaction with Italians and their language than the driving did. This is where Google Translate and Voice Search really came into their own, providing real-time translation.\nPresented with an Italian menu to order dinner at Ristorante Pierluigi , we used Instant On in Google Translate to change the words into English before our eyes, via the camera. It was fascinating - if slightly unnerving - to watch the letters jump about and morph into recognisable words within seconds.\nDaily Mirror Don't worry, 'tiramisu' is the same - and of course you should order it, you're on holiday!\nThe app has its limitations (‘Peacemakers’ Pasta’ anyone?), but it saved at least one vegetarian from ordering the pork. Instant On can also read non-western alphabets, so it's great for visits to China and the Middle East.\nConversations can be started by the Google Translate app. After choosing your languages - English to Italian for us - you press the microphone button, speak into the phone, then hand it to the other person, so that he or she can read the translation into their language. When they speak, the process automatically reverses, and there you are, chatting to the locals!\nThe two kinds of translation aided our market trip the next day, buying supplies ahead of a cooking session with chef Fabio Bongianni, who runs the courses in a stunning apartment on Tiber Island, located in the middle of Rome’s river.\nDaily Mirror \"Vorrei sei melanzane per favore?\" - the local lingo's literally at your fingertips!\nAhead of the class, Fabio walked us around the lovely Trastevere area by the river. We ordered meat, vegetables and fruit from his shopping list, with the assistance of the translation app. Being able to check numbers in the app was especially useful, as they can be hard to follow when you’re not used to the the language.\nUsing the app to speak to shopkeepers and other locals is a much quicker and smoother process than frantically hunting for, then rifling through, a dog-eared phrasebook. Trying the local lingo will always get a better response and, in our case, a few extra balls of burrata.\nPasta-making #RomewithGoogle pic.twitter.com/rLwuhOmQMx\n— Suchandrik rgh (@SuchandrikaC) October 16, 2015\nOnce in the kitchen, Fabio got us making filled pasta (ravioli and tortellini), gnocchetti sardi (small shell-like versions of the dumplings) and lasagne sheets. We ended up with a conga line of pasta so long that it had to be held aloft by eight people round the table, passing it on like a conveyer belt, as Fabio pushed more through the pasta maker. A burst of photographs I took were automatically made into a gif- a moving image that can be posted online.\nYour holiday snaps can also be stitched into collages, stop-motion videos or slideshow stories, so you may share them how you like. How else are you going to inform your Facebook friends, Pinterest pals and Instagram frenemies of what you did on your holidays?\nTravelfile\nHotel: Leon’s Place has doubles from 287 euros, including breakfast.\nDriving: Buzz4tours.com cars cost 35 euros for two hours, 59 euros for 5 hours, 89 euros for 10 hours.\nCooking classes: Fabiolous Cooking Day costs 65 euros a day, including lunch and wine.\nTop tip: Do not try to jump in the Trevi Fountain - the Cavalieri don’t like it at all.
