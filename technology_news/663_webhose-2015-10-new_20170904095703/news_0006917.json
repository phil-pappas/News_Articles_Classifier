Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Dominic White It's almost a month since Tony Abbott was ousted from the Liberal leadership by Malcolm Turnbull but the former Prime Minister may extract some small pleasure from new data that shows he is still beating his arch nemesis when it comes to social media.\nDespite Mr Turnbull's well-known fetish for gadgets and all things webby, he is trailing all three prior Prime Ministers when it comes to \"engagement\", according to BrandData , a social media ranking system for brands and \"influencers\".\nBrandData uses a ranking system for \"engagement events\" – such as a Facebook comment, Retweet or YouTube View – and weights them according to importance for 6500 different Australian brands.\nIts findings for the last month show that Mr Turnbull is trailing Kevin Rudd, Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard – in that order – as Australia's fourth most social-media-engaged politician.\nThat is even though he beats all of them in terms of website, Facebook and Youtube engagement - and is second only to fanatical snapper Mr Rudd on Instagram.\nMr Turnbull's Facebook mixes video and images well, and earns consistent engagement, according to BrandData. His YouTube channel - where you can find his slightly awkward interview with the Bondi Hipsters - is healthy.\nBut it is on Twitter – \"the most crucial channel of the media/political nexus\" – where he's lagging, apparently.\nIf Mr Turnbull wants to topple Abbott again and make it to No. 1, he (or one of his staffers) need to get his Tweets up, says BrandData CEO Georgie Summerhayes.\n \"Twitter is the most dominant channel for Australian politicians in terms of audience size and engagement percentage averages,\" she says.\nMr Turnbull is behind all three former leaders in engagement on Twitter, where his follower count of 456,000 is dwarfed by @MrKRudd's 1.6 million.\nMs Summerhayes says the PM needs to be more \"consistent, regular and accurate\" with his posts.\nBrandData spotted that at the AFL Grand Final earlier this month, Mr Turnbull posted a selfie with Hollywood actor Liam Hemsworth, only to issue a swift correction when he realised that the Hemsworth he'd been pictured with was actually Chris.\nThe perils of social media.", "external_links": ["https://branddata.com/listings/australian-politicians#filter", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy49P8J2YwM", "https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:16:34.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
