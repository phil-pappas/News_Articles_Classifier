The segments who are most likely to pay for a smart home service include males and young adults who are also willing to pay a higher smart home service fee.\nThe most popular smart home wireless sensing products are smart light bulbs, video security cameras and smart thermostats with growing adoption for smart appliances and smoke detectors. After costs, the most important purchasing considerations are whole-home coverage, system integration and a single app interface.\nIf U.S. households adopt smart home wireless sensing services at the levels indicated by the survey, this represents a potential $14 billion market.\nThe survey is part of ON World’s series of reports on Smart Home Wireless Sensor Networks based on surveys and interviews with 2,000+ individuals. These reports cover 20+ product segments for Smart Home Lighting , Safety and Security, Home Energy Management and Smart Appliances sold through the managed services, retail/DIY and professional installer channels. Each report may be purchased separately or as part of a report set.\nMore information and free executive summaries are available from ON World’s website .\nAbout ON World:\nON World ( http://www.onworld.com ) provides global business intelligence on smart technology markets.
