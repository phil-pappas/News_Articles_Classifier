During the following days, guests will be reminded of latino characteristics, food related traditions, and family life. On the last day of the celebration, HablaMexico.com will reveal the anthem of el Día del Corazón Latino: ‘La Gozadera’ by Gente de Zona and Marc Anthony. Everyone will be invited to create their own video of ‘La Gozadera’ that will be included in the official video of the celebration.\nThe mission that el Día del Corazón Latino is trying to achieve is to celebrate latinos worldwide and to emphasize their unicity.
