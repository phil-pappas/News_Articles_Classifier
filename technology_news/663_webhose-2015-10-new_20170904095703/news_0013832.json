A true gem.”\nJacob Ogles of SRQ Magazine: \"Paradise, FL is a film that satisfies, one that connects stunning imagery with a captivating story that produces ample emotional resonancethis is a story about loyalty more than one about addiction or family catastrophe, but the beauty is the film will appeal to those looking for an exploration of human tenacity or a dissection of character flaws.”\nJohn Woodruff of SNN: \"Paradise, FL [is] a treat for festival-goers. The film has the type of loose, free-flowing structure that is a welcome change from the closely focused-grouped world of multiple rewrites that typically dominates screen 10 at the Hollywood 20there’s some real, veritable talent on display here.”\nSkyway Film Festival Artistic Director Joe Restaino, “Paradise, FL is a brilliant independent film that just so happened to be shot in our area. It brings the best out of the talent of the Bradenton and Sarasota film industry. It’s these types of films that push area filmmakers to strive for success and at Skyway we had to bring it back for those who missed it at the Sarasota Film Festival. Even those who may want to see it for a second or third time. It’s that good!”\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038193.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://iphias.com/", "https://twitter.com/RinglingCollege", "https://www.facebook.com/RinglingCollege?fref=ts", "http://www.paradiseflmovie.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13038193.htm", "http://virginiafilmfestival.org/films/paradise-fl/"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:20:57.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
