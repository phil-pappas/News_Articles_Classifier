Dr. Howard A. Rubin, President and CEO, Rubin Worldwide will present his views and moderate the panel discussion. \"There should be no doubt that we are now in a Digital and Technology Economy with dynamics more complex and unknown than in the past \"Information Age,” says Rubin. “The winners in this new economy will be the companies (and even nations) that realize this. And there is no sector for which this is of greater importance than Financial Services.” Distinguished panelists include representatives from Alcatel-Lucent, Compuware, Virtual Clarity, Fidelity Investments, Harvard Management Company, Inc., and Wells Fargo.\nPanel Discussion Overview\nAs a prelude to a panel discussion of how firms have become “masters” of their technology economics — instead of being victims — Howard Rubin will be presenting his annual update from his work on charting the world’s “technology economy” with a special focus on the technology economics of banking and financial services. The “windshear” forces of regulation, innovation, and emerging technology and how those impact the economics and value of technology in our sector will also be addressed. The panel itself will be composed of IT and business leaders that have demonstrated such “mastery” and the participants will engage in a lively discussion covering a range of topics from IT transparency to optimizing costs and value to communicating at the Board level.\nProfile\nFor over 47 years, the Wall Street Technology Association ( http://www.wsta.org ) has provided financial industry technology professionals, vendors, service providers, and consultants forums to learn from and connect with each other.
