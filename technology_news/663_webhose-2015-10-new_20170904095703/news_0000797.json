The acquisition marks the latest expansion to his growing charity network, which already includes Chideo and Prizeo . In unifying three of the top digital fundraising platforms, Wagner has solidified his position as the owner of the largest coalition of charity-based fundraising platforms. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/276916 \nFounded in 2005 by Coppy Holzman, Charitybuzz is a pioneer in philanthropy and the premier on- line charity auction marketplace. Its bidder network is considered the most affluent and philanthropic community in the world. The company will continue to operate as its own entity based in New York City with Holzman overseeing all day-to-day activities. \n\"I am incredibly excited that this new partnership with Charitybuzz means uniting some of the top minds in the philanthropic space to collaborate, instead of compete, and bolster our ability to produce funds and awareness for charities around the world,\" said Wagner . \"Fundraising tools have not yet evolved to meet the demand of issues worldwide or modernized to effectively infiltrate our technology-based society. It's time we disrupt fundraising in a positive way and we are thrilled to take on this endeavor with the Charitybuzz team.\" \nThe acquisition of Charitybuzz is the third major charitable announcement to come from Wagner this year. In early 2015, Wagner launched Chideo --the first and only charity broadcast network-- and this summer, Wagner announced he had acquired Prizeo, a leading charitable 'experiences' platform. This most recent acquisition of Charitybuzz strengthens the charity network's already impressive roster of exclusive content, experiences, celebrities, and charities, all to raise awareness and funds for hundreds of nonprofit organizations across the globe. The three organizations will work together to offer brands, nonprofits, celebrities, and consumers an unparalleled menu of original content, fundraising experiences, events and charitable auctions. \n\"What we've learned from the success of Charitybuzz over the past decade is that there is a mutual desire from celebrities, brands and consumers to expand their commitment to social responsibility and the more opportunities we can provide, the more funds we can raise,\" explained Holzman, CEO of Charitybuzz. \"Todd Wagner's career has proven him to be a force in philanthropic generosity and in creating innovative platforms that resonate with consumers. It's an ideal partnership and we couldn't be more excited about the possibilities we can create by working together.\" Wagner helped pioneer the streaming media landscape in the late 90s as CEO of Broadcast.com before focusing his attention on an array of entertainment companies that he owns with his business partner Mark Cuban, which include 2929 Productions, Magnolia Pictures, and Landmark Theatres. Now, his focus on building out Charitybuzz, Chideo and Prizeo has allowed him to consider how charities and celebrities can leverage this same basic technology and media to bring heightened awareness and support to causes across the world. \nABOUT CHIDEO \nChideo ( chideo.com ) is the first and only charity broadcast network connecting celebrities with their fans in the spirit of driving awareness and raising money for important causes around the world.
