Wal-Mart's stock fell 10%, and the guidance dampened market sentiment for grocery retailers broadly. Grocer Kroger Co. saw its share price shed 3%, one of the biggest single-day drops in two years. Albertsons delayed its IPO in part because of Wal-Mart's woes, a person familiar with the offering said.\nAlso late Wednesday, First Data Corp. priced its IPO below expectations at $16 a share, according to people familiar with the offering. The deal raised $2.56 billion by selling 160 million shares, they said. The payment-processing company had planned to sell 160 million shares between $18 and $20.\n\"This is a very skittish market,\" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, early Wednesday. \"It makes companies wary about whether or not this is the best time to jump in.\"\nNeiman Marcus Group Inc. delayed its IPO until early next year or later as a result of recent stock-market volatility, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.\nWrite to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"CitiGroup Inc\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US1729674242\n 14, 2015 18:35 ET (22:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US1729674242", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:44:03.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
