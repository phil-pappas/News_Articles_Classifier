When the retailer does win the customer, they still have difficulties understanding the omni-channel journey that has occurred, as the vast majority of considered purchases start online. With online sales accounting for nearly 10 percent of total retail sales, it is obvious that retail as a whole is experiencing a digital transformation. This presents a huge opportunity for brick-and-mortar to invest in digital technologies that can enhance the in-store experience by mimicking the best part of e-commerce — convenience. Unfortunately, it is a bit of a process for a retailer to source, vet, qualify, and eventually pilot start-ups. This is where Plug and Play Retail comes in. Plug and Play is a global retail-focused innovation platform based in Silicon Valley. We revolutionize the way brands and retailers engage with the start-up community through a built-out innovation platform. Register Today.
