Basically, if a site did not work previously because of missing HMTL5 video or audio capabilities, chance is quite good that it will work now without issues. \nI have tested the new capabilities on YouTube, Dailymotion, Vimeo and Twitch, and content on all sites played fine after the upgrade. Let us know if sites that you visit regularly work as well now in the latest version of the Vivaldi browser. \nWindows and Mac users can make use of the new capabilities right away while Linux users are asked to install the chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra which is required to add the same capabilities to machines running supported flavors of Linux. \nYou may download the latest Vivaldi snapshot from the official website as well if you don't run it already. Users who have it installed may use the browser's update functionality to download and install the update this way. You find the option under Vivaldi > Help > Check for Updates. \nVivaldi continues to improve the browser; barely a month goes without at least one feature update for the browser. \nThe browser has still not been released as a stable version but it is expected to be released soon. If I had to guess, I'd say that it is likely that Vivaldi will release a stable version of the web browser this year. \nNow You: Have you tried Vivaldi yet?
