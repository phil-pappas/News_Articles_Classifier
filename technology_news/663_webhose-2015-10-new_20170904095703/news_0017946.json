Using the stylus is more convenient, and the battery charges very quickly.\nThe bad : Low-light and indoor shots aren’t as good as they should be. The Note 4 costs significantly more than some other phablets, like the LG G3.\nThe cost : Free with some carriers’ two-year contract, up to $686.\nThe bottom line : The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will thrill anyone who loves a fast phone with a large screen, but it’s best for compulsive scribblers willing to pay a lot for its winning stylus.\nSamsung Galaxy S6 \nCnet rating : 4.5 stars out of 5 \nThe good : The upscale phone’s smooth glass-and-matte-metal body, improved fingerprint reader and convenient new camera shortcut key make it a stunner. The decluttered take on Android 5.0 brings the beauty inside, too.\nThe bad : Longtime fans will bristle at the Galaxy S6’s nonremovable battery and absent expandable storage. The phone has an intensely reflective backing and looks embarrassingly like the iPhone 6. Battery life, while good, falls short of last year’s Galaxy.\nThe cost : $130 with some carriers’ two-year contract, up to $585. \nThe bottom line : Worldly looks and top-notch specs make the impressive, metal Samsung Galaxy S6 the Android phone to beat for 2015.\nHTC One M8 \nCnet rating : 4.5 stars out of 5 \nThe good : This top-flight smartphone’s sumptuous aluminum body makes a beautiful background for its brilliant 5-inch display. It runs on a powerful quad-core processor and Android KitKat, the stereo speakers deliver excellent sound and the depth-sensing camera brings a ton of useful features.\nThe bad : The battery is not user-removable, making it harder to replace once the battery inevitably wears out. The phone’s sealed chassis is not water-resistant, and its photos look less sharp than those of competitors.\nThe cost : Free with some carriers’ two-year contract, up to $700 \nThe bottom line : Elegant style, raw power, and sophisticated features make the HTC One M8 an excellent smartphone choice for anyone but the most exacting photographer.\nLG G Flex 2 \nCnet rating : 4 stars out of 5 \nThe good : This smartphone sports a uniquely immersive and comfortable arched design, a sharp 1080p display, the latest Snapdragon 810 processor and a scratch-resistant coating.\nThe bad : The camera takes muted photos, its battery capacity is smaller than its predecessor and performance can be slow at times.\nThe cost : Free with some carriers’ two-year contract, up to $500\nThe bottom line : No longer just a daring experiment, the G Flex 2 finally has the killer screen and top-of-the-line processor that its bold design deserves.\nThe following Cnet staff members contributed to this report: Brian Bennett , Jessica Dolcourt and Laura K.
