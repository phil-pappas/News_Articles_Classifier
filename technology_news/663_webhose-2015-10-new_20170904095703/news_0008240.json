This exhibition on additive technologies and tool and form-making will be looking to fulfill its promise in becoming the leading international exhibition in the fields of modern product development and manufacturing. \nFormnext 2015 will demonstrate the full scope of possibilities and technologies facilitated by the integration of additive manufacturing and conventional techniques. Those planning to attend can look forward to experiencing the next generation of product development and manufacturing. The event will feature exhibitors representing the global elite in industrial 3D printing, including alphacam , 3D Systems , EnvisionTEC , EOS , HP , Keyence , Prodways , Realizer , Renishaw , Ricoh , Sisma , SLM , and Stratasys – the last of which is planning the largest stand that they have ever had at an exhibition in Europe. Industry luminaries such as Arburg and the laser manufacturer Trumpf will also be on hand at this year's formnext, with the latter set to unveil its new product and technology portfolio for additive metal-component manufacturing. \nMeanwhile, the Dutch company Additive Industries will be using formnext as an opportunity to celebrate the world premiere of its 3D printing system for metals, MetalFAB1 . Other leading companies have also announced the launch of their own innovative products. \"After less than a year of preparation, we can already guarantee that the formnext premiere will be a five-star event,\" declares Sascha Wenzler, Head of Division for formnext at Mesago Messe Frankfurt, the exhibition organiser. \"I have no doubt that we'll be laying a solid foundation for formnext's ongoing development in the years ahead along with our exhibitors, partners, visitors, and the entire industry.\" A top-class conference \nOn all four days of the exhibition and with 30 international speakers, formnext powered by tct will \nhighlight cutting-edge technologies and applications in additive technologies and explain how they are influencing product development and manufacturing. Keynotes will be held by leadingrepresentatives from Audi, EOS, Stratasys, and more. The conference will thus offer real value in the form of both in-depth expertise and unique, first-hand experiences. The entire conference agenda and information on the registration process are available at www.formnext.de/konferenz Product development from A to Z × Expand \nRepresentatives of the various industrial areas of product development will be in attendance at formnext. In the field of tool-making, Audi and numerous other innovative companies will be putting their international expertise on display. Formnext will also feature exhibitors applying a wide range of technologies in realms such as design, materials, standardized component construction, and tool and form-making. Visitors are sure to find the knowledge they need to accelerate their own product development, incorporate the latest innovations into their manufacturing methods, and achieve greater efficiency in the process. Innovative showcases \nAudi will be presenting its unique expertise at formnext in a promising exhibit entitled \"Audi Werkzeugbau\", which will offer exclusive insights into product development in the automotive industry. This showcase will take visitors on a journey through the history of tool-making at Audi up to current production techniques, including the latest trends in product development and a look at Industry 4.0. It will also demonstrate how generative technology is becoming part of tool-making at the company and the opportunities such advances afford. \nIn addition, the importance of choosing the right basic materials for a component will be illustrated at formnext 2015 in a special exhibit called \"From Basic Material to Component\". It will also demonstrate the use of materials for both conventional production (such as injection molding) and additive production processes. With select exhibits and eye-catching examples – from toothbrushes and eyeglass lenses to aircraft parts and brake discs – the showcase will highlight innovative solutions for the future.
