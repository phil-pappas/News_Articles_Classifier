Equipped with a localized graphical user interface, Fluke Calibration’s regional sales manager David Patterson said the new controller/calibrator is easy to operate and maintain.\n“It also has removable pressure modules, which enable users to hot swap them from the panel and only ship individual modules in for calibration, not the entire module,” added Patterson.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Fluke%20Calibration_Screen%20Shot%202015-10-23%20at%2013_49_25(1).png"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:40:39.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
