Mitigating fraud and the losses it causes will continue to be an ongoing battle. It is about solving the different levels and types of fraud one at a time. For the U.S., the recent arrival of EMV chip technology is the first step and solves a major form of fraud - counterfeit cards at the point of sale. It is inevitable that fraudsters will refocus on the weakest link in the payment chain, and from previous EMV case studies, CNP transactions are the next target. \nDuring the three day event (October 26 th – 28 th ), Gemalto is demonstrating the newly launched Dynamic Code Verification (DCV) solution designed to protect against CNP fraud. Visit the Gemalto lounge to see first-hand how DCV is securing eCommerce payments and also the company's \"top of wallet\" card portfolio for banks interested in bringing a unique look and feel to their payment cards. \nHear from Gemalto's Jack Jania, SVP of Strategic Alliances, during his panel \" Fraudsters in Cyberspace: Mitigating the Threat of Card-Not-Present Fraud\" on October 28 th at 12:40 in Marcello Ballroom, Venetian Level 4. \nThe panelists along with Gemalto's Jack Jania will discuss topics including the evolving patterns in fraud, how and what needs to be secured to minimize risk, and the mobile challenge. \nFor more information about Gemalto's presence at Money20/20: http://www.gemalto.com/money2020 . \nAbout Gemalto \nGemalto (Euronext NL0000400653 GTO) is the world leader in digital security , with 2014 annual revenues of €2.5 billion and blue-chip customers in over 180 countries. \nGemalto helps people trust one another in an increasingly connected digital world.
