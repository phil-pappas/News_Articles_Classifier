(together with the Guarantors, the Issuers) announce today that they have listed the following senior notes with the Irish Stock Exchange’s Global Exchange Market: £750,000,000 4.375% Senior Notes due 2029: CUSIP No. U25398 AM7 €500,000,000 2.750% Senior Notes due 2023: CUSIP No. 25459H BJ3 £350,000,000 5.200% Senior Notes due 2033: CUSIP No. 25459HBK0 Guarantors: DIRECTV, LLC; DIRECTV Customer Services, Inc.; DIRECTV Enterprises, LLC; DIRECTV Group Holdings, LLC; DIRECTV Home Services, LLC; DIRECTV Merchandising, Inc.; and LABC Productions, LLC. \nIn light of the new listings, the Issuers intend to voluntarily delist these senior notes from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). \nThese senior notes are being delisted from the NYSE because they are now listed on the Global Exchange Market. As a result, the Issuers’ reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be suspended after this has been completed; however, the indentures under which the senior notes are issued require the Issuers to continue to provide publicly available financial statements and other information. \nIn connection with the delisting, the Issuers intend to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about October 30, 2015, and the Issuers anticipate that the delisting will become effective ten days after the Form 25 has been filed.
