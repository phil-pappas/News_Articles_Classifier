The 10,000-student private Catholic institution in Texas will use the cloud-based learning management system to power its Extended Academic Programs. \nEllucian Brainstorm is designed to help deliver CBE content, manage student and faculty interactions, and meet the reporting requirements of self-paced learning. The platform offers different instructional modes based on students' needs, alternative credit models, personalized learning, social media and collaboration tools, and integrates with student information systems to streamline the registration, financial aid, billing and grading needs of competency-based programs. \nUIW hopes to leverage CBE to drive student success. \"The University of the Incarnate Word is not just another traditional campus. Our unique position allows us to be at the cutting edge of market changes and respond to them quickly,\" said Cyndi Wilson Porter, UIW vice president for extended academic programs. \"We understand that our students today are not like those of yesterday and require new methods of engagement. With Ellucian Brainstorm and CBE, we're pushing to understand what students already know so we can more effectively engage with them.\" About the Author \nAbout the author: Rhea Kelly is executive editor for Campus Technology.
