Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is investigating recent reports that Experian suffered a major data breach in September. Hackers accessed an Experian computer server that housed personal information of over 15 million new T-Mobile applicants who required a credit check for service or device financing during a two-year period from September 1, 2013 through September 16, 2015.

(Photo: Business Wire) \nExperian said, “This was an isolated incident of one server and one client’s data.” But hackers took T-Mobile customer names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdays and ID numbers like a driver’s license, military ID or passport number. These types of critically important information are used to commit fraud or identity theft. \n“I take our customer and prospective customer privacy VERY seriously,” said T-Mobile CEO John Legere. “This is no small issue for us. I do want to assure our customers that neither T-Mobile’s systems nor network were part of this intrusion and this did not involve any payment card numbers or bank account information.” \n“Consumers have a right to expect that the companies they do business with will keep their information safe from criminals who can use this data to commit identity theft and fraud,” said Cari Laufenberg , a member of Keller Rohrback’s nationally recognized complex litigation group. \nWhile it is unclear what hackers have done with the stolen information, this type of information is typically sold on black markets. T-Mobile is offering two years of free credit monitoring through Experian to anyone affected; however, this would require people to provide even more personal information to Experian and trust that it will remain secure. \nIf you are concerned that your personal information was breached and would like to know more about your rights, please contact attorneys Cari Laufenberg or Gretchen Cappio at (800) 776-6044 or via email at consumer@kellerrohrback.com . \nKeller Rohrback is a leader in representing consumer and employee victims of data breaches.
