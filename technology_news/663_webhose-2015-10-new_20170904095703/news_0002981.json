The consumer-price index rose 1.6% in September from a year earlier, compared with a 2% rise in August.\nFutures indicated a 0.1% opening loss for the S&P 500 following Tuesday's small declines, as shares on Wall Street snapped their seven-session winning streak. Changes in futures aren't necessarily reflected in market moves after the opening bell.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was down 0.7% midway through the session, deepening losses from Tuesday.\nMost Asian indexes declined amid fears Beijing would miss its year-end growth target. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.9% lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.7% and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.9%. China's third-quarter growth figures are due for release on Monday.\nChinese markets had initially rallied as the data propped up expectations for new stimulus measures, though the optimism quickly waned.\nThe recent losses come as last week's global stock rally runs out of steam. Although some of the worst fears over the global economy have eased, the latest run of weak Chinese data has reminded investors that a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is likely to hold back growth elsewhere.\n\"Fears of imminent financial catastrophe were overdone. But most people see that the growth capacity of the global economy probably diminished over the summer,\" said Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.\nA lackluster start to the third-quarter corporate earnings season has added to investors' caution, he added.\nAfter U.S. markets closed on Tuesday, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. reported higher third-quarter profits but lower revenue. Intel Corp. said its third-quarter profit fell 6.3% on continued weakness in demand for personal computers. Both companies' shares fell in after-hours trading.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of America Corp. said it swung to a third-quarter profit, after big legal expenses had pushed the bank into the red last year. Other companies reporting Wednesday include BlackRock Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.\nInvestors are looking ahead to the U.S. retail sales report for September and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which is based on anecdotes in the Fed's regional survey of economic conditions.\nIn currencies, the euro rose 0.2% against the dollar to $1.1410, while the dollar was 0.2% lower against the yen at Â¥ 119.49.\nIn commodities, gold prices climbed 0.1% to $1,166.80 a troy ounce.\nBrent crude oil was down 0.3% at $49.53 a barrel.\nWrite to Tommy Stubbington at tommy.stubbington@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 08:05 ET (12:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:38:08.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
