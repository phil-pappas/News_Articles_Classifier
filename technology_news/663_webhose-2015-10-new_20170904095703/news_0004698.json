It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm,\" he said.\nREAD: China: The next space superpower?\nAdvancing astronomy\nIts unprecedented precision will allow astronomers to survey the Milky Way and other galaxies and detect faint pulsars, and the array might also work as a powerful ground station for future space missions.\nAnd, of course, it will advance the search for extraterrestrial signs of life.\nIn July, when NASA discovered an 'earth-like' planet named Kepler-452b there was understandable excitement.\nIt was in the so-called 'Goldilocks zone' -- the right distance from its sun to support an atmosphere and liquid water.\nA side-by-side comparison of Kepler 452-b and Earth (artist's conception). But detecting radio signals -- signs of life -- from the planet is beyond the means of our current instruments. But not for FAST.\nWu Xiangping, director-general of the Chinese Astronomical Society, was bullish about its capabilities. \"It will help us to search for intelligent life outside of the galaxy and explore the origins of the universe,\" he told state media.\nIdeally placed\nConstruction on the FAST project began in 2011 and it is nestled in a natural indentation in Guizhou province's spectacular karst mountains.\nThe remoteness of the location -- meaning minimal interference from other radio signals -- and the region's topography make it an ideal site for a telescope of this kind.\nWhen operational, it will surpass the current largest radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which has a diameter of 305 meters.\nThe current largest single-dish radio telescope, the Arecibo Observatory, Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Great leap forward\nChina's space program has come along in leaps and bounds.\nJUST WATCHED CNN gains exclusive access to China's space city Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nCNN gains exclusive access to China's space city 03:59 In 2003, it became the third nation to put a human into orbit, and since then, Chinese astronauts have walked in space, launched an orbital space lab and sent a lunar probe to the moon.\nAs 2015 unfolds, China is building a heavy-lift rocket, planning a second robotic mission to the moon and constructing a 60-ton space station.\nNicknamed the Sky Eye, the giant observatory is an impressive addition to an already ambitious space program and one which has the ability to change how we see the universe.\nThere are many who think we aren't alone. It's not clear whether FAST will ever find evidence of little green men, but it will allow us to look further than ever before for them.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-small-11.jpg", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-07/23/c_134441260.htm", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008115047-kepler-452b-comparison-with-earth-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150527204436-china-space-city-mckenzie-pkg-00000607-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008114957-arecibo-observatory-peurto-rico-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:25:57.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
