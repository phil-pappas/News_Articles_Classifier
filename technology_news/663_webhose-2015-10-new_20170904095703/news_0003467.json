Haylock, the college's chief technology officer, said the new Jenzabar software will better fit the needs of the unique college in which all 1,800 students are required to both work at the institution and participate in volunteer activities along with their academic programs. \n\"Jenzabar was the only company to present solutions to our unique needs,\" Haylock said. \"It offers us the value that we did not see in our current solution or in other solutions we evaluated.\" \nThe new enterprise resource planning system will allow the university to adopt its elements module by module as it needs them. Jenzabar's new cloud-based application has embedded analytics that can be accessed by administrators anytime anywhere, an enterprise client relationship management system, responsive design and a mobile-first strategy that is intended to be student-friendly with a number of self-service aspects. \n\"Warren Wilson needed a comprehensive and integrated solution, but they also needed an IT partner that understood their unique needs,\" said Jenzabar EX Business Unit Executive Vice President Sam Burgio. \"Jenzabar EX provides a long-term platform that enables the growth and success of the college.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:19:47.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
