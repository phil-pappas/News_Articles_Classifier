(Photo: Scott Olson, Getty Images)\n172 CONNECT 35 TWEET 25 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO — Apple has named James Bell, the former Boeing Co. chief financial officer, to its board.\nBell, whose career at Boeing included a stint in 2005 as chief executive officer, gives the world's most valuable company significant expertise in manufacturing. Google last year added Alan Mulally, former CEO of Ford Motor Co. and senior Boeing executive to its board.\nApple's appointment of a prominent African American businessman whose career at the world's largest airplane manufacturer spanned 38 years is also a significant step in fulfilling Apple CEO Tim Cook's push to diversify the company at all levels.\nAt the time of his retirement, Bell was the highest-ranking executive African American in Boeing history. He was credited with guiding Boeing through turbulent periods.\n\"James brings a wealth of global, financial and industrial experience from his successful career at Boeing,\" Cook said in a statement Thursday.\nBell also sits on the boards of JPMorgan Chase and Dow Chemical.\n\"I am an avid user of Apple products and have a tremendous respect for the company's ability to innovate,\" Bell said in a statement.\nApple said in August that it's making progress in hiring women and underrepresented minorities, recruiting more diverse candidates in the past 12 months than in any previous year, but overall there was little change in the demographics of the company.\nUSA TODAY\nJesse Jackson escalates Silicon Valley diversity campaign\nApple is still overwhelmingly male and white. Some 69% of the company is male and 54% is white. Leadership of the company is 72% male and 63% white. Technical employees are 53% white. Those percentages barely budged since last year.\nApple and other tech companies have come under growing pressure from Rev. Jesse Jackson to bring diversity to their companies, from the board of directors to the rank and file.\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus also traveled to Silicon Valley in August to press tech companies to hire more African Americans and appoint them to their boards.\nUSA TODAY\nBlack lawmakers call for more diversity in Silicon Valley\nThree blacks and one Hispanic sit on the boards of 20 major technology companies, according to a 2014 survey from Rainbow PUSH Coalition. In all, four out of 189 directors are black or Hispanic, the survey found.\n\"We are delighted but not surprised,\" Jackson said in an email. \"Tim Cook has made a wise choice. James Bell is eminently qualified. He has the capacity to serve; he has the experience of running one of the largest companies in the world, Boeing. Our contention has always been that there is no talent deficit, but an opportunity deficit.\"\nJackson says he's starting to see progress from major tech companies. Last month Hewlett-Packard announced it would appoint two African Americans — one each to the new boards that will govern the tech giant after it splits into two companies in November.\n172 CONNECT 35 TWEET 25 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1KOQfM1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58273c144ec248f1df42110b532948508e5ade39/c=0-43-512-726&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792957766046107-Bell.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792957766046107-Bell.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KOQfM1&text=Apple%20names%20retired%20Boeing%20CFO%20James%20Bell%20to%20board&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04b8bec6b09be4c8ec13e127598f748ba87fa9e0/c=170-0-853-683/local/-/media/2015/08/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635748179987404410-Jackson.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1KOQfM1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792957766046107-Bell.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6905f9047115f755f62d1cf11653adbc9d83098a/c=78-0-691-613/local/-/media/2015/08/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635742233375996837-barbaralee.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1KOQfM1&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:39:44.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
