The successful applicant will undertake PhD research in the field of wear and corrosion in hip replacements. \nBackground: Articulating joint replacements represent a medical market exceeding €8 billion per year that is expected to rise as the demographics reflect a more aged population. The faster growth has been observed in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in the primary interventions. The major cause of these revisions is that all joint replacements are prone to wear leading to a loss of implant function. It has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus the failure of these devices still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion is an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome these problems our novel approach is to use a silicon nitride coating in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles that are released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. \nAim: develop and deploy experimental models for the prediction of wear and corrosion within coated bearing systems for use in hip arthroplasty. \nMethods: The focus will be on the whole joint system within a joint simulator and the application of adverse loads to predict wear, corrosion and/or coating delamination under the scenarios defined by the AnyBody technologies modelling environment. The physical description of the surface phenomena will be the key aspect of the project, allowing a prediction of the surface performance to be derived from the local tribological conditions. This will be undertaken for a range of patients and operative parameters to perform patient group predictions of join performance, to ultimately be used in the design and optimisation of a next generation of artificial joints. \nProject start date: As soon as possible \nDuration of funding: 3 Years \nResidency Requirements due to Funding restrictions \nOnly candidates who are EU/UK nationals and have been ordinarily resident in the UK for three years prior to their start date may be considered for this award \nMinimum academic requirements \nUndergraduate \n1 st class or 2:1 Honours Degree (or equivalent) in a Biological Science, or engineering (Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering) discipline \nEnglish language \nIf English is not your first language you must meet the University’s English language requirements: www.leeds.ac.uk/info/125196/admissions/2107/entry_requirements \nHow to apply \nComplete an application form via the following link: www.leeds.ac.uk/info/130206/applying/91/applying_for_research_degrees \nRemember to include the project title in your application Share this PhD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:38:04.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
