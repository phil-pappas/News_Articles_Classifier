The market pulled back somewhat from a sharp rise earlier in the day, but the gains were sufficient to put the Standard & Poor's 500 index back into positive territory for the year following a market swoon in August and September. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,556 as of 12:01 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 11 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,064. The Nasdaq, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, gained 80 points, or 1.6 percent, to 5,000. \nTHE QUOTE: \"The tone of the market has changed from where we were a week ago, or certainly a month ago,\" said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \"There've been a lot of worries out there, and yet there are some very strong tail winds the market can't ignore, and we're seeing that this morning with tech earnings.\" \nTECH WINS: Microsoft, Amazon and Google's parent company Alphabet all notched gains a day after the three tech giants reported surprisingly strong quarterly results.

Alphabet climbed $48.84, or 7.2 percent, to $729.98. \nCHARGING AHEAD: Shares in Capital One Financial rose 7.8 percent.

The stock added $5.86 to $80.80. \nWRONG TUNE: Pandora Media tumbled 32.4 percent after the Internet radio giant reported a loss for the third quarter and gave a weak outlook. The stock lost $6.22 to $12.97. \nFALLING SHORT: Skechers U.S.A. slumped 34.7 percent after the shoe company reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit, but a jump in revenue still disappointed Wall Street. The stock slid $16.02 to $30.17. \nSECTOR VIEW: Half of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 index moved higher, led by technology stocks, up 2.6 percent. Utilities stocks fell the most, down 1.5 percent. \nEUROPEAN ACTION: Stocks rallied for a second day in Europe in anticipation that the European Central Bank may inject more financial support into Europe's ailing economy.
