The two companies announced the joint solution today.\nTango Networks, the enterprise mobility company, and CTI Group, a global provider of carrier-grade software solutions and services that empower organizations through communication analytics, can now enable service providers to offer a broad call recording and analytics package.\nThe mobile call recording (www.tango-networks.com/solutions/wireless-provider-mobile-call-recording/capabilities) of Tango Networks fill out the recording and analytics portfolio for CTI Group, enabling the two companies to help service providers address a growing business market, particularly in industries such as healthcare and financial services.\nThe unmatched advantage of mobile recording (www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vCYG-FW1yQ) using the Tango Networks system is that recording is managed in the provider network and can't be circumvented. This assures that all relevant business calls are recorded and that the recordings stay under a company's complete control. The solution can also record and log text messages, making sure that a company can thoroughly enforce its policies across all communications.\nThe collaborative Tango Networks-CTI Group solution is integrated and does not require that an app be installed on a user’s device, so users don't need to change their normal calling and texting behavior in any way. It works with the user's existing mobile service provider.\nThe cloud-based CTI Group solutions include SmartRecord®, which enables service providers to selectively record any communications on behalf of their corporate customers using a multi-tenant platform designed specifically for secure service provision by the carrier. Its Proteus® product suite is used by companies, institutions, and government agencies to track communications activity and control the operating costs of their communications networks, through functions such as call accounting, cost allocation, client bill-back, analyses of trunk traffic and calling and usage patterns, toll fraud detection, and directory services.\n\"The beauty of the joint CTI Group-Tango Networks solution is that it extends call recording to mobile phones in a way that requires no change in user behavior. That is an important addition to our recording and analytics portfolio,\" said Randy Sorensen, CTI Group Vice President of Global Sales for SmartRecord. \"With mobile phones becoming the dominant means of communication, this will be a valuable offering for service providers.\"\n\"In some industries, recording every call is required. In others, recordings are a matter of policy,\" said Lathan Lewis, Chief Strategy Officer for Tango Networks. \"Because our solution is completely enforceable, compliance is never a concern. And its ease of use, allowing users to communicate as they always have, will definitely appeal to service providers' business customers.\"\nAbout Tango Networks\nTango Networks powers enterprise networks with mobility solutions that make employees more productive and allow them to work more freely.
