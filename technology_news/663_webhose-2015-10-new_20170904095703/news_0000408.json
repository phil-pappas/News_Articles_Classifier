He was asked how he felt about Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos referring -- in a controversial New York Times article -- to Microsoft as a country club.\nBallmer offered a controlled beginning: \"Microsoft's culture is very strong.\" Then he spoke almost as the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers would talk about the Golden State Warriors.\n\"You've got to remember there's intense competition between Microsoft and Amazon,\" he said, referring especially to the fact that both companies are based in Seattle. But then he soared to an aggressive posture: \"I think Amazon is a place where people don't want to work.\"\nThis was clearly a reference to The New York Times article that suggested some Amazon employees cry a lot and the culture is one of continual emotional brutality. (This article was this week rebuffed in robust fashion by Amazon .)\nBallmer wasn't finished: \"Anybody who ever left Microsoft to Amazon, we could count on them coming back within a year or two, because it's not a great place to work to do innovative stuff as an engineer.\"\nMore Technically Incorrect Donald Trump blames intern for retweet insulting Iowa voters HTC defends new handset by reportedly pointing copycat finger at Apple Airbnb's ads tax San Francisco's patience It's true that Redmond has been responsible for innovative things, but sometimes those things are capitalized on by companies other than Microsoft .\nTalking of which, Ballmer was asked about Apple. He admitted that Cupertino has done a great job. He believes, though, that the only competition Apple has left is Microsoft.\n\"No one else is trying to compete with them anymore, really, seriously in hardware,\" he said. \"Who's really going after the Mac? Who's really going after the iPad?\"\nHe described the new Surface Book not as a direct competitor with Mac, but as a \"new category.\"\nPerhaps Ballmer is right that the only companies with real hardware and software imagination are Microsoft and Amazon. The Surface Book is an attractive thing and, under CEO Satya Nadella, Redmond has striven to be far more open in its attitude and its offerings.\nHe has to hope, however, that the Microsoft that he still so clearly loves can develop the cachet -- and therefore attract the appropriate talent -- to truly frighten Apple.\nIt's a little like his own Los Angeles Clippers. They've always seemed one or two players away from truly consistent excellence.
