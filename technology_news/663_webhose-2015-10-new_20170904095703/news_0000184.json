Instead, life had something that was much more sophisticated on a molecular level.”\nComets are remnants from the formation of the solar system, and when their orbit brings them close to the sun they heat up and release gases, creating a dazzling light show.\nWhen Lovejoy, formerly known as as C/2014 Q2, was nearest the sun on January 30 of this year it was releasing water at a rate of 20 tons per second, according to researchers.\nBy analyzing the molecules and how they glow at certain microwave frequencies scientists were able to determine the makeup of the molecules.\n\"The next step is to see if the organic material being found in comets came from the primordial cloud that formed the solar system or if it was created later on, inside the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the young sun,\" said Dominique Bockelée-Morvan from the Paris Observatory, a co-author of the paper.", "external_links": ["http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/researchers-catch-comet-lovejoy-giving-away-alcohol"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:13:12.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
