Requiring an additional monthly fee, Foxtel leveraged its partnerships with HBO and Showtime to offer a wide selection of TV shows, from individual episodes to entire seasons, through the Presto Entertainment portal.\nSince launch, this rollout has continued to expand, with partnerships with NBC and BBC worldwide, among others. Now, Presto is offering exclusive streaming of acclaimed series like Mr. Robot and Aquarius, giving it a distinct point of difference to its rivals.\nThe catch, unfortunately, is that this TV content isn't automatically included in the service's price.\nWhile Foxtel launched Presto at $20 a month for access to movies only, and then halved that rate shortly afterwards, users who want to watch both TV and movies will need to pay $15 a month for a bundled offering, or $10 a month for just TV or just movies.\nThis price premium is a definite disadvantage against newcomer Stan, which charges just $10 a month for arguably a better lineup of content.\nNetflix has a local pricing structure that offers an equivalent product for $8.99, making the $15 Presto price tag slightly harder to swallow.\nOn the upside, Presto hasn't increased the price with the inclusion of HD streams.\nSigning up\nWhen we first reviewed Presto, it was an incredibly frustrating experience to sign up, involving browsers, activation emails and delayed payment detail input.\nThe good news is that Presto has improved the signup process. The bad news is that you can't just download the app on your iOS or Android device and sign up from there – you still need to head to the browser to hand over your details.\nBut once you're in the browser, the signup is relatively painless. You create an account with your name, email and password; move on to creating a PIN, sharing your date of birth and postcode before choosing your plan and then handing over the credit card details.\nThe fact that you get the first month free as a default is nice, although it isn't too hard to come across bundle deals offering anywhere between three and 12 months of access to Presto's library.\nThe technology Make no mistake, Presto is an intuitive and simple-to-use service.\nInitially available via a web browser on a PC or Mac, or via an iPad app, Presto has added support for Android tablets and both Android and iOS phones since launch.\nOfficially, the app supports all Android phone and tablet devices running Android 4.1 and above. The support page does add the caveat that user experience may not be the same across all Android devices, but given the range of Android devices on the market, it's not surprising that Presto can't quality check every single device.\nPresto has also launched on selected Samsung Smart TVs, as well as the soon-to-be-obsolete Telstra T-Box.\nEven better news is the fact that the platform will have an app on the upcoming Telstra TV service, alongside apps from Netflix and Stan, making the Telstra TV the only device to host apps from all three services when it launches.\nBut sadly, that's the extent to which Presto apps are available. Earlier this year, Presto made a reselling deal with Quickflix, which would have seen the number of compatible devices dramatically improve, but the deal was squandered by Quickflix shortly afterwards.\nIn the meantime you're locked to a browser or tablet screen to watch the service, or a TV via Chromecast or Airplay to an Apple TV, but more on that later.\nThe experience\nFrom the web browser side of things, once you've signed into your account, you can access the entire suite of on demand movies and TV shows within a few mouse clicks.\nThe top of the page is made up of your navigation and search bar, allowing you to begin browsing by movies, TV shows or using the search function. A shortcut to your Watchlist sits next to the search function, making it easy to find the shows and movies you've saved for later viewing.\nThere's also a quick link to the Community forums for advice and help using the service (something we had to check a few times during our review, which was a little disheartening).\nJust below the bar is a massive carousel filling up the bulk of your screen and pointing you to the most recent featured content.\nIf you scroll down, you'll see a series of collections, which seems to change fairly regularly. Expect to see things like \"New to Presto\", \"Star packed Adren-a-thon\", \"Animation fixation for kids on vacation\" and other themes along those lines.\nFor a combined subscription, the list of featured content seems to be split between both movies and TV fairly evenly, with between four and six titles on display, and the ability to scroll if the collection has more titles in it.\nHover over any film or TV cover, and you'll see a more detailed synopsis pop up, along with a classification and general film information like runtime and release year, plus a rating from Presto users.\nFrom this window you can select to watch a movie straight away or add it to your watch list for later viewing.\nThe iPad app and Android tablet versions have a similar user experience. Down the left hand panel is a navbar that offers shortcuts to the home page, TV, Movies, your Watchlist, your history and settings.\nBut when you select a movie on the iPad version of the app, instead of getting a rating, Presto offers a selection of films you may also like for Movies, or a rundown of episodes for TV shows.\nBecause of the design of the app on the iPad, there are more options on the screen which makes browsing a bit easier.\nViewers using the Presto phone app will experience the same navigation options as the tablet version, albeit with significantly fewer selectable options on screen at any given time thanks to the limited real estate.\nThere's also a new way to access the Presto service on the big screen now – via the new Telstra TV streaming box.\nWe're still putting the Telstra TV through its paces, but from our early experiences, the experience is fairly clean and responsive. The fact that Presto now streams in HD is very welcome – a look at the first episode of Mr. Robot looks great on 50 inches.", "external_links": ["http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0685-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0685-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0683-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0681-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.beta.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0691-320-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/software/utilities/other-software/foxtel-play-1171983/review", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0684-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0683-650-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1065801/review", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0689-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0689-650-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-apps/abc-iview-for-ios-1231116/review", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0684-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0686-650-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/chromecast-1171126/review", "http://cdn1.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0681-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn4.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0691-650-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/mobile-computing/tablets/foxtel-go-brings-paytv-to-the-ipad-1110625", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/telstra-tv-1307231/review", "http://cdn3.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//art/Streaming%20Services/Presto/Presto%20rev%20update/IMG_0686-320-80.jpg", "http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-apps/entertainment/stan-1281619/review"], "published": "2015-10-23T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:19:00.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
