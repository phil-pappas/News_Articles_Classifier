Bush and served from 2008 until 2013. At present, he is the founder of Paredes Strategies LLC, a consulting practice that advises clients on financial regulation, corporate governance, and compliance as well as public policy and governmental affairs strategy. He also serves as an expert in regulatory enforcement and private litigation disputes involving securities law and corporate law. \n\"The corporate bond marketplace is at an inflection point. It is widely recognized that supply of secondary liquidity has diminished in recent years while during the same period there’s been a significant increase in mutual fund corporate bond assets under management,\" said Paredes. “We need to look to the private sector for innovative solutions, and I’ve been impressed with Electronifie’s team and unique approach. I look forward to playing a role in building on the success the company has experienced so far.” \nBefore becoming an SEC Commissioner, Mr. Paredes was a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis and a professor of business (by courtesy) at Washington University’s Olin Business School. Currently, he is the Distinguished Policy Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School. Paredes is the author of numerous academic articles on financial regulation, corporate governance, innovation and behavioral economics. He also is a co-author (beginning with the 4th edition) of a multi-volume securities regulation treatise with Louis Loss and Joel Seligman entitled Securities Regulation . \nMr. Paredes holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from UC Berkeley and a JD from Yale Law School. \nMr. Kamhi is a veteran of successful startups, including Jamison Capital Partners, a $1.7BN AUM energy and macro-focused hedge fund. He is currently the Chairman and Co-Founder of Life Science Logistics and previously joined Jamison Capital Partners at its inception as the COO and CFO. In addition, Mr. Kamhi has had a diversity of experience in the technology, healthcare and financial industries. In recent years, he has actively invested in several early stage technology and pharmaceutical companies while continuing more than 20 years of both commercial and residential real estate development and management. He previously worked as a financial analyst in the Financial Institutions Group at Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. \nMr. Kamhi earned a BS in Economics, summa cum laude, from the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania. \n“There is a considerable opportunity in the corporate bond space for a company with the right model to play a pivotal role in solving the liquidity crisis,” said Kamhi. “Electronifie’s expertly-crafted model and strong team are what attracted me to the business – first as an investor and now as a Board member.” \nAbout Electronifie \nElectronifie operates an all-to-all anonymous corporate bond trading platform with a focus on deep liquidity and quality execution.
