Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith A professor from the University of New South Wales will head to New York this week to speak at a United Nations event highlighting the deadly threats of artificial intelligence in modern warfare, and call for a ban on autonomous weapons.\nProfessor Toby Walsh has been invited to address a side event at the UN General Assembly's First Committee on International Security and Disarmament, by a group called Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, in which he will seek to influence countries to act upon the ethical and practical concerns arising from rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\nMr Walsh is a professor in artificial intelligence at UNSW, and has also served as scientific director of NICTA, Australia's research centre for Information and communications technology research. He gained global prominence in July when he helped craft an open letter from the Artificial Intelligence community , calling for a ban on autonomous weapons, which gained high profile signatures from such luminaries as Stephen Hawking, Tesla founder Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, MIT professor and Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek and Noam Chomsky.\nLife or death decisions Predator drone's have been used by the US in Afghanistan, but are not yet autonomous. Supplied The group are concerned that technology will imminently be available that will take decision-making about who to kill in a war zone out of the hands of humans, and entrust intelligent robots with life and death decisions. These robots could include armed quadcopters that can search for and eliminate people meeting certain pre-defined criteria, or sentry robots similar to those made by Samsung , which already patrol the demilitarised zone along the border between North and South Korea.\nProfessor Walsh told The Australian Financial Review that the open letter earlier in the year had been a turning point in terms of giving credibility to growing concerns, as aside from the celebrity signatories, 3000 leading AI researchers had also signed. He said that while the UN had been speaking in recent meetings about starting the process of having a ban, it has been dragging its feet in the face of resistance from weapons manufacturers and countries like the United States and Israel, which are the most advanced in researching autonomous weapons.\n\"People think we are talking about Terminator, but really we are talking about much simpler technologies,\" Professor Walsh said.\n\"If you take a predator drone, the sort of thing that is flying over Afghanistan, that is not autonomous yet, there is still a soldier sat in Nevada flying it with a joystick and making the life or death decision. But it would take very little to take the human out of the loop and replace them with a computer.\"\n Professor Walsh said autonomous killing would take humanity across a new moral threshold, and research needed to be banned as soon as possible. He said countries currently leading the field were mistaken if they thought they would retain a strategic advantage for long once weapons were being used, and said that as soon as one country developed the capability to kill autonomously, others would have to follow suit.\n\"It is talked about as the next revolution in warfare after the invention of gunpowder and nuclear bombs ... They would certainly make killing more efficient and history shows us that this has always been a bad thing for mankind,\" Professor Walsh said.\nSci-fi reality He said that autonomous weapons were only a few years away from reality, but that science fiction-style fears about AI breaking its programming and turning on humans were still very far away from being feasible. He said the soon-to-be available weapons were \"stupid AI,\" and should not detract from the positive uses that AI was going to have for society in the near future.\n\"I am an accidental activist actually. I really didn't intend to be doing this at all, but I feel like I have the responsibility to inform people about what the possibilities and risks are. We only have a small window of opportunity to do something about this,\" Professor Walsh said.\n\"We can't just bury our heads in the sand with AI, because the benefits will be immense. The same technology that will go into autonomous weapons will also go into autonomous cars, so the thousand people that die on Australian roads every year will no longer die.\"", "external_links": ["http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons", "http://www.ubergizmo.com/2014/09/samsung-sgr-a1-robot-sentry-is-one-cold-machine/", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:26:28.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
