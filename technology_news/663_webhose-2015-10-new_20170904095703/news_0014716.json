Firms using these services together will have an advantage in speed and knowledge management that lawyers have never possessed before,” said Jack Newton, founder and CEO of Clio. “We’re thrilled to offer this collaboration to our customers.”\nDocket Alarm enables lawyers to find court cases, and provides alerts and immediate document access, as well as providing case outcome analytics. Docket Alarm is linked into several U.S. court systems, including federal district, circuit and bankruptcy courts; the Supreme Court; the International Trade Commission; the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB); and the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), providing access to documents the moment they’re filed.\n“We acquire hundreds of thousands of federal district court decisions per year, about five times as many as Google Scholar,” says founder and CEO Michael Sander, “and because of our tight court integration, it’s always up to date.”\nNow Docket Alarm will sync your cases with Clio, downloading and storing court filings and exhibits automatically. Clio can then push documents to services like Dropbox, so your documents will be accessible from anywhere, automatically.\n“We’re eliminating the boring part of the attorney and paralegal’s job,” said Sander. “Thousands of paralegals spend their day downloading court documents and filing them in various systems.” The cutting-edge software allows paralegals and attorneys to be performing more valuable functions in support of their firm.\nDocket Alarm customers rank among the largest law firms, Fortune 500 companies, and market research and consulting firms. For some, it’s the Docket Alarm analytics that deliver the most value. Docket Alarm analyzes cases, building high-level reports on judges, parties, law firms, or on how certain factors affect a case, reporting the likelihood of success of a particular action.\nMichael Sander is available to talk about the features of Docket Alarm, its new integration with Clio, as well as trends in legal technology and analytics. He will be discussing Docket Alarm and its new Clio partnership with attendees at the Clio Cloud Conference.\nTo sign up for access to Docket Alarm’s legal research platform, Clio users can visit https://www.docketalarm.com/clio .\nAbout Docket Alarm\nDocket Alarm is a full service legal research and analytics platform that offers users a comprehensive research engine, detailed analytics, and advanced docket tracking and litigation alerts delivered directly to your inbox.\nAbout Clio\nClio is a robust law practice management platform that allows attorneys to manage cases and tasks, schedule meetings, track time, send invoices and more, all from one central location.\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nFrank Farrar\nfrank(at)one-400(dot)com\n626.587.5040\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13028381.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.docketalarm.com/clio", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13028381.htm"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:49:22.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
