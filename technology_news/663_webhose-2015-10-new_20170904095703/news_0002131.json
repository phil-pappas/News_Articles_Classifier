Could not subscribe, try again later Eric Pickersgill Eric Pickersgill took these impressive photos - and omitted one important detail \nSmartphones have become such an important part of our lives that hardly a moment goes by that we're not staring into their small, glowing screens. \nA new project from photograher Eric Pickersgill aims to show how dependent we've become on our pocketable mobile computers. \nThe black and white photos show scenes of everydaylife - but the smartphones and tablets have all been taken away. Eric Pickersgill \nThe American photographer says he got the idea for the project - appropriately called 'Removed' - when he spotted a family eating breakfast together in a cafe. \nAll of them, except the mother, were busy playing on their phones. Eric Pickersgill \n“They were all sharing the same physical space however they were engaging with people and content elsewhere,\" Pickersgill told the Evening Standard . \n\"Maybe it was the beautiful light and the mother who wasn’t using a device that made me see the situation as a photograph. Eric Pickersgill \nI didn’t make that picture but it exists in my mind as an image, a very emotionally charged image.” \nIronically, you're probably reading this on a smartphone or tablet.
