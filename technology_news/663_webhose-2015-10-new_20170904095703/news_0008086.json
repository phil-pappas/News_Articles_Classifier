To support these challenges, Earth Networks, which has the world’s largest weather, lightning and greenhouse gas monitoring networks, was competitively selected to deliver a comprehensive Early Warning System that includes reliable and accurate data about current, near medium-term weather conditions via four major subsystems: a current conditions network, a severe weather nowcasting network, a weather forecasting solution and a weather and climate data display system. \nEarth Networks' Early Warning System is designed to strengthen weather infrastructures and reduce the impact of weather-related hazards on communities and economies. The establishment of this Early Warning System will help countries throughout Africa and beyond to mitigate the impact of extreme weather through real-time weather observations, high-resolution forecasts, and proxy weather radar. Earth Networks’ Early Warning System utilizes a cost-effective integrated approach, ensuring timely and accurate delivery of warnings and forecast information at a fraction of the cost of radar. \n“We are honored to have been awarded this long term agreement by UNDP and to play a vital role in helping governments and populations throughout Africa and other countries address the need for advanced detection of approaching severe weather,” said Bob Marshall, founder and chief executive officer Earth Networks. “Today’s announcement is part of our broader efforts to support global regions and nations, including national hydrological and meteorological services (NMHS) by providing the most precise live weather conditions, the most relevant weather reports and the earliest weather warnings to safeguard lives and secure infrastructure.” \nAbout Earth Networks: \nFor 20 years, we have been Taking the Pulse of the Planet® using the world’s largest weather, lightning and greenhouse gas monitoring networks. Our sensors across the planet keep consumers, businesses, and governments informed, updated and alerted. Enterprises such as schools, airports, professional sports teams, utilities and government agencies rely on our early warning solutions to safeguard lives, prepare for weather events, and optimize operations.
