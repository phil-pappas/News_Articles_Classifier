These phases include producing a concept of the device through a sketch or 3D rendering, creating a prototype of the product, designing user interfaces, creating the product packaging, and getting consumer feedback.\nWhen it comes to medical product design, the scrutiny during these phases should be at an optimal level. Since these devices will be used to treat patients, they must be easily used, durable, and regulated. A flaw in the device could bring devastating costs not just financially but to a patient’s health. While all phases are important, there are three aspects of the process that make for a successful medical product design.\n1. Concept Drawings & Renderings\nThe first step in the industrial design process focuses on concept drawings and renderings. This allows immediate visualization of a product. During this process, several designs may be created in an effort to secure the most efficient, aesthetically desirable physical product. Options for this stage include 2D concept drawings, such as a raw sketch or fully detailed piece, or 3D renderings.\nDrawing a 2D concept is easiest for sketching out ideas for components of the device as well as the shape of the device itself. But to really get an idea of the device without creating a prototype, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model is the next necessary step. The 2D drawings can be translated into a CAD model, allowing for a three-dimensional visual of the product to scale.\nWhat is great about this is its ability to simulate the product. In addition to offering a scalable model, the CAD program can render photorealistic shades, identify areas of effects and stress, include marking and switches down to the detail of the actual device, and add representations of user interface displays. The CAD rendering helps in reducing mistakes in design that would be costly in prototyping and production phases.\n2. Prototyping\nSince this device is intended for mass production, it’s necessary to create working prototypes to ensure the device has desirable qualities in weight, size, functionality, or usability. In various stages of the industrial design process, the prototype may not utilize the same materials as the final product, especially if it’s only intended to demonstrate a certain feature of a design. This step is crucial, as it can shorten time from concept to production by avoiding mistakes in design, which in turn saves on costs.\nPrototyping is necessary for all product designs, but perhaps more important when developing medical devices. The product itself is generally costly from the beginning due to the nature of the item, and prototyping can reduce unnecessary costs when it comes time to mass-produce. Because medical devices must adhere to strict FDA regulations, prototypes can help maintain the production timeline as well as ensure that the final product will meet FDA standards.\nThere are several advantages to prototyping, such as functionality check, mistake detection, and materials selection. When prototyping a medical product design, this stage will help iron out weak aspects of the product that could severely affect its functionality or submission to FDA approval. It is also necessary to make sure that the design facilitates use. If it cannot be held comfortably or if the interface isn’t easy, this could result in complications of use and possible complications for the patient.\n3. Trials & FDA Regulations\nWith the prototype now finished and the flaws corrected, it is time for the testing phase. For typical products, such as a cell phone or set of headphones, they may go straight to production phase after a working model is created. But before finished medical product designs are able to enter the mass production phase, it must meet the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) regulations . These regulations are:\nEstablishment registration Medical device listing Premarket Notification 510(k) / Premarket Approval Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Quality System (QS) regulation Labeling requirements Medical Device Reporting (MDR) Often this phase encompasses clinical trials to secure FDA approval. After receiving an IDE, the device can then be used in a clinical study. Once the device has successfully met all requirements, the FDA will give approval. The device can then be mass-manufactured and distributed commercially.\nWhen going into designing a medical product, remember that there are more hurdles to anticipate than a typical industrial design process. These devices are for consumer use, but they are also to save lives. And when that’s at stake, there is no such thing as being too critical.", "external_links": ["http://www.pivotint.com/services/manufacturing/prototyping", "http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:03:33.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
