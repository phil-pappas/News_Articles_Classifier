Building on its integration with Veeam Software, the innovative provider of solutions that deliver Availability for the Modern Data Center™, the new offering streamlines physical backup and recovery activities for managed service providers (MSPs) through LabTech. \nCurrent and future LabTech partners can centralize management and restore activities, including remote bare-metal restore of failed devices , through the LabTech control center. Veeam Endpoint Backup for LabTech enables service providers to take a centralized approach to deploy the endpoint backup agent, configure backup jobs, perform recovery tasks, monitor endpoint backup status and even perform remote bare-metal restores. \n“As the demand for data availability in the modern work environment becomes increasingly 24/7, it is critical for MSPs to have centralized control over their backup capabilities to efficiently and effectively secure their access to data and applications,” said Matt Nachtrab, CEO of LabTech Software. “This integration with Veeam further enhances our partners’ ability to secure customer environments and allows IT solution providers to direct more time to delivering their customers exceptional services.” \nThe new offering simplifies the backup and recovery of Windows-based desktops and laptops, including centralized management through the LabTech console. IT service providers can efficiently deploy and manage backups across numerous endpoints, monitor and report on endpoint backups through LabTech, and perform bare-metal restores of failed devices to save time and money. The solution can be used alone, or in conjunction with Veeam Backup & Replication™ v8 Update 2 or later to write endpoint backups to a Veeam backup repository and optionally to tape or the cloud. \n“Endpoint backup should not be overlooked as a part of enabling availability for the modern data center,” said Mike Waguespack, Vice President, Global Cloud Group at Veeam. “Veeam and LabTech have collaborated to provide MSPs with a complete endpoint backup solution for Windows-based machines. MSPs can now deploy the endpoint backup agent, configure backup jobs, perform recovery tasks, monitor endpoint backup status, and even perform bare-metal restores—all from the LabTech console, helping to streamline management and recovery of endpoints for customers.” \nTo learn more about Veeam Endpoint Backup for LabTech , visit www.LabTechSoftware.com/Veeam or register for the upcoming 30-minute webinar with Veeam on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 3p.m. EDT. \nFollow LabTech Software", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:02:15.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
