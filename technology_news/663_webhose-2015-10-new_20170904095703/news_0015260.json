This drives companies to push one another in new directions and Connected World aims to identify who is leading the way. Today, Connected World magazine announces its 13th annual CW 100 list for 2016, which recognizes the best companies of the evolving IoT (Internet of Things) and sets the precedent of what’s to come. Each company is ranked by the editors of Connected World magazine on its dedication to the advancement of its products and services.\nThe list, which has been compiled annually since 2003, is globally recognized as an accurate snapshot of the market today and a template for future trends.\nThe top five companies on the 2016 CW 100 list are:\nAmazon Cisco Systems Alphabet (Google) Qualcomm General Electric\nAn overview of the 2016 CW 100 is featured in the Oct/Nov 2015 issue of Connected World; however the ranking and in-depth analysis is found exclusively in the new Member Hub online.\nConnected World is now offering an exclusive Member Hub subscription package, providing the complete 2016 CW 100 ranking, which includes a Disruptive Innovation Index. The DI2 will assess each company’s impact on its key markets, multiple markets, as well as other markets in which its innovative technology can be adopted and deployed. Those companies on the low end are not bringing innovative products, applications, and processes to market. Rather these are the companies that are achieving their success through acquisitions, mergers, and buyouts.\n“The DI2 really demonstrates the companies that are transforming the IoT and our analysis recognizes which ones have significant disruptive power even if the company is not considered a primary competitor in those markets. These are the companies that are truly leading the technology charge,” explains Peggy Smedley, editorial director, Connected World magazine.\nFor instance, the 2016 CW 100 companies represent a total of $2.628 trillion in annual sales for the M2M/IoT arena.\nIn addition, the CW 100 will highlight a comparison to the 2015 CW 100 ranking, provide access to company revenue, including public or private status, detailed list of company competitors, comprehensive analysis of acquisitions by company, thorough list of partnerships by company, market predictions, and editorial interpretation and analyses on all the companies from the award-winning editors based on the companies and markets they report every day, including why each company has been selected and who hasn’t, with links to additional articles for further reading.\nFor more information, or to become a member, visit http://connectedworld.com/lists/cw100/wait-theres-more/ . The complete list will be live at 12 noon central time.\nAbout Connected World Magazine\nConnected World is the business and technology publication that provides the intelligence industry titans need and the guidance consumers crave.
