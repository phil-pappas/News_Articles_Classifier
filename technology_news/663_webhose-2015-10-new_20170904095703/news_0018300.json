Related Content 7 things we now know about Pluto \nPeople from Long Island, New York, down to Morehead City, North Carolina, might have seen the launch of the Black Brant IX suborbital rocket. \nThe sounding rocket gets its name from the nautical term \"to sound,\" which means to take measurements. It's an important tool for NASA. During the mission, NASA will test a modified Black Brant sounding rocket motor, launch vehicle and spacecraft systems and sub-payload ejection technologies. \nDuring the sub-payload ejection test, a mixture of the chemicals barium and strontium will release and create blue-green and red vapor clouds. \nThe vapor clouds will be used as tracers during the mission. This will help scientists measure winds in the area between the Earth's atmosphere and space. \nDon't worry though. The barium-strontium mixture used in the mission is a smaller amount than what is seen during a fireworks display during the Fourth of July, according to NASA, and poses no threat to the public. The payload is expected to fall into the ocean after the mission is completed. \nWallops Flight Facility launches about 10 sounding rockets annually from its Virginia-based site.
