The contracts, said Koehler, are short duration, three months, six months or so, by intent. The shorter contracts, he said, allows GSA to negotiate better pricing more often, keeping it closer to the pricing in commercial markets. \nThe function, located on GSA's Advantage homepage, is much like the aisle \"end-cap\" displays at supermarkets, he said, allowing customers to find popular bulk items and pay for them without the work of searching through the entire store for them.
