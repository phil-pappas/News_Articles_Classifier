Voting in Egypt's other 13 provinces, including Cairo, will take place next month.\nFinal results are scheduled to be announced in December and the 596-seat chamber is expected to hold its inaugural session later in the month, thus completing a three-phase political roadmap announced by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi when, as military chief, he ousted Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi in July 2013.\nThe first two phases were drafting and adopting a new constitution by January 2014, replacing a charter mostly written by Morsi supporters and which had an Islamist slant. Presidential elections, which el-Sissi won last year, were the second stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:07:36.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
