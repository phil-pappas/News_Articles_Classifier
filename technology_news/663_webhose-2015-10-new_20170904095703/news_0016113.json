Can giving birth really be made easy?\nFor many pregnant women the notion of childbirth can be very frightening.\nIt therefore comes as no surprise that deciding which pain relief to use whilst giving birth is now one of the most important aspects of the whole experience for millions of women.\nHypnobirthing is the alternative method for giving birth that many midwives predict will be standard antenatal practice within a decade.\nPaola Bagnall, hypnotherapist and author of the acclaimed book Birth Made Easy and creator of this new range of hypnobirthing downloads contained within the Birth Made Easy app, says; “It is no wonder that some mothers-to-be feel tense and unable to relax in childbirth due to all the horror stories they hear, so the ‘pain’ that they have been told about becomes a reality”.\nPaola continues, “Childbirth is a natural process and one that women’s bodies were designed for.\n\"When a woman is calm and relaxed her muscles and skin stretch easily and naturally in a pain-free way. Hypnobirthing’s deep relaxation techniques help women to stay calm and be in control, thus coping with contractions more easily.”\nThe hypnobirthing downloads contained within the app help women to access these techniques quickly, easily and at a low cost.\nIn fact the initial relaxation session is provided free so users can see if it's for them before purchasing.\nHypnobirthing is based on the work of Dr Grantly Dick-Read, an English physician whose principles provided the foundations of the National Childbirth Trust (NCT).\nHe is famously Quote: d as saying; “In no other animal species is the process of giving birth apparently associated with any suffering, pain or agony, except where pathology exists or in an unnatural state, such as captivity.”\nHe went on to conclude that fear and tension was responsible for 95 per cent of labour pain, which could be eliminated through relaxation techniques.\nPaola’s new Birth Made Easy App, has just been released on Apple, Google Play, Amazon and Windows.\nIt focuses on how each woman can take control of her mind and body so that birth becomes the straightforward process it is meant to be.\nThis ensures that she learns to trust the biology of her body which is designed to give birth.\nBy harnessing the power of the unconscious mind to create healing, baby’s birth can become the truly magical experience it was always meant to be.\nThe app was developed in collaboration with Darren Marks, one of the UKs top hypnotherapists whose app company Harmony Hypnosis has won multiple awards for their powerful and effective self-help programs.\nThis new hypnobirthing app includes the use of self hypnosis, visualisation, different breathing methods, and the use of colours for healing and relaxation.\nThese have had proven results, empowering mothers-to-be to enjoy their pregnancy, have a wonderful birth experience, be relaxed and in control, promote their own rapid healing and recovery, bond easily with their baby, and get back to pre-pregnancy weight, shape and dimensions very soon after birth.\nTo discover how birth can be the most natural, pain-free and joyous event that it was always meant to be, download the Birth Made Easy Hypnobirthing App.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:16:23.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
