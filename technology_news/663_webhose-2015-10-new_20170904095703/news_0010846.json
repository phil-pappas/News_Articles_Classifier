Package deal \nYouTube will offer US-based users a month's free trial of Red from 28 October. International pricing and launches will be announced soon. \n\"For years, YouTube's fans have been telling us they want more,\" the company wrote in a blog post. \n\"More choice when watching their favourite content, more ways to support their favourite creators and, above all, the option to watch their favourite videos uninterrupted.\" \nYouTube Red original shows will include: \nScare PewDiePie - a reality adventure series as Felix reacts to situations inspired by his favourite games. \nSing it! - A comedy that satirises talent competitions \nLazer Team - A movie featuring four losers who find an alien ship carrying an strange cargo \nA Trip to Unicorn Island - An in-depth look at the life of Lilly Singh as she embarks on a 26 city tour. \nSingle by 30 - a romantic drama about two high school friends who pledge to marry each other if they are still unwed at 30 \nFight of the Living Dead - a reality show that puts popular YouTubers in a frightening zombie apocalypse to see how they cope \nI Am Tobuscus - a comedy about a self-involved YouTube creator trying to be a big star \nThe roster also includes some as yet untitled items such as a show based around the science of video games that will be filmed for VR headsets, a reality series that puts YouTube stars into a murder mystery setting and an anthology looking at the absurdity of internet culture. \nYouTube content will be able to be downloaded and watched offline, a contrasting approach to Netflix - its chief product officer last month said offline viewing wasn't something users wanted. \nThe subscription will include access to YouTube Gaming and a new YouTube Music app, also announced on Wednesday. Google's streaming music service, Google Play Music, will also be included. \nThis package deal of sorts could present a threat to Apple Music and Spotify whose services, which are solely audio, are roughly the same price. Zombie apocalypse \nWhile the free, ad-supported version of YouTube will remain as-is, the move represents the first time that YouTube will limit some material to paying customers only. Image copyright PA Image caption One of the shows will involve trying to terrify PewDiePie aka Felix Kjellberg \nThose members will get productions featuring YouTube stars who regularly command audiences bigger than global broadcast giants, working with high-end production houses on the original content. \nThe first of these shows will be rolled out early next year. \nArguably the most well-known, PewDiePie - real name Felix Kjellberg - will be working with the executive producers behind blockbuster zombie series The Walking Dead on a \"reality adventure series\". \nThe show will include \"thrills, chills and laughter as PewDiePie encounters terrifying situations inspired by his favourite video games\". \nAnother show \"takes popular YouTube talent and traps them in a frighteningly realistic zombie apocalypse. They must use their instincts and gaming skills to survive as they battle the elements for the ultimate prize of survival\". \nIn all, the company announced 10 original projects, including one project that will be shot in 360 degrees and designed to be enjoyed using a virtual reality headset. Strategy shift Image copyright AP Image caption Some of the content YouTube will produce will be made for viewing on VR headsets \nThe move represents YouTube's gradual shift from being the first giant of the new media age to something resembling a more traditional media company, with executives deciding what content is made and promoted - albeit heavily influenced by online trends and viewing data. \nMoving to a paywall model could be appealing to creators who could receive higher revenues from paying YouTube customers than they currently do from advertising revenue shared with YouTube. \nHowever, that relies on YouTube's ability to get an audience not used to paying for content to commit to a monthly subscription. Or, tougher still, YouTube has to convince the parents of those fans to start paying instead. \nAnd breathing down YouTube's neck is Facebook. After rolling out auto-playing videos to its news feed, the site recently started creating dedicated video areas, much like YouTube Channels. \nBehind the scenes YouTube has been busy trying to convince advertisers that its viewers are comparatively more engaged than Facebook users in what they are watching - and that YouTube has stricter criteria over what exactly constitutes a \"view\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:42:20.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
