At just 18 months old, Doctus has made a name for itself as a distruptor in an industry heavily established in its old-school ways. An online medical service, the company is essentially ‘killing’ the time we spend in the waiting room. \nFor patients not requiring a full consultation, but needing a script filled, the service will give you access to common medications for conditions such as asthma quickly. Say goodbye to the coughing and sniffing. Source: iStock \nSupported by her GP Co-founder and father, Dr Rodney Beckwith, a solution to the ‘Waiting Room Blues’ came quite easily. Sarah has no medical background, but as a patient herself, she recognised the need for easier and quicker access to obtaining prescriptions, home test kits and referrals. With the help of her father’s medical expertise, Sarah was able to transform what was once an inconvenience, into an innovative and efficient experience. \n“Building a scalable health platform to address inefficiencies in Australia’s highly regulated medical system was a natural extension of my professional and life experiences,” Sarah says. \n“Working in advertising on global consumer accounts, product innovation and customer experience were the basis of brand loyalty and trust — this is something I always kept front of mind when we founded Doctus. I want to remove the negative stigma around doctor consultations and make it a positive experience for patients.” Other Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:58:23.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
