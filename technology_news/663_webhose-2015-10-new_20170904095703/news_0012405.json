CSIRO has come up with a new way to gather fingerprint evidence. \nchallenging evidence where conventional ‘dusting’ is not appropriate. \n“While police and forensics experts use a range of different techniques, sometimes in complex cases evidence needs to be sent off to a lab where heat and vacuum treatment is applied,” Dr Liang said. \n“Our method reduces these steps, and because it’s done on the spot, a digital device could be used at the scene to capture images of the glowing prints to run through the database in real time.” The method is done on the spot and only takes 30 seconds. \n“When my house was broken into I saw how common practice fingerprinting is for police,” Dr Liang said. \n“Knowing that dusting has been around for a long time, I was inspired to see how new innovative materials could be applied to create even better results. Different colours can be achieved by altering the chemistry of the solution. This photo shows the method on the blades of two knives. \n“As far as we know, it’s the first time that these extremely porous metal organic framework (MOF) crystals have been researched for forensics.” \nMOF crystals have a number of benefits in that they are cheap, react quickly and can emit a bright light. The technique doesn’t create any dust or fumes, reducing waste and risk of inhalation. The new method can reveal fingerprints on metal, plastic and glass. \nThe method could have other valuable applications including new biomedical devices and drug delivery. \nCSIRO is now looking to partner with law enforcement agencies to apply the technique.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:02:44.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
