(PRWEB) October 20, 2015\nTenable Network Security®, Inc. , the leader in continuous network monitoring, today announced it is integrating Nessus® Agents into SecurityCenter 5, giving enterprise customers unprecedented visibility across the entire IT infrastructure including portable devices and hard-to-scan assets.\nAgent technology allows organizations to monitor transient and complex systems and perform offline assessments across segmented systems without the need for privileged credentials. The extended visibility into vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the entire enterprise allows security teams to secure mobile workforces, as well as assess systems on complex or bandwidth-limited networks on remote facilities that previously were cumbersome or impossible to assess for vulnerabilities.\n“Nessus Agents represent a major step forward for security teams who need to improve visibility into previously unscannable systems,” said Ron Gula, CEO, Tenable Network Security. “The integration of Agents into SecurityCenter Continuous View makes it easier for customers to gain a truly comprehensive overview of the status of the network and all its endpoint devices, even when those devices are not connected to the network.”\nAgents deliver the detailed visibility of credentialed scans without the requirement to manage the credentials needed for traditional active scanning. In addition, agent technology enables large-scale concurrent scanning with little network impact.\n“The high frequency of data breaches tells us that many organizations still suffer from poor visibility and struggle to understand the effectiveness of their security initiatives at any given time,” said Robert Westervelt, analyst, IDC. “Organizations need situational awareness for a proactive security program. The use of continuous monitoring with agent-based technology gives organizations broader visibility in an era of BYOD and distributed networks.”\nTenable’s SecurityCenter is a comprehensive vulnerability analytics solution that provides complete visibility into the security posture of an organization’s distributed and complex IT infrastructure. SecurityCenter consolidates and evaluates all of the vulnerability data from across a company’s entire IT infrastructure, illustrates vulnerability trends over time, and assesses risk with actionable context for effective remediation prioritization. SecurityCenter Continuous View is the only true continuous network monitoring platform and provides the broadest coverage for organizations’ IT environments, the deepest detection of vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, malware and real-time threats, the most advanced analytics, and the industry’s only Assurance Report Cards.\nNessus Agent support in SecurityCenter 5 from Tenable Network Security will be available later this month.
