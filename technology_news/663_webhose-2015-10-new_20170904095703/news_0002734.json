I don't know anybody who's seriously disputing this,\" said Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière. \"We work intensively toward reducing this number -- on an international, European, and national level....The alternative isn't the complete closure or opening (of borders). It is a question of the level.\"\nBerlin expects between 800,000 and 1 million people to arrive in Germany this year with the intention of applying for asylum -- roughly 1 per cent of the population.\nThe highest influx of migrants since the end of World War II has prompted calls to limit the number of people allowed to enter Germany.\nThe new rules passed -- by a large majority in the 631-seat lower house -- will cut cash benefits paid to asylum seekers, speed up the review of asylum applications, expedite the departure of rejected applicants, and make it more difficult for citizens of Albania, Kosovo and Montenegro to become refugees.\nThe government also set aside some €6 billion ($US6.8 billion) in extra money to deal with soaring migrant-related costs this year and next. That will largely benefit Germany's 16 federal states, which have complained about the growing pressure on their finances as they feed and house asylum seekers.\nThe measures still require approval of the upper house of parliament, representing the country's 16 states. The vote is scheduled for Friday.\n\"It is no exaggeration to call this task a historic test for Europe,\" Ms Merkel told the house earlier in an address on the summit of European Union leaders that starts in Brussels later Thursday. \"Closing borders in the 21st century (marked by) the Internet is an illusion,\" she said, calling for a joint action of the 28-member strong bloc to confront the migration crisis.\nMs Merkel's decision, from September 4, to open the door to migrants stranded in Hungary was initially supported by the German public, but the mood has shifted recently and the chancellor's \"We can do it!\" mantra is facing increasingly o pen dissent from her own conservative parties .\nMunicipalities in charge of housing asylum seekers have warned they will soon run out of homes for the new arrivals.\nGermany reintroduced document controls along its borders last month as an emergency measure to help it cope with the surging numbers of migrants crossing into the country, but with little effect. Officials say up to 10,000 migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan, Africa and southeastern Europe are still arriving daily.\nBavaria has been particularly critical about Ms. Merkel's policy, as it is the first point of entry for migrants coming to Germany via Austria. Around 300,000 migrants have arrived in Bavaria since September 1, according to the Bavarian government.\n\"Without limiting migration to Germany, we will fail terrifically as a community of states in Germany and Europe,\" said Horst Seehofer, state premier in Bavaria and one of Ms. Merkel's present sharpest critics, during a debate in Bavaria's parliament.\nAt the summit in Brussels, EU leaders will discuss the continuing migration crisis, strengthening the bloc's borders and a closer cooperation with Turkey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:54:01.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
