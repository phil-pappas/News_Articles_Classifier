Liberty Global confirms that it is in discussions with the board of CWC regarding a possible offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of CWC. \nThis announcement does not amount to an announcement of a firm intention to make an offer under Rule 2.7 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Code\"). There can be no certainty that any offer will be made or on the terms on which any offer might be made. A further announcement will be made as appropriate. \nIn accordance with Rule 2.6(a) the Code, Liberty Global must, by no later than 5:00 p.m. on November 19, 2015, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for CWC in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for CWC, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. This deadline will only be extended with the consent of the Takeover Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code. \nFurther Information \nA copy of this announcement will be made available on Liberty Global’s website at www.libertyglobal.com . \nInvestors should note that in connection with the possible offer for CWC, Liberty Global will be required to disclose, which may be on a daily basis, certain information about its share buyback program and capital structure, as well as other information relating to Liberty Global and the possible offer. This information may be material to investors in connection with the possible offer. This information will be posted on our website and will be released through the Regulatory News Service in the U.K., as required by the Code.

An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s).

A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the person's interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror, save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing. \nIf two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3. \nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4). \nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panel's website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk , including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified.
