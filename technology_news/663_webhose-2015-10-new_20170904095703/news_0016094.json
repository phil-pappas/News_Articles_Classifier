This trails global expectations of digital revenue to grow from 16 per cent to 37 per cent in the next five years.\nThe findings come from Gartner’s worldwide survey of 2,944 CIO respondents representing more than $US250 billion in CIO IT budgets in 84 countries, including 175 in ANZ.\nThe ANZ results will be presented today at the four-day Gartner Symposium/ITxpo on the Gold Coast attended by about 1500 people.\nThe Gartner report, Building the Digital Platform: The 2016 CIO Agenda, found in the ANZ public sector CIOs predict a rise from 38 per cent to 79 per cent in digital processes (from 42 per cent to 77 per cent globally).\n“In general, CIOs in ANZ are more conservative or less optimistic about the impact of digital so far,’’ Gartner analyst Andy Rowsell-Jones told The Australian.\n“On face value, Australia is less of a digitised economy than the global average with the exception of the public sector and that digitisation deficit is expected to continue.’’\nThe report found two-thirds of ANZ CIOs believe security and cyber risk posed a greater threat to their business than new competitive and commercial threats. This was in contrast to 54 per cent of CIOs globally viewing security and cyber risk as more of a concern.\n“We expect to see a lot of skills development in the area of security simply because it is perceived as being a major consideration more so here than it is elsewhere,’’ said Mr Rowsell-Jones, who is a vice-president and research director in Gartner’s CIO & Executive Leadership Research Team and research chair of the symposium.\nThe survey found leading businesses must shift to platform thinking in terms of their business models, delivery mechanisms, talent and leadership in order to survive and thrive.\nIt showed purse strings were loosening with ANZ CIOs expecting an average budget increase of 2.9 per cent, slightly higher than the global weighted average of 2.2 per cent.\nHowever, ANZ CIOs cited money as their biggest barrier to achieving their objectives as a CIO, while globally skills were seen as the top barrier.\n“For them (ANZ CIOs) it is ‘do I innovate and produce a digital business or do I focus on cost reduction and take money out’,’’ Mr Rowsell-Jones said.\nThe survey found 52 per cent of ANZ CIOs were the leaders of digital transformation in their enterprise, and more than 40 per cent are the innovation leader. This is significantly higher than the global averages of 40 and 30 per cent respectively.\nCIOs globally and in ANZ identified the biggest talent gap as information and analytic skills.\nThe survey also found chief digital officers (CDOs) were not being put in place as fast as expected. Currently, 9.1 per cent of ANZ enterprises said they have a CDO similar to the global average of 9.3 per cent (up from 6.6 per cent globally two years ago).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:39:26.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
