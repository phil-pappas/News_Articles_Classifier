This is the fourth year The AeroClinic has provided the shots and will also be doing them in Charlotte and Philadelphiaâ€™s airports. Some other airports across the country also provide the service under different providers. The AeroClinic will also be registering with the state to provide the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes reportedly available sometime in October. The shots will be available all through the flu season until late December and may extend into January if the CDC deems it necessary. The AeroClinic has hired an additional 20 people to man the kiosks that also include privacy screens.
