Over 100 TD users in Toronto, Ottawa and Regina will be testing the Nymi Band’s \ncontactless payment functionality until the end of the summer, as part of this closed payment pilot. \nOther participating Canadian banks are scheduled to launch similar pilots later this year, and Nymi \nexpects several thousand payments to be made using the Nymi Band during this time. \nThe Nymi Band is a secure and continuous wearable authenticator that identifies a user based on their \nunique heartbeat (or electrocardiogram) through proprietary Nymi technology called HeartIDTM. Nymi \nhas developed an NFC-enabled prototype of the Nymi Band for these pilots, which is linked to a user’s \nMasterCard. In doing so, participants can utilize the Nymi Band to make secure, contactless payments \nusing Tap & Go™ payment terminals found at many retailers. \nKarl Martin, Nymi’s Founder and CEO explains, “Nymi’s goal is to fundamentally change the way \nauthentication is treated and to move industries towards a more secure and convenient identity model. \nBy working with partners like TD and MasterCard, we are effectively demonstrating that continuous \nauthentication can be a more secure and convenient way to make retail payments.” \n“Over the past several years, TD has improved the customer experience by introducing a host of \ninnovative digital enhancements allowing us to better address customer needs,” says Chuck Hounsell, \nSenior Vice President, Payments, TD. “Working with Nymi’s secure, customer authentication technology \nis an example of how TD is exploring new and innovative ways of bringing the next level of convenience \nto our customers.” \n“Wearable and mobile payments are becoming increasingly popular among Canadians and we’re \nensuring that every MasterCard transaction on the Nymi Band is safe, secure, seamless and convenient \nfor our cardholders,” said Jason Davies, Head of Emerging Payments, MasterCard Canada. “In \npartnership with MasterCard Labs and Nymi, we’ll continue to invest in and explore cutting edge \npayment technologies.” \nNymi and MasterCard collaborated with NXP, the world leader in secure chips for payment, to prototype \nNFC-enabled Nymi Bands based on NXP’s SmartMX Technology. Nymi, MasterCard and TD will continue \nworking together to innovate in the financial technology space. \nAbout Nymi \nNymi is focused on delivering secure, continuous authentication solutions. The company’s first product \nis the Nymi Band, a wearable device that delivers biometrically secured, continuous authentication \nexperiences.
