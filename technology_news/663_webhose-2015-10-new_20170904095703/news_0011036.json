All proceeds from the Festival benefit the nation's leading hunger-relief organizations Food Bank for New York City and No Kid Hungry. Along with some of today's most celebrated chefs, including Ashley Christensen, Alex Raij and Gabrielle Hamilton, LG proved that with its best-in-class OLED technology TV dinners can be a premium affair. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151019/278101 \nAt this year's Festival, LG brought the action from the kitchen to the dinner table by live-streaming in stunning 4K Ultra HD resolution the chefs as they prepared signature dishes, all viewed on LG OLED TVs. With an awe-inspiring picture created by perfect blacks and incredible color, even from wide viewing angles, LG OLED TVs transported guests on a culinary journey to experience every seasoning sprinkled, vegetable chopped and protein saut√©ed with the ultimate precision and clarity that only OLED technology can deliver. \nIn addition to the OLED live-streaming, LG offered attendees a chance to bring the \"LG OLED TV Dinner of the Future\" experience home with the LG curved EG9600 series OLED 4K TVs at select intimate dinners with celebrated chefs throughout the Festival. At the same time, Best Buy surprised attendees with a Best Buy Mystery Gift Card, valued from $25-$500, with one lucky winner at each of the five dinners winning a $500 grand prize gift card. Taking the OLED TV experience beyond the Festival TV Dinner, consumers have a chance to enter the LG #OLEDisHere Twitter sweepstakes by Oct. 21 for a chance to win a newly launched 55EG9100 OLED TV. Consumers can check LG's Twitter handle, @LGUS for more details on how to enter. \n\"LG has revolutionized television with our OLED TVs, celebrated by industry experts for delivering the best picture quality available today,\" said David VanderWaal, vice president of marketing, LG Electronics USA. \"By pairing LG's award-winning TVs with the distinguished dishes made by world-renowned chefs at the Wine & Food Festival, we were able to treat consumers to a new take on the traditional TV dinner -the LG OLED TV dinner of the future - featuring the best in picture quality and fine cuisine.\" \nOLED's revolutionary technology lets consumers enjoy an awe-inspiring picture with perfect blacks and incredible color, even from wide viewing angles, unlike any LCD/LED TV can deliver. Blacks rendered by LG's OLED TV are up to 200 times deeper than those of an LCD panel, creating an infinite contrast ratio and bringing colors to life like never before. \nLG Makes the \"OLED TV Dinner of the Future\" Experience More Attainable As the leader in OLED TV technology, LG tripled the number of models in its OLED TV portfolio this year and just announced 30- to 45-percent price reductions for the new flat EF9500 series and curved EG9600 series 4K Ultra HD OLED TVs thanks to exploding consumer demand and production efficiencies. LG also is introducing a Full HD OLED TV for under $2,000 for the first time in the industry, bringing the advanced technology to more consumers than ever before. \nWhat is a TV dinner without the best content streaming experience possible? LG OLED TVs feature the award-winning webOS Smart TV platform designed to make finding and switching between content options - including broadcast TV, streaming services and external devices - simple and fast. LG's updated webOS platform for 2015 models features an enhanced user interface, reduces boot time and allows users to personalize Launch Bar menus to make it easier than ever for users to access their favorite content, including entertainment from 4K partners* such as Amazon Video, Netflix, DIRECTV and YouTube, and many more Full HD options.** \nTo enter the LG #OLEDisHere Twitter sweepstakes for a chance to win a 55EG9100 OLED TV, visit LG's Twitter handle, @LGUS for more details. \nLearn more about LG's 2015 OLED TV lineup at www.lg.com/us/experience-tvs/oled-tv .
