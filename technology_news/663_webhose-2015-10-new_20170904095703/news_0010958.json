( OTCPK: SSFT ), a leader in innovative eDiscovery and email archiving solutions, announced that its automatic legal hold feature in its email archiving and eDiscovery solutions automatically effortlessly allows customers to retain email that has been identified by certain content criteria even after the retention period has expired. Flagged emails are not purged and held securely until these emails have been examined and the reviewer has marked them as closed. Only after this review process is completed are the held emails released and are subject to expire if applicable.\n“Several customers of Sonasoft have welcomed our automated legal hold feature in our eDiscovery platform”, said Bilal Ahmed, CTO and Vice President of Engineering. “They appreciate that all they had to do is identify criteria such as a keyword or sender in the archive. All emails that then meet the identified criteria, such as credit card information, social security numbers, insider trading information, etc., automatically are flagged. These flagged emails are never purged from the archive even after the retention policy has expired. For instance, if a customer has a retention policy to retain email for seven years and to purge emails from the archive that are older than seven years, then our automatic eDiscovery legal hold feature safely will retain these emails as long as needed, even if the seven year period has passed. Of course, our customers also have the flexibility to flag email manually in addition to our automated legal hold feature. This design allows our customers to achieve the maximum benefit and obtain peace of mind when an eDiscovery request needs to be fulfilled.”\n“Sonasoft strives to offer excellent value”, said Douglas MacKallor, Head of Sonasoft’s Online Marketing. “Customers appreciate our enterprise-class features that are usually just a fraction of competing email archiving and eDiscovery solutions. Sonasoft also makes every effort to design its products to be easy to use. In our automatic legal hold feature, emails can be flagged and retained as easily as it is to do a simple search.”\nFor more details regarding the automated legal hold feature as well as other benefits from SonaVault Email Archiving and eDiscovery Software solutions:\nhttp://www.sonasoft.com/products/sonavault-email-archiving-software/\nAbout Sonasoft\nSonasoft Corporation is a publicly traded corporation and is listed on the OTC Markets with the trading symbol SSFT.
