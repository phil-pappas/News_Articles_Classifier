Cable operators are looking to reduce trouble calls, enhance work efficiencies and reduce truck rolls, ultimately improving customer experience and satisfaction, decreasing customer contact rates, and providing significant savings over similar in-sourced support services. \n\"Our Technical Support Services Call Centre has played a substantial role in helping the pay-TV community reduce costs and drive customer retention,\" said Brian Dean, senior director, Technical Support Services, Universal Electronics . \"Hitting this recent milestone is a great accomplishment for us and truly demonstrates the significance of our broad array of support offerings.\" \nUniversal Electronics is also a specialist in universal remote control technologies and control interfaces, and recently noted a milestone with its QuickSet universal remote solution, having shipped the platform in more than 150 million devices around the world, reaching over ten million users per month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:48:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
