He characterised the loss as a short-term setback. Still, the final bill lacked the punch Brown might have hoped to deliver when he attends the United Nations climate change conference in Paris in November.\nThe Legislature approved the watered-down SB350 in the final hours of the legislative session on September 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:05:37.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
