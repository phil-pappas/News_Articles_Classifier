As part of the agreement with MOFCOM, and in order to leverage the rich storage industry heritage of each long-standing brand, Western Digital will continue to offer both HGST and WD product brands in the market and maintain separate sales teams for two years from the date of the decision. \n\"The decision announced today positions us for continued growth and long-term value creation,\" said Steve Milligan, chief executive officer of Western Digital. \"HGST and WD are an exceptional combination, and together, we will set the pace for innovation in this dynamic and evolving industry.\" \nIntegration activities will begin immediately and are expected to continue over the next 24 months. Western Digital expects the integration of corporate and other key functions, including research and development, heads and media operations, engineering and manufacturing, will result in significant opportunities for growth, synergies and cost savings consistent with the levels previously outlined by the company. \nThe company also announced today that Mike Cordano, formerly president of the HGST subsidiary, has been appointed president and chief operating officer of Western Digital by the company's board of directors. In his new role, Cordano will head a business leadership team with balanced representation of proven leaders from the company's two former subsidiaries. \nJim Murphy, who previously served as president of the WD subsidiary, will lead the Storage Devices business unit, which includes the company's HDD and SSD products. Jim Welsh and Dave Tang will lead the company's Content Solutions and Storage Solutions business units, respectively. \nSteve Milligan will continue to serve as chief executive officer of Western Digital Corporation and oversee all business and corporate functions, including an Advanced Technology organization led by Steve Campbell, former chief technology officer for HGST. The appointments announced today are effective immediately. \nWith mobility and the cloud continuing to drive rapid data growth, businesses and consumers are increasingly looking for efficient and economical means to store, manage and access data.
