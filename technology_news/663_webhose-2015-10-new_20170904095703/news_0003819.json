LOUIS , Oct. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Employees of Phelps County Regional Medical Center (PCRMC) are now eligible for a 5 percent discount on tuition under a new partnership between WGU Missouri and the Rolla -based healthcare facility. The agreement provides employees with greater access to high-quality, affordable bachelor's and master's degrees in business, information technology, and health care, including nursing. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, PCRMC employees can receive a 5 percent discount (for up to two years) to pursue a bachelor's or master's degree at WGU Missouri. The tuition discount reduces WGU Missouri's already-low tuition of about $6,000 per year for most programs. \n\"We are pleased to partner with PCRMC and provide its employees with greater access to high-quality, affordable education,\" said Dr. Angie Besendorfer , Chancellor of WGU Missouri. \"As a university that is designed to meet the needs of working adults, our flexible, self-paced model is ideal for employees who want to make higher education fit into their busy lives.\" \nWGU Missouri, the state affiliate of Western Governors University , is a nonprofit online university established by the state. WGU Missouri's competency-based learning model allows students to learn at their own pace.

As a result, many students are able to accelerate their time to degree completion â€“ with the average time to a bachelor's degree less than three years. \nPhelps County Regional Medical Center employees will also be eligible for the Healthcare Partners Fund, with scholarships of up to $2,500 .
