The partnership features seamless workflow between two user centric platforms that promote efficient leasing and property management processes. Leasehawk's multi-channel communications enables leasing professionals to communicate and engage with prospects not only from their desktop, but also mobile devices. Key platform features include the Relationship Management App and ACE, which stands for “Answer Calls Every time.” The App automatically tracks every inbound and outbound form of communication, including calls, texts and emails for an entirely new way of analyzing traffic, activity and leasing success. ACE, the automated conversational assistant with a Siri-like interface, provides leasing information, schedules appointments and collects customer information when staff is unavailable, creating a modern and affordable alternative to traditional call centers.\n“This integration allows our mutual clients to easily push guest cards into ResMan from the App and enable ACE to utilize pricing and availability data to answer callers questions. The integration ultimately eliminates duplicate or manual data entry which also improves accuracy,” states Mike Cornell, LeaseHawk Chief Product Officer.\n“We are committed to serving our partners through integrations with organizations who share our dedication to Service First and our vision of intuitive property management software .
