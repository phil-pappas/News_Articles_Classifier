In the future, additional -- free and legal-- services may be added to Butter. \nNot only an empty shell, we want to make Butter a great App if you want to stream independent cinema and tv shows. \nOne potential target here is the movie offering of Archive.org but there are others out there that the developers may integrate. \nButter is not available in binary form currently but that is about to change. The developers plan to make another announcement soon and it is very likely that this will be about the first binary release of Butter. \nIt will be interesting to see how this will work out for the Popcorn Time team. Developers who did not want to work on Popcorn Time but are interested in helping develop Butter are effectively improving the backend of Popcorn Time at the same time. The Popcorn Time team noticed a drop in contributions after it moved away from GitHub after copyright concerns. \nClosing Words \nEven if you disagree with what Popcorn Time is offering, I think it is fair to say that it help showcase how great and easy streaming media services could make it for users. \nThe new development strategy could add new blood to the project that is working on the backbone exclusively. \nNow You", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:54:49.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
