S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is not covered by an existing Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), or uses a drug, biologic or device that is being used outside of its FDA-approved indication and population (e.g., off-label), evidence that an IND or IDE application has been submitted or will be submitted within 60 days of award is required.â¢ If the proposed study will use clinical sites located outside of the United States and uses an investigational or off-label drug, biologic, or device, evidence that submission of the appropriate application to the regional regulatory authority has been or will be submitted within 60 days of award date is required.â¢ The Government reserves the right to withdraw funding if the appropriate regulatory approval application (e.g., IND, IDE) has not been submitted to the FDA or regional regulatory authority within 60 days of the DoD award date or if the documented status of the regulatory approval has not been obtained within 6 months of the award date.- A business plan that describes the product and industry development progression through FDA marketing application, and to the commercial market (if applicable), must be submitted within 60 days of the award.â¢ The Government reserves the right to withdraw funding if the business plan has not been submitted to the DoD within 60 days of the award date.The following are important aspects of a submission for the ERI:Relevance and Feasibilityâ¢ The proposal/application should describe how the proposed intervention to be tested will offer significant potential impact for military Service members, Veterans or the general public over current standard of care.â¢ The proposal/application should demonstrate availability of, and access to, a suitable patient population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study.â¢ The proposed clinical trial is initiated and can begin enrollment no later than 12 months after the award date.â¢ The proposal/application should demonstrate how accrual goals will be achieved and how standards of care may impact the study population.â¢ The proposal/application should demonstrate documented availability of and access to the drug, biologic, or device, if applicable, and/or other materials needed, as appropriate.Clinical Trial Elementsâ¢ The proposed clinical trial should include clearly defined, measurable, and appropriate endpoints.â¢ The proposal/application should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, availability of appropriate statistical expertise, and a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will clearly answer the objectives of the study and support an FDA marketing application, if applicable.- The proposal/application should indicate the availability of a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local IRB or EC of record and other regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual.â¢ If an IND or IDE application is required to be submitted to the FDA, the proposal/application should describe the availability of appropriate support to prepare, submit, and maintain the IND or IDE application.â¢ If submission to a non-U. S. regional regulatory authority is required, the proposal/application should describe the availability of appropriate region-specific support to prepare, submit, and maintain the relevant application.â¢ Inclusion of preliminary data relevant to the proposed research project and FDA marketing application is required.Examples of preliminary data include preclinical toxicology, manufacture validation, quality systems audit/gap analysis, a summary of preclinical studies, and any prior clinical experience inside or outside of the United States.- In addition to requisite preliminary data, the proposed research project must be based on sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and critical review and analysis of the literature.Institutional Elementsâ¢ The proposal/application should include a post-award transition plan (including potential funding and resources) showing how the product would progress to the next clinical trial phase and/or delivery to the market after the successful completion of the work associated with this proposed award.â¢ The proposal/application should clearly demonstrate strong institutional support.
