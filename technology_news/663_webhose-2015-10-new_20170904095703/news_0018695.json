More than half of the illustrations are animated or interactive, with such touches as a golden snitch from Quidditch matches flying away as you tap it on the screen. \nSeries creator J.K. Rowling also goes deeper into some of the characters and story lines with a handful of pop-up annotations. \nThe editions, released Thursday, are exclusive to Apple's iBooks Store and require an Apple mobile device or a Mac computer to read. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
