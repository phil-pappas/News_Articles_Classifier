It is comprised of more than 250 federal government labs and research centers. \nThe LAPµSL is an image projection micro-stereolithography system that rapidly produces very small features over large areas, by using optical techniques to write images in parallel, as opposed to conventional techniques, which either require mechanical stages moves or the rastering of beams to expose pixels in series. LLNL optical engineer Bryan Moran makes an adjustment to the Large Area Projection Micro Stereolithography machine, for which he recently received a 2015 Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) Far West Region Award for outstanding technology development.

The original polymer can be removed via chemical means or heat, leaving structures that can be back-filled with various materials or left hollow for extremely light, complex and large parts. LAPμSL can be used to quickly make these large parts with great complexity and detail. \nSome of the other commercial applications envisioned for the LAPμSL system by Moran include medical devices, dentistry and microfluidics. \nThe system has garnered “significant attention” at LLNL from potential users and collaborators, and is considered an excellent candidate for technology transfer, according to Lab Industrial Partnership Office officials. \nThe current LAPμSL system has been built with off-the-shelf components that are not optimized for this application, Moran said, adding that he is in the process of developing a new system with LLNL-designed and customized optics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:54:05.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
