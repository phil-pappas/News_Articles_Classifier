The competition will be held in conjunction with the SANS Cyber Defense Initiative (CDI) 2015 security training event in Washington, D.C. taking place December 12 - 19. \nOne of the key competitions in the U.S. Cyber Challenge, NetWars is an in-depth learning tool for security professionals. Participants will compete in a mock environment to test their defensive, analysis, and offensive cyber skills, fighting off intruders while trying to take over target systems and networks. \n\"This year, we've really amped up the NetWars Tournament of Champions. As we pit the best of the best against each other, they will be faced with all new challenges featuring mobile device attacks (exploiting Android and more), a brand new narrative (save Frodo from Mordor), and a whole lot more. It will be very exciting for all involved,\" said Ed Skoudis, Director of SANS NetWars. \nSANS Cyber Defense Initiative 2015 will feature hands-on, immersion style training courses for InfoSec professionals at every level. Attendees will learn how the newest cyber attacks work and what can be done to prevent them or mitigate the damage. They will also learn about the latest tools, and how to use them, for finding, blocking and deciphering hacking attacks. \nFor additional information on the NetWars Tournaments Dec. 17-18, a list of courses, or to register for SANS CDI, please visit: www.sans.org/u/8L1 \nAbout SANS Institute The SANS Institute was established in 1989 as a cooperative research and education organization.
