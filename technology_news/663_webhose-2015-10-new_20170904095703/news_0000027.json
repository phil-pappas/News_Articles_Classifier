The demands of justice are yet unmet,\" Mr Turnbull said.\nThe investigators stopped short of apportioning blame but were in no doubt that the plane was brought down by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air-missile.\nRussia has denied any responsibility, putting forward the alternative theory that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet.\nHowever, the Russian Federation has also resisted efforts of the United Nations to establish a Security Council tribunal that would prosecute those responsible, using its veto power to reject a resolution moved in July this year.\nThe prime minister vowed a separate criminal investigation into the tragedy - involving Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and the Ukraine - would continue \"undaunted\".\n\"We are focussed on all possible options for prosecuting those responsible, with a view to securing due punishment for this crime,\" he said.\n\"We, and all the nations whose citizens share our grief, are determined to do everything we can no matter how long it takes to identify those responsible and bring them to justice.\"\nMr Turnbull said he would write to the families of the Australians killed \"to assure them that they have the heart felt sympathies of the nation as this process continues\".\nHe condemned Russia for blocking the UN resolution over prosecution.\n\"We will not be bullied by Russia,\" he said.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said the report released on Tuesday night was \"another step in the unfinished journey to justice\".\nBut amid the lingering anger, Paul Guard, who lost his parents Jill and Roger in the July 2014 disaster, said he did not blame only Russia.\n\"I blame Russia partially but not completely. There are many other players that are also to blame,\" he said.\nHe said it appeared Malaysia Airlines did not have the information needed to make a risk assessment of whether to fly above the war zone.\nWeeks before the disaster, Qantas decided it would stop flying over Ukraine.\n\"I think more could have been done to share the information and intelligence to ensure that the operation of aircraft was safe over that path,\" Qantas chief Alan Joyce said on Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:08:06.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
