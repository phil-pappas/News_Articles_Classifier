A new support concept from $2.2B information technology (IT) services company CompuCom, Tech-Zone is designed to provide small and medium-sized businesses with expert technology and security services, in addition to business-class hardware and software. With businesses increasingly dependent on technology to power their operations and few technology support options custom-designed for small and mid-sized businesses, a dedicated solution like Tech-Zone is essential to their growth. \"Kannapolis, Concord and the greater Charlotte region is such a vibrant and burgeoning area where small and mid-size businesses abound, making it an ideal location to introduce Tech-Zone before rolling out the concept nationally,\" commented Dan Stone, Tech-Zone president. \"We're thrilled to put down roots in North Carolina with this brand new concept and immerse ourselves into the local business community. We hope this market finds a tremendous partner in Tech-Zone,\" continues Stone. Expert Technical Support Enterprise-level technical support - from everyday issues and security to networking and mobility - is delivered on-demand or by-appointment, in store or onsite with transparent, flat-rate pricing. Additionally, business customers with a valid tax ID have access to a plethora of ongoing support services such as Tech-Zone Pro support, Tech-Zone print, hosted private cloud and exclusive wireless talk, text and data plans for smartphones, tablets and IOT devices, etc. Customers are assisted by Tech-Zone technology specialists who are full-time employees with an average of 15 years or more of support experience. They are fully trained and certified on all of the latest hardware and software platforms and are background-checked for customers' security and peace of mind. Tech-Zone also offers comprehensive subscription-based support - called Tech-Zone Pro - which provides the customer the same tech support specialist at his/her location every two weeks for tech support plus annual technology check-ups and in-store discounts. Subscription support will retail for $99/monthly. Business-Class Hardware Through partnerships with leading manufacturers like HP, Dell and others, Tech-Zone provides new and certified (with warranty) business-class technology. Business owners and IT professionals are able to not only find support for issues like hardware repairs, technology refreshes and software upgrades, but also may purchase devices and hardware, such as rugged laptops, 3D printers, point-of-sale equipment, the latest tablets and more, not available in the big box stores. Aware of the fact that the average businessperson today carries almost three web-enabled devices, Tech-Zone is fully staffed and stocked to assist customers with their multitude of devices. Custom Business Solution \"Suites\" To ease the decision-making and shopping process for customers, Tech-Zone will be offering customized \"suites,\" which will be made up of the devices, peripherals and accessories from leading manufacturers like HP, Dell and others, bundled for specific job types. Each will have base and premium options to meet diverse budgets. This prototype store will have the following suites:  Executive Office  Mobile Sales Force or Real Estate Pro  Office Worker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:05:44.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
