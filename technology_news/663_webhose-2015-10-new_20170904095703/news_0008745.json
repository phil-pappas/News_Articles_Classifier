The board of directors recommends that the Company's shareholders and ADS holders vote FOR, among other things, the proposal to authorize and approve the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby (including the Merger). \nShareholders of record at the close of business in the Cayman Islands on November 2, 2015 will be entitled to attend and vote at the EGM.
