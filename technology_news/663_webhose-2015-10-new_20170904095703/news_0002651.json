With Halloween anticipation building, BoxOffice.com analyst Phil Contrino expects the film to lead the box office this weekend with $29 million in its 3,300-theater debut.\n“‘Goosebumps’ will run away with this weekend,” Contrino said. “People might be underestimating it.”\nWith impressive social-media activity and reviews, Contrino said the “Goosebumps” brand’s enduring popularity should give the film some generational appeal as well. Despite the family and Halloween theme similarities to “Hotel Transylvania 2,” Contrino said the market it wide open for another family film thanks to the poor performance of “Pan,” distributed by Viacom Inc.-owned VIAB, -0.26% Paramount Pictures.\nSee also: The problem with ‘Pan’: There are too many Peters flying around\nFandango’s “Fanticipation” metric, which measures online and mobile traffic, social-media buzz and advance ticket sales, indicates moviegoers are excited for this weekend, but more so for 20th Century Fox’s FOXA, -0.07% “The Martian.” The Matt Damon-led space epic has a 78 out of 100 point from Fandango, just above “Goosebumps” with 76 and other newcomers “Crimson Peak,” (75) and “Bridge of Spies,” (74).\nSee also: How Matt Damon could rocket NASA to Mars in real life\n“The Martian,” from director Ridley Scott, has enjoyed two straight weekends at No. 1, as well as much critical acclaim, fanfare, and it’s been at the center of countless Oscar discussions. Contrino expects the film will earn $24.5 million this weekend, putting its domestic gross at $146.5 million.\nWeekend top 10 box office estimates Rank Title Distributor Weekend estimate (millions) Estimated domestic gross (millions) 1 “Goosebumps” Sony $29.0 $29.0 2 “The Martian” Fox $24.5 $146.5 3 “Bridge of Spies” Disney $17.5 $17.5 4 “Crimson Peak” Universal $15.0 $15.0 5 “Hotel Transylvania 2” Sony $12.2 $12.2 6 “Pan” Warner Bros. $7.5 $7.5 7 “The Intern” Warner Bros. $6.2 $59.5 8 “Sicario” Lions Gate $4.8 $4.8 9 “Woodlawn” Pure Flix $4.0 $4.0 10 “Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials” Fox $3.2 $75.9 BoxOffice.com The Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.13% “Bridge of Spies,” which the studio produced for a reported $40 million, opens this weekend, shrouded in Oscar buzz. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg, written by Joel and Ethan Coen and stars Tom Hanks. Contrino expects this Cold War-era political drama to earn $17.5 million in its debut. “Bridge of Spies” is opening in about 2,800 theaters.\nUniversal Studios, owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.02% is laying its Halloween-flick card on the table this weekend as well, with the 2,800-theater release of Guillermo del Toro’s gothic horror “Crimson Peak.” Led by Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston, Contrino expects “Crimson Peak” will garner $15 million at the box office.\nSee also: Fandango hopes to bring virtual reality to movie theaters with new venture\n“Woodlawn,” the story of a talented high-school football player struggling with faith and racial tensions, will look to build off the success of recent faith-based films, such as Sony’s “War Room.” “Woodlawn,” from privately owned, Christian film company Pure Flix, stars Sean Astin. Contrino expects it’ll finish the weekend with $4 million.\nBoxOffice.com analysts project the weekend’s top 10 films will rake in about $123.9 million, up 8% from the same weekend a year ago when Sony’s “Fury,” starring Brad Pitt, led the box office with $23.7 million in its debut.\n“It’s going to be a real steady weekend. There is a solid slate of films in theaters,” Contrino said. “We just have to maintain this flow until that November weekend when ‘Spectre’ and ‘The Peanuts Movie’ come out [Nov. 6], and then it’s off to the races.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:00:30.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
