It must have been kept under wraps for quite some time. But how will it fare against other flagships already in the market such as Galaxy Note 5, Sony Xperia Z5 and the rest of the gang? Life sure is tough at the top… \nWith a body of 151 x 72 x 9.6 mm (5.94 x 2.83 x 0.38 in) and weighs 168 g (5.93 oz), it sure isn’t thin nor lightweight – more like your average smartphone. It has a premium all-metal body that features polished edges that are ergonomically tapered to effortlessly fit your grip. Its unibody back is curved to achieve the streamlined look and feel of the iconic HTC One series smartphones. \nThe One M9 Plus Supreme Camera will be sporting a 5.2-inch Quad HD Super LCD3 capacitive touchscreen that displays 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~565 ppi pixel density that makes for an excellent viewing. Feast your eyes on great-looking images and videos on the device. What’s more, there is also the fingerprint scanner for additional security. \nUnder the hood of the One M9 Plus Supreme Camera is some serious hardware running around. Mediatek MT6795T Helio X10 chipset paired with an Octa-core 2.2 GHz processor, PowerVR G6200 and 3GB RAM screams of a beast hiding inside its metal body. It will feel like a walk in the park to run all the latest apps and games that are out there. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the One M9 Plus Supreme Camera will be sporting a 21 Megapixel primary camera with 5248 x 3936, optical image stabilization, laser autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash, automatic simultaneous video and image recording, geo-tagging, face/smile detection, HDR and panorama.
