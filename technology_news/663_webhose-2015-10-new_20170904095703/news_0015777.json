Picture a Boomer’s take on Pimp My Ride : Some carts are souped up to look like Model Ts, fire trucks, or Thunderbirds, or colored to rep a hometown sports team. In a city with no native sons, the carts are expressions of identity.\nThey’re also a central mode of transportation. In The Villages, according to the book Young-Old: Urban Utopias of an Aging Society by architect Deane Simpson, there are 50,000 golf carts and 90 miles of dedicated golf-cart infrastructure. Autocentric facilities like drive-ins and car washes have been adapted. Golf-cart bridges and paths lead to golf-cart parking. One-third of trips, in this city of 110,000, are taken by cart.\nIn the video, one man boasts of selling his car. Another: “It is our main transportation.” A third Villager: “I could not live without my golf cart.”", "external_links": ["http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/young-old"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:55:30.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
