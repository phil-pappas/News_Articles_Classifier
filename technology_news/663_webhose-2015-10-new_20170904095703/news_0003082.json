In addition, field technicians doing a regular inspection or troubleshooting can use MXview ToGo to scan a QR code to view specific device information without connecting to a laptop computer. Also, by deploying the built-in device locator feature, users can trigger a particular device's LED to blink so they can quickly locate it out of hundreds of similar devices. \n\"Mobile users now outnumber desktop users, and we are seeing this trend expand into the industrial automation workplace,\" shared Richard Wood, product manager at Moxa Americas Inc. \"Since engineers joining the workforce today are accustomed to using mobile devices in their private life, it is only natural that they would want to use these same devices to simplify their work life with our MXview ToGo mobile app.\" \nAbout Moxa \nMoxa is a leading provider of industrial networking, computing, and automation solutions for enabling the Industrial Internet of Things.
