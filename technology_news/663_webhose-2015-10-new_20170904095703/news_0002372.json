In April, Amazon sued several sites that offered to produce reviews. \nIn the current litigation, the company is going after writers of the reviews themselves who have accounts on freelance marketplace Fiverr.com. They don't name them in the complaint because they're working to determine their identities. \nIn a statement Amazon says the complaint is not against Fiverr.com but against individuals selling reviews and says the vast majority of the reviews on its site are authentic. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
