The youngest would be spoiled, outgoing, and immature, while a middle child would be independent, rebellious, and relatively healthier. Of course, Adler was a middle child.\nThe idea that first-born children are smarter can be traced back to Francis Galton, a 19th-century scientist who worked in psychology, biology, and anthropology, among other fields. He noticed that a lot of his English scientist colleagues were first-born sons, and proposed that their intellectual success came from the resources and attention poured into them by their families. (First-born sons are the heirs, after all.)\nThe idea that birth order determines siblings' personality and intelligence remains entrenched in society, even as modern scientific findings on the matter have historically been inconsistent. But a couple of recent studies of large samples suggest that birth order does not matter when it comes to personality, and barely matters when it comes to intelligence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:51:39.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
