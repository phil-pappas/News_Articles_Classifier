FieldAware's mobile application on the Salesforce AppExchange provides customers with an enterprise-class solution for automating and optimizing field service operations. The integration leverages FieldAware's Application Programming Interface (API) to combine mobile field service functionality with Salesforce's cloud-based CRM capabilities. The integrated solution was shown for the first time at Dreamforce 2015. \nFieldAware's made-for-mobile application automates field service processes to increase productivity, revenue and safety while at a job site. It provides a flexible mobile architecture and customizable workflow for all functions in the work order life cycle, including work order and asset management, job scheduling, time tracking, quotes and invoicing. The integration enables customers to synchronize their Salesforce and FieldAware data in real-time, allowing users of either system to create, read, update and delete transactional data (i.e., sales orders and jobs). Workflows can be adjusted and synchronized across both platforms immediately, and Salesforce users can push changes in customer data and job information in real-time to FieldAware. \n\"Businesses that provide field services are undergoing a transformation in order to gain better visibility into their service operations by empowering field workers with mobile technology at the customer site. As a result, companies can remain competitive by reducing service errors, controlling service costs and providing exceptional customer service.

It improves productivity, accuracy and efficiency, which ultimately enables us to provide a better customer experience,\" said Michael O'Leary, Chief Financial Officer at The Cross Group, an industrial HVAC services provider and an existing FieldAware customer. \n\"Companies are looking to transform the way they connect with customers, partners and employees to thrive in today's connected world,\" said Ryan Ellis, VP, Product Management, AppExchange, Salesforce. \"By leveraging the power of the Salesforce App Cloud, FieldAware provides customers with the proven social, mobile and connected cloud technologies to accelerate business success.\" \nKey Benefits: When a work order is received, the job is automatically scheduled.
