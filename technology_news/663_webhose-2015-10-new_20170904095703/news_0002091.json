Embryos can be implanted a long time after fertilisation, which enables the babies to be brought to term at a time of environmental plenty. And, when they are born, they will be afforded the protection of the dominant male in the social group, even though some (or all) of them might not be his. \nThe amazing research, conducted by zoologists from the School of Natural Sciences at Trinity College Dublin, vets at UCD, and scientists at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), has just been published in leading international journal PLOS ONE . The journal article can be viewed here. \nAssociate Professor of Zoology at Trinity, Dr Nicola Marples, co-authored the paper. She said: \"It's amazing to think that only five species in the world have evolved this ability to maintain several different embryos at different stages of development at the same time. It seems such a useful trick for the female to play!\" \nUnderstanding when and why badgers move between territories provides key insights into how populations mix. This is extremely valuable information from a conservation perspective, because it may help researchers design an effective TB vaccination programme. \nPhD Researcher in Zoology at Trinity, and co-author on the paper, Lynsey Stuart, added: \"Studying badger movement is imperative to improving our knowledge of the diseases they carry, including tuberculosis. This type of research will aid in the effective delivery of a vaccine against tuberculosis, helping badgers and cattle alike.\" \nBadgers can harbour TB and inadvertently pass the disease to cows, which results in cattle farmers losing millions of euro each year. As such, a well-designed vaccination programme should provide a win-win situation. Europe's largest badger study finds rare long-distance movements March 7, 2014 \nAnimal movement is a key part of population ecology, helping us understand how species use their environment and maintain viable populations. In many territorial species, most movements occur within a home range. Occasionally, ... New selective badger cull risks spreading bovine TB June 9, 2014 \nA new bovine TB control strategy to be piloted in Northern Ireland risks spreading the disease rather than supressing it, scientists warn. Zoologists tap into GPS to track badger movements March 31, 2015 \nZoologists from Trinity College Dublin's School of Natural Sciences are using GPS tracking technology to keep a 'Big Brother' eye on badgers in County Wicklow. By better understanding the badgers' movements and the reasons ... Bovine TB infection depends on feedback between cattle and badgers May 14, 2015 \nBovine tuberculosis (BTB) is an infectious disease affecting cattle and badgers. New research from the Universities of Bristol and Cambridge has found that BTB is most likely to be nearly under control in both species taken ... Recommended for you Cyanobacteria can efficiently harvest sunlight with smart antenna October 15, 2015 \nCyanobacteria have an interesting trick to harvest sunlight during light fluctuations. In darkness, the cells prepare for a subsequent increase in light intensity by adopting a larger light-harvesting antenna. Researchers ... Oxytocin nose-drop brings marmoset partners closer October 14, 2015 \nResearchers from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, show for the first time that common marmosets—Callithrix jacchus, a species of New World monkey—that receive oxytocin in nose-drops attract more social interaction ... Biodiversity stabilizes ecosystems during climate extremes October 14, 2015 \nCan biodiversity help protect ecosystems from extreme conditions? That question is much on the minds of scientists and policy makers as a changing climate brings more wildly swinging conditions at the same time human activities ... Deadly bacteria stiff-arm the immune system October 14, 2015 \nThe most severe Group A Streptococcus (strep) infections are often the work of one particularly nefarious strain known as M1T1, named in part for the type of tentacle-like M protein projecting from the bacterium's surface. ... Divorce in birds is affected by their social group October 14, 2015 \nWhether a pair of birds will divorce or stay together after they first breed is influenced by the social environment in which the relationship is formed, according to a new study by researchers from Oxford University. Mutational 'hot spot' leads to adaptation in high-altitude birds October 14, 2015 \nNew research led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of New Mexico has pinpointed changes in a single, mutation-prone gene site that ultimately allow wrens to breathe easy in the rarefied air of the Andes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:51:05.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
