The new sensors -- the Vernier Flash Photolysis Spectrometer, Pressure Sensor 400, and Platinum-Cell Conductivity Probe -- offer instructors and students greater versatility for conducting laboratory investigations. \nThe Vernier Flash Photolysis Spectrometer is a simple, user-friendly and compact tabletop instrument for demonstrating the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and photochemistry during experiments that involve excited-state dynamics, triplet-decay analysis, time-resolved phosphorescence, and more. It includes a 600 nm filter that measures the absorption and emission changes over time of a photoexcited sample at a single wavelength. The Vernier Flash Photolysis Spectrometer also includes free software and downloadable experiments. \n\"Transient absorption spectroscopy is typically an expensive technique, making it inaccessible to college students; however, our new Flash Photolysis Spectrometer is priced at one-fifteenth of the typical educator price for this type of technology, making it more readily available for undergraduate labs,\" said Melissa Hill, Ph.D., chemistry staff scientist at Vernier Software & Technology. \"Our new spectrometer is the first one of its kind designed specifically for educational use. Best of all, it gives the student an accurate, reproducible kinetic trace of a photocatalyzed reaction with 100 microsecond resolution that can be obtained with free software and easily analyzed with our Logger Pro software.\" \nThe Pressure Sensor 400 provides an optimal sensor for conducting physical and analytical chemistry experiments, such as approximating the adiabatic expansion of a gas, Charles' law experiments, and gas law investigations. It measures absolute pressures from 0 to 400 kPa and also operates with great accuracy over a wide temperature range. The robust metal fittings allow for a tight, leak-proof seal to the reaction apparatus. \nThe plug-and-play Platinum-Cell Conductivity Probe allows high school and college chemistry students alike to explore the various properties of conductivity in a wide variety of solutions such as stronger acids and bases, as well as non-aqueous solutions. It also allows students to explore the dependence of conductivity on temperature. The 2-cell, glass-insulated platinum sensing element and epoxy body of this electrode ensures greater chemical compatibility and accuracy, making it ideal for a variety of chemistry experiments, including two free experiments available on Vernier's website. \nThe Vernier Flash Photolysis Spectrometer ($5,400), Pressure Sensor 400 ($189), and Platinum-Cell Conductivity Probe ($149) are all currently available for purchase. \nTo learn more, visit www.vernier.com . \nAbout Vernier Software & Technology Vernier Software & Technology has been a leading innovator of scientific data-collection technology for 34 years.
