New product launches and cheaper prices will lure a flood of customers for a whole week. \nThe excitement never stops. Then there are traffic jams to encounter. Organisers expect a bumper show as residents and visitors to the emirate hope to walk away with some bargains for their hard-earned dirhams. \nGadget-crazy residents will be on the look-out for smarter, cheaper and faster devices that don't blow a hole in the pocket. Gitex Shopper this year will be all about driving the need for connectivity, because no matter where we are, we are always in touch. \nPeople now view technology and its devices as necessities as the UAE continues to benefit from private consumption and high business confidence in the economy. \nAll major brands are here in full force and sales are expected to top the Dh259 million made last year. Visitors are being pulled in by Dh3 million in prizes. There are also scholarships on offer and cars to drive away. \nThis is a technology carnival that celebrates life. Where else can you find it but in Dubai? Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T15:58:10.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
