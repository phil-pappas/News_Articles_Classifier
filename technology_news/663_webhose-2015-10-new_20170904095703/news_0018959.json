It is not only space-saving and cost-effective, but enables two important measurements to be monitored using a single port.\nWith no silicon oil, the new EPTTE3100 combined sensor features a well proven thin-film strain gauge pressure measuring cell for safe and reliable operation whilst the PT1000 platinum resistance element provides linear temperature measurement with proven reliability and long term stability.\nThe new sensor is fully sealed to IP67 and is housed in a high strength stainless steel for maximum durability. With a 22mm diameter and overall length around 60mm, the sensor’s compact dimensions are complemented with a choice of industry standard M10 or 1/8” NPT pressure port interfaces and a 600mm sheathed electrical connection cable for ease of installation. Nine pressure measuring ranges between 0.6 and 25 bar are available with a ratiometric output signal of 0.5-4.5V, whilst temperature measurement is from -50 to +150°C with Class B accuracy.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/Varihom_VAR188_EPTTE3100_Image-2100x1377.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:04:17.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
