Source: Supplied\nTelstra has finally launched Telstra TV, its much-hyped TV streaming service, which the telco says is designed to complement the pay-TV offering of Foxtel rather than drive customers away.\nJoe Pollard, Telstra’s chief marketing officer and group executive of media, told The Australian Telstra TV was likely to attract more customers to Telstra’s 50-per cent owned Foxtel.\n“If we can use Telstra TV to get people into the pay-TV ecosystem, then hopefully we will turn them into pay-TV junkies, move them up the ladder and sell them Foxtel,” Ms Pollard said.\nShe said given the price point of Telstra TV, it was likely the product would sit comfortably with Foxtel’s iQ set-top boxes.\nTelstra TV, priced at $109 per streaming player, aggregates 15 services, including subscription video-on-demand services (Netflix, Presto), television catch-up services (SBS on Demand, PLUS7 and 9JumpIn), Telstra’s on-demand BigPond movie service and apps such as YouTube.\n“That content experience is very different to the Foxtel proposition, which includes live sport and premium content,” Ms Pollard said. “So, if you are a content junkie, then (Telstra TV) will sit on top of your stack.”\nBigPond Movies and Presto will be unmetered on Telstra Home Broadband at home, while data usage charges will apply for other uses. The device is included as part of selected Telstra large and extra large broadband bundles. The Telstra TV proposition is driven by a key partnership between the telco and US-based videostreaming device maker Roku, which is providing the hardware. Telstra’s service will be delivered on the Roku 2 device, which Ms Pollard said combined flexible hardware with an easy-to-use interface.\nWhile Roku 2 is a relatively old device — Roku 4 recently launched in the US — Ms Pollard said the Roku partnership meant the entire product portfolio of the US company could at some point be integrated into Telstra TV.\n“We have the optionality to have the first look at all of Roku’s devices, and as their road map evolves we will look at the next generation of Roku, the Roku dongle and hopefully bring a whole suite of these devices to market,” she said.\nThe Roku 2 lacks a built-in tuner, a deficiency some say could hinder adoption, but Ms Pollard said the issue was likely to be smoothed out over time.\nThe launch of the service was originally scheduled for September, and while the device was ready, Ms Pollard said the way in which it was offered to customers had to be streamlined.\n“What we wanted to do when we brought it to market was (offer the choice of) a stand-alone option for an existing customer or as part of a bundle.”\nTelstra TV will be available from Tuesday, October 27.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/15/1227570/856217-3f3b0730-7312-11e5-8a80-5a407624b6b3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:46:52.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
