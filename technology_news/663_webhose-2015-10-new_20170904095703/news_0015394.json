Details of pledges on reducing greenhouse gas emissions \nThe Paris pact would be the first to unite all the world's nations in a single arena for reining in global warming and helping vulnerable nations cope with its impact. \n\"The most difficult issues remain the same as before,\" the European Union's top climate negotiator, Elina Bardram, told AFP on Thursday, summing up the first four days. \nAfter more than two decades of negotiations, she said, it still boils down to one fundamental disagreement: \"How do you divide responsibilities between developed and developing countries?\" \nAs negotiators bickered, US scientists reported Thursday that the first nine months of 2015 had been the warmest on record worldwide. \nVoluntary national pledges to reduce greenhouse emissions have gone part of the way towards the UN goal of capping warming at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above the mid-19th century benchmark. \nBargaining chips \nBut how to fill the remaining \"emissions gap\" remains highly contentious, with developing countries reluctant to set more ambitious goals unless rich nations provide guarantees of finance. \nThat money would go towards easing their transition away from cheap and abundant coal to cleaner energy, and for shoring up defences against the impact of climate change . US scientists say the first nine months of 2015 was the warmest on record worldwide \nMoney, said negotiators and observers, remains the most obstinate hurdle. \nA promise made at a tumultuous 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen to provide $100 billion (90 billion euros) in annual assistance to developing nations from 2020 was devoid of detail. \nHow much will be for curbing emissions and how much for boosting resilience? Can the money be from grants or loans, or the private sector? All these points remain undecided. \n\"We shouldn't be waiting for a miracle on finance here,\" France's climate ambassador Laurence Tubiana said of the talks in Bonn. Analysts say there has been little progress at the climate talks in Bonn \nThe job of negotiators in the former West German capital is to provide a manageable framework for ministers and top leaders to work out political compromises to give the final pact teeth. \nHistorically, this only happens at the 11th hour of climate conferences, if at all. \n\"Parties are still holding back their bargaining chips,\" Kaiser told AFP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:20:55.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
