Some users colors to make this even clearer to the user. \nThe most recent version of Firefox Nightly, currently at version 44, ships with a change that notifies Firefox users when pages with password inputs are not protected by https. \nThe new \"insecure\" lock icon in the address bar highlights that the connection to the site is not secure and that data that is entered on the site may be captured by third-parties because of that. \nThe warning is displayed on login pages that use http and not https, even if the form itself uses https. The reason for that is that scripts may still intercept what has been entered on the page before submit is clicked on in the browser. \nA click on the icon highlights the same fact as you can see on the screenshot above. \nThe new feature catches this only if <input type=\"password\"> fields are used. Sites could avoid the message by changing the input type, but that would have other consequences. Still, it is best to use it as another indicator but not as a sure-fire way of making sure that a login page is properly protected. \nYou are probably wondering when this will land in release versions of Firefox . Please note that all development feature may change or be removed entirely before they reach the stable version of Firefox. \nIf things go as planned, Firefox Stable users should see the new notifications on January 26, 2016 when stable versions of Firefox reach version 44. \nNow You : Do you pay attention to whether sites use https or not?
