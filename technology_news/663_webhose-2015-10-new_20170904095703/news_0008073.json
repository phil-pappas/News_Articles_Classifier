As a pioneer in the field of container handling, ECT has made history here. This is where container handling in Rotterdam started and matured. \n“Ever-larger vessels constantly require deeper and deeper ports and more modern facilities. At our ECT Delta Terminal and Euromax Terminal Rotterdam, situated directly on the North Sea, we are able to meet that demand and we are constantly investing there.” \nThe ECT site, covering 65 ha, will retain its port-related use. The Port Authority has plans to redevelop the site for use by businesses in the vicinity, as well as for new activities. It expects to be making further announcements about this in the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:42:39.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
