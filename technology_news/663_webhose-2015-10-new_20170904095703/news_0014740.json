Trimble, managing principal of Morzine Medical. “This is a game-changer for Morzine. It is also an acknowledgement that the Doak Table is the benchmark for a mobile, lightweight and compact operating platform.”\nBy year’s end, the Atlanta-based company he runs projects construction of 70 of these lightweight, but sturdy surgical tables designed to be used in non-traditional medical care settings, such as the battlefield or in the aftermath of a catastrophic event.\nThe Doak Table — named for the inventor’s father, a military surgeon — will be used as the standard operating table for all the far forward surgical teams in one branch of the military. Trimble believes that it is only a matter of time before the other branches adopt the Doak Table as well.\nMark W.
