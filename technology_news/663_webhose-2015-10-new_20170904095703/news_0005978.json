When I reflect back on my decision to start The Squires Group 20 years ago, the one thing that has consistently guided me over the years has been our vision – to be the most trusted talent solutions partner for our clients and consultants. This vision has guided me in making many key decisions--like who to hire, what specialty areas to focus on and which companies to partner with,” says Nancy Squires. “The first 20 years in the business have been incredible. I share the credit of making it to this list with my business partner, Eric Galasso (President of TSGi), the wonderful team we have in place to deliver service to clients and consultants, and our consultants who continuously strive to deliver on our client’s goals and mission.”\nThis year’s finalists will be profiled in the November/ December issue of Baltimore SmartCEO magazine and celebrated at an awards ceremony on November 17, 2015 at the Baltimore Harbor Hotel.\nAbout SmartCEO\nSmartCEO’s mission is to educate and inspire the business community through its award winning magazine, connections at C-level events and access to valuable online resources.
