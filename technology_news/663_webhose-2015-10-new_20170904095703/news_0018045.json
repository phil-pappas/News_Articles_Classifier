Same store sales continue to be impacted by our decision to exit video game products, digital cameras, and certain tablets. Excluding the impact from these products, same store sales for the month increased 5.7%. Results early in the month were led by solid Labor Day weekend sales, which drove the furniture, mattress, and TV categories.\" \n\"For the month of September, excluding the impact from video game products and digital cameras, same store sales for consumer electronics increased by 0.9%. Same store sales in the television category increased 1.2% on higher average selling prices as a result of an increase in the proportion of television sales from Ultra HD televisions, partially offset by lower same store unit sales. Same store unit sales increased in the furniture and mattress category, partially offset by lower average selling prices.
