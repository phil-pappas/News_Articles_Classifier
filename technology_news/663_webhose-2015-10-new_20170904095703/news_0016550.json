Dash serves guests in a Silicon Valley hotel, while OSHbot works as a retail assistant in downtown San Jose, California. Only they’re not people. They are the first of a new breed of mobile, semi-intelligent robots designed to assist customers and work alongside human employees in shops, hotels and hospitals – and perhaps ultimately even replace them.\nRelated: The ethics of AI: how to stop your robot cooking your cat\nIndustrial robots have been working in factories for decades. These large, static machines carry out the same tasks over and over, with little interaction with their surroundings or human workmates. In contrast, robots designed for service or retail need to be able to interact with (or at least avoid) shoppers and staff, as well cope with unpredictable situations such as abandoned shopping carts and wet floors.\n“The technology is finally ready to handle buildings with large corridors and repeating tasks,” says Steve Cousins, CEO of Savioke , the Silicon Valley startup that built Dash. “There’s an opportunity in the service industry to go where there are very few robots right now.”\nHow large that opportunity might be, no one really knows. An estimated 134,500 professional service robots will be sold between 2014-2017, according to the International Federation of Robotics, although retail robots are likely to represent just a tiny fraction of that number.\nLooking further ahead, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University predict that around half of all jobs in the US are likely to be automated over the next decade or two. By their calculations , two jobs at high risk of being computerised are retail salesperson, with a 92% chance, and hotel desk clerk, at 94%.\nThe job killer The OSHbot, designed by another local startup called Fellow Robots , could not look less like a fearsome job killer. Its swooping five-foot high frame has no intimidating arms or threatening pincers, just a pair of large LCD screens displaying in-store offers. Above its squat head, a cardboard sign perched jauntily on a wooden stick reads “Hi there! Need help?”\nThe OSHbot Photograph: Mark Harris I wander over, press the microphone icon on its front screen and say, “I’m looking for a screwdriver.” In a flash, the screen updates to show all the screwdrivers in stock. When I press one of the images, I get a larger picture of the screwdriver and a map showing its location. “Would you like me to take you there?” asks the OSHbot. I hit a button and the robot rolls slowly off.\nThen it stops, wobbles for a second and says “Hmmm …” three times. We set off again and make it almost as far as the plumbing section before the OSHbot veers to one side and crashes gently into a shelf of heating ducts.\n“We’re having a few bugs!” says an enthusiastic young man, popping out of a door at the back of the shop. He introduces himself as Thavidu Ranatunga, Fellow Robots’ chief information officer.\nHe walks me back to an office next to the human’s lunch room, where the second OSHbot stands, partially dismantled, beside a laptop computer. On the computer screen, we see what the malfunctioning OSHbot sees. There is a grainy video image of aluminium ducting and a graphical representation of the map it has built up with its on-board lidar laser ranging system. The problem is that the robot’s map has become slightly misaligned to the actual aisles, so Ranatunga just reboots it.\nThere is currently someone from Fellow Robots stationed at the shop for OSHbot’s three-hour shift each day, fixing bugs and observing how staff and customers interact with it. “Sometimes people only want the robot, and sometimes they only want people,” says Ranatunga. “That’s part of the learning for this pilot phase. It was never intended to replace human workers. It’s more of a moving kiosk.”\nWith the robot back up and running, we follow it to the screwdrivers, then to the compost bins, and finally to an aisle where inventory specialist Monica Gonzalez, a seven-year veteran of Orchard Supply Hardware, is checking how many tap washers are in stock. “Right now, I’m going round marking them so we know which shelves are empty,” she tells me. “But soon the robot’s going to do that for me. It’ll give me more time to do other things I’m supposed to be doing that I don’t have time to do now. If it works, it’ll make my job a little easier.”\nFor OSHbot to scan shelves, it will need an upgrade to its video system. Better cameras and visual processing will also help it carry out one of its original intended functions: scanning random hardware presented by customers and finding a matching product on the shelves. The OSHbot has enough battery power to work for 11 hours straight, and can then navigate autonomously back to its dock to recharge at night. Assistant manager Gilbert Sierraz says he would like to have one robot for each of the shop’s six departments.\nRoom service please! Over at the Crowne Plaza Silicon Valley hotel, Dash is equally popular with staff. “I was hoping he’d be able to shoot stuff under doors,” says Arnie Garcia. “He can’t do that but he’s still saving me time. I don’t think he’s going to take my job.”\nDash the robot Photograph: Mark Harris Dash is small and cute, a dustbin-shaped R2-D2 to the OSHbot’s gawky C-3PO. When a clerk taps in a passcode on an LCD screen, Dash’s lid flips up to accommodate toothbrushes, soap or (at a squeeze) a small pillow. The clerk enters a room number and Dash zips off to the lifts. He can call for a ride wirelessly, his screen excitedly flashing “I’m on a delivery!” as he dodges guests and housekeeping trolleys. Dash does bump softly into an empty beer glass left outside one door, however, which delays him for a moment before he scoots neatly around it.\nWhen Dash reaches his destination, the phone inside the room rings to announce his arrival. Dash then detects the door opening and pops his lid to reveal his cargo. The guest is prompted to rate his service, with a five-star rating earning a trill of delight and a little droid dance from Dash.\n“Dash has been here for two months,” says David Wang, the hotel’s director of sales. “At the beginning, we didn’t want to use him on the weekends as the crowd is a little more rowdy. We worried they might have a couple of drinks and bump him over or scratch him, and injure our investment. But we haven’t had any problems.”\nWang’s eventual goal is to have Dash deliver items from an expanded gift shop. In the meantime, he and Savioke are working on a social mode where Dash will scoot around the lobby greeting guests. “It’s more about adding value than reducing head count,” says Wang. “No matter what, we’re always going to have a front desk agent.”\nBut some roboticists are less certain about the long-term prospects for human employees. “You often walk into a clothes store and there’s just a 20-year old behind a desk playing with her iPhone,” says Mike Rogero, chief operating officer of Robots LAB, a robotics retailer from San Francisco. He is developing a robot that can scan a tag on any garment in a shop and use algorithms to decide whether it will suit an individual’s body type.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rogero’s fashion retailer robot Photograph: Mark Harris\nThe robot will then recommend only trousers that flatter, or a top to match what the person might have purchased six months previously. “It’s a persuasion engine,” says Rogero. “And it can more than double spending per year on average.” Rogero’s robots are about to be deployed at German retailer Ulla Popken, with stores in France, the Netherlands and the US following next year.\nRogero is one of dozens of exhibitors at the RoboBusiness 15 conference also held in September in San Jose. Other companies at the conference are showing robotic arms that can work for days at a time , autonomous forklift trucks for warehouses and humanoid concierge robots to replace receptionists. Their vision seems a world away from Dash and OSHbot. So will robots become trusted assistants taking care of dull, dirty drudge work? Or are they destined to replace humans in all but the most obscure and highly regulated professions?\nWhatever the future holds, it is arriving quicker than might be imagined, according to Steve Cousins. “We’re not really thinking of the next robots, we’re thinking of how we can get Dash into as many hotels and other places in the service industry as makes sense,” he says.", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=bab43f38a9f737546f5f87a3d70e3c74", "http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf", "http://www.ifr.org/service-robots/statistics/", "https://www.aldebaran.com/en", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=5bcc8d396fddab576c25d7689022e0d5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401ab9afe18a11441e3e4dfadce19f2c114d57e0/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=809ba002bd1aaf5aecba52abce5f311a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401ab9afe18a11441e3e4dfadce19f2c114d57e0/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9161bf1f8ae023d1149cc1b526a5b5ef", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401ab9afe18a11441e3e4dfadce19f2c114d57e0/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=8ad9549f5379b3c6d7673804d43279ac", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpyq%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpyq&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb%2F0_0_6000_4000%2F6000.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401ab9afe18a11441e3e4dfadce19f2c114d57e0/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d01490563e50ee5a0a95fa35283e2bc2", "http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/sawyer-intera-3/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4bd89dc8dd49f8af1fd534acdc1aef45cd092/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=6b7c376aba0532c637d670f30acd1b1f", "http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/otto/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4eeb11c018bbcef8fd77c54c5792e8a1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401ab9afe18a11441e3e4dfadce19f2c114d57e0/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ac8ffca23caba937af7351721a46cbd4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f6eb68280d452f9d993c9b1f6cf75e14", "http://www.savioke.com/", "http://fellowrobots.com/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4bd89dc8dd49f8af1fd534acdc1aef45cd092/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f6ac83516816744df6ba7509c9efdd56", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Meet%20Dash%20and%20OSHbot%3A%20the%20robot%20workers%20who%20might%20steal%20your%20job&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpyq%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4bd89dc8dd49f8af1fd534acdc1aef45cd092/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3ec33d103d5f3eede52e4a5ab1fa16ce", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4bd89dc8dd49f8af1fd534acdc1aef45cd092/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=63e900c12404a08f6e3d57a1fefdee9b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=43d36e84ef3b1d2e89ee7e0f289dc0d0", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Meet+Dash+and+OSHbot%3A+the+robot+workers+who+might+steal+your+job&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsustainable-business%2F2015%2Foct%2F02%2Frobot-workers-silicon-valley-dash-oshbot-steal-job&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F751c10796b099b5cc994859b1338625330f069eb%2F0_0_6000_4000%2F6000.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4bd89dc8dd49f8af1fd534acdc1aef45cd092/0_0_444_666/master/444.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=57035e2155365c523ca7dccdf97bce65"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:27:24.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
