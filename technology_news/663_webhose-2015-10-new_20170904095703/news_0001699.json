CNBC reported that major retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and Macy’s are taking steps to ensure that online orders will get to consumers faster this year. \nAs part of the fulfillment planning, some retailers are building bigger warehouses to facilitate shipments, or sending orders directly to online customers from brick-and-mortar stores, or using sophisticated software that analyzes the fastest and cheapest method of shipping for orders. Walmart has opened five new warehouses in the past year, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Fort Worth, Texas; Plainfield, Indiana; and Atlanta, all in order to process online orders more efficiently. They are opening two additional warehouses in Florida next year. \nHome Depot also opened a new warehouse in Troy, Ohio, in September, the largest of its three warehouses, that together will allow the retailer to provide two day shipping to 90 percent of its shoppers. And Macy’s recently opened a new facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that enables the retailer to deliver 90 percent of packages in the central western states within 48 hours. \nTarget also opened two new warehouses this year, and has increased the number of brick-and-mortar stores that process online orders from 150 to 462, and has launched a program that notifies shoppers of precise delivery dates for their orders. \nAnd Nordstrom opened a 3 rd warehouse in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, to help process online orders that will complete deliver in two days for half of its customers. \nAmazon has also implemented robots in its warehouses to reduce processing time. “The Amazon fulfillment teams are dedicated to innovating in our fulfillment centers to increase speed of delivery while enabling greater local selection at lower costs for our customers,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations and customer service. \nReducing the order-to-delivery time is crucial for retailers, as consumers turn increasingly to online shopping . Forrester Research predicts that online sales will increase 12 percent to $371 billion this year, or 10 percent of overall retail sales. But shoppers are also demanding faster delivery. \nAmazon Prime offers two-day delivery on many items, many retailers are striving to meet the demands of shoppers for speedy service by making two-day delivery standard. That's half the average for standard delivery for the top 40 online retailers , according to data company StellaService . But most are stopping short of guaranteeing customers faster deliveries. \nIt’s a thin line to tread, however, since Forrester Research, for example, has found that, in general, shoppers are more interested in keeping prices low than in fast delivery, although they do want their holiday orders to arrive in time. \nThe key is finding the balance between providing quick delivery and keeping those costs low enough to continue to entice shoppers.
