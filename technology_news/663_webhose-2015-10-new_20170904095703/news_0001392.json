There’s a good chance that you recently received a new credit or debit card in the mail with an interesting little chip embedding into the card. Or possibly, you tried to swipe your card at checkout, it didn’t go through and you were instructed to insert it into a “chip” reader. This is because of a technology that’s being adopted nationwide by major card issuers. The square, metallic chip appearing on the front of cards is another security layer that is in place to help reduce fraud.\nAside from the appearance of the card, the chip also changes the way you make in-store purchases. Instead of swiping your card, you’re inserting into a chip reader and leaving it there for a couple of seconds until it tells you to remove it. So, how is this different than swiping the magnetic strip on the back of your card? The chip is creating a unique code for each purchase. It’s good only for that transaction and since the code is constantly changing, your information is more difficult to steal. Some cards will continue to require a signature, while others will move to the more secure PIN. The Federal Reserve has previously reported that Chip and PIN cards are 700 percent more secure than Chip and Signature.\nThough chip technology may reduce fraud on in-store purchases, it does not change the way your card functions online, by phone or by form (any time the card is not physically present or inserted into the chip reader). Here are some reminders for safe practices when online shopping:\nAvoid public Wi-Fi networks. Be cautious making purchases from a public computer or Wi-Fi network like a library, airport or coffee shop. If you are making transactions on public Wi-Fi, only do it through encrypted sites, always log out after the transaction and don’t use the same password across different websites.\nLook for https. That little “s” after “http” is a good indicator that the site is probably a safe place to enter your credit card. Make sure you see https on every page you visit, not just the welcome page and especially on the page where you enter financial information.\nThink twice before shopping on an app. It can be difficult to determine an app’s security because they don’t carry the visual “https” indicator. According to the FTC, researchers have found that many mobile apps don’t encrypt information properly. When in doubt, go to the company’s mobile website (and look for https) rather than shopping through their app.\nDon’t store card information. If a site asks you to store credit card information, don’t to it, even on a personal computer or your phone. If you do store information, be sure to log out of accounts. If you have credit card information stored on accounts in your phone, you may want to change the settings on your mobile device so it doesn’t automatically connect to nearby Wi-Fi.\nDon’t email credit card information. Email is not a secure way to send your credit card information over the Internet. It should be transmitted via a secure website (https). Of course, security is not ensured just because a site has you fill out a form and appears to have a legitimate URL. The key here is to be suspicious of any company that requests you email credit card information.\nGo with the credit card. Credit cards offer more protection than your debit card. Use them for online transactions, especially if it is a site you are not overly familiar with.\nMonitor activity. No matter what new fraud prevention technology comes our way, you should always do you due diligence. Check credit card activity regularly, review statements line-by-line, and check your credit report annually for any errors or suspicious activity.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:03:11.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
