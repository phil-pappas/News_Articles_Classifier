The new service is an advanced, multi-layered protection solution that helps shield consumers from sophisticated and evolving threats across all platforms. Norton Security Premium is also available with secure PC cloud backup to provide extra protection against ransomware attacks and help ensure photos, address books and important files don’t get lost.“Today our digital lives are central to the way we connect, interact and transact,” said Mark Gorrie, Director, Norton Business Unit, Pacific region, Symantec. “We live in a world where cybercriminals are working overtime trying to find new ways to steal personal information. At Norton, we want to give people confidence - whether they’re sharing photos online or shopping from a smartphone - that Norton Security Premium is working behind the scenes to keep their information and their devices protected.”“Our goal is for consumers to go about their digital lives without the fear of having their computers, smartphones, and tablets compromised in any way. The changes we’re making to Norton are designed to keep us one step ahead of the cybercriminals and help keep information safe without sacrificing the performance of smartphones, tablets or laptops,” Gorrie added. According to Symantec’s latest Internet Security Threat Report, there were nearly one million new threats released into the wild each day and crypto-ransomware threats increased by more than 4,000 percent in 2014. It’s increasingly important for consumers to take steps to protect themselves in this highly complex and connected world, no matter what device they are using. Norton Security Premium delivers a seamless, easy-to-use service that takes advantage of Symantec technologies and intelligence to protect consumers from today’s advanced threats.Norton Security Premium is a single service that protects PCs and Macs, as well as Android smartphones and tablets, iPhones and iPads. Some of the key features of Norton Security Premium include: Best-In-Class Performance and Protection: According to three separate third-party tests conducted in the last year, Norton Security Premium is not only the fastest security product [i]; but it also scored 100 percent in “time-to-protect” [ii] by blocking all malware attacks on day one; and scored 100 percent in “vulnerability protection.” In addition, Norton and Symantec protect more than one billion systems, scan more than 30 percent of the world’s email traffic, review more than eight billion email messages and protect more than 135 million consumers every day. Beyond Just Antivirus: Norton Security Premium builds on patented innovations like Insight, SONAR and threat monitoring with aggressive threat detection techniques that enable it to identify even the most resistant threats. In addition, Safe Web, Scam Insight, Download Insight, and Anti-Phishing technologies share information with one another to determine if a site is being used as part of a new social-engineered attack scam. Norton Family Premier: Keeping kids safe online should not be the end of their freedom but the start of an open conversation about building smart and healthy online habits. Norton Security Premium 3 and 5 devices includes all the advanced features of Norton Family Premier to help prevent kids from sharing too much information online or accessing inappropriate content and to balance the time spent on their devices. Backup precious files and images: Norton Security Premium offers consumers the option to backup and save their personal files, photos, videos and other memories on their PCs.
