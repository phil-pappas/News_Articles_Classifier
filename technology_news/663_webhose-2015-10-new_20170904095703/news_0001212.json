For the speaker to survive water, the door must be closed and no cables can be connected.\nUnder the door are a microUSB port for charging the battery, a 3.5 mm aux-in port and a full-size USB port that is used to charge portable electronics like your phone from the speaker’s battery.\nI did find the BRV-Pro would turn itself on when paired with my iPhone 6s. I’d turn it off, and a few minutes later it would power back on again.\nIt was a bit strange. The powering on stopped when I unpaired the phone and speaker.\nPros: Small, rugged, easy to use, nice accessories\nCons: Small sound, expensive\nBottom Line: Waterproof is good, but Braven has other speakers that sound better if you can keep them dry.\nAltec Lansing LifeJacket 2\nI’ve known about the Altec Lansing audio brand for years, but this is my first experience with the Bluetooth speakers.\nThe LifeJacket 2 is a beefy speaker, weighing in at 2 pounds and measuring 7.5 by 3.12 by 2.82 inches.\nThe speaker is IP67 rated to be waterproof, sand-proof, snow-proof, dustproof, shockproof, and it floats.\nThe LifeJacket 2 has a built-in voice that clearly states the unit is powering on or off and when it’s paired. I couldn’t find a way to disable the voice status updates, which is a bit annoying.\nThere are only three buttons on the top of the LifeJacket 2, volume up and down and a power button that also accepts or ends calls and invokes Siri (press three times).\nAround back, a small rubber door conceals the microUSB (charging port), aux-in and USB port for charging your phone.\nLike the Braven, the LifeJacket 2 is only waterproof if you have the port door closed and sealed.\nOn the bottom is a one-fourth-inch threaded accessory mount point. My LifeJacket 2 came with a handlebar mount, but it should also work with any other action mount with a one-fourth-inch threaded screw, like a tripod mount.\nPros: Very tough, dust proof, included mount\nCons: Big, heavy.\nBottom Line: Seems to be ready for anything you can throw at it.\nReal-life use\nThe speakers are remarkably similar, but they do have some differences.\nThe Altec Lansing is dustproof while the Braven is not.\nI’ve listed each speaker’s IP (ingress protection) rating.\nThe Braven’s IPX7 rating means no dust or solid object protection, but it’s protected against water immersion up to 1 meter deep.\nThe LifeJacket 2’s IP67 means totally protected against dust and water immersion up to 1 meter.\nWireless range for playing music was pretty similar, despite there being a big difference in stated range.\nThe Braven lists up to 100 feet of range in its specs, while the LifeJacket 2 lists 33 feet as its range.\nI tested both speakers outside my office by pairing each with my phone, setting the phone on the trunk of a car in the parking lot and walking away until the signal started breaking up.\nThe Braven’s range outside with a clear line of sight was about 200 feet, while the LifeJacket 2’s range was about 160 feet. Both speakers worked well past their stated ranges, and both would work across most backyards.\nI can see these speakers being popular poolside.\nHow do they sound?\nIt’s pretty easy to compare the sound of both speakers. I paired each speaker with my iPhone and started some music. It’s a simple on-screen selection to change between the speakers during a song, so I could flip between them mid-song and get a good feel for the sound.\nWhat did I find?\nIt’s about a draw.\nSome music sounded better on the Braven, while other songs sounded better on the LifeJacket 2.\nI liked Pink Floyd better on the LifeJacket 2, but Dire Straits sounded better on the BRV-Pro.\nNeither has any tone adjustments, so you’ll have to adjust the sound on your source player.\nNeither of these speakers should be your only sound system, as you’ll be disappointed, but they sound good enough for a pool party, tailgate party or campsite.\nI’d have to give the edge to the Altec Lansing LifeJacket 2 for being a bit more rugged and including a handlebar mount, although I do like the accessories that are available for the Braven.\nThe optional flashlight, spare battery and solar panel make the Braven a better choice for campers.\nTwitter: @jimrossman", "external_links": ["http://www.alteclansing.com/", "http://www.braven.com/"], "published": "2015-10-11T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:58:19.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
