These productions will launch early next year. \nList of original series announced today: Scare PewDiePie: PewDiePie encounters \"terrifying situations\" inspired by his favorite video games. Sing It!: A new comedy show that makes fun of \"reality singing competitions\". Lazer Team: A feature-length action comedy. A Trip to Unicorn Island: A feature-length movie about the \"life and journey of Lilly Singh\". Untitled Joey Graceffa project: A new \"reality adventure series\". 360 Project with MatPat of Game Theory: Real-life science behind video games show. Single by 30: A \"romantic drama series\" Untitled College Humor project: A \"dark and comedic look at the absurdity of Internet culture\". Fight of the Living Dead: A \"social experiment reality show\". I Am Tobuscus: A satiric show about the life of a new-age celebrity. \nGoogle's long-term plan is to establish YouTube as a direct competitor to Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime and others, and the first batch of series and movies it announced today are just \"some of the original series and movies\" it is debuting with YouTube Red. \nThe new YouTube Music app that Google announced today as well will also be ad-free for YouTube Red subscribers and available as an ad-supported version for non-subscribers. \nYouTube Red in a nutshell Subscription costs $9.99 per month (iOS 12.99 per month). Subscribers get an ad-free experience on YouTube on the desktop and on mobiles. Subscribers do get ad-free access to the new YouTube Music app as well. Additional benefits include options to save videos and playlists for offline watching, access to original series, and background playback. \nClosing Words \nThe main question is this: would you pay $9.99 per month to access YouTube ad-free. Is the exclusive content that you get another incentive that may persuade you to give it a try? \nIf you compare YouTube's offering to that of Netflix, you may come to the conclusion that it is not offering that much for the money right now especially since it will launch its first batch of original series next year and not on launch. \nThere are other questions that need to be answered. Will YouTube Red be geo-locked? \nNow You : What's your first impression of YouTube Red? Summary Would you pay $9.99 per month for an ad-free YouTube?

Responses to Would you pay $9.99 per month for an ad-free YouTube? Joe Mezzanini October 21, 2015 at 7:58 pm # \nNo - I would not pay $10 a month for it. Not when I can get NetFlix or Hulu for that price Reply Yuliya October 21, 2015 at 8:07 pm # \nNo, and lol. That original content sounds just awful. I wonder if the video download would also be allowed from desktop. On mobile they can hide the file from user and make it available offline only for the YouTube app. On desktop, once you've got the mp4 file, it's yours. Reply not_black October 21, 2015 at 8:31 pm # \nI believe they generate multiple MP4 few second nuggets for each video, so you'd still have to use some software to join them. Reply Velocity.Wave October 21, 2015 at 9:25 pm # \nAgreed the original content doesn't sound all that great or enticing. So I would also not pay the 10 bucks per month. \nBut interestingly... \ngiven Google's (or should I now say Alphabet's) access to funds, I bet they could fund some amazing hit new TV or movie productions (just like Netflix, Showcase, or HBO) to spice up that original content and transform youtube into a hybrid cross between Netflix/youtube. \nFor example, I'd love to see some awesome written SciFi (of the quality of Battlestar Galactica, StarGate, etc...) and then you bet I would pay $10 per month (or possibly even more!) Anonymous October 21, 2015 at 8:20 pm # \nNo: thanks to Adblock Plus I can't remember when I last saw an ad on YouTube. not_black October 21, 2015 at 8:25 pm # \nYouTube is finished and bankrupt. Andrew October 21, 2015 at 10:21 pm # \nYou don't know much stuff do you? Robert Headley October 21, 2015 at 10:44 pm # \nha ha ha g October 21, 2015 at 8:44 pm # \nNope, that's a bit too much for me, especially given the fact that a lot of it will be wasted on stupid \"original content\" by some douchebags that I have no intention of caring about. I would probably pay half of that IF that money would go only to those channels that I actually watch (and some to youtube obviously). But I am not financing any such youtube so-called \"stars\". \nWhat I really would like to see is something that would bill me per video watched at a rate that would correspond to the revenue an advertisement would have generated. That would be fair. Tom Hawack October 21, 2015 at 8:56 pm # \nLet's be clear and straightforward : NO! 120USD a year? Never. Either I'll limit myself to available videos if the ant-adblocker scheme becomes stronger than the adblocker, either I'll carry on as I do now : no ads even within the videos. I have no YouTube account because the company is owned by Google (need to say I have no Google account as well) and moreover I very seldom visit YouTube, the site, and that most of the YouTube hosted videos I discover are embedded. I do have subscriptions elsewhere on the Web, I'm not at all a skinflint, but for videos, no. Reply RustyH October 21, 2015 at 9:27 pm # \nI would pay if it were accessible to the family. Giving my kids and wife access to my account doesn't sound great and neither does $40 a month. Reply Social Media Grandpa October 21, 2015 at 9:34 pm # \nI might have considered it a few years ago. Before Google continually and progressively made youtube worse and worse. Today. Youtube ain't what it used to be. I miss the good old days when it was full of regular people doing regular videos about things they were passionate about. Then suddenly everyone had to get partner and monetized and there had to be presidential debates and sports and movies and professional content creators and blergh. And today the site is crippled for desktop users. Clearly designed for mobile. I'd rather donate or patreon users I like then pay to the evil googlemachine while they keep ruining the site. Reply A Guy Who's Frustrated with YouTube's Current Shittiness October 21, 2015 at 9:35 pm # \nI'd be willing to pay for it, if only Google were to improve the service, rather than making it shittier day after day. Somehow they managed to make the HTML5 player even worse than the Flash one. Reply Robert Headley October 21, 2015 at 10:47 pm # \nThe big kicker here, is that it includes Google Play music. Youtube already has just about every song that exists, once you add Google Play Music on top of it, background play. At $9.99 It is basically gunning for Spotify premium. As a bonus, you get original series and no ads. Reply Nebulus October 21, 2015 at 10:55 pm # \nI would not pay that sum, because I'm not interested in YouTube's offer. I don't see ads on their site because I use a blocker and I don't need to download clips too often (and when I do there are tools for it). So there is no point for me to pay them. \nThat being said, I don't think that the introduction of Red is a bad idea in itself, it just isn't for me. tecn0tarded October 21, 2015 at 11:50 pm # \nfck no...
