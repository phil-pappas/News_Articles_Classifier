The lay-offs come a few days after Twitter announced its founding CEO Jack Dorsey will stay in the top job on a permanent basis.\nA Twitter spokesman said “We’re not commenting on rumour and speculation.”\nThe move would be a longtime coming, according to people close to the company. For years, there had been internal debates about the need to pare hiring at Twitter as bloated staff levels slowed progress. But others inside the company argued that the it would quicken the pace of execution.\nThe report did not specify which departments would be affected, but will presumably hit the engineering staff particularly hard. Engineers make up roughly half of Twitter’s 4,100 global headcount as of June 30, up 24 per cent from the same period a year earlier. At the same time, its user base has grown 15 per cent to 316 million monthly active users. In comparison, Facebook has 10,955 employees and nearly 1.5 billion monthly active users.\nThe Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:40:28.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
