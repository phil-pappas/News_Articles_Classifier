There they can run a manual check for updates and install the new update once it has been found by the routine. \nThese updates are quite large and it may take a while to get them downloaded and installed on the system. \nImportant Changes \nYou may remember that it was possible previously to move apps to another location , or to set a different default location for application installations on Windows 10. \nMicrosoft, for reasons unknown, removed that option before it released Windows 10 to the public. That option makes a return in the latest Windows 10 Insider build. \nWhile it is still not possible to move installed apps to another drive -- the option is still grayed out under System > Apps & features in the PC Settings, the option to set a different storage location for apps is available. \nThe option underneath \"new apps will save to\" is no longer grayed out. Please note that you need another partition or drive connected to the Windows machine before you can modify the selection. If you have only one partition or drive then it is the only one displayed there in the selection menu. \nIf you are using Microsoft Edge on multiple devices, you may be delighted to hear that Microsoft integrated syncing capabilities in the latest version of the web browser. \nYou find them when you open the settings of the browser. Sync is turned on automatically, and it will synchronize favorites and your reading list only for now across Windows devices. \nThe new version of Microsoft Edge supports tab previews now as well. Just hover over any tab but the active one to get a thumbnail preview of the page displayed on the page. \nOther changes include new icons for the Registry Editor and devices in the Device Manager, improvements made to the context menus, to Cortana, Skype, and managing default printer functionality. \nIt is clear that Microsoft is still working on Windows 10, and that it may take a while before the operating system turns out to be exactly what Microsoft envisioned for it. \nIt is unclear right now when the changes will find their way into the retail version of Windows 10 but it is likely that they will be part of a bigger update that Microsoft plans to release in the near future.
