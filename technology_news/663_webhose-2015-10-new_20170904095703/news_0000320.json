Celebrating transformative technology in the build-up to UAE Innovation Week and in line with the UAE’s Year of Innovation, the 5-day event is being held under the theme of “The Internet Future of Everything,” revolving around the pillars of innovation, connected cloud, big data, mobility, and security. Additional new and expanded Gitex this year features include the world’s largest Google CSI Lab, all-night Hackathon, Hot Stuff Awards, Student Lab, and networking platforms the Connexions Majlis, Connexions Lounge, and Connexions Online.“More than ever, Middle East businesses are engaging in digital transformations, as the Internet of Things is no longer a theory, but is impacting our daily lives and business practices,” said Trixie LohMirmand, Senior Vice President, Dubai World Trade Centre, organisers of Gitex Technology Week 2015. In tandem with the Year of Innovation, the GTX Horizons Zone will showcase leading edge demonstrations of next-generation disruptive technologies across 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, drones and robotics. Innovation, interoperation and disruption will continue as themes across the GTX Ignite conference, a powerhouse of global thought leadership, and GTX Innovation Tech Talks, free to attend sessions, that will host over 100 sessions with 150-plus global futurists, including the PM of Estonia, ICT ministers from Egypt, Kenya, and Nigeria, and senior executives from Accenture, BP, Boeing, and Facebook. The 35th edition of Gitex is expected to welcome more than 130,000 visitors from over 150 countries including more than 20,000 C-level executives, and more than 3,600 exhibiting brands, and over 62 participating countries, organisers said in a media statement.“From new solution demonstrations to world-renowned thought leaders, visitors to Gitex Technology Week 2015 can discover the latest innovations, forge new partnerships, and network with the top businesspersons and industry experts from the region and worldwide,” said LohMirmand. Courtesy of strong regional technology take-up, Middle East organisations are ideally placed to become leaders in IoE innovation. The Middle East and Africa is set to post the world’s second-fastest growing ICT market in 2015, reaching $270 billion, according to IDC. Longer-term, the Middle East’s IT market is set to grow by 23 per cent, from $204bn in 2014 to $252bn in 2019, according to Gartner. As a marker of the strong Middle East adoption of IoT technologies, and the rise of the four technologically-advanced Economic Cities, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will serve as the Official Country Partner of Gitex this year, represented by the Kingdom’s Ministry of Interior. Co-located events include the GSMA Mobile 360 Series, the region’s leading mobile community conference, and InfoComm MEA, the Middle East and Africa’s leading audio visual technology event. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:40:14.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
