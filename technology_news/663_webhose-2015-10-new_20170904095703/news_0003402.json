It is also a new standard that relies upon various supporting technologies including millimeter wave propagation, IPv6 transmission protocol, and many others including some that are still in the R&D stage with major infrastructure providers. Among other major differences as compared to the fourth generation of cellular, 5G network demands higher data rate in a range of several gigabits per seconds (Gbps) and this can achieved using steerable antennas with Millimeter Wave (mmWave) technologies. \nSome technologies will become standardized and well-known components of a 5G system whereas other aspects may be optional and even proprietary adjuncts to a standardized system. As with all game-changing technologies of the past, software, platform, and infrastructure providers have a lot at stake in terms of the prospect of their offerings becoming part of the de facto standard or being left behind with stranded R&D expenditures. \nThis research provides an in-depth assessment of both technical issues (enabling technologies, 5G standardization and research initiatives, spectrum bands, etc.) and business areas (market drivers, challenges, use cases, vertical market applications, regulatory issues, trial commitments, introduction strategies, and impact to CSPs), as well as analysis of the emerging 5G ecosystem. The report includes specific ecosystem constituent recommendations and forecasts for both 5G investments, subscriptions, and more for the period of 2015 - 2030. All purchases of Mind Commerce reports includes time with an expert analyst who will help you link key findings in the report to the business issues you're addressing. This needs to be used within three months of purchasing the report. \nTarget Audience:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:12:09.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
