The new competency launched yesterday during the Global Partner Summit at AWS re:Invent 2015. As an APN DevOps Competency Partner, Flux7 has demonstrated proven success helping businesses to be more efficient and agile leveraging the AWS platform and DevOps principles, particularly around continuous integration and delivery as well as configuration management.\nThe APN Competency Program is designed to provide AWS customers with quality APN Partners in specialized solution areas. APN Partners who’ve attained an APN Competency offer a variety of services, software and solutions on the AWS Cloud. Working with these APN Partners, like Flux7, gives customers access to highly experienced DevOps consultants with established track records of optimizing existing infrastructure.\nFlux7 helped Medallion Learning, a company providing tailored eLearning courses that bring learners to content mastery in less time and at lower cost, implement more robust DevOps to get its AWS infrastructure production-ready. Medallion Learning selected Flux7 for its DevOps consulting expertise, advanced knowledge of AWS, flexibility and willingness to create a solution that fit its budget and desired business outcomes. Using DevOps, Flux7 helped Medallion Learning implement an architectural roadmap to address pre-existing needs and add disaster recovery. The changes improved the end user experience, saved engineering time and increased developer productivity.\nMatt Krusemark, CTO and Product Development Manager at Medallion Learning said, “AWS and DevOps is clearly where Flux7’s expertise lies, and that is why it is important for us to work with them – to leverage that expertise, while keeping our team focused on our customers.”\nFlux7 has also helped improve DevOps practices for Pristine and Auto.com. Flux7 helped Pristine improve the overall scalability, automation and security of the company’s infrastructure with a series of DevOps based strategies and adjustments. The result, presented at AWS re:Invent 2014 , was ten times more DevOps work in one-tenth of the time. For Auto.com, Flux7 helped the company improve its ability to innovate by creating faster dev-test cycles. Organizational ownership of ops knowledge has improved business continuity, high fidelity in production and development environments. See this Dockercon 2014 presentation for more information.\nFlux7’s comprehensive DevOps assessment shows organizations how to create or optimize existing infrastructure. To identify areas of improvement, Flux7 consultants review a company’s infrastructure across six key areas: performance, monitoring, dev workflows, cost, security and robustness and disaster recovery. The company then highlights opportunities to bake DevOps automation into processes, workflows and infrastructure, helping create a flywheel of innovation.\n“DevOps is ultimately a cultural transition that must come from within an organization, and working with seasoned DevOps consultants will offer support in this shift of thinking,” said Aater Suleman, CEO of Flux7. “Through the APN DevOps Competency, organizations can source experienced APN Partners that have proven customer success, technical proficiency and validation from internal AWS teams for DevOps.”\nFlux7’s DevOps assessment helps organizations build or change cloud infrastructures to meet their needs. The assessment helps companies speed time to market, meet new business opportunities, achieve a high level of uptime and reduce soft and hard costs.
