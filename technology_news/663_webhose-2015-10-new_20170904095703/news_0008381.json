The trials were conducted by Roche's biotech business, Genentech.\nShares of Roche rose 2% to $33.19 in midday trading.\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that affects an estimated 2.3 million people around the world, according to the company. Relapsing MS is the most common form of the disease, which has no cure.\nTwo late-stage trials testing ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing MS showed that ocrelizumab was better than Rebif, a common therapy for relapsing MS, in reducing certain symptoms over the course of the two-year test, Genentech said in a news release.\nIn a separate study focusing on patients with a deteriorating form of the illness, known as primary progressive multiple sclerosis, the drug was said to reduce the progression of clinical disability over 12- and 24-week periods when compared with a placebo.\n\"Additionally, the study met other secondary endpoints of reducing the time required to walk 25 feet, the volume of chronic inflammatory brain lesions, and brain volume loss,\" the company added.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 08, 2015 13:45 ET (17:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:21:57.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
