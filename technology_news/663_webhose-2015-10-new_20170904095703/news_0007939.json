The real time data collected from sensors can be analyzed and corrective measures taken even without human interventions in many cases,\" says Vijay Sethi, CIO & Head- CSR, Hero MotoCorp.Equipment suppliers can, for instance, remotely monitor the health of machines and take preventive actions to do condition based maintenance for reducing or eliminating machine down time.Similarly, based on physical conditions like temperature, humidity etc - automatic actions can be taken to control the parameters. Real time information in logistics can help significantly cut down logistics costs and inventory holding while improving customer service at the same time.It helps reduce costs, reduce energy consumption, reduce downtime of machines but also significantly improve efficiency and customer serviceHero Motor Corp took initial steps towards IoT by GPS enabling its fleet, getting real time data of truck location and linking that with its sales and distribution data to take actions as may be required. This also helped its delaers and sales teams to get real time information on location of goods.\" At one of our locations, we put in various sensors like weather sensors, and sensors to monitor levels of humidity, temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide, pressure etc. and the entire air temperature, pressure, humidity, oxygen is today being monitored using sensors and being controlled remotely, states Sethi.He point out that IoT initiatives deliver results only when the huge amount of data generated from the sensors is transported in real time to the right place and analyzed for intelligent business insights.For this to happen, one needs to ensure availability of high quality of internet bandwidth. \"Even today the quality and availability of bandwidth is an issue in many parts of the country,\" he highlights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:16:22.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
