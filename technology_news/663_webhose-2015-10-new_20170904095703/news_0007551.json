We were first to launch an Apple Watch app with the ability to place a bet from your wrist and most recently we were first to launch a cash in feature that lets punters deposit via newsagents,’’ he says.\nShannon started his journey as part of the development team at Brisbane-based Bookmaker.com.au, which was acquired by the gaming giant Ladbrokes in September 2013. He has been CTO of Ladbrokes Digital Australia, which has 170 employees, for just over a year.\nAfter graduating from Queensland University of Technology with a Bachelor of IT, Shannon headed overseas to undertake contract and consulting work and CTO roles in Britain and the US before heading home to work with Bookmaker in late 2011.\nHe is now responsible for all of the product development and technology solutions or Ladbrokes.\n“I think one of the things that really works here at Ladbrokes is that we are able to use a lot of the latest technologies, test solutions and stay on top of research and development,’’ he says.\nShannon, who expects to grow his staff to close to 70 by the end of this year, believes his biggest lesson around software development is releasing early and often.\n“The sooner you have got something that is facing your customers, whether it is internal or external, the quicker you will be able to get feedback on it and iterate and improve.’’\nThe qualified personal trainer also says most of a business’s costs are internal. Almost everything is built in-house by developers and there is little outsourcing.\n“I like that now we are hitting a point where a lot of expertise is being funnelled into these software-as-a-service or cloud-type start-ups,’’ says Shannon.\n“Three years ago, if some of the platforms and solutions had existed that are out there now then, I dare say, we would have taken the opportunity.’\n“We moved a lot of our infrastructure away from these custom builds to virtualisation and use containerisation through Docker.’’\nShannon, who admits he is not a fan of social media, aims to address the issue of “duplication of effort’’ so there is not so much of a resource cost to implement a new feature.\n“We experimented with Facebook’s React Native, which allows someone to write a view and distribute that across iOS, Android or a mobile website, which simplifies development, but it is probably not quite ready for production use yet,’’ he says. “It is definitely something that I want to move towards.’’\nHe says the next target for Ladbrokes will be adopting a 100 per cent push-based system.\n“So when events happen in the business such as odds changing, for example, we can send down the notifications direct to the customers so that they are getting the fastest experience on our apps or our websites.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:41:36.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
