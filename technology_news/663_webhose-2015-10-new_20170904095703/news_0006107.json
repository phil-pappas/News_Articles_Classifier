The work done at SDSC has not only provided insights into fundamental science but it has also included a strong dedication to K-12 educational outreach.\" \nHow SDSC's \"Comet\" Supercomputer Serves Science and Society \nComet is configured to help transform advanced computing by expanding access and capacity not only among research domains that typically rely on HPC--such as chemistry and biophysics--but among domains which are relatively new to supercomputers, such as genomics, finance and the social sciences. Some of the domains already being served by Comet include: \nAstrophysics: Supercomputers can greatly accelerate timescales for researching the origins of the universe. \nNeurosciences, Brain Research: SDSC's Neuroscience Gateways project will contribute to the national BRAIN Initiative announced by the Obama Administration to deepen our understanding of the human brain. \nSocial Sciences: Sociologists and political scientists are analyzing newly accessible data sets to study censorship of the press, factors that affect participation in the political process, and the properties of social networks. \nMolecular Science: Studying the properties of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules can advance our understanding of biophysical processes at the atomic scale, leading to new drug designs and reducing disease. \nDNA Nanostructures: Conducting nanoscale biomolecular research could lead to low-cost DNA sequencing technologies, and in turn create targeted drug delivery systems and help explain the molecular causes of disease. \nAlternative Energy Solutions/New Materials Research: Finding new and more efficient solutions to energy harvesting, nanoporous membranes for water desalinization, solar thermal fuels and more. \nFluid Turbulent Physics: Supercomputers can create highly detailed simulations to track ocean currents or improve industry methods related to the discharge of pollutants or oil flow in pipelines. \nClimate Change/Environmental Sciences: Modeling atmospheric aerosols, identified as influencing the chemical composition and radiative balance of the troposphere, has direct implications for our climate and public health. \nSeismic Research/Disaster Prevention: Keys to hazard management for major earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires include the ability to predict a wide range of possibilities. Supercomputer-generated simulations are used to inform decision-making strategies. \nThe Tree of Life: Biologists construct phylogenetic trees to capture the evolutionary relationship between species, and help us better understand the functions and interactions of genes, the origin and spread of diseases, the co-evolution of hosts and parasites and migration of human populations. \nKey Features of Comet: \n~2 petaflops of overall peak performance--one million billion operations or calculations per second. Dell compute nodes using next-generation Intel Xeon processors, 27 racks of compute nodes totaling 1,944 nodes or 46,656 cores. 128 gigabytes of dynamic RAM and 320 GB of flash memory per standard compute node. 72 nodes per rack with full bisection InfiniBand FDR interconnect in each rack, and a 4:1 bisection cross-rack interconnect. Additional GPU and large-memory (1.5 Terabytes) nodes for applications such as visualization, molecular dynamics simulations, or de novo genome assembly. 7 petabytes of Lustre-based high-performance storage from Aeon, and 6 petabytes of durable storage for data reliability. First XSEDE production system to support high-performance virtualization. ### \n-NSF- \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:35:15.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
