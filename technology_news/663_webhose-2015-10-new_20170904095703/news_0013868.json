This is important because job creation above that level will push the jobless rate lower over time and raise the risk of a surge in inflation.\n\"We're still running well above that pace,\" said David Stockton, the Fed's chief economist between 2000 and 2011. He expects the U.S. central bank will raise rates in December.\nWAGES SEEN RISING MODESTLY\nIn another sign of labor market tightening, Friday's report was expected to show significant upward revisions to job growth in prior months.\nStill, inflation has remained subdued despite the jobless rate's sharp drop over the last year and Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the Fed will hold off on rate hikes until it is quite confident that inflation is going to pick up.\nCurrently, the pace of inflation, at 0.3 percent in the year through August, is well below the Fed's 2 percent target.\nThere is little sign of inflationary pressure in wages. Average hourly earnings are expected to have increased just 0.2 percent last month, slower that the 0.3 percent gain in August.\nEmployment gains in September are expected to have been concentrated in service industries, in part because a China-led global economic slowdown appears to be battering U.S. factories.\nThe manufacturing sector is expected to have added zero jobs last month.\nConstruction sector payrolls, however, likely rose also thanks to a strengthening housing market.\nBut more layoffs in the energy sector, which is grappling with a nearly 50 percent drop in the price of oil over the last year, were probably a drag on mining payrolls.\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:18:26.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
