The early, wakeful sunbeams of summer are a fading memory as October mornings grow dark and cold. Frankly, waking up isn't as easy as it used to be \nExcept this week. \nIn the days ahead, if you find yourself yawning over your morning coffee before sunrise, longing for repose, just take a look out the window. Three bright planets are converging in the eastern sky—and the view is an eye opener. \nEvery morning in late October, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars will rise in the east an hour or so before the sun. Together, they form a triangle in the pre-dawn sky. Venus and Jupiter are the brightest vertices—visible even after the black pre-dawn sky turns cobalt blue. Once you find them, you will have little trouble locating the dimmer Red Planet, which completes the triangle while the sky is still black. \nAlthough any morning in late October is a good time to look, the six day stretch from Oct. 24th through the 29th is the best. That's because during this time, the triangle of planets will shrink until it is less than five degrees wide. For reference, the bowl of the Big Dipper is about 10 degrees wide so two of these triangles would fit comfortably inside the bowl. \nOf greater significance, however, is what you can see through binoculars. Typical binoculars can see a patch of sky about six or seven degrees wide. So when the triangle of planets shrinks to five degrees, they will all fit inside a binocular field of view. Imagine looking through the eyepiece and seeing three planets—all at once. This rare and beautiful sight is what is waiting to help wake you up starting on the 24th of October. \nIn addition to the planets are the moons … Jupiter's moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. 3 or 4 of these giant satellites will typically be visible if the binoculars are held steady by leaning on something sturdy or by mounting them on a tripod. The configuration of the moons will be different every morning. \nBy the time October comes to an end, the planetary triangle will start breaking apart. But there are still two dates of special interest: Nov. 6th and 7th. On those increasingly wintry mornings, the crescent Moon will swoop in among the dispersing planets for a loose conjunction guaranteed to dislodge the \"sleep in your eyes.\" On the 6th it will be close to Jupiter. By the 7th it is just past Mars and Venus. \nWaking up before sunrise may not be so bad after all.... This video is not supported by your browser at this time. Four planets huddle up before dawn next week May 6, 2011 \nFour of the five planets visible to the unaided eye huddle quite close together in the pre-dawn sky next week, according to the editors of StarDate magazine. A good reason to wake up at dawn July 4, 2012 \nSummer is a good time to relax, sleep late, enjoy a break from school or work. Waking before sunrise is just not done. Venus and Jupiter super-close before dawn on August 18 August 14, 2014 \nIf you're willing to rise before dawn on Monday, August 18th, you'll be rewarded with the sight of the closest planet pairing of 2014—and not just any planets, but the two brightest ones: Venus and Jupiter. Planets align in the morning sky (w/ video) May 10, 2011 \nHave you ever woken up at the crack of dawn, shuffled to the kitchen counter for your first cup of joe, only to discover that you're out of coffee beans?
