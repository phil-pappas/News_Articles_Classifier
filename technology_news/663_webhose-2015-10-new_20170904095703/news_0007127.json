Pat Scala by Ben Potter If you want to know how much things have changed in the Age of Malcolm Turnbull, look no further than the Prime Minister's Wednesday diary.\nIt reads \"launch finance app, Sydney\".\nIt's safe to say that Turnbull is the first prime minister to preside at the launch of an app.\nTurnbull is a well-known tech nerd. In the 1990s he was one of the founding investors in Ozemail, a pioneering internet company that made small fortunes for its initial backers.\nAs communications minister he maintained his fascination with all things tech.\nNow that he is the Prime Minister he gets to call the shots across the whole of government.\nAnd if his industry minister Christopher Pyne can be believed, Turnbull intends to use that power to shake up the way Australia looks at innovation and technology.\nPyne was doing his own launch on Wednesday – cutting the ribbon at a new $24 million carbon fibre auto wheels factory near Geelong, aptly named Carbon Revolution.\n Citing the Waurn Ponds company as an exemplar of the transition from \"old\" manufacturing to the shiny new tech-based model that sinks its teeth into global value chains with world-beating products, Pyne let slip that Turnbull had told him to \"release his inner revolutionary\" in the quest for bolder ideas to turbo-charge the shift.\nBlessed with mineral riches that yield periodic booms (and busts), Australia performs dismally at commercialising the fruits of the world-class research that comes out of universities and public research bodies.\nPyne's predecessor Ian Macfarlane was hardly asleep at the wheel. But his efforts mainly revolved around re-badging Labor ideas – from \"innovation precincts\" to \"growth centres\" – and pushing the $9.7 billion public research effort to focus more on producing products that can compete in the world.\nTurnbull isn't happy with the status quo. He wants revolutionary change, a new national innovation agenda to replace the \"innovation and competitiveness agenda\" that Macfarlane unveiled barely a year ago.\nIdeas that have languished for years in advisory bodies and the bureaucracy – crowd-funding, tax breaks for angel investors and venture capital – are back on the table.\nThe government is going to push researchers in universities universities, CSIRO and co-operative research centres – who share nearly $7 billion in funding – to focus more on commercial outcomes.\nPyne said on Wednesday Australia had failed to make the \"cultural shift\" from \"believing that once your research is done your job is done\" to exploring the commercial possibilities.\n\"To me the research is the first part of the job,\" he said. \"The second part of the job is commercialising that research, finding the commercial investors, getting industry and business interested.\"\nPyne said that Australia and Britain share a 70:30 split between researchers in public universities and public bodies and their counterparts in the private sector.\n\"And yet only 4 per cent of our researchers in public institutions are involved in business. In Britain that figure is 40 per cent.\n\"We can obviously do a lot better.\"\nFord Motor Company's performance vehicles unit has a mission to drive innovation for the whole company. The Shelby Mustang GT350R is Ford's flagship sportscar, designed to match the Porsche GT3, the benchmark for performance vehicles.\nIt wears Carbon Revolution's carbon fibre wheels because they cut the \"unsprung weight\" – the weight below the suspension – by 30 kilograms, reducing inertia by 40 per cent.\n\"That to an engineer is a mind-blowing number\", Jamal Hameedi, Ford Performance's chief engineer, told the Carbon Revolution launch.\n\"We'll go to the ends of the earth looking for cutting edge technology, things that give our racing cars an advantage over their competition – and that's what carbon fibre wheels do,\" Hameedi enthused.\n\"These wheels are really revolutionary. They are a game changer for a performance car in terms of acceleration, unsprung weight and handling.\"\nNo-one else makes them for a production car or on a factory scale.\nCarbon Revolution's journey from a garage in a Geelong suburb in 2007 to a fully fledged business with a sparkling new plant and ambitious plans for global expansion and a $100 million initial public offer by 2017 is one Turnbull and Pyne want more Aussie firms to follow.\nThree graduate engineers – Ashley Denmead, Matt Dingle and Brett Gas – made their first carbon wheels by hand for a lightweight race car competition for students, the Formula SAE, a decade ago. The rules were strict, and it was one way they thought they could gain an edge.\n\"No-one else in the world had done it,\" said Jake Dingle (brother of Matt) who became chief executive shortly after the company was set up in 2007. \"It was a classic bit of Australian irreverence.\"\nGeneral Motors had tried fibreglass wheels without success in the 1980s. US aerospace companies had tried to make carbon fibre wheels. Germany's ThyssenKrupp​ is still trying. Swedish supercar company Koenigsegg​ hand-makes carbon fibre wheels as a $60,000 option on a $1.8 million car.\nCarbon Revolution moved onto the Deakin University campus and mastered the art of designing and manufacturing carbon fibre wheels to automotive standards, and in 2012 began selling the wheels via aftermarket retailers – to owners of Porsche, Audi, BMW, McLaren, Chevrolet Corvette and Lamborghini vehicles – for about $15,000 a set.\nSince then Switzerland's Ronal – which pioneered alloy wheels in the 1960s, disrupting the traditional steel wheels market – has bought a third of the company's stock for about $20 million.\nRonal recognised that Carbon Revolution had technology that could disrupt the wheels market all over again, Dingle said.\nCarbon Revolution used Ronal's money – along with a $5 million Geelong Regional Innovation and Investment Fund grant – to build its new $24 million plant just up the hill from Deakin's Carbon Nexus facility – a $34 million carbon fibre research centre.\nIt hired production engineers and process workers from Futuris, Ford, Alcoa and Qantas. They are automating the design and manufacturing plant bit by bit. The aim is to produce 50,000 carbon fibre wheels by 2017 at about half the current cost and – with another $25-50 million in capital expenditure, 250,000 by 2020.\nBy then it will be a \"turnkey plant\" – one able to be replicated in the major auto markets of Europe, North America and Asia, Dingle said. Carbon Revolution may build these plants in partnership with Ronal.\nThe best laid plans can always go pear-shaped. Dingle said risk and innovation \"come as a box set\" and the management have had to learn to \"embrace and manage risk\".\nEven so, Carbon Revolution embodies some of the things the government wants from the high tech manufacturing sector.\nIt has made good use of public money – it had a $1.8 million green car grant along the way – to develop unique technology and sell it to the world.\nIt is collaborating closely with researchers at Deakin, Carbon Nexus and CSIRO to halve the cost of carbon fibre and to develop carbon fibre especially for wheels and quick-curing custom resin to speed up the production process.\nThe goal is to \"lock in an unassailable advantage\" and win more original equipment supply contracts off the back of the Shelby GT350R so that when competitors come after them, Carbon Revolution will be further ahead.\nThe GT350R contract is a beachhead – Ford will only sell 600-800. But as Carbon Revolution scales up production, \"we can start putting them on higher and higher volume vehicles at lower and lower cost\", Hameedi said. He expects carbon fibre wheels to be available across Ford's performance car range within a decade. \"It's just too much of weight reduction to ignore.\"\nCarbon Revolution is eyeing a broader market that also includes aerospace, defence and commercial trucking – where the volumes are smaller but the imperatives to save weight are greater and the margins potentially wider – and trying to keep it Australian-controlled.\n\"Let's make it a real Australian business\", Dingle told AFR Weekend .\nCarbon Revolution is one of many Aussie tech successes. Sydney-based Quickstep supplies carbon fibre parts and manufacturing systems to the automotive, aerospace and defence industries. Brisbane-based mouldCAM supplies resins to the marine, industrial and architecture sectors – including the dramatic MPavilion in Melbourne's Queen Victoria Gardens designed by British architectural star Amanda Levete​. Futuris supplies luxurious leather seats for Tesla electric cars.\nCarbon Revolution's story also embodies a problem with Australian innovation policy. Venture capital was virtually non-existent. It had to raise most of its funds from family and friends, until Ronal chipped in.\nYou can have your innovation precincts, growth centres and co-operative research centres (CRCs), but someone still has to design a product and sell it to the world, says Pat Boland, co-founder of ANCA, which supplies automated machine tools to Apple, Samsung and Boeing suppliers.\nBoland reckons CRCs are too bureaucratic, and government should just offer more R&D grants and capital equipment write-offs and get out of the way.\n\"Growth centre\" policies also come in for flak. \"How does … anyone know what are going to be the industries of growth in the future?\" Manuel Trajtenberg​, a Zionist Union member of the Knesset and professor at Tel Aviv University, told an innovation conference in Melbourne last month.\nPyne has deflected such criticisms in his initial appearances, but conceded that many publicly funded efforts across government, universities and agencies can be better co-ordinated.\n\"One of my priorities is to bring them together in a cohesive strategy\", he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:30:12.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
