Changes in the extent and focus of research undertaken by CFE for government departments and agencies, research councils, higher education, charities and the private sector since 2012 have resulted in an increase in the number of large projects that are more longitudinal in nature and that use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodologies.\nCFE required an MR solution that could manage the scale and scope of complex projects. It also needed to efficiently monitor and track survey cohorts over multiple years and to gather information from all sources in one place for management and analysis over the long term. Furthermore, it was critical that CFE could design highly attractive and accessible surveys that maximize response rates amongst hard-to-reach respondents to ensure data is robust and representative. Finally, it was essential to offer flexible delivery of questions, tailored and formatted to suit the audience, and provided using a variety of offline and online channels in order to improve accessibility and to drive engagement.\nLindsey Bowes, acting Managing Director at CFE explains: “Our investment in Confirmit Horizons is a substantial financial commitment for us as a small business. However we are confident that Confirmit will provide the additional features and functionality we need to improve the efficiency of our offering. It will enable us to maximize our existing resources, freeing up our team of consultancy and research professionals for new projects, and allow CFE to re-invest in the business and to innovate in the future.\n“Confirmit Horizons will not only help us to streamline and automate processes, and to retain more control over the entire research process. It will also enable us to maintain our focus on finding new ways to capture data beyond existing online, tablet or mobile surveys, irrespective of the ability or disability of the respondent.”\nTim Hannington, EVP EMEA and APAC at Confirmit added: “Confirmit Horizons is a sophisticated solution with a wide range of features and functionality that we believe enables our customers to innovate on many levels. We are delighted that CFE has been able to reap the benefits of their investment in such a short space of time, and we look forward to a long and successful relationship.”\n###\nAbout Confirmit\nConfirmit is the world’s leading SaaS vendor for multi-channel Voice of the Customer, Voice of the Employee, and Market Research solutions.
