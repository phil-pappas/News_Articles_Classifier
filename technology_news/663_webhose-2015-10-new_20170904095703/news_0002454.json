The National Weather Service's Aaron Jacobs says 7 inches fell at the Ketchikan airport Thursday.\nThe remnants of Oho were picked up by a larger low-pressure system. Jacobs says another system packing rain and winds could affect the region later this weekend.\nOho was among a record number of tropical cyclones in the central Pacific so far this season, which officials attributed to unusually warm ocean temperatures from El Nino.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
