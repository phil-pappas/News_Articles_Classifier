It was built by academics for academics, and without any notion of the new kinds of commerce, crime, and espionage it would enable.\nAs the Internet spread beyond purely academic circles and became a valuable tool for corporations and governments, as well as a target for criminals and terrorists, a vast—and growing—security industry sprang up to develop new controls and defenses that would protect us against threats. But the academic world, from which the Internet originally came, has not wholeheartedly embraced this growing market of new security tools and tactics.\nA highly secured network that closely regulates and restricts new devices, users, or online traffic streams may be desirable in a secretive government agency or a company jealously guarding its intellectual property and strategy, but it may make less sense on the campus of higher-education institutions, which draw intellectual sustenance from the regular arrivals of new people from all over the world, carrying their own devices, looking to study and collaborate alongside everyone else.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:17:16.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
