And you know if it can work in a television production schedule, it can work for any project.”\nFor more information on FrameForge Previz Studio, including real-world case studies, please check out our website http://www.StoryboardBetter.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdG9yeWJvYXJkYmV0dGVyLmNvbS9zYXZlLXRpbWUtbW9uZXk=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5TdG9yeWJvYXJkQmV0dGVyLmNvbQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXN0LXN0b3J5Ym9hcmRpbmctc29mdHdhcmUuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:14:05.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
