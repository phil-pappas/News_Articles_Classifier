The new disaster recovery solution leverages ExaGrid's award-winning backup storage appliances, featuring its unique landing zone and scale-out architecture, and supports Veeam® Availability Suite software at either the customer's onsite data center or at OffsiteDataSync's strategically located Tier IV data centers throughout the United States. Service configuration options include Veeam-based on-premise local backup to ExaGrid appliances, instant DR recovery in OffsiteDataSync Tier IV facilities, and hypervisor of choice which addresses failover and failback complexities presented by large-vendor lock-in solutions and proprietary cloud architecture. \nThe new jointly offered Disaster Recovery as a Cloud Service addresses a number of growing customer concerns in relation to today's more commonly deployed DR solutions. First, many customers have access to only a single data center, or pay a hefty price for a secondary data center location. Second, many companies often do not have the manpower and/or expertise to effectively address and mange a DR failover site or the time to maintain compliance with initiatives such as HIPAA, PCI, ITAR and more. And third, many organizations prefer to pay for DR as a monthly service -- using operating versus capital budgets -- to avoid making large capital investments in depreciating hardware and software assets for DR. \nCustomers will leverage either an ExaGrid appliance onsite, a cloud-based OffsiteDataSync ExaGrid appliance offsite or both for fast and reliable local backups and restores, as well as configurable instant DR restore options locally or offsite. Since only the changed bytes are replicated, the solution is extremely WAN efficient. Specialized DR services are available in the event of a disaster, ensuring that data can be restored and services resumed almost immediately. \n\"Disk crashes, power failures, and human error, as well as natural and manmade disasters, are very real and constant threats to business services availability. At best, an outage is costly. At worst, data is irretrievable and/or services are unavailable for extended periods of time, causing loss of revenues and customers, damaged business reputations, compliances put at risk, and potential legal ramifications,\" said Matthew Chesterton, CEO, OffsiteDataSync. \"By partnering with ExaGrid to offer a new DRaaS that supports Veeam, top performance, reliability, and trustworthy DR has never been more easily and cost effectively obtained.\" \n\"We are delighted to be working with OffsiteDataSync, an organization that is expert in ensuring availability, reliability, security and recoverability in the cloud, as further evidenced by being named a Top 100 Global Cloud Provider and a Gold Veeam Cloud & Service Provider partner,\" said Bill Andrews , CEO, ExaGrid. \"Organizations now have access to affordable enterprise-class DR, ensuring the protection of one of their most valuable assets -- data.\" \nExaGrid's unique landing zone and scale-out architecture provide the fastest backup -- resulting in the shortest fixed backup window and the fastest local restores -- breaking the paradigm over other solutions. OffsiteDataSync delivers data retention, DR, and hosted cloud services across three strategically located data centers in Las Vegas, Nevada; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Rochester, New York. In 2014, OffsiteDataSync was selected by Veeam Software , innovative provider of solutions that deliver Availability for the Modern Data Center¸ as a launch partner for Veeam Availability Suite v8. Unlike legacy backup solutions which provide recovery time (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) of hours or days, Veeam helps organizations meet recovery time and point objectives (RTPO) of less than 15 minutes for all applications and data. \nBoth ExaGrid and OffsiteDataSync personnel will be available to discuss the new offering at VeeamON 2015, the World's Premier Data Center Availability Event, taking place in Las Vegas, October 26 - 29, 2015. \nTweet this: .@ExaGrid & @OffsiteDataSync to Offer Disaster Recovery as a Service with support for @Veeam http://www.exagrid.com/media/ #DRaaS #Backup #DR #HA \nAbout OffsiteDataSync OffsiteDataSync is a leading provider of cloud-based disaster recovery and backup services.
