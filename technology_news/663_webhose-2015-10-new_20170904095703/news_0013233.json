ZCorum will be featuring a range of diagnostic tools, and will present \"hands-on\" demonstrations of new TruVizion features including a tab that displays the downstream spectrum from any device that supports full band capture. Click to Tweet\nTruVizion places key diagnostics data at operators’ fingertips. Accessing the spectrum data doesn’t require a separate server-side install or a separate desktop client. The spectrum for all channels passing through a compatible device, both data and video, can be viewed directly within TruVizion at the click of a button.\nAnother of the latest developments in TruVizion is a WiFi QoS report that looks at the performance of in-home WiFi access points embedded in cable gateways in comparison to the subscriber’s broadband package. “Quite often complaints about slow Internet are related to the subscriber’s in-home network,” said Scott Helms, ZCorum’s VP of Technology. “This new report will help operators determine if the WiFi performance in the home or business is significantly less than what the customer should be experiencing over their broadband connection”.\nZCorum has also added a Power Tab for viewing the status of power transponders that support the SCTE outside plant transponder MIBs. The screen displays battery information, current voltages, connection to commercial power, and any other values that can be collected for the device.\n“We are continually updating TruVizion with new features specifically designed to help our customers reduce operational costs, increase the efficiency of their staff and improve the subscriber experience,” said Julie Compann, President and CEO of ZCorum. “These new features meet that goal, and we’re excited about demonstrating them at the Cable-Tec Expo this week.”\nSCTE Cable-Tec Expo begins Tuesday, October 13th and runs through Friday, the 16th at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center.
