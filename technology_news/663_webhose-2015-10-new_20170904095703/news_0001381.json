Stephen Colbert wants to take your job driving sports cars and kissing exotic women as British secret agent 007.\nDaniel Craig took some heat last week when he said in an interview that he'd \"rather break this glass and slash my wrists\" than participate in another Bond flick. \"I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on,\" the actor told Time Out.\nThat didn't sit too well with Stephen Colbert, who on Thursday night's episode of \" The Late Show \" told his audience he'd be more than happy to sip martinis and \"crush the skull of bad guys between [his] diamond-hard butt cheeks\" in the next Bond movie.\nRelated Links James Bond is 'hunting, hunted and alone' in the full-length trailer for 'Spectre' Bond's on a dark mission in final 'Spectre' 007 trailer Colbert's already got the goods to play Bond, he says, including an incredible, almost-not-insulting British accent that will almost definitely not offend viewers.\nColbert then made a musical case for consideration for the Bond role, belting out an adapted version of the song \"Consider Yourself\" from Lionel Bart's \"Oliver!\" that should easily win him the role of the man with a license to kill.\nFor now, we'll have to settle for the Daniel Craig version of James Bond in \"Spectre,\" which lands in the UK on October 26 followed by the US on November 6 and Australia on November 12.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cr-ZKl-j5pM", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/08/daniel-craig-im-over-james-bond/"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:30:04.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
