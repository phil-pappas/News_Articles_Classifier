Much progress has been made, but many challenges remain to ensure our communities are safe, healthy and vibrant. \nTwo Kansas City-based organizations, Netsmart and Cornerstones of Care today announced a first-of-a-kind, multi-pronged affiliation agreement designed to innovate and implement together to positively impact the health and well-being of children and families. \nFully Aligned Partnership \nThe partnership is built on three tenets: Creation of a demonstration site for the utilization of technology to drive real, measurable outcomes Creation of new solutions where gaps exist Proliferation of the learnings to the rest of the human services industry \n\"The traditional relationship between a health and human services organization and an EHR provider is too often oriented around 'projects' that have finite beginnings and endings,\" said Netsmart CEO Michael Valentine. \"In this case, both Netsmart and Cornerstones of Care were looking to create a relationship that is designed up front to sustain deep engagement over a very extended period of time. Core to this is the notion that we are taking a 'One Team' approach, in which members from both organizations blend together from day one to create a shared team with shared objectives. Under this model, we both measure success in identical ways, which helps to maintain the alignment of the relationship over time.\" \nCornerstones of Care provides a full range of prevention, treatment and support services to children and families, including mental health intervention, psychiatric hospitalization, transitional living services, prevention and therapeutic treatment services for victims of abuse and neglect, and foster care case management. \n\"We are entrusted with providing a programmatic spectrum of care that benefits more than 10,000 children and family members. That's no small task,\" said Cornerstones CEO Denise Cross. \"This partnership with Netsmart gives us the opportunity to transform how we provide services, allowing us to broaden our reach and have an even greater impact on the children and families we serve. We are excited to integrate new technologies and a tech culture of innovation with our culture of healing and nurturing, resulting in cutting-edge service delivery.\" \n\"We both feel a real obligation to be leaders in the human services industry. Together, we will both be able to accomplish bgger and better things than we could have individually,\" said Valentine. \nImmersive Collaboration \nThe partnership involves deep interaction and collaboration between clinical, IT and operational professionals from Netsmart and Cornerstones: Cornerstones of Care employees will take up residence at Netsmart facilities to learn how technology capabilities are evaluated and ultimately created. Netsmart associates will participate in cultural sabbaticals, shadowing clinical staff with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the optimal workflows and content required at the point of service. A strong focus will be placed on measuring the impact that the initiatives have on clinical, financial, and operational outcomes. Over time, Cornerstones of Care will become a showcase healthcare information technology space where best practices can be shared with the other HHS providers and communities. \n\"The long term goal of this immersive collaboration is to foster an environment of integration, innovation, discovery and knowledge capture,\" said Cross. \"From this we hope to develop improved clinical and operational processes and solutions that can be broadly scaled to improve services and quality of care for children, families and communities.\" \nAbout Cornerstones of Care \nCornerstones of Care is a family of agencies dedicated to strengthening children, families, and the communities in which they live.
