Fundamental structural change has taken place within the industry and it will be what drives the outcome for some time to come.\" \nMr Widdows concluded that the lack of cooperation among industry players in coordinating these two variables is part of the reason for the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:57:49.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
