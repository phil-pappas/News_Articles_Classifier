It follows a competitive pitch for the retained brief that included the incumbent agency. \nLogitech was founded in Switzerland in 1981 and operates in 100 countries. It is listed on the Six Swiss Exchange and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and has a market cap of $2.27bn (£1.5bn). \nLogitech also owns speaker brand Ultimate Ears. \nThe company confirmed the appointment of Fever Unlimited and Things Unlimited but declined to comment, as did the agencies. \nBrands2Life co-founder Sarah Scales told PRWeek: \"We worked with Logitech for more than ten years and we participated in the tender process in July. We are very proud of our work and we wish Logitech all the best with their new partner. We still look after Logitech B2B.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:44:25.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
