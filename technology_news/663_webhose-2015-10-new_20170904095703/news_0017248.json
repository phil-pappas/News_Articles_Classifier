Bloomberg Share on twitter by David Ramli If you can tinker with a Sony PlayStation then you can help build the $56 billion national broadband network.\nThat's the message from NBN as it spends $40 million to recruit the next generation of telecommunications tradies to meet its ambitious goal of connecting 11.9 million homes and businesses to high-speed broadband by 2020.\nThe government-owned company on Monday will launch its Career Start campaign using online ads and social media to help draft 2000 inexperienced Generation Y and millennial workers for the project. They will be part of the 4500 extra staff needed to finish the job.\nBut behind the colourful recruitment posters lies a looming danger – failing to ramp up or finish on time will represent a broken promise from the Coalition government and a major budget shortfall for whichever party is in charge by 2020 .\n\"If you're good with your hands with PlayStations then you're the type of people we're looking for,\" NBN industry management executive general manager Michael Doherty said. \"People who like to be working with their hands, pulling things apart and putting them back together again.\n\"This [campaign] is looking at a younger workforce or people out of school that want to get a career in telecommunications work.\"\nEveryone who makes contact will be referred to the contractors that are building the project and need the workers. Once personnel have been vetted and offered a job, they will be handed back to the NBN for training certificates at one of 10 approved providers.\nMr Doherty said despite the NBN being under way since 2007, there had been little stimulation of training or growth in the telco market for many years. In contrast, younger workers have flooded to trades relating to the mining and housing booms nationwide.\n But as the resources sector starts to slow, NBN will look to scoop up the able bodies – offering clean, constant work. This campaign alone expects to get 500 people signing up.\n\"It's very clean work [because] doing line work is very different from, say, doing plumbing where you're often in sewerage, or heavy civil works,\" he said.\n\"We have to build it, then we have to connect customers to it and then we have to continually operate and maintain it over its lifetime so from that perspective you can generate a career out of it.\n\"It's also a very safe environment because you're working with low voltages and you're not working typically with big heavy machinery.\n\"I perceive that younger people are attracted to things that are new and sexy [and] certainly working on the broadbanding of the nation is an attractive thing to be a part of.\"\nMr Doherty said previous NBN training programs had failed because they did not come with the guarantee of work, leaving fresh graduates out of a job. He also said NBN had never kept a register of those it had trained and called on them to reapply for the latest round of work.\n\"When someone gets trained by us expecting to get a job and they don't then it's not the right model,\" he said. \"That's why we've sought to completely remodel this program – we'll keep a record of who is trained and what skills they have so that at the same time we're building a skills registry of what we have out there in the industry.\"\nTop executives at NBN have already cast some doubt on its ability to reach construction goals. Chairman Ziggy Switkowski told Fairfax Media it would take a \"heroic\" effort to hit the deadline of reaching 11.9 million homes and businesses by 2020, as promised by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull .\nThe Coalition took over the project promising a vast improvement on Labor's construction efforts, which missed targets and suffered staff shortages.\nBut its original pledge of finishing by 2016 has already been broken and the total cost forecast has blown out by up to $15 billion . The government has claimed this was because Labor underestimated the project's costs and timing.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/nbn-set-to-announce-cost-blowout-20150823-gj5ze3.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-10-25T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:17:57.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
