There were no curved lines making the silhouettes clean and simple.\n\"The collection was made in Banaras. The garments presented technical advancements in Mashru that make the 'old' textile contemporary, while retaining the luxuriousness that has always been an important part of it.\n\"It's very geometrical. The sleeves are also wide. The pieces can be worn as separate garments. You can walk around and work wearing my creations,\" said Garg, who doesn't do projects on the basis of trends.\nThe look of the models was also very neat. With no heavy jewellery or loud make-up or elaborate hairdos, the models looked very traditional and simple.\n\"Braiding and oiling hair are very common in India. There is a certain pride in sporting that look and well tied hair doesn't create any obstacle while working,\" he said.\nThe designer, who made his AIFW debut, also brought fresh music on the stage. With no lyrics or instruments, a group of people just used their voice, hands and feet to produce melodious sound to entertain the packed audience.\n\"I wanted music without boundary. I didn't want any genre restriction like folk, pop or rock. So, there was a bit from Bengali weddings and some inspiration from Africa and more. This way the music belongs to everyone,\" said the designer.\nHis garments were definitely the stars of the show, but one couldn't skip Bollywood beauties Konkona Sen Sharma, Mini Mathur, Deepti Naval and Soha Ali Khan who applauded the collection from the front row.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:23:19.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
