The organic, thermoplastic polymer possesses unique properties that make it a great fit for industries such as aerospace, medical engineering or offshore applications. \nIn order to expand its PEEK 3D printing services, Rauch recently installed a newly developed FFF-system designed for working with high-performance-polymer PEEK. The company is the first service provider in the world to offer 3D printing services with PEEK-filament and will present a selection of parts made using the material at the inaugural formnext exhibition. × Expand PEEK filament \n“The FFF-technology is an ideal addition for the already available expertise in PEEK through industrial SLS-technology. Our customers can now select the best technology and material for their component,” Managing Director, Bernd Rauch, explained. “Many design engineers have recognised the particular potential of the additive manufacturing and therefore our service is gaining more and more attention. Our customers appreciate our know-how in additive manufacturing of PEEK, as well as our extensive advisory skills in this special field.” \nRauch CNC Manufaktur will exhibit alongside leading names in the additive manufacturing and tooling industries at formnext powered by tct on 17-20 th November in Hall 3 of the Frankfurt Exhibition Centre, Germany.
