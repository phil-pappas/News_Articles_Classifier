Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Some of Australia's top technology entrepreneurs want the Labor opposition to drop its attacks on one their most successful peers, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, over his wealth.\nFreelancer founder Matt Barrie called the attacks \"ridiculous,\" and was joined in his criticism by SEEK co-founder and venture capitalist Andrew Bassat and Vinomofo co-founder Andre Eikmeier.\nThe local tech sector has been buoyed by Mr Turnbull's elevation and doesn't want sniping about Mr Turnbull's wealth to distract from his plans to encourage more innovative companies.\nMr Barrie said Labor was \"grasping at straws\" as it slipped in the polls and Mr Turnbull's star rose .\nSEEK co-founder and chief executive Andrew Bassat said he was staggered by Labor's comments last week. Josh Robenstone \"It was terrible and really in the end it was inspiring the people of Australia to have low expectations of themselves,\" he said. \"The opportunity to create a powerful economic engine in Australia comes from the thousands of entrepreneurs pursuing economic opportunity.\"\nThe sentiment was shared by other technology entrepreneurs, including Pollenizer chief start-up scientist Phil Morle, who likened Mr Shorten's comments to schoolyard bullying when kids call each other fat because there was nothing else to tease them about.\nLookSmart co-founder Evan Thornley, an ex-Labor state MP who listed the first Australian tech company to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, said Mr Turnbull's leadership could be good for the economy.\n\"In the last 20 years Australia has put four tech companies on Nasdaqâ€¦ in the same time Israel has put more than 120 companies on Nasdaq with one-third of our population,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful that given his background and early signals of intent, Mr Turnbull sees how crucial it is to change that as we deal with the downturn in resources and likely soon property. That focus is very 'in touch' with the job needs of our economy right now.\"\nVinomofo co-founder and joint chief executive Andre Eikmeier said people should not have to apologise for their success. David Mariuz photography 0400396 During question time last week Opposition Leader Bill Shorten rebuked Mr Turnbull for having managed investments in the Cayman Islands , a continuation of Labor's tactic to position Mr Turnbull as too wealthy to relate to most Australians.\nLabor has been trying to counter Mr Turnbull and position itself as a party in touch with technology innovation. Last week Labor MP Ed Husic was named opposition parliamentary secretary of digital innovation and start-ups .\nLabor targets start-ups Labor announced a number of new start-up targeted policies last month including entrepreneurial visas and a start-up year for university students, and will bring together members of the local venture capital and superannuation industries next month for a meeting aimed at getting more funding for startups.\nMuch of Mr Turnbull's net worth of approximately $200 million was made prior to entering politics, as an investment banker and entrepreneur, including as a founding director of internet service provider OzEmail.\nSEEK's Mr Bassat said he was staggered by Labor's comments last week.\n\"The criticisms are ridiculous. You have a guy who has been a successful lawyer, merchant banker and a successful businessman. How anyone could think he's anything but a terrific person to lead the country I'm staggered,\" he said.\n\"He's had a crack, he's been successful and he's to be admired. We need a culture that says to support these people.\"\nIf the polls are to be believed, Labor's attempts to paint Mr Turnbull as a man above the people has failed.\nThe latest Fairfax/Ipsos poll showed the Coalition leading Labor on a two-party-preferred basis 53 per cent to 47 per cent, a 7 percentage point lift since August when Tony Abbot still held the leadership.\nVinomofo's Mr Eikmeier said people should not have to apologise for their success.\n\"Shut up Shorten and co., and start adding some value,\" he said. \"Give the new vastly improved leadership of this country a chance to actually do something.\"\nResponding to questions, direct and indirect, about his wealth, Mr Turnbull said he'd worked hard, but not harder than many others in the community, and that some of his success came down to luck.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-19T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:24:46.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
