The new trailer focuses on combat and depending on your desired difficulty mode, the combat in Original Sin Enhanced Edition can be torturously tactical, or bright and breezy! It just depends on your play-style. You can take advantage of crowd control spells such as petrify, charm, and freeze — required in the harder difficulty settings, or simply ignite, inflame, poison, and electrify your way through the world — zapping water under-foot to shock, or engulfing the enemy in flames by igniting a near-by oil barrel. \nIt’s all about using the skills at your party’s disposal to supplement each of their player-defined roles. Although featuring 12 classes (including a new class, the Inquisitor!), Original Sin Enhanced Edition is really “classless.” You can mix and match as you develop your characters, chaining abilities and taking advantage of environmental aspects such as water, ice, oil on the floor, and steam clouds, things like that. \nWith this, more games than you can play is making their transition to PlayStation from PC, its just whether you’ve got the time to play them all!
