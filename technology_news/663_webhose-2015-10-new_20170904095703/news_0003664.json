Back in the Dutch Golden Age, they were called self-portraits and were the preserve of highly trained artists who thought long and hard about every aspect of the painting.\nNow the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague is staging an exhibition focusing solely on these 17th century self-portraits, highlighting the similarities and the differences between modern-day snapshots and historic works of art.\nThe exhibition, opening on Thursday and running through January 3, features 27 self-portraits by artists ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn to his student Carel Fabritius - best known for The Goldfinch , which hangs elsewhere in the Mauritshuis - and Judith Leyster, whose self-portrait is on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:24:34.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
