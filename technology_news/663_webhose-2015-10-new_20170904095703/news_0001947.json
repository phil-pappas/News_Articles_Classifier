Some also star in movies, write books, go on tour, sell music or cut endorsement deals. They're a hit with younger audiences and brands trying to reach the next generation of consumers. \nTwo acts tied for second on Forbes' list, both earning $8.5 million: comedy prankster duo Smosh -- Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla -- and the Fine Brothers, Benny and Rafi Fine. \nDancing violinist Lindsey Stirling ranked fourth with $6 million. Tied for fifth were comedians Rhett and Link -- made of Rhett McLaughlin and Charles Lincoln Neal III -- and video game commentator Olajide Olatunji, known as \"KSI,\" with $4.5 million. \nMake-up artist Michelle Phan was seventh at $3 million. \nThe No. 8 slot was a three-way tie at $2.5 million shared by comedian Lilly Singh, or \"Superwoman;\" prankster Roman Atwood; and chef Rosanna Pansino. \nForbes is best known for its list of billionaires and the list appearing in its Nov. 2 issue marks its first stab at ranking YouTube stars. It says it measured earnings before management fees and taxes and came up with the figures based on data from online sources such as Nielsen, IMDb and interviews with managers, lawyers, industry insiders and the stars themselves. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
