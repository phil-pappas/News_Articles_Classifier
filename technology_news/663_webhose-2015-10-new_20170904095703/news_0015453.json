KickassTorrents was earlier in a similar crisis when it was banned for being a bad advertiser. Famous browsers Firefox and Chrome would black out users from accessing the torrent website for unhealthy advertisements on the portal. Now, KickassTorrents is in deep waters by Firefox and Chrome again and this time it is for their harmful software that shows up as popups, as reported by Torrentfreak.\nGoogle’s safe browsing algorithm has flagged the website under the ‘unwanted software’ program as it triggers malicious third-party programs via the advertisements. Chrome browser pops up a message stating ‘The site ahead contains harmful programs’. The warning adds, Attackers on kat.cr might attempt to trick you into installing programs that harm your browsing experience (for example, by changing your homepage or showing extra ads on sites you visit)’ Firefox also displays the similar message.\nGoogle has previously stated that the unwanted software policy will apply to all websites and also specifically mentioned that torrent websites are common targets for malicious software distribution. Google’s warning from the browsers will automatically disappear if the website is declared safe.\nOn the other hand, KickassTorrents website mentions that attackers might use the website for tricking users into installing programs.\nKickassTorrents is presently believed as a dangerous website. Chrome will simply not allow you to get to the website unless it is declared safe. Unfortunately, other browsers such as Opera allows you to access the website without any warning.\n latest Kickasstorrents hacking malware virus google Also Read 10 tablets with conveniently large screen (8-9 inch) Capital inflows may shoot up to Rs 60,000 crore over the next five years SBI cuts home loan interest rate by up to 0.25 per cent Meet the first Android phone, the T-Mobile G1", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Kickasstorrents_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151022/technology-latest/article/kickasstorrents-gets-blocked", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Kickasstorrents_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sshot-1_152.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151022/technology-latest/article/kickasstorrents-gets-blocked", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sshot-2_101.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:05:11.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
