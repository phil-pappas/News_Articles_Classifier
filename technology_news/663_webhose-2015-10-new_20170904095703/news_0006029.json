It's also a tool that can be used to engage citizens in the process of their government once again.\"\nAsked later in the interview what she would do to strengthen cybersecurity and technological awareness, Fiorina listed three steps she would take as president.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton's Keystone XL comedy falls flat among green groups Green groups seem too focused on oil exports to care about Clinton's \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/05/15 7:37 PM \"Number one, we need to have collaboration between the private sector and the public sector on the detection and repellence of these attacks,\" she said. \"Secondly, we need to have basic competence in IT management in the government. ... Part of that, I believe, is to stand up a centralized cybersecurity command in the federal government that would be accountable for protecting our sensitive databases and systems in federal government and that would report, I believe, to the White House, Department of Defense, or Department of Homeland Security.\n\"And of course we should retaliate,\" she added, third and finally. \"There has to be consequence when the Chinese or the Russians attack us in cyberspace.\"\nFiorina has risen rapidly in the weeks following the second Republican primary debate. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll shows her at 16 percent support among GOP voters in New Hampshire, just 5 percentage points behind front-runner Donald Trump and 6 points higher than where she stood in early September.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:26:48.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
