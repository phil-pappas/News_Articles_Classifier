Could not subscribe, try again later Patent Yogi A computer-generated image of the new airliner \nFrequent flyers will be pleased to see that Airbus' latest patent hints at a spiritual successor to the retired Concorde airliner. \nAwarded to Airbus back in July, the patent describes a plane that can not only fly at hypersonic speed, but also land and take off vertically. \nThe plane would be able to travel at Mach 4.5, meaning it would be possible to travel from London to New York in an hour . \nIt's already being dubbed 'Concorde 2' on YouTube, where it has been picked up by Patent Yogi - a channel specialising in futuristic patents. Airbus The patent drawing from Airbus \nIn the patent, Airbus describes how the plane would use three different hydrogen engines to propel the craft at 3,425mph. \nA rocket motor would mean the airliner could cruise at 100,000 feet - and Airbus believes it would be quieter than the original Concorde. Patent Yogi The aircraft will take off and land vertically and be able to reach 100,000 feet \n\"In the case of civil applications, the market envisaged is principally that of business travel and VIP passengers, who require transcontinental return journeys within one day,\" explains the patent. \nWhich, roughly translated, means its likely to be ultra expensive and ultra luxurious to actually fly on. \nAnd Airbus' design hints at only 20 passengers per flight.
