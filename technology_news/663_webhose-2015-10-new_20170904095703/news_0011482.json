The operation, being set up from scratch, required a dedicated IT software solution to manage its wholesale operations. \nBCP is one of the UK's top suppliers of specialist Supply Chain solutions to the Food and Drink Wholesale industry, with clients including Creed Foodservice, T Quality, BWG, Musgrave and SPAR. \nKey to selecting BCP's Accord solution for the new operation was BCP's experience and reputation in the marketplace together with the comprehensive functionality within Accord and, in particular, its ability to easily scale up in size and scope as the company grows. Mark Huggins, General Manager of Inter-Food Imports, and responsible for setting up and running the new facility: \"I'm familiar with Accord, its reputation as a market leader in the foodservice sector and BCP's track record of delivering successful implementations from my previous roles in the foodservice industry. It really is second to none in the sector.\" \nThe investment covers BCP's complete Accord solution, including Purchasing, Sales Order Management, Telesales, RF Stock Control and Warehouse Management, Multicurrency and Financial Accounting and gives Inter-Food Imports a fully integrated system covering all aspects of its wholesale business. Implementation of Accord was timed carefully around kitting out of the warehouse to ensure it was up and fully operational to meet Inter-Food Imports' opening plans. \nMark Huggins: \"The initial implementation of Accord was quite stripped back with only a few users, but we envisage rapid growth and I know the system will scale up easily to accommodate that growth, proving an excellent fit both now and for our enlarged operation in the years to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:31:49.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
