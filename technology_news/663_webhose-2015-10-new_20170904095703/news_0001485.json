It’s free to list, and the start-up then markets that space through online and offline channels.\nThe website is available today in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but Mr Rosenbaum is ­already eyeing an international expansion, as well as other types of space. He said Spacer, which had been in soft launch mode, had already gained traction with some of Australia’s local councils, where street congestion is proving to be a big issue.\n“Many councils are looking at ways to get boats, caravans and other large items off the streets,” he said. “We are currently in discussions with a number of councils about partnerships to support their local community needs, as well as a number of sporting clubs, and industrial real estate providers to secure listings of under-utilised commercial properties on the platform.”\nSpacer’s prices are typically 50 per cent of what one would pay at traditional self-storage facilities and users pay on a month-to-month basis with no lock-ins.\nMr Rosenbaum said although his team was small his track record and following made it relatively easy to raise the $1m required, which should ensure the start-up has a runway of at least 18 months.\n“Our aim is to grow the market and we think we will bring new users to the storage market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:01:47.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
