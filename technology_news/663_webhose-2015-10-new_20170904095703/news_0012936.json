Reses was in the role for a little over three years. She was responsible for business partnerships, merger and acquisitions, and heading up the company's HR departments. Reses left Yahoo last week to join Square , Jack Dorsey's payments technology company that just filed for an IPO. \n-- Lisa Licht, who wasSVP of Marketing Partnerships. Licht left Yahoo last week as well, according to Re/code , although it's unknown where she's headed to next. \n-- And Kathy Savitt, whowas chief marketing officer. She left in September to join an entertainment company. \nEarlier this year, Yahoo also lost its Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos to Facebook, and two key advertising executives -- Bruno Fernando-Ruiz and Mike Kerns -- to startups. \nMayer also gave an update on Yahoo's plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba on Tuesday. \nShe said the completion of the transaction may be delayed until January. \nYahoo ( YHOO , Tech30 ) reported $1.2 billion in sales during the past three months, a 7% increase. \nShares were down in after-hours trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:27:32.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
