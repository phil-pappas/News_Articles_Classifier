It went on to say that the university was in support of the students' demands.\nYet SRC sub-committee member, Azra Karim, said this was the first they had heard of the statement by university management.\n''I don't believe it's true. If Habib felt that way, then he would have come to address the students as we have been asking him to for days now. He keeps saying he wants to meet with student leaders,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:41:05.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
