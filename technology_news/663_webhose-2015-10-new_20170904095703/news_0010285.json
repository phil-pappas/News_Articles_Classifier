Thailand October 22, 2015 A man holds a towel to his mouth on October 8, 2015 as dense haze produced by Indonesian forest fires ups pollution levels at Lamai beach on Thailand's Kho Samui island \nDense haze from Indonesian forest fires has caused some of the worst pollution in southern Thailand for a decade, officials said Thursday, cancelling flights in an area popular with tourists. \nFor nearly two months, thousands of fires caused by slash-and-burn farming have choked vast expanses of Southeast Asia, causing rates of respiratory illnesses to soar, schools to close and scores of flights and some international events to be cancelled. \nThailand usually avoids the worst effects of Indonesia's fires, which annually blight Malaysia and Singapore. \nBut in recent weeks prevailing winds have brought the smog further north, stoking tensions and creating a headache for the country's vital tourism industry. \nThai officials Thursday said air quality had dipped to unhealthy levels in seven southern provinces, with particularly high readings in the southwestern province of Songkhla where some flights have been delayed or turned back. \n\"It's considered a crisis. It's the worst in 10 years,\" Halem Jemarican, head of the Environment Office in Songkhla, told AFP by phone. \n\"The key factor is the wind. It's strong at the hot spot origins but when it reaches Thailand the winds weaken so the haze stays around for longer,\" he added.

A flight to Songkhla's Hat Yai airport was also diverted on Wednesday evening. \nSouthern Thailand boasts many pristine tropical beaches and is an especially popular tourism destination. \nEarlier this month several planes packed with beach-bound tourists to Phuket and Koh Samui were forced to turn back because of haze levels. \nThailand's Public Health Ministry said it had distributed 55,700 facemasks in the south with a further 40,000 on the way. \nIn a statement the country's Pollution Control Department said it had \"called for Indonesia to implement measures to reduce burning in order to mitigate haze\".

Last week it launched its biggest fire-fighting push yet, with dozens of planes backing up thousands of personnel on the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:02:39.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
