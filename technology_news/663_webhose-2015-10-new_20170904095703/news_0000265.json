Stratus Video Interpreting —a leading provider of on-demand interpretation services—identifies the states and metropolitan areas where Syrian refugees are likely to be resettled, and advises healthcare providers in those locations to prepare for a rise in limited English proficient (LEP) patients requiring Arabic interpretation services.\nMillions of Syrians have fled from Bashar al-Assad’s regime and Islamic State forces, leading to what has been dubbed “the world’s largest humanitarian crisis since World War II” (3). Since 2011, more than 7.6 million Syrians have been internally displaced and nearly 4.1 million have left the country and registered as refugees (3). Nearly 430,000 refugees have applied for asylum in Europe, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has already referred 18,000 for resettlement in the United States (2)—with priority given to “vulnerable” individuals such as widowed women, unaccompanied children and those with life-threatening medical conditions (4).\nDuring fiscal year 2015, which ended on September 30, a total of 1,682 Syrians were admitted the United States (5). Nearly three-quarters of them were resettled among ten states: 184 in Texas; 179 in California; 179 in Michigan; 134 in Illinois; 125 in Arizona; 111 in Pennsylvania; 98 in Florida; 73 in New Jersey; 70 in Massachusetts; and 61 in Kentucky (5). Many of these states are already home to large Syrian-born populations; as of 2013, the top 10 metropolitan areas for Syrian natives were Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Riverside, Calif.; Detroit; Phoenix; Allentown, Pa.; Boston; Miami; and Atlanta (2).\n“When Syrian refugees begin arriving in larger numbers next year, they’re likely to be resettled in areas with established Syrian communities,” noted David Fetterolf, President of Stratus Video Interpreting. “Many of these new arrivals—including children, torture victims and those with serious health conditions—will need immediate medical care, and government regulations require that patients with limited English proficiency have access to qualified healthcare interpretation services. By examining current resettlement and residency patterns, we can predict areas that will likely experience an increased demand for medical interpreters.”\nFetterolf says healthcare providers in the above-mentioned cities and states would be wise to prepare for an influx of Syrian LEP patients, but points out there are also resettlement centers in less-populated places like Boise, Idaho and Huron, South Dakota. “All healthcare facilities should be ready to provide refugee patients with an interpreter that speaks their language and dialect,” advised Fetterolf. “On-demand interpretation services offer a convenient and affordable solution, especially in locations where interpreter availability is lacking or interpretation needs are more sporadic.”\nStratus provides certified healthcare interpretation services in nearly 200 languages, including Syrian dialects of Arabic and Kurdish. In addition to its over-the-phone interpretation services, Stratus offers video remote interpreting (VRI) in more than a dozen commonly spoken languages, with extended hours for Arabic VRI.\nFor more information on Stratus and its video remote interpreting services for limited English proficient patients, visit http://www.stratusvideo.com .\nAbout Stratus Video Interpreting:\nStratus Video Interpreting provides on-demand interpreter services by using technology to connect clients with interpreters in over 175 spoken and signed languages in less than 30 seconds.
