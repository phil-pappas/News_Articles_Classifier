The museum isn’t mounting a big Renoir show, or celebrating the artist in some other way. Any institution foolhardy enough to do so knows by now to expect some kind of pushback, because everyone hates Renoir, and everyone always has. Maybe even, yes, God.\nSo there wasn’t, in fact, a new or timely reason for the protestors to gather where and when they did—they just really hate Renoir. Max Geller, the leader of a group called Renoir Sucks at Painting, organized the strike earlier this week. And it’s fair to say Geller has strong feelings about the artist. Yesterday, after he received some counter-criticism from The Boston Globe ’s art critic, Sebastian Smee—who called the protest at the MFA “sophomoric”—Geller challenged him to a duel on Boston Common. But in denouncing the anti-Renoir movement as a stunt, even Smee wasn’t going so far as to stand up for Renoir.", "external_links": ["http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2015/10/05/renoir-haters-picket-outside-museum-fine-arts/e0ybbZMdhVclxN01wfmaYM/story.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:33:22.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
