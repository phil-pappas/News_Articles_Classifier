No addict finds himself suddenly addicted.\nThis impropriety usually begins with a mild liking for an object, then it assumes an uncontrollable devotion.\n“…the journey of a thousand miles usually begins with a step…”\nIf you take a journey and you find yourself at the end of a wrong road, what do you do?, ..Jump to the beginning of the road, that’s only possible in cartoons. So what do you do, you retrace your steps back to the beginning where you made the wrong turn. There is a process of retracting your commitment to addictions. It is never an easy procedure considering time and resources required but it has to be done if one must to do what is right.\nHowever, there must be a strong will that’s driving an addict to wanting to do the right thing.\nAddictions are the aftermath of a sequence of frequent actions taken with the best of intentions though never initially realizing the destructive consequences and they cannot be broken spontaneously, you can only abridge (gradually reduce your intake or frequency of actions) from the point or level where you currently are. If you are a chain smoking, reduce the quantity you take in, and before you ask how this is possible, here’s the thing; breaking an addiction is more psychological than it is just following routine blindly.\nThe war zone is actually in your mind, if you win it in your mind, you will win it in reality.\nTrick your mind into believing it’s the same quantity or the same usual activities you are taking and never try breaking addictions alone, get moral support from someone who is emphatic and is willing to help out. And just before you completely breakout, find a positive attitude or object to replace it with, something of keen interest to you which of course is good.\nRemember, Nature abhors vacuum.\nGood luck!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:04:02.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
