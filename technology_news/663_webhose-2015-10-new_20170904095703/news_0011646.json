This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America.”\nWhile Obama has repeatedly called for new gun controls, those attempts have hit a wall in Congress. Furthermore, of the gun laws enacted at the state level since the Newtown massacre, more have actually loosened restrictions than tightened them . Firearm production and sales have also increased since Obama took office.\nThe common liberal explanation for why this has happened is the entrenched power of the gun lobby—the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers. This isn’t wrong. The NRA’s power is considerable and it is carefully and effectively wielded. But focusing exclusively on the lobbying angle overlooks the very real fear and distrust with which many gun owners regard the government that drives much of the opposition to gun laws. Many of them simply don’t believe that enhanced background checks—or whatever other modest changes are proposed—are what they appear to be.", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/regulation/248950-gun-production-has-doubled-under-obama", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/10/us/state-gun-laws-enacted-in-the-year-since-newtown.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:13:13.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
