Loads of cars have wings but never for flying. \nIndeed the whole purpose aerodynamics is to create downforce and thus, ironically, keep the machine from achieving what wings are primarily good for. \nBut don’t give up on that flying-car dream. \n‘Sixty years of frustration’ might sum up past effort to achieve a truly useable car-o-plane (a descriptive coined in the 1950s) – not least Paul Moller, whose Skycar project, after 40 years and $100,000,000 in expenditure, has demonstrated nothing more than limited tethering hovering capability. \nYet there are some in the car industry who reckon they can still wing it. \nToyota is among those harbouring aero ideals. The New Zealand market leader has just filed a patent in the United States for a “stackable wing for an aerocar”. \nPatent number US20150246720 is a design for a multiple-wing system that can fold and be stored on the roof while the car is driving. Toyota's stackable wing patent. \nAgreed, the drawings are hardly over-detailed. And, yes, the whole concept of a series of wings protruding from the vehicle’s roof seems straight slightly slapstick. \nYet Toyota asserts it doesn’t have its head in the clouds. \n“Flying has always been a dream central to the history of humanity,” reads the patent, submitted on behalf of the company and two inventors. \n“Vehicles (aerocars) that demonstrate such capability provide operators with freedom, comfort and the ability to arrive quickly to a destination as mobility becomes three-dimensional yet remains private a brand doesn’t include details on how the car could take off, land or stay stable in the air.” \nRELATED: Simon Cowell wanted a flying car for his birthday \nIt appears to be a patent just on the wings with nothing said about propulsion methods. The brand has tacitly offered that thrust could be sourced from things “such as a pusher propeller, open rotor, turbofan, or other thrust generation system in flight mode”. \nMultiple airfoils aren’t made, either. Having wing sections that are no wider than the vehicle they serve and also quite thin makes them easier to stow compactly. \nAnd yet the sum total of their area is enough to provide sufficient lift, as much as a larger, more awkward single span would generate. \nToyota says the wings’ car-top carrier “facilitates a low profile and stylish body design potential” and is dimensioned so as not to “interfere with the side and aft view for the driver” when said vehicle is in its “roadable mode”. \nWhen extended, it seems the wings can assume various positions for takeoff, landing, and cruising. While the highest wing features a fixed section, the lower wings incorporate internal actuators to vary their section. \nThis not only alters the degree of lift, but also enables the wing to shrink in thickness. \n(As an aside, Toyota isn’t just aiming to fly high – the maker’s leading research and development man also let slip last year that hovering cars are also being researched, though it’s all simply theory at the moment – there are no prototypes floating around (literally) Toyota’s headquarters). \nToyota isn’t alone on the taxiway. Others testing the wind are Aeromobil and Terrafugia. \nAeromobil is a teensy Solvakian startup with big dreams, being adamant it will be producing fully-fledged consumer flying cars by 2017. Aeromobil reckons it will be producing flying cars by 2017. \nIt has credibility, having showed off its first working flying car prototype in 2013. Since then there's been improved study, Aeromobile 3.0, which can carry two people for 700 kilometres at a top speed of 200kmh. \nThe catch? It’s more aircraft than car and is set to be Bentley Bentayga money. \nOn paper, Terrafugia has an even stronger proposition in its TF-X: a four seater that can soar at up to 320km/h for a distance of up to 800km. \nIt also has a snazzier future-now propulsion system, in running a pair of electric motors combined with a grunty petrol engine (as a generator); this setup runs a ducted fan at the rear plus a propeller at the edge of each wing. \nAnd said wings furl into the body, as a bird’s would. And it’s all fly-by-wire, with computers assuming so much control that, the makers say, anyone can get the hang of flying it within a couple of hours. \nIt all sounds too good to be true ... and, in a way, it is. \nSo far the TF-X is still in a protoype form that, while able to represent the driving operation, appears incapable of flight. \nSo what of Canadian enthusiast Moller, who began working on his Skycar dream on 1963? Moller International still trades and the M400 \"volantor\", a fibreglass four-seater that emerged in 2003, is still touted as a goer. Moller's Skycar. \nBut this \"powered lift aircraft\" that relies on thrust generated from eight Wankel-type rotary engines working as ducted fans is still striking tubulence, mainly because the powerplant that allow cruising at 560kmh for a range of 1400km is still not in production. So it remains grounded, too. \nBut one day ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:45:34.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
