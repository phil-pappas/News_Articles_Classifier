At just 63.5/100mm (2.5/3.9 inch) x 150/178mm (5.9/7 inch) x 203mm (8.0 inch), the HPERC-IBR-H Series is a highly integrated, compact VITA 75 compliant unit almost 30% smaller than other leading competitive products.¹ The HPERC-IBR-H Series meets SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) requirements for modern military applications, with a focus on sensor data display, command, and control for mission computing in military ground or naval vehicles and mass image acquisition and processing for payload computing in UAVs.\nThe HPERC-IBR-H Series is a follow-on to ADLINK’s HPERC-IBR-M Series and features two models, the HPERC-IBR-HC coldplate mount system and the HPERC-IBR-HH finned-convection systems. Both units offer dual- or quad-core Intel® Core i7 processor technology and optional GPGPU parallel processing engine on a 16-lane 3rd generation PCI Express interface, as well as DDR3L-1333 ECC soldered down memory up to 16GB. The Extreme Rugged system also includes dual removable solid state drives, as well as four USB 3.0, two USB 2.0, four GbE, seven Serial (RS-232/422/485), and one VGA plus three digital video HDMI/DisplayPort/DVI interfaces. The HPERC-IBR-H Series provides expansion options to support fast and easy integration of additional interface cards such as PCI/104-Express and Mini PCI Express.\n“The HPERC-IBR-H Series offers intense capabilities in a compact form factor, leveraging high performance graphics capabilities and a wealth of I/O support for camera and vehicle data buses,” said Yong Luo, general manager of ADLINK's Embedded Computing Product Segment. “This tightly integrated solution offers equivalent or better performance than competitive systems in a smaller footprint, with space requirements being a critical component of any successful in-vehicle military applications.”\nTo endure harsh environments, the HPERC-IBR-H Series was developed using ADLINK’s Rugged by Design methodology to withstand extreme shock, corrosion and galvanic oxidation. The HPERC-IBR offers flexible cooling options: the HPERC-IBR-HC (-40°C to +85°C) for cold-plate cooling, and the HPERC-IBR-HH (-40°C to +75°C) designed for natural convection cooling.\nThe ADLINK HPERC Series is compliant to VITA 75 20/21/22 small form factor mounting and provides a wide array of fast I/O via MIL-DTL-38999 connectors. Additional expansion interfaces to meet the demands of various sensor suites are easily added with user-defined I/O pins.\nFor more information on ADLINK’s HPERC rugged COTS computing systems, please visit: http://www.adlinktech.com/Extreme-Rugged-System/index.php\nAbout ADLINK\nADLINK Technology is enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) with innovative embedded computing solutions for edge devices, intelligent gateways and cloud services.
