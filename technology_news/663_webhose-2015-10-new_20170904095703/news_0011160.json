It's fast food that is not customary for our country,\" said Alexander Agureyev, who oversees catering for the International Space Station at the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nAccording to Agureyev, proposals to change space menus have been plentiful since space food began to be mass produced in 2011.\nAstronauts' menus are generally made up of refrigerated, dehydrated and canned foods with long shelf lives.\nWhile a variety of ethnic and fast foods ranging from hamburgers to chicken teriyaki are currently available on menus for American astronauts, the menu for Russian cosmonauts has generally featured more traditional fare such as borscht, cottage cheese and caviar.\nDuring the first joint U.S.-Soviet space flight in 1975, Russian astronauts famously treated their American colleagues to tubes of borscht paste with vodka labels jokingly taped on the outside.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:48:28.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
