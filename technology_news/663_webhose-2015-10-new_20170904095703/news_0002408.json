Cepheid expects revenue of about $126.5 million for the period.\nCepheid said third-quarter gross margin excluding items was about 48%. It expects a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter and said it remains committed to its 2017 goal of 60% gross margin excluding items.\nIlan Daskal, who joined Cepheid in April as chief financial officer, left in August. Dan Madden, who was corporate controller and a former interim CFO, was named financial chief.\nWrite to Josh Beckerman at josh.beckerman@wsj.com\n 13, 2015 19:25 ET (23:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:07:16.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
