This year's theme — Cowboy Up, Take Cancer Down! — Perfectly articulated this fundraising tradition's goal. With 3,500 guests in attendance, the energy was buzzing from the moment doors opened to the invitation-only VIP Baron Party. Shortly after 7 p.m., the festivities got underway with the 'Cowboy Buffet' dinner with items such as beef brisket, smoked sausage and shrimp jambalaya.\nThe Ray Johnston Band got the entertainment started before the auctioneers rallied the crowd to bid big and bold to give cancer the boot. One highlight of the auction came when the “Barbecue with Dallas' Finest Chefs” package hit the block. Alumni’s took the stage to help drive up the bids, and the charismatic crew sold two of 'em for $70,000 apiece. More big bucks were raised when Hall of Famer Charles Haley showed up to help his Poker with Dallas Football Greats package, which sold for just under $100,000.\nPost auction, guests filed into the Andrews Distributing Main Stage to see three-time Grammy Award-winning country music legend Tim McGraw. His personable, chatty, and downright dreamy set included past and present hits and a serenade — which someone won at the live auction, of course. The Louisiana boy playfully picked on the Texas guests and won them over with \"The Cowboy in Me,\" among other songs.\nAbout Cattle Barons Gala: Since 1974, this gala has raised nearly $60 million. The first Cattle Baron's Ball was a full-fledged Texas barbecue, attracting 500 guests and raising $56,000. Last year, it raised $3.6 million.\nAbout Aschere: Aschere Energy’s integrated business model combines performance and responsibility with a strategic vision.
