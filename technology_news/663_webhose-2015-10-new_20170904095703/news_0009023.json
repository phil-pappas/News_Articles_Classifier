(Networks, of course, are being continuously accused in public debate of being inefficient investors, a criticism they vigorously contest, not least in the current tribunal hearing examining the AER’s recent decisions and its new benchmarking approach.)\nAnother contributor to the regulator’s annual review is former board member Ed Willett, who makes two interesting observations.\nThe east coast electricity market, he declares, is “by a clear margin” the best in the world -- but it has “clear vulnerabilities.”\nNetwork prices are too high. The wholesale contract market is too thin. The power spot market’s continuing viability -- rather than performing as “a mere dispatch engine” -- is at risk. Demand-side participation “remains formative.”\nFor all this, Willett reminds critics of the regulatory system, to remember where we started: at the beginning of the century national competition policy energy reforms “had run out of puff” and federal, state and territory energy policy processes “were moribund”.\nThere have been “hiccups” along the way, he acknowledges, but “the big picture has been smooth implementation of fundamental changes in a difficult political environment”.\nThis is probably a red rag for the many agitated consumer bodies (not to mention agitated network managers) now crowding the debate but perhaps they all should remember that Victorian adage: “keep a tight hold of nurse for fear of getting something worse.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:56:20.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
