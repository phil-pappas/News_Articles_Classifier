CEO Kazuo Hirai told a technology conference on Tuesday that following the hack, the movie studio has “come out more resilient, more strong, and they have a very good management team in place now.” Hirai said there wasn’t much of a business impact from the hack, although he said employee morale was hurt for a short time.\nFormer Sony Pictures co-chairwoman Amy Pascal left her position after a trove of embarrassing e-mails was leaked, including racially insensitive remarks about President Obama’s purported taste in movies. She continues to run a production venture at Sony that will handle major blockbuster franchises such as the “Spider-Man” series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:08:11.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
