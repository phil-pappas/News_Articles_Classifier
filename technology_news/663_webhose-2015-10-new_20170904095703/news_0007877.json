In the 12-month period, ACL reported that it surpassed its growth goals, disrupted the category with major upgrades to its suite of software solutions, and enriched the value of those solutions with new content services including ScriptHub and ACL Academy. ACL also mobilized talent with dramatic hiring across R&D, Customer Service, and Sales in Europe and Asia, while receiving further recognition as one of Canada's top employers. Additionally, ACL transformed its business model by converting effectively its entire customer base to subscription licensing in a single year, less than a third the time it has taken most leading software companies to do the same. “Our significant progress in fiscal year 2015 is a culmination of the last four years of effort anchored around three priorities: 1) Mobilizing Talent, 2) Disrupting the Category, and 3) Transforming our Business Model. Today, 75% of employees are new to their role with the highest employee satisfaction levels on record, our investment in R&D doubled, we've transitioned our product into the cloud, and converted our business model to subscription,” said Laurie Schultz , President and CEO of ACL . “Our growth is evidence of the market's buy-in to our Data-Driven GRC value proposition—borne of the integration of our heritage Analytics business with our recently acquired cloud-based GRC gear and content. In just three years, we've grown our GRC customer base to a number that exceeds the majority of vendors in the market on our unique emphasis on DATA integration, DESIGN (ease of use), and DEPLOYMENT (cloud and mobile). We intend to accelerate this with increased investment in technology, marketing, and sales.” ACL also appointed a new CFO to the leadership team . Brent Flichel brings to ACL more than 25 years of experience, spanning a range of privately held and publicly listed technology companies.
