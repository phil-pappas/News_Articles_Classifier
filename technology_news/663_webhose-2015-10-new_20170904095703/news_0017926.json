It fell as much as 6.6 percent Tuesday as investors questioned the industry’s outlook for profit growth.\n“There’s certainly been a shift in sentiment in biotech, I think that goes without saying,” said James Gaul , a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors LLC, which oversees $2.8 billion. “It had such a strong run for such a long time and needed the reason to sell off.”\nProspects for earnings growth in the larger health care sector, one of just four S&P 500 groups that analysts expected to expand profit in the third quarter, took a hit Tuesday as Greatbatch Inc. in Frisco, Texas, maker of electronic equipment for medical devices, and Illumina Inc. in San Diego, a maker of gene analysis systems, lowered sales forecasts.\nGreatbatch sales this year will be between $685 million and $695 million, the company reported, compared with earlier estimates of as much as $730 million. Revenue at Illumina, the biggest maker of DNA decoders, will be about $570 million in the fourth quarter, compared with the average forecast of $603.2 million, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nAll but two companies in the 143-member biotech index fell. Exact Sciences Corp. plunged 45 percent after a U.S. panel of medical experts questioned the benefits of a colon cancer test.\nOliver Renick and Kate Garber are Bloomberg writers.
