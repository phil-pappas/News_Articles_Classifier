I think there's a story here.\nI recently saw a graph showing that for each province, the ANC level of support is directly inverse to the level of maths and science skills, and the ANC know it.\nThey know that a large proportion of qualified students will not vote ANC. I believe that their covert policy is that schools are designed to educate those that through lack of funds are forced to go to state non-Model C schools (ie about 80% of learners) only sufficiently to function as \"hewers of wood, carriers of water and voters of the ANC\", and to squeeze university funding to 1/12 of what it logically should be as a proportion of the schools budget.\nAll the facts (tolerance of SADTU, abolishing teacher training colleges, OBE that was doomed to fail learners, WEF ratings at #142 out of 144 countries, 30% pass rate for matric, university funding at 1/13 of what it should be, etc) all fit perfectly and consistently with this theory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:11:55.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
