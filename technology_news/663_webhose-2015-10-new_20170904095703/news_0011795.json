Broadcasters must commit to a preferred initial bid option by March 29, as well.\nA senior FCC official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the whole process will likely close in the second or third quarter of 2016.\nAccording to the notice, the highest opening price in the auction is $900 million, which would go to WCBS-TV in New York.\n(Reporting by Lisa Lambert ; Editing by Will Dunham )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:07.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
