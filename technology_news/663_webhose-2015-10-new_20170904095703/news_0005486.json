The apps using Youmi's SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected.\"\nApple hasn't explicitly named which apps were responsible for stealing the personal data.\nBut it follows news that Facebook will now alert users when \"government-sponsored\" hackers target their profiles .\nIn a blog post, Alex Stamos, chief security officer at Facebook, said the social network will flag up \"targeted attacks\".\n\"Starting today, we will notify you if we believe your account has been targeted or compromised by an attacker suspected of working on behalf of a nation-state,\" he said.\nAnyone who comes under attack will be given a warning, advising them their account has been compromised.\nThis isn't the first time Apple has had to defend its online store against a Chinese threat. In September, tainted Chinese apps were loaded on through the Xcode vulnerability .\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/notifications-for-targeted-attacks/10153092994615766", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:32:16.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
