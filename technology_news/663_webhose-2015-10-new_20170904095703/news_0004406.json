As an entirely new distribution channel that’s available today to any brand or agency, TapFire’s optimized distribution engine amplifies content distribution, while protecting and improving brand reputation by connecting the best performing content with relevant influencers who reach a highly-targeted audience. \nTapFire automates and optimizes the distribution and amplification of brand content in two ways: Content Optimization enables marketers to: Identify the top performing content type (a blog post, image, or video) that will perform best across a given social channel (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, etc.) by testing with seed influencers across a variety of verticals (i.e. millennials, baby boomers, foodies, runners, etc.) Analyze performance based on those results and automatically select winning content, platforms, and verticals Influencer Optimization gives marketers the power to: Test winning content with influencer groups to reveal the best audiences for the specific piece of winning content Distribute that winning content to the highest performing influencer groups based on influencer group test performance to reach highly-targeted audiences and meet brand goals \n“TapFire solves a problem all digital marketers are facing.
