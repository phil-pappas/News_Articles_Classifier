NEON Signal Mapper is an Android application tightly integrated with the NEON Indoor Location Solution that enables users to cost-effectively, quickly and accurately map the measurements taken indoors where GPS is unavailable. Eliminating the need to take measurements using labor-intensive, time-consuming and error-prone manual techniques, the NEON Signal Mapper application allows users to:\nQuickly create geo-referenced 3D building maps Track user location in 3D Log user position and elevation Retrieve logs and export for processing Display log information on 3D maps\nWith NEON Signal Mapper, users can reduce the time, complexity and cost of indoor signal testing. The NEON Indoor Location Solution also provides an API that delivers this real-time location information, making it easy to integrate with existing test and measurement equipment and applications.\nThe NEON Signal Mapper's intuitive Android user interface and small tracking accessory enable lightly trained personnel to quickly and accurately log location information inside buildings. Users taking indoor signal measurements simply initialize their starting locations in the NEON Signal Mapper application and then walk through the building to generate time stamped location data that is synchronized with signal data. When the walk-throughs are complete, all of the collected location data is uploaded to the cloud, which enables centralized access to the data. The NEON Command Software allows visualization of 3D building maps showing the tracks and corresponding signal data collected.\n\"Enterprises, building owners, engineering companies and service providers are increasingly working to validate wireless coverage and service quality in complex indoor environments,\" said Carol Politi, CEO of TRX Systems. \"NEON Signal Mapper was designed to simplify the task of signal mapping indoors by eliminating some of the error-prone manual processes used when collecting indoor signal data today.\"\nTRX conducted a live demonstration of the NEON Signal Mapper application at the recent ION GNSS+ conference in Tampa, Fla. The demonstration met with rave reviews and was dubbed the \"winning demonstration\" of the show by GPS World. The TRX team used the new, small NEON Tracking Unit to map their movement across multiple floors and meeting rooms of the Tampa Convention Center with only inertial navigation and with no pre-planning or installed infrastructure.\nNEON Signal Mapper Developer’s Kits Available\nThe NEON Signal Mapper Developer's Kit provides the software and accessories for seamless integration with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular signal mapping applications. The NEON API may be used by custom Android signal mapping applications to access NEON 3D location information. The Developer's Kit includes the NEON Command Software, NEON Location Service, NEON Signal Mapper Application, NEON API, four NEON Tracking Units, and six months of NEON Cloud Service.\nAbout TRX\nTRX Systems is the developer of the NEON® Indoor Location Solution , delivering location and mapping indoors, underground and in dense urban areas where GPS is not available or is unreliable. NEON delivers ubiquitous, low cost 3D indoor location through the use of advanced sensor fusion, ranging, and patented, dynamic mapping algorithms.\nTRX Systems is the recipient of the 2015 Silver Edison Award for innovation in the Navigation and Robotics category, the Tibbetts Award given by the U.S. Small Business Administration for innovation and economic impact of research and development, the TEDCO ICE Award for Corporate Excellence and the Innovator Award from the Chesapeake Regional Tech Counsel (CRTC). TRX indoor location software development has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. Army and the Department of Homeland Security.
