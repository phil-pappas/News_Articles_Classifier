This release also includes new versions of Aperio eSlide Manager, Aperio ImageScope and Aperio Scanners. \n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150917/267841 ) \nThe new Aperio Image Analysis Workstation provides an entry-level solution for researchers to leverage the proven power of Aperio Image Analysis algorithms directly on a local computer. Users will be able to analyze whole slides or regions of interest with no additional IT overhead. Furthermore, the workstation deployment option scales to server-side image analysis should throughput requirements increase during use. \nReferenced in hundreds of peer review publications, Aperio image analysis has been at the forefront in digital pathology research and biomarker discovery for almost a decade. With over twenty-thousand downloads since its introduction, Aperio ImageScope is the world's most widely used digital pathology viewer. It now contains advanced functionality for z-stacked images and multichannel fluorescence, plus improved annotation, Image Analysis Tuning and navigation tools. In addition, this release includes the availability of the Aperio eSlide Manager v12.3 with performance advancements in the integrated web-viewer and simplified workflows. Both Aperio ImageScope and the integrated web viewer in Aperio eSlide Manager v12.3 benefit from improved handling and performance of SCN format whole slide images. \nMoreover, whole slide images, with up to 25 z-stacks, can now be captured on the Aperio AT2 , CS2 and AT Turbo scanners, to enable optimal digitization of thick sections or cytology preparations. \n\"Aperio Image Analysis Workstation gives researchers a powerful, yet affordable means to begin using automated, quantitative analysis techniques,\" said Puneet Sarin , vice president and general manager of Leica Biosystems Pathology Imaging Business. \"This highlights Leica Biosystems commitment to customers to deliver innovative new solutions while also providing ongoing support and improvements to existing products.\" \nDownload your free copy of the Aperio ImageScope software now, or visit our website at LeicaBiosystems.com/AperioImageScope. \nAbout Aperio Image Analysis Workstation \nThe Aperio Image Analysis Workstation is *For Research Use Only.
