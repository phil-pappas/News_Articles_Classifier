Supplied \"Places like Australia are more adventurous than say China, which is completely closed off,\" he said. \"Australians like software and they like security.\"\nMr McClure said his company's software was taking advantage of the same kind of artificial intelligence that hackers were now using.\n\"The only way to defeat a machine is to use a machine â€¦ and there is a lot of wealth in Australia making it a very attractive target,\" he said.\n\"Artificial intelligence algorithms are algorithms that self learn. They learn to classify the good and the bad and any mutations of malware, spyware, ransomware, whatever.\"\n An energetic Californian, McClure sits down at his bulky laptop and pulls up a list of ferocious viruses, freely available to download online.\n\"What's your favourite virus?\" he asks seriously. \"Australians often get hit with ransomware so let's get one of those.\"\nWithin minutes, McClure has unleashed a host of attacks on his computer and watches web security blockers McAfee and Sophos fail to capture the string of attacks, which seep through the end-point and infect the computer.\n\"They don't recognise mutations of spyware whereas Cylance can read if it's destructive,\" he says as he sets up the attack again, this time on CylancePROTECT. Gleefully, he attacks his own security tool and watches the list of blocked viruses grow.\nOutdated methods The traditional \"signature\" detection model of enterprise security relies on authenticating the origin of a digital message and giving the receiver a reason to believe a known sender created the message. Mr McClure said signatures quickly become out of date as new mutations of malware develop.\n\"Signatures mean you have to constantly update the product, which is annoying and dangerous for the client. We don't have that, we also don't use the cloud, so you can be completely disconnected.\"\nThe average cost of a data breach to an Australian business is more than $2.5 million a year, according to Deloitte's cyber intelligence centre, with the average breach involving more than 20,000 records over the five years to 2014.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/118426044981129025592", "https://twitter.com/jessicasier"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:20:42.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
