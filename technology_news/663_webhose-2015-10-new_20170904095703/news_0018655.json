For the development of new components for the race car, four measurement modules and one data logger have been made available by CSM. The entire drivetrain along with the engine, gearbox, inverter and cooling, as well as the chassis, have been redesigned.\nWhen developing its Formula E race car, ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport mounted the CSM measurement modules directly to the traction battery of the vehicle for test bench tests and during test drives to carry out the required measurements.\nFor optimizing the chassis, the mechanical stress on the push rods of the axle suspension has been measured with an STGMM strain gauge measurement module. Since cooling plays an important role for the energy efficiency of electric engines, a PTMM temperature measurement module has been used to optimize the cooling system of the drivetrain, and for measuring the temperature of the oil and the cooling water. The air resistance which for example depends on the height of a vehicle is another key element for energy efficiency. In order to keep the height as low as possible, several laser distance sensors have been connected to two CSM ADMM measurement modules to calculate the optimum distance between the vehicle floor to the road surface.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/ABT%20Sportsline%20GmbH.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:39:32.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
