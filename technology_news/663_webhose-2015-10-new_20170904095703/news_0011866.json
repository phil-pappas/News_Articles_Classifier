It’s a trust multiplier, and people really will want to work for you and be on a mission together with you. You were C.E.O. at SuccessFactors, a cloud-based software company. What rules of the road did you set for culture there? One of the rules was about email — no blind copying. And if someone emailed me complaining about a colleague, I would add the person they were complaining about to the email string and say something like, “Hi, Kim, it looks like Carl has something to talk to you about. I really look forward to you guys meeting and figuring this one out.” That sends a powerful message. It goes back to daring to be human and talking to people face to face about problems. When you look someone in the eye, you’re not going to be that rude. It’s just impossible. The funny thing is when it becomes routine in your life, it becomes the most rewarding part. In fact, I seek it out, because there’s where I can make the biggest contribution. If you can get organizational silos to talk to each other, then you can have power in your organization. How do you hire? One question I ask about 10 minutes into the interview, after we’ve created some trust, is “What did you learn from your mom?” It’s an incredibly powerful question. And then I’ll ask them about their father. Not that anyone should go first, but is there a reason you start with mothers? I don’t know. I think it’s because it will give me more of an insight into the person’s emotions. Basically I’m testing them to see, “How human are you ready to be with me?” I also like to ask people about the mistakes they’ve made. You think their answers will be so rehearsed, but I remember one person who said, “Well, that’s a funny thing. I’ve never made any mistakes.” Up until that point, I was thinking, I can’t wait to hire him. Then I wondered how I could get out of the interview without being rude. What advice do you give to new college grads? If you’re not truly committed to what you’re doing, whatever it is, don’t even begin. Because you basically won’t be able to make it through and you will be in a world of pain and misery. Are you going to have the courage to go after whatever you’re doing and be legendary, or are you going to just sort of tell yourself stories and excuses about why you couldn’t get there? \nEach week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership.
