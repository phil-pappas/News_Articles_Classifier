Analysts had forecast a non-IFRS net profit of EUR1.09 billion for the quarter, according to a recent poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal.\n\"Clearly the third quarter is a beat,\" said Chief Executive Bill McDermott, suggesting that the company had a chance to \"outrun\" its guidance for the full year.\nSAP last week reiterated its outlook for fiscal year 2015, saying it expects full-year non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to be in a range of EUR1.95 billion to EUR2.05 billion at constant currencies. Full year non-IFRS operating profit should be in a range of EUR5.6 billion to EUR5.9 billion at constant currencies.\nSAP pre-released some of its third quarter figures last week, reporting a 5% increase in the company's closely watched operating profit, to EUR1.21 billion. Total revenue rose by 17% to EUR4.98 billion, buoyed by strong growth in the cloud and a solid uptake of new on-premise software licenses. Cloud subscriptions and support revenue increased by over 100% to EUR599 million year-over-year.\nMr. McDermott has moved in recent years to focus the company more squarely on cloud technology, rather than on-premise software. The strategy shift has included a series of acquisitions, such as last year's $8.2 billion purchase of U.S.-based cloud expense management software provider, Concur Technologies Inc.\nSAP earlier this year launched a redesign of its core Business Suite software, S/4HANA, which operates on the company's real-time, in-memory database--either in the cloud, on hardware or as part of a hybrid solution. SAP said it had more than 1,300 S/4HANA customers at the end of the third quarter.\nSAP's final third quarter results were largely in line with analysts' expectations. Analysts at DZ Bank noted Tuesday that the figures did \"not surprise\" and that SAP was making progress relative to its cloud competitors.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600\nAccess Investor Kit for \"SAP SE\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042\n 20, 2015 04:52 ET (08:52 ", "external_links": ["http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=DE0007164600", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US8030542042", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:22:34.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
