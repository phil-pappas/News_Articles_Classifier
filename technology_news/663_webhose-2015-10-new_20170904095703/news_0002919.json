Executives at the social-media marketing agency said Wednesday that it is hunting for office space in London for a European headquarters that will open next year. \nThe move is part of the rapid growth of the company that CEO Gary Vaynerchuk, a Crain's 40 Under 40 honoree this year, co-founded in 2009. Last week, VaynerMedia announced that it will be leaving its current home on Park Avenue South for a new headquarters in Hudson Yards. \n\"When we looked at the current marketplace, we believed that the U.K. specifically has a lot of 'white space' that, in 2016, will be huge for social and digital marketing,\" Vaynerchuk wrote in an email. \nThe company, which employs more than 500 people—about 440 in New York—will be taking 88,000 square feet at 10 Hudson Yards. The far West Side development is scheduled to open early next year. \nVaynerMedia also has offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chattanooga, Tenn. The London office should be open by next summer, and will house about 10 employees. \n\"We're building for the long term in Europe,\" said Vice President Eric Fulwiler, who will be leading the London office. \"We'll take a year to map the landscape. We want to make sure we fully understand the new cultures, audiences and markets in Europe.\" \nNews of VaynerMedia's London move was first reported by PRWeek.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:47:35.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
