First-time implementations, mobility-based upgrades and composite content applications (CCAs) helped drive continuous double-digit growth during 2014 in the regions of Asia/Pacific, Greater China, and Middle East and Africa.\"²\nThe report also states that, \"Product specialization — aligned to country-based business requirements — increased the fragmentation of market share as best-of-breed and regional vendors succeeded in out-competing their larger international rivals. The era of large-scale single vendor deployments across the whole enterprise is being increasingly undermined by business-specific solutions, new content types and an expanding number of SaaS tools that are brought in by users themselves.\" The report goes on to state, \"By 2018, 50 percent of enterprises will be managing their content using a hybrid content architecture.\"³\n\"It's an honor to be recognized by Gartner for the fourth consecutive year in their Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management,\" said Greg Milliken, vice president of marketing of M-Files Corporation. \"We see this as validation that we’ve been succeeding in offering solutions to organizations around that world that are highly competitive with the traditional ‘enterprise’ vendors, while also continuing to meet the needs of small and medium sized businesses. We have a unique metadata-driven approach to information management that is helping businesses achieve dramatically better business performance and faster ROI. This unique approach, and a disciplined focus on customer success, are two key reasons we're growing at a much higher rate than the market at large as well as any other particular ECM vendor.\"\nM-Files revenue increased more than 75 percent in 2014, culminating in a robust six-year growth rate of nearly 1,100 percent. The success of M-Files has been driven by strong revenue growth in key regions around the world. In 2014, the company's revenue grew more than 100 percent in North America and the Asia-Pacific region, and nearly 70 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). In addition, M-Files experienced a strong surge in the adoption of its cloud-based EIM solutions, with more than a 70 percent increase in cloud-based revenue in 2014 over 2013. The M-Files reseller channel was also a key driver of worldwide growth in 2014, with total revenue generated through the company’s reseller network growing by nearly 80 percent compared to 2013.\n\"Our unique metadata-driven architecture, our hybrid cloud deployment capabilities and our intuitive interface and easy user adoption is one of the key strengths of M-Files,\" continued Milliken. \"We wholeheartedly agree that this combination of a unique modern architecture, the choice to deploy in the cloud or on-premises with identical functionality and user experience, and dramatically better user adoption are key success factors for M-Files. But when you get past all the technical analyses and jargon, customers tell us M-Files just works better.\"\n“We transitioned to M-Files from OpenText because we were experiencing a lack of consistency in how our electronic documents were stored and imaged,\" said Darren Lowe, vice president of Information Technology with Stearns Bank. “Now with M-Files, we have a consistent structure and process for organizing and managing information that is nearly impossible to deviate from. The result is that we are no longer wasting time searching for documents or losing important paperwork.”\nAbout the Magic Quadrant\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
