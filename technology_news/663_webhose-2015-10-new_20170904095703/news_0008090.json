And the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, with its Emerging Analytics Center, is charging ahead in seeking to translate big data into better ways for Arkansas companies to do business. \nIn other words: We’ve got no problem with data and its measurement. Data is business oxygen. \nBut we’re old-fashioned in this regard: Some things can’t be measured. They happen to be the best things — faith, hope and love. Courage. Perseverance. Joy. And rating people when what’s best about them can’t be measured is a lie. Unfortunately, it’s a lie that Peeple proposes to share with the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:53:43.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
