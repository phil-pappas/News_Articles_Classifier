But her communications may not have been any more secure had she used a State Department email address, judging by years of independent audits that excoriated the department over poor cyber security on Clinton's watch. \nThe State Department's unclassified email system was breached by hackers linked to Russia last year who stole an unspecified number of emails. The hackers hit a department that was among the worst agencies in the federal government at protecting its computer networks while Clinton was secretary from 2009 to 2013, a situation that continued to deteriorate as John Kerry took office, according to independent audits and interviews. \nThe State Department's compliance with federal cybersecurity standards was below average when Clinton took over but grew worse in each year of her tenure, according to an annual report card compiled by the White House based on audits by agency watchdogs. Network security continued to slip after Kerry replaced Clinton in February 2013, and remains substandard, according to the State Department inspector general. \nIn each year from 2011 to 2014, the State Department's poor cybersecurity was identified by the inspector general as a \"significant deficiency\" that put the department's information at risk. The latest assessment is due to be published in a few weeks. \nClinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has apologized for her use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state. The FBI is investigating whether her home server was breached. \n--- \nJustin Trudeau's re-energized Liberals take early lead in Canada's elections \nTORONTO (AP) — The Liberal Party of Justin Trudeau took an early lead in Canadian elections Monday that pitted the son of one of Canada's most famous politicians against Stephen Harper, the Conservative politician who has led the country for almost a decade. \nCanada has shifted to the center-right under Harper, who has lowered sales and corporate taxes, avoided climate change legislation and clashed with the Obama administration over the Keystone XL pipeline. But after nearly 10 years in power, he has trailed in opinion polls behind Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, the son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. \nPolls have closed throughout Canada's Atlantic region. It will be a while before the rest of the country catches up, with the last of the polls closing in Canada's Pacific Coast province of British Columbia at 10 p.m. EDT (0200 GMT). \nThe governing Conservatives held 13 of Atlantic Canada's 32 seats and the New Democratic Party held six when the election was called but Liberals were leading in 30 of the region's districts in early vote counting. \n\"A sea of change here. We are used to high tides in Atlantic Canada. This is not what we hoped for,\" said Peter MacKay, a former senior Conservative cabinet minister \n--- \n10 Things to Know for Tuesday \nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Tuesday: \n1. WHERE THE DEATH OF A MIGRANT HAS TRIGGERED NATIONAL SOUL-SEARCHING \nAfter an Eritrean was killed after being mistaken for an attacker, Israelis reflect on how they are reacting to recent Palestinian violence. \n--- \nSouth African official says Oscar Pistorius released from prison, put under house arrest \nJOHANNESBURG (AP) — Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee Olympic runner who fatally shot his girlfriend in 2013, was released from prison and placed under house arrest on Monday night, a South African official said. \n\"Oscar Pistorius was placed under correctional supervision tonight,\" Manelisi Wolela, a spokesman for South Africa's correctional services department, said in a cellphone text message sent to journalists. \nWolela cited officials at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre, a prison in the South African capital of Pretoria where Pistorius had served nearly a year of his five-year sentence for manslaughter. \nThe correctional services department had originally said Pistorius would be released from the Pretoria jail on Tuesday in line with a decision by a parole board at the prison. \n\"The handling of the actual placement is an operational matter of the local management, and how they handle it is their prerogative that is carried out in the best interest of all parties concerned, the victims, the offender and the Department of Correction Services,\" Wolela said in a second text message. \n--- \nFatal beating of Eritrean migrant prompts soul-searching in Israel amid wave of violence \nJERUSALEM (AP) — The death of an Eritrean migrant who was shot and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian attacker set off a round of soul-searching Monday amid the jittery atmosphere sweeping Israel in a wave of unrest. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the vigilantism. Some critics accused Israel's leaders of fostering the charged climate, while others called for the swift prosecution of the crazed mob. \n\"It is a disgrace to Israeli society, and those that carried out this lynching need to be found and brought to justice,\" said Yaakov Amidror, Netanyahu's former national security adviser. \n\"Even if it was the terrorist himself, by the way, after he was shot, after he was neutralized and lying on the floor, you need to be an animal to torment him,\" he told Israel Radio. \nNine Israelis have been killed in the past month in the attacks, mostly stabbings, on city streets. At least 41 Palestinians have been killed — including 20 identified by Israeli authorities as attackers; the rest were slain in clashes with Israeli forces. \n--- \nOhio delays executions until 2017 citing ongoing problems obtaining lethal injection drugs \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio is putting off executions until at least 2017 as the state struggles to obtain supplies of lethal injection drugs, delaying capital punishment for a full two years, the prisons department announced Monday. \nExecution dates for 11 inmates scheduled to die next year and one scheduled for early 2017 were all pushed into ensuing years through warrants of reprieve issued by Gov. John Kasich. \nThe result is 25 inmates with execution dates beginning in January 2017 that are now scheduled through August 2019. Ohio last put someone to death in January 2014. \nOhio has run out of supplies of its previous drugs and has unsuccessfully sought new amounts, including so-far failed attempts to import chemicals from overseas. \nThe new dates are needed to give the prisons agency extra time, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in a statement. \n--- \nSea of migrants reach Croatia as police lower border obstacles, face Slovenia bottleneck next \nBERKASOVO, Serbia (AP) — Thousands of people trying to reach the heart of Europe surged across Serbia's border into Croatia on Monday after authorities eased restrictions that had left them stranded for days in ankle-deep mud and rain. \nThe miserable wave of humanity left behind a field scattered with soaked blankets, mud-caked clothing and water-logged tents as they headed for Slovenia, the next obstacle to their quest to reach richer European Union nations via the Balkans. \nMonday's surprise move allowed an estimated 3,000 more migrants to enter Croatia bound for its small Alpine neighbor, which also has been struggling to slow the flow of humanity across its frontiers — and faced another wave of trekkers seeking to reach Austria and Germany to the north. \n\"Without any announcement, the borders opened. When the borders opened, everybody rushed,\" said Melita Sunjic, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, who was stationed at the Serb-Croat border. \nMany had discarded their mud-soaked socks and walked only in sandals or slippers through the ankle-deep muck in a driving rain, frigid winds and fog. Some who had lost limbs during the civil war in Syria were aided by friends pushing their wheelchairs down a country lane that, since Saturday, had been blocked by Croat police. \n--- \nDemocrats on Benghazi panel issue report disputing GOP claims about Hillary Clinton \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats on the House committee investigating the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya, issued a report Monday disputing what they say are unsubstantiated claims about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by some Republican members of Congress and GOP presidential candidates. \nThe 124-page report summarizes the results of 54 interviews and depositions conducted by the committee and includes some unclassified testimony from several top Clinton aides, including her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills. \nRep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's top Democrat, said the report shows that no witness has substantiated what he called \"wild Republican conspiracy theories about Secretary Clinton and Benghazi,\" including a widely debunked claim that Clinton or other top officials issued a \"stand down\" order during the September 2012 attacks. \n\"It's time to bring this taxpayer-funded fishing expedition to an end,\" Cummings said. He called on the panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, to move the committee's focus \"from politics to policy.\" \nThe report comes as Clinton, a Democratic candidate for president, is set to testify before the panel Thursday at a widely anticipated public hearing that could make or break the credibility of the 17-month-old inquiry. \n--- \nRegistering drones: Worries about close calls prompt federal action on unmanned aircraft \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Concerned about rising reports of close calls and safety risks involving drones, the government announced Monday it will require many of the increasingly popular unmanned aircraft to be registered. \nPilot sightings of drones have doubled since last year, including near manned airplanes and at major sporting events, and there are reports of interference with wildfire-fighting operations, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said at a news conference. \n\"These reports signal a troubling trend,\" said Federal Aviation Administration chief Michel Huerta. Registration will increase pressure on drone operators to fly responsibly, he said, adding, \"When they don't fly safely, they'll know there will be consequences.\" \nThe FAA now receives about 100 reports a month from pilots who say they've seen drones flying near planes and airports, compared with only a few sightings per month last year. So far there have been no accidents, but agency officials have said they're concerned that a drone weighing only a few pounds might cause serious damage if it is sucked into an engine or smashes into an airliner's windshield. \nToys and small drones that don't present a safety threat are likely to be exempt from the requirement. Drones that weigh only a pound or two or that can't fly higher than a few hundred feet are considered less risky, but heavier ones and those that can fly thousands of feet pose more of a problem. \n--- \nEx-NBA star Lamar Odom alert and improving, but unclear when he may leave hospital, aunt says \nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Lamar Odom is alert and his condition is improving after the former NBA star was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel a week ago, his family said Monday. \nAlvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer, said the former reality-TV personality is undergoing testing, but there is no word yet on when he might be released from the hospital. Odom is overcoming \"insurmountable obstacles\" and defying the odds, Mercer said in a statement. \n\"Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery,\" the statement said. \nOdom was found in extremely critical condition at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada, on Oct. 13 and was hospitalized in Las Vegas. He regained consciousness and communicated for the first time Friday. \nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra.
