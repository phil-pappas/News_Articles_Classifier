GAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company provided no new information the proposed spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - a key issue for shareholders.\nYahoo earlier this year sought a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to confirm whether the transaction, worth about $27 billion currently, would result in a tax obligation. The tax agency denied the request, but Yahoo has said it will go ahead anyway with the spinoff by year-end.\nMany analysts attribute little value to Yahoo's core business without its Asian assets, which also includes a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp.
