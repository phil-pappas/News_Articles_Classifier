The move unites two premier education companies within Holtzbrinck Publishing Group (HPG)—Macmillan Higher Education, which include the renowned publishing imprints of Bedford/St. Martin’s, W.H. Freeman, and Worth Publishers; and Macmillan New Ventures, which houses several start-up companies including Hayden-McNeil, Sapling Learning, Late Nite Labs, PrepU, and Dynamic Books. “This is such an exciting time in the education space,” said CEO Ken Michaels. “The need for customizable and personalized learning solutions has never been greater. By uniting the formidable legacy of our content and technologies with pioneering digital tools, we will deliver unparalleled options to our customers. Our continued deep partnership with educators will continue to drive our creation of the right content, tools, and services to drive course success.” “At Macmillan Learning, our mandate is to develop effective and aligned content and resources that address specific teaching challenges,” said Managing Director Susan Winslow. “Too often, technology that resonates outside of the classroom doesn’t address learning challenges within the classroom, or the holistic learning experience. It is vital that content and technology are created together with learning challenges in mind.” Macmillan Learning is the home to some of the most authoritative, well-respected content in higher education; from Diana Hacker’s \"A Writer’s Reference,\" which remains the best-selling textbook for all college students, to David G. Myers’ “Psychology,\" to Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman’s \"Economics.\" Macmillan Learning will continue to foster an innovative environment by nurturing start-up tech companies that quickly and efficiently solve pain points in the classroom. For example, Sapling Learning provides interactive learning assessment that significantly improves student comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. This combination of authorship and innovation will drive the new solutions to come from Macmillan Learning. “As a learning services industry, we can’t expect educators to work with a one-size-fits-all boxed solution,” noted Sapling Learning President James Caras. “Our solutions need to be modular, tailored to the learning needs and course goals of each instructor and student.” ### ABOUT Macmillan Learning Macmillan Learning improves lives through learning.
