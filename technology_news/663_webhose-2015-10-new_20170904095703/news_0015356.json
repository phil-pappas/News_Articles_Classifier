Square is competing against several large mobile payment platforms, including Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) 's and Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) 's. \nDorsey was only named permanent Twitter CEO earlier this month after a long, speculative search and vetting process. Many questioned -- and still question -- his ability to lead two companies that need a lot of attention. \nA week after he took over, Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) let go of more than 300 employees to help the company become \"more focused.\" \nThe very next day, Square filed paperwork for an IPO . \n\"We intend to make this big!\" Dorsey wrote in a note on the SEC's S-1 form for Square. \nHe had the same level of enthusiasm and expectation regarding Thursday's news. \n\"I'm confident we can make Twitter big!\" Dorsey tweeted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:01:12.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
