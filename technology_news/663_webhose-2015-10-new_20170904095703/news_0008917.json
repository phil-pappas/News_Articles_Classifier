Pilot sightings of drones have doubled since last year, including sightings near manned aircraft and major sporting events, and interference with wildfire-fighting operations, the government said.\n\"These reports signal a troubling trend,\" Federal Aviation Administration chief Michel Huerta said at a news conference to announce the step. Registration will increase pressure on drone operators to fly responsibly, he said.\nThe FAA now receives about 100 reports a month from pilots who say they've seen drones flying near planes and airports, compared with only a few sightings a month last year.\nIn July, a drone came dangerously close to a passenger jet with 159 people aboard as it prepared to land at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, NBC News reported.\nTask force assembled\nTo work out details, the FAA and the Transportation Department are setting up a 25- to 30-member task force including government and industry officials and hobbyists.\nThey'll recommend which drones should be required to register and which should be exempted, and design a system that would be easy for commercial operators to comply with, the department said.\nToys and small drones that don't present a safety threat are likely to be exempt. Drones that weigh less than a kilogram or that can't fly higher than a few dozen meters are considered less risky. Heavier ones and those that can fly much higher pose more of a problem.\nThe FAA is scrambling to get registration rules in place before Christmas.\nThere is no official count of how many drones have been sold in the United States, but industry officials say it is in the hundreds of thousands and will easily pass a million by the end of the year.\nThe Consumer Electronics Association has forecast that 700,000 drones will be sold this holiday season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:12:13.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
