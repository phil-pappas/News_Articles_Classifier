It was also gathered that the vehicle lost control but information revealed that the former President was said to have alighted safely from the vehicle and joined another one in his convoy. Although it was not confirmed whether Obasanjo was injured or not, it was however confirmed that he was said to have headed straight to Adebutu’s 80th birthday church service before jetting out of the country. \nFRSC’s Head of Media Relations and Strategy, Bisi-Kazeem, however said Obasanjo was never involved in any crash as being reported. He said the former president’s vehicle had a blown up tyre, he moved into his back-up vehicle to continue his journey, while the tyre was eventually changed and left the scene around Sagamu interchange on Lagos-Ibadan expressway. \nSource: Thisday Newspaper", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:32:51.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
