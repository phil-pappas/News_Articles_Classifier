Thanks to its electric motor, it was pinned as the future of motoring, but nothing about it screamed excitement in a driver’s eyes.\nThings changed in 2012 when a plucky South African billionaire Elon Musk and his start-up electric car company Tesla changed everything. No longer was the electric car just a dull commuter car — it looked great, and more importantly, was brilliant to drive. The original Model S was capable of driving from 0-100km/h in 4.2-seconds with an electric range of 426km.\nIt was a revelation that has since turned the automotive industry on its head, with nearly all of the world’s traditional big automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche all vying to build a true competitor.\nThrough genuine innovation, Tesla had created the ‘Apple effect’ in the automotive world, or the constant standard in which other cars that aim to innovate are compared against. Ever since the iPhone came along, headlines such as, “Is this the iPhone killer?”, or “Is the new Samsung good enough to go against the iPhone?” popped up daily, and Tesla has begun a phenomena much the same.\nYou just need to look at this year’s Frankfurt motor show to see this in full swing. Take Porsche’s Mission E concept or Audi’s e-tron quattro concept, both of which, when announced were given some form of headline around them being a “Tesla killer”.\nBut it’s just not those headlines that are the same, you simply need to look at the innovation the brand has popped into the market.\nThe world’s fastest family car. Source: Supplied\nSure, there would be electric cars if Tesla never existed. But would any of them be as advanced, as fast or even just as down right cool as the Model S is? I doubt it. Since the Model S has come along, car makers across the world have all doubled their efforts to introduce some form of electric vehicle that’s both great for the environment, but also fun to drive.\nIt’s the same as the iPhone. Regardless of how advanced you feel it is now, the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 forced other traditional phone makers to innovate too, allowing us to be where we are today.\nNow Tesla has just launched its latest car in Australia, the Model S P85D and it is truly a gamechanger that fully encompasses the Apple effect.\nOn the outside nothing has changed compared to your standard Model S. It still has that sleek love it or hate it fast back design, the same optional carbon-fibre spoiler and the same choice of wheel designs.\nThe car actually has an ‘insane’ mode. Source: Supplied\nOn the inside it’s the same too. It has the same 17-inch screen in the centre-console which controls everything from suspension levels and steering weight to your climate control, navigation and media. In front of you, the dashboard is still the same digital screen that can show your speed, electric range and navigation direction.\nIt’s a tech geeks heaven, but at the same time it lacks the refinement that a $200k car should have. Just the week before I was driving Audi’s S7, one of the Model S’ closest competitors, and its interior completely blows it out of the water.\nThe column gear shifter feels stupidly cheap, as do a lot of the materials used around the rest of the car, especially compared to the Audi. The interior is bare, although not in a good way like inside a BMW i3 which feels spacious and futuristic.\nNice, but $200k nice? Source: Supplied\nBut for Tesla, that’s okay, it’s only a new company, and it doesn’t take much more than poaching a few interior designers from Germany to improve it for its next car.\nRight now, if you’re buying a Tesla, it’s going to be for the electric drivetrain, and that is spectacular.\nThe Model S P85D features an AWD system, with dual-electric motors that can accelerate from 0-100km/h in an insane 3.2 seconds. Do you know what other cars accelerate in that time? Crappy little things such as a Ferrari 458 or Lamborghini Huracan.\nAcceleration is brutal, it throws you back in your seat with more ferocity than even the mighty Nissan GT-R. It also does it from the second you put your foot down thanks to the nature of the electric motors which are able to provide all your power and torque instantly. All without leaving any emissions (are you listening, Volkswagen?) or creating any noise while driving close to 500kms on one charge.\nAnd because the car’s batteries are all placed just below the floor, it means that most of its weight is as low as possible, giving the car an excellent centre of gravity, which means it handles great too.\nAll without using a drop of petrol. Source: AP\nWhen you remember that the P85D is then capable of carrying five, or even seven people in some markets, you begin to appreciate the technological marvel that this car is.\nPriced at around $200k depending on what state you live in, the Model S P85D certainly isn’t cheap, especially when you consider that you’ll then likely spend another few grand getting a high-powered charger installed in your garage.\nAnd while travelling long distances still isn’t as easy as in a traditional petrol car, more Superchargers that can charge your car in less than an hour are popping up everywhere on the Australian East Coast, removing that dreaded range anxiety.\nBut if you want the pinnacle of motoring technology, if you want to embrace with both hands the future of fast cars then the Model S is a no-brainer.\nCutting Edge Cars 23:36 What will the cars of the future look like and what are the next great leaps forward?\nMarch 23rd 2015 7 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/TV/Documentary/", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0db929701155e168592f75089f8d2ee", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F05%2F06%2F2015%2F35940%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D7&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/451553af9037e9b9421b696d783aae8d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3e070374189eec83b7d00539b0ec80fc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6cdacd0ab538bda8307b170972e98b0f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4a920611787f318fdd5dd4dfa2d753ad", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-29T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:29:08.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
