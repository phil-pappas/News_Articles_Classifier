Kim Fejfer, CEO of APMT, said: “We are very proud of what we have been able to accomplish as a team effort of more than 20,000 people and grateful for this recognition by the judges.” \nThe transition of the global container fleet to an increasing dependency on vessels of 10,000 TEU capacity and above has introduced challenges to the port and terminal operating industry.\nThese are reflected in both demand for greater terminal productivity and the need for increased accident risk awareness with larger volumes of container movements required for each vessel call.\nThe Journal of Commerce study cited 13 facilities within the APMT global terminal network as among the world’s productivity leaders for the first half of 2014, as measured by crane moves per hour (MPH) with a vessel alongside, with APMT Yokohama being the world’s productivity leader at 180 MPH.\nIn addition to holding the top spot globally (and concurrently in Asia), APM Terminals Rotterdam ranked first in productivity among European Terminals, with 102 MPH. \nAPMT also continued to invest in emerging markets underserved by modern infrastructure, where industry-leading standards of safety and productivity have an even greater impact. In May 2014, APMT signed a 20 year concession to operate, maintain and develop the Port of Namibe, Angola. \nIn June 2015, the company signed an agreement with the Government of Ghana, for a $1.5 billion expansion of Tema Port, including the construction of new port access roads. \nMr. Fejfer concluded: “Leadership in innovation, safety, productivity and new investment, however, are not new goals or results for APMT.”\nFor all the latest on APM Terminals, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:22:02.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
