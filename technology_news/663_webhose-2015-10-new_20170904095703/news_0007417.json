But I never thought I’d end up building a horserace betting system for Rupert Murdoch and I had no idea I would become passionate about improving the way companies train and grow their employees.”\nThe raise was led by Baillieu Holst and attracted retail and institutional investors including Sanlam Private Wealth, Alignment Capital, Shaw and Partners, as well as Mr Gandel.\nMr Francis said he wanted the firm to get outside of Western Australia.\n“We’re not just a Western Australian company, we’ve got global potential,” he told The Australian. “With this raise we wanted to prove we’re a national company and drum up a national shareholding base.”\nThe start-up is set to list on the ASX around mid-October through a reverse takeover with International Coal, and as previously reported in The Australian former Xero executive and cloud computing expert Leanne Graham will join the board on completion of the takeover.\nMr Francis said the Velpic platform reduces the time to train employees by up to 75 per cent and increases comprehension by up to 50 per cent, compared with pure text.\nThe start-up generates revenues through monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) fees, along with Pay Per View (PPV) fees for each lesson completed. Over the past 12 months Velpic has achieved revenues of approximately $2m, momentum that Mr Francis says he expects will continue over the next financial year. Revenues are currently growing 30 per cent month-on-month.\nVelpic also recently won an award from Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, who met Mr Francis to present him with the ‘Most Disruptive CIO/CTO’ prize at the Talent Unleashed awards.\nOther judges included Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Seek CEO Andrew Bassat.\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/australian-elearning-start-up-velpic-raises-4m/story-e6frgakx-1227557194192"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:47:49.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
