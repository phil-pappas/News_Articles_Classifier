Go90 is packed with content, a variety of about 8,000 titles, including episodes from popular TV shows and 35 exclusive original series and, to come, live college football and basketball games.\nUSA TODAY\nVerizon starts '5G' field tests in 2016\nVerizon's goal with the go90 service is to cater to young adults and teens who increasingly devour video on smartphones and tablets. “Brilliant coders and engineers and awesome content partners have invested an incredible amount of work and have taken care to create a video experience that until now has been missing for millennial and Gen Z viewers,” Brian Angiolet, Verizon's go90 architect, said in a statement. \"go90 bridges the content divide between traditional and digital distributors, along with established and emerging creators.”\nA quick look through the service found fresh episodes of The Daily Show with Trevor Noah and The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore from Wednesday night's broadcasts on Comedy Central, U.S. and international news from HuffPost Live, video game and gadget coverage from Nerdist News and a nearly two-hour concert from Mumford and Sons.\nA screen shot from Verizon's new go90 mobile video service.

Other content comes from Vice, Machinima, Maker, ESPN’s 30 for 30 , MTV, Michelle Phan (Endemol), Sarah Silverman (Jash comedy network), DreamWorksTV’s Shrek and Donkey and AOL's original series Making A Scene, starring James Franco.\nBETCH the show premieres tomorrow on the new @go90 app!

At the time , Verizon executive vice president and president of product innovation Marni Walden said that AOL's advertising technology was \"an exceptional fit\" for the mobile video network.\nIn addition to simply watching video, users can create clips to share via text and email, as well as on Facebook and Twitter.\nA screen shot from Verizon's new go90 mobile video service.
