The figure reflects how much revenue that Yahoo keeps after paying its advertising partners — a bill that has been climbing since the company struck a deal late last year to serve as the built-in search engine in the U.S. on the Firefox browser.\nIt marked the ninth time in the past 11 quarters that Yahoo's net revenue has declined or remained unchanged from the previous year. Meanwhile, revenue at Yahoo rivals Google, Facebook and Twitter has been steadily surging as advertiser spend more of their marketing budgets on the Internet. Analysts are projecting third-quarter revenue increases ranging from 14 percent to 55 percent at Google, Facebook and Twitter when those companies report their results during the next two weeks.\nYahoo's earnings also plunged 99 percent to $76 million, or 8 cents per share, during the three months ended in September. The steep decline reflected huge windfall that Yahoo pocketed from selling some of its stock in the Chinese company's initial public offering. If not for expenses covering employee stock options and other options, Yahoo said it would have earned 15 cents per share to match the estimates of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research .\nYahoo's stock dipped 38 cents to $32.45 in extended trading after the numbers came out.\nInvestors are now focused on the fate of Yahoo's plan to place its remaining Alibaba holdings — 384 million shares currently worth about $28 billion — into a new company called Aabaco Holdings .\nYahoo is doing the spin-off as part of a plan to prevent the remaining profits from its $1 billion investment in Alibaba from being taxed in the U.S., but it's now unclear whether that will pan out. The Internal Revenue Service raised doubts by declining to declare the spin-off will protect the Alibaba stake from being taxed.\nDespite that setback, Yahoo Inc. is still planning to complete the spin-off by next year with the expectation that it will qualify as a tax-free maneuver.\n\"Our top priority is the planned spinoff of Aabaco Holdings,\" Mayer said. \"This is an important moment for the company, and we continue to strive to complete the spin as quickly as we can.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/62/8821928/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/51/62/8821928/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:54:33.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
