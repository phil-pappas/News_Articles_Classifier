( Mark Carter ) \nLittle Rock Tech Park Director Brent Birch told his board Wednesday that things are busy at the park's downtown temporary space. \nThe park is working to acquire property along Main Street for Phase 1 of the $100 million project, and in January moved its command central into 8,000-SF of leased space at 107 East Markham . \nIt shares the space with the Venture Center, the entrepreneurial resource provider that advises the park's tenants, who pay a nominal monthly fee for a desk and co-working space. \nBirch said the space has 15 tenants, down from a high of 18 in July. Eleven of those 18 early-stage startups outgrew the space and moved on to more permanent offices. \n\"That says a lot to what we're doing,\" he said. \"People are interested in this space. It's a pretty good testament to what's going on here.\" \nThree of the more high-profile startups to occupy tech park space, each of whom moved into permanent offices downtown, were recognized this week as part of the Venture Center's Catalyst Speed Mixer for October: Apptegy, now up to 13 full-time employees , Bfonics and Elyxor. \nBirch told the Little Rock Rotary Club last month that once the tech park has moved into its permanent space on Main, the idea is for startups to percolate there, move up to below-market space provided by the park, and eventually graduate into permanent, dedicated space in the park. \nHe said the three startups recognized this week would've stayed in the park had permanent space been ready, and have signed one-year leases in their current spots with plans to come back once the new space opens. \nApptegy has created a school communications platform; Bfonics has developed a digital marketing platform; and Elyxor provides software engineering services. Apptegy was founded in Little Rock but Bfonics, founded in India, and Boston-based Elyxor had various ties to the city and decided to locate to Little Rock after experiencing the low cost of living and emerging tech scene. \nTownsend said Elyxor had been looking across the country for a location to place its development center. Its founders — Mark Carleo, Pete Buletza and Andy Cowles — attended last year's Little Rock Tech Fest and, according to Townsend, fell in love with the city and decided to open the center here. \nTownsend, who came to Little Rock from the U.K. to work for Acxiom and previously worked for Rockfish Interactive, said the tech startup scene in Little Rock is drawing people to the city. \n\"In my 10 years in Little Rock, this is the most exciting time for tech, even in the last two years really,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:14:53.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
