Investors are understandably jittery given the potential flow-on effect from market volatility and a slowdown in emerging markets, but for now the reduced chance of a 2015 rate hike has stocks trending higher.\nAt the close of trade on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7 per cent, while the S&P 500 lifted 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.9 per cent.\nOn this occasion it was both energy and healthcare stocks driving the markets forward, after the two went in opposite directions in the prior session.\nThe healthcare sector rebounded 1.5 per cent, while energy stocks added 1.3 per cent despite weakness on oil markets.\nUS Nymex crude slipped 1.5 per cent to $US47.81, while global benchmark Brent crude gave back 1.1 per cent to $US51.33 as US oil stockpiles rose more than the market had expected.\nAcross the Atlantic, Germany’s DAX 30 advanced 0.7 per cent and France’s CAC 40 tacked on 0.1 per cent.\nSoft German data again proved no hurdle to a positive session as investors shrugged off news of a 1.2 per cent decline in industrial production in August. Analysts had been expecting a more marginal 0.1 per cent dip.\nThe news serves as music to the ears of traders eyeing an expanded QE program from the ECB.\nOutside the eurozone, the UK’s resources-heavy FTSE 100 edged up 0.2 per cent, with miners leading the way.\nThe UK-listed shares of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto soared 4.6 and 7.5 per cent, respectively, as commodity prices continued to rebound.\nIn other market action:\n-- The Australian dollar jumped clear of US72c as commodity prices largely gained ground. At 7am (AEDT), the local unit is trading at US72.13c, up from US71.85c on Wednesday.\n-- Iron ore climbed 0.7 per cent to $US54.40 a tonne. The positive session was just its second through the past 11 sessions.\n-- Copper crept up less than 0.1 per cent, while other base metals expanded between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent in London trade.\n-- Gold gained a further 0.2 per cent to $US1,148.70 an ounce, extending a strong rally that has been driven by weakened US rate hike expectations.\n-- ASX futures are pointing up 30 points, or 0.6 per cent, as of 6.45am (AEDT).\nAhead: The local session is devoid of market-moving data, with the focus to centre on tonight’s release of minutes from the latest Fed policy meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:54:08.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
