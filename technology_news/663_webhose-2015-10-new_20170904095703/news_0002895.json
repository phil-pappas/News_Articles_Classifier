Our devices have made us so hyper-productive, we deserve to relax with them too. But if you’re willing to waste your digital time in different ways, The List ’s Jimmy Rhoades says you can earn a little cabbage, on What’s The Deal . \nSwagbucks \nSwagbucks collects a bunch of different ways to make money at a single online location: Shop from their site, search from their site, take surveys, watch videos and play games and print coupons. \nThese activities earn you Swagbucks, which you then convert to a reward. To date, the site has paid out over one hundred million dollars, and counting. Gaption \nMalaysian-based Gaption is brand new – and talk about ambitious: The app’s designers hope you’ll do what you’re already doing on Facebook, but on their platform instead. Gaption isn’t luring you with the old-fashioned way – stalking peoples personal lives – but with money! \nAs Gaption founder Ken Ho said, “We were thinking, ‘Hey, is there a way we can kind of convert time people spend social networking into income?’” Algorithms in the app assess the relationship between your posts and ad clicks then give you a cut! If you post a purchase and a friend clicks from your thread to buy it, you can get a commission of up to five percent! So if you’re a social influencer, this might be a way to monetize what you’re already doing for free on other platforms. Pact \nPact makes your screen time productive by getting you off the screen – and off the couch! With the Pact app you will make or lose money, depending on whether or not you stick to your personal fitness goals. \nYou prove that you’re keeping your healthy promises with photos, journaling, and GPS tracking. It’s both the stick of losing money and the carrot of cold, hard cash. Some general caveats for all of these services: Make sure you’re cool with how often, and how the app pays: PayPal, gift cards, or even old-fashioned checks by snail mail, it runs the gamut. Check for weekly or monthly minimums you have to earn before the service pays out, and make sure earnings roll over. We all know that the internet is filled with get-rich-quick scams. The devil is always in the details, so actually read the terms of service. You’re not going to make a living off any of these services, but it might buy you another round next time you’re out – and when’s the last time an Angry Bird bought you a beer?
