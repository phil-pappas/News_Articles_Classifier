The first two involve the installation of malware through malicious applications or software that users download, while the third refers to the injection of malicious code directly into existing code on a device through a website.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ Out of 32 known vulnerabilities, the authors selected 11 particularly virulent exploits to conduct their analysis, and found \"on average 87.7% of Android devices\" were vulnerable. \"Using a corpus of 20,400 devices we show that there is significant variability in the timely delivery of security updates across different device manufacturers and network operators,\" the researchers wrote.\nMore from the Washington Examiner L.A. Times to Obama on Afghanistan: It's not your fault The headline suggested both that Obama is a failure, and that it's the fault of George W. Bush.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/16/15 5:00 PM However, they noted, \"This does not mean these devices are attacked, but that they are vulnerable. The likelihood of a successful attack then depends on what apps the user installs and where from, as well as the computer networks the device is connected to and the actions the user takes whilst connected.\"\nThey also observed that Apple iOS devices don't have the same vulnerabilities.\n\"As well as supplying security updates promptly, the impact of vulnerabilities can be reduced through security in depth,\" the authors wrote. \"In this regard, iOS provides additional safeguards beyond those used in Android, including a pre-distribution review, mandatory code-signing by the manufacturer, and … the technical prohibition of dynamic code loading by an app.\" In other words, Apple does substantially more to prevent applications from being able to download strange code.\n\"These features, combined with mandatory access controls, has resulted in a lower level of malware affecting iOS when compared to Android,\" they concluded.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2573651 This month, cybersecurity firm FireEye reported the discovery of Chinese malware that had spread to Android devices in more than 20 countries through malicious applications. It is unusual for Apple devices to experience similar attacks unless they have been \"jailbroken\" by users.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Coburn blames 'Cruz effect' for disappointment in Congress The former senator criticized Cruz's failure to fulfill his promises, such as getting rid of Obamacare.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/16/15 7:59 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:57:26.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
