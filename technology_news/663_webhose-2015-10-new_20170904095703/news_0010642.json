An individual based in Delhi registered the ara-apple.com domain name through GoDaddy in an effort to mirror Apple's legitimate support site, ara.apple.com , according to security blog MalwareBytes . Scammers typically try to trick users into landing on such falsified support sites by targeting them with false warnings and pop ups warning of something wrong with their computer. Some encourage the victim to call a given number for 'tech support' or similar, which Apple, Microsoft and others would never do. Clicking on links within this kind of warning directs the victim to download remote access software tools LogMeIn or TeamViewer, after which they can gain control of their machine. Apple's legitimate remote support page Apple's site has been designed to help technical support staff gain access to a customer's desktop in order to troubleshoot any issues they may be having, such as changing settings or deleting unnecessary files. While ara-apple.com is not identical to Apple's support page, at first glance it could be mistaken for it, deploying similar fonts and colour schemes. The false site contains links to four downloadable files, alongside an official-looking card payment tab for users to input billing information, customer ID and credit card details. This page lacks a padlock icon in front of its url, designed to indicate the presence of a secure connection via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The fake payment page: note lack of SSL padlock The Telegraph has contacted the email address associated with the fake domain. Similarly, fraudulent sites impersonating Apple's iTunes page s and banks including Natwest and Halifax have been wrongly issued with the authentication certificates, which can instill users with false confidence when inputting their details. GoDaddy was also among the sites used to register the fake domains, alongside CloudFlare and Symantec. Financial Fraud Action UK’s top tips for staying safe online Be on the lookout for unexpected invoices or unusual payment requests. Avoid enabling any macros on an untrusted document. If you’re suspicious – don’t reply to the email but instead call your supplier on the number that you have on file to check the authenticity of the invoice. Ensure you have the latest anti-virus and security updates installed on your computer and consider using high-level macro security settings in software applications. Ensure strong firewalls are in place to help detect malware and prevent data leaving the network without permission. Consider using a separate computer dedicated to making online payments to minimise security risks.
