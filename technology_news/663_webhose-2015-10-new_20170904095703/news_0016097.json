DXL enables the TrapX DeceptionGrid to integrate directly with the McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE). DeceptionGrid can now provide actionable intelligence and initiate activity throughout the line of Intel Security products and other Intel Security Innovation Alliance partner's products on TIE. This allows direct remediation actions to be taken, such as shutting down an attack in-flight and quarantining compromised assets in real-time. This enhances customers' ability to identify and defeat many advanced threats such as the APT, zero-day events and other sophisticated malware attacks. \nDeceptionGrid automates the deployment of a network of camouflaged malware traps that are intermingled with real information technology resources. These traps appear identical in every way to real IT assets. Once sophisticated malware has slipped past other primary cyber defenses and penetrated the enterprise, it continues to move laterally to find high-value targets. Just one touch of DeceptionGrid sets off a high-confidence alert. Through the use of the DXL fabric, this alert can drive actions to mitigate the attack rapidly and resume normal operations. \n\"Dynamic Deception Operations (DDO) gives our customers the strongest set of options available to find and defeat attackers that have already breached the perimeter. We've automated everything and integrated DDO tightly with Intel® Security's threat intelligence sharing ecosystem,\" said Carl Wright, executive vice president and general manager at TrapX Security. \"Now we can move with speed and in concert with other Intel Security partner capabilities and products to shut the attack down before the attacker can achieve their objectives or spread.\" \n\"By implementing products that are integrated with Intel Security solutions, we believe our customers will experience faster deployment times, and with faster deployment times come reduced costs,\" said D.J. Long, senior director, head of the Security Innovation Alliance at Intel Security. \"TrapX's integration with TIE over the DXL platform provides customers with actionable intelligence to manage their multi-vendor security environments.\" \nTrapX will also be demonstrating DeceptionGrid at this year's RSA conference taking place in San Francisco February 29 through March 4, 2016. \nTrapX is a member of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance: http://www.mcafee.com/us/partners/security-innovation-alliance/index.aspx . The Intel Security Innovation Alliance is a technology partner program that facilities interoperability and streamlines the integration of security products in complex customer environments. By working together, Intel Security and its partners aim to deliver more complete security solutions designed to safeguard systems more effectively than solutions available from any single vendor. \nTrademark Notice \nTrapX Security and DeceptionGrid are trademarks licensed by TrapX Security, Inc. \nVisit the TrapX Website: www.trapx.com Watch a 60 Second Introduction to Deception Technology: http://trapx.com/whitehat-versus-blackhat/ Learn more about DeceptionGrid: http://trapx.com/products/deceptiongrid/ Visit the TrapX blog: http://www.trapx.com/blog/ Follow TrapX on Twitter: @trapxsecurity Follow TrapX on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/trapx Like TrapX on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/TrapX/258804147648401 \nAbout TrapX TrapX Security is a leader in the delivery of advanced threat cyber security defense.
