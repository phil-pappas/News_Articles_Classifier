Revenue was EUR1.55 billion in the quarter, compared with EUR1.65 billion in the prior period.\nThe results were broadly in line with company guidance and analysts' estimates.\nASML, whose customers include large chip makers such as Intel Corp. (INTC) and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), said it expects fourth-quarter sales to fall to around EUR1.4 billion, in part because its foundry customers have become slightly more cautious in their investment plans. The company, however, said it remains on track to achieve record sales in 2015.\n-Write to Maarten van Tartwijk at maartenvan.tartwijk@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 01:38 ET (05:38 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:39:40.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
