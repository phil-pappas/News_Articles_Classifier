OmniVision logo OmniVision logo <-  <- stripped tags -> SANTA CLARA, Calif. , Oct.   OmniVision Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: [[UEdFZ2NtVnNQVndpYm05bWIyeHNiM2RjSWlCb2NtVm1QU2RvZEhSd09pOHZjM1IxWkdsdkxUVXVabWx1WVc1amFXRnNZMjl1ZEdWdWRDNWpiMjB2Y0hKdVpYZHpQMUJoWjJVOVVYVnZkR1VtVkdsamEyVnlQVTlXVkVrbklISmxiRDBuYm05bWIyeHNiM2NuSUhSaGNtZGxkRDBuWDJKc1lXNXJKeUIwYVhSc1pUMG5UMVpVU1NjZ2IyNWpiR2xqYXowbmJHbHVhMDl1UTJ4cFkyc29kR2hwY3lrbklISmxiRDBuYm05bWIyeHNiM2NuUGs5V1ZFazhMMkUrfA==]]), a leading developer of advanced digital imaging solutions, today announced the OV788, an ultra-low power video compression chip with integrated synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM). Ideally suited for smart-home and security applications, the compact OV788 system-in-package with SDRAM (OV0788-U44G) provides small to midsize original equipment manufacturers with an easy-to-integrate and compact video processing solution that significantly reduces lead times and time to market. The OV788 system-in-package is compatible with a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as battery operated intrusion cameras, door locks, video doorbells and 360-degree multi-cameras in smart homes. \"On a global basis, industry analysts expect 12 percent of homes to have at least one smart-home system by 2019. Furthermore, the U.S. market is forecasted to have the highest growth rate for smart homes [1]. This equates to an estimated 224 million potential smart-home systems,\" said David Ho , senior product manager at OmniVision. \"Sensors and video processor ASICs are vital components in visual sensing and visual data processing functions, which are essential for smart-home systems. They allow consumers to truly benefit from IoT imaging applications. The OV788's built-in memory, ease of integration, compact size, low power and fast boot-up are critical features for battery-operated smart-home appliances, and can help bolster further development of smart home IoT technologies.\" The OV788 is a H.264 video processor ASIC that supports video-encoding and decoding up to 720p (1280x720) high definition (HD) at 30 frames per second (FPS), and enables still capture output of full-resolution 8-megapixel JPEG images. Additionally, the OV788 offers ultra-low power consumption and fast boot-up. The OV0788-U44G with integrated SDRAM can fit into a compact 9 x 9 mm BGA package, and thus compares favorably to the OV788 with external memory (which fits into an 11 x 11 mm BGA package). The product is currently available for sampling, and is expected to enter volume production in the fourth quarter of 2015.
