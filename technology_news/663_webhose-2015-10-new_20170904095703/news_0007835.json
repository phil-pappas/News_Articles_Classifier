Only in the Windows Store does it drop, down to third position, with its parent company Facebook enjoying number one position. Facebook is second in free iOS downloads and third in Android. \nFacebook \nFacebook properties dominate the next two positions on iOS as well, with Facebook Messenger and Instagram rounding out the top four. The Google Play store has the same top four, in a slightly different order, with Facebook Messenger at two and Instagram also in fourth place. \nWindows Phone \nWindows Phone has a slightly different mix, thanks to marketing emphasis by Microsoft, which has its own Podcast app in second, its cloud storage app OneDrive in fourth place, and the Microsoft-owned Skype in fifth. However, Facebook messenger lies sixth, giving Facebook three of the top six spots for free Windows Store downloads. \n“It can be argued that Facebook currently owns mobile – but not necessarily its revenue,” says Arthur Goldstuck, MD of World Wide Worx. “Games completely dominate the top ten lists for highest grossing apps on iOS and Android, filling the entire top ten on each, as well as the top eight in the Windows Store.” \nFuseware MD Mike Wronski points out that smartphones have not been entirely taken over by entertainment impulses: “The occasional utility app does intrude in the list of most downloaded paid apps. The serious professional and business users of smartphones still want to combine their social and work lives on their handsets.” \nThe report shows that Facebook has grown by 8 percent in the past year, from 12 million to 13 million, and Twitter by 12 percent, from 6,6 million to 7,4 million users. Video sharing platform YouTube increased its user base marginally more, with a 15 percent rise from 7,2 million to 8,28 million users. The biggest growth has come from photo sharing network Instagram, which rose 133 percent, from 1,1 million to 2,68 million. \nThe study is based on access to consumer data from seven major social networks, three app stores, and a corporate survey conducted among more than a hundred of South Africa’s leading brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:59:29.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
