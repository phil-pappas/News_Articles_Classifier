October 20, 2015 \nNORWOOD, Mass. —Environmental Health Services (EHS) is raising funds to support Mark Maynard, a friend of the company who was stricken with West Nile virus. Maynard, a longtime vendor of EHS (providing printing services), became the first person in Massachusetts to contract West Nile virus this year from a mosquito bite. He been confined to a wheelchair and unable to lift his arms, the result of this neuroinvasive affliction. Mark Negron, director of marketing & sustainability for EHS has taken Maynard’s cause to heart. Negron brought the story to the attention of EHS Owner John Stellberger. EHS then put together a $1,000 matching donations drive . Negron added a post to EHS’ Facebook page (blogged and Tweeted too) and so far they’ve raised more $500 to match. Now EHS is reaching out to industry professionals and others with the following message: In August, our friend and co-worker Mark Maynard was the first person in Massachusetts this year to contract the West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. This neuroinvasive affliction has kept him in hospitals and physical rehab ever since. Mark, a skilled tradesman, has been an offset printer with the same company for 22 years. Mark is also a very talented photographer… but he can’t even lift his arms anymore. Mark’s recovery is uncertain… he has lost the use of his legs and is confined to a wheelchair, All from a mosquito bite! It could happen to anyone. He especially needs financial help now with employment benefits drying up and medical and rehab bills soon piling up. We are not sure if he will ever return to work. Mark is a hard-working American tradesman who has worked his ass off for the last 22 years, only to be brought down by a mosquito bite. We want to help any way we can and hope others might be inspired to assist as well… all funds will go directly to Mark and his beautiful wife Alex. We are praying he overcomes this virus but recovery will be lengthy and difficult. Everybody says, “let us know if we can do anything…” Here’s your chance! Thanks for helping out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:32:48.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
