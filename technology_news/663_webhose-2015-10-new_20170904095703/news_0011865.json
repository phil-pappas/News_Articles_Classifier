Our definition of success truly depends on our individual goals. For example your goal might be monetary a physical accomplishment or a moral achievement. To flesh out this topic we are adding a few comments made by famous and successful people in diverse fields - similar and familiar concepts to those put forward by the Premier Experts® in this book. \nSuccess is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while trying to succeed. Booker T. Washington \nYou can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. Napoleon Hill \nThe difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather a lack in will. Vince Lombardi \nNothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude. Thomas Jefferson \nIn our New Economy the acquisition of success has been reformatted somewhat by business and industry even though its principles remain the same. The Electronic Revolution has changed the economic landscape as much as the Industrial Revolution. We now live more and more in \"real time\" and expect others to do the same. This era of instant communication has changed the ways in which we communicate and expect responses. \nTo succeed today it is useful perhaps essential to have a mentor. Errors will be made but to minimize them will speed up your journey. The Premier Experts® in this book will help you along the way. They have been there and know the road. Who would be better to guide you? They will illuminate your path to The Soul Of Success... \nAfter such a successful release Janet Fouts will be recognized by an organization that honors authors from many of the leading independent best-seller lists.\nClick to order a copy of The Soul of Success \nA portion of the royalties earned from The Soul of Success will be given to Entrepreneur’s International Foundation a not for profit organization dedicated to creating unique launch campaigns to raise money and awareness for charitable causes.\nMore About Janet Fouts: \nJanet is CEO of Tatu Digital Media a social media-marketing agency in Silicon Valley serving brands from social good organizations like Human Journey co-founded by Archbishop Desmond Tutu t tech startups and Fortune 50 corporations.\nJanet is respected as a corporate trainer on all things social media.
