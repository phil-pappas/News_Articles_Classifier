But hoiw long will they take to set up? Jefferson Graham relays his tale of a 7-hour setup for a CableCARD with Verizon FIOS.\nCable Card menu on TiVo Bolt (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n7 CONNECT 21 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES - Most of us spend hundreds of dollars to rent our cable set-top boxes from the likes of Comcast, Time Warner and Verizon.\nWhat if we could bypass the rental fee, buy our own box and save lots of money?\nA little used option, the \"CableCARD,\" offers just that, and I leapt at the chance of trying it this weekend.\nAs you might expect, getting it to work sounds simple, but at least for me, there was a 7 hour installation process that took many phone calls, tweets, direct messages and two visits from a Verizon installer to finish up.\nI got excited about the new TiVo Bolt DVR, because it can record TV shows, pick up streaming apps like Netflix and YouTube--and most importantly--replace your cable box. With the TiVo, you won’t have to pay those huge yearly rental hardware fees.\nIn my case, that’s $420 yearly to Verizon. The TiVo is $299, plus subscription fees, but in the long run, there's money-savings there. Additionally, Verizon charges $5 monthly to rent the “CableCARD,” to bring TV service to the Tivo. (Time Warner charges $2.50 monthly, and Comcast says the service is free for its subscribers.)\nSo I contacted TiVo for a review unit, and waited for the weekend for the setup, in case it was a bear, as these things sometimes are.\nThe actual installation of the CableCARD was drop-dead simple. You open the back of the Tivo unit, and insert the card. Period.\nCable installer activating the cable card (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\nFrom there, you go to the TiVo menu, and find the info for the cable company--which is all clearly marked--serial numbers and the like.\nWhen I called Verizon and asked for the cable card on the phone, I got it right away--on October 7.\nBut the first post installation and nothing is working call had the rep telling me that I couldn't use the card wouldn't be \"processed\" until October 20th. Even though I was physically holding the card.\nUSA TODAY\nNew streaming TV boxes for fall\nAfter grousing about it on Twitter, Verizon sent repair reps to my home on Sunday, where I learned what the snag was.\nMy billing cycle starts on the 20th, and Verizon, the rep said, didn’t want me to have free service for 10 days.\nHowever, it's finally working now, and at last, I can dive into reviewing the TiVo Bolt.\nI’ll be back later this week with my report on cutting this one cord, and how I like the Bolt, but first, I’ve got to ask--how have you fared getting CableCARDs to operate? Did it go any smoother for you? If we can all save hundreds in box rental fees each year--who wouldn’t want that, right?\nI’d love to hear from you. Look for me on Twitter, where I’m @jeffersongraham .\nTiVo Bolt on top of a Verizon FIOS set-top box (Photo: Jefferson Graham)\n7 CONNECT 21 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RCEydS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4552757175001_video-still-for-video-4552639122001.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4552757175001_video-still-for-video-4552639122001.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCEydS&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802491966513434-IMG-0673-3.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802491966513434-IMG-0673-3.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RCEydS&text=Cutting%20the%20cord%20with%20a%20CableCARD&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RCBpLh", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abc24fbd7747a50af62bd39601855788dddef857/c=5-0-4027-3024&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802492648393805-IMG-0675-5.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abc24fbd7747a50af62bd39601855788dddef857/c=5-0-4027-3024&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802493857245554-IMG-0674-4.JPG", "http://twitter.com/jeffersongraham", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4552757173001_thumbnail-for-video-4552639122001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4552757175001_video-still-for-video-4552639122001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://usat.ly/1RCEydS", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d4d253303a7d41dc8750b8eadd6e87d44a7f0965/c=5-0-4027-3024&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/635802491966513434-IMG-0673-3.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9533c2469e6faa82c7f251036400209a7fab3c73/c=285-0-1418-1133/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635797530195603812-BOLT-Front.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:07:59.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
