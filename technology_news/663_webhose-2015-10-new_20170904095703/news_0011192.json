Posted by Craig Rubadoux, FLORIDA TODAY Posted Oct. 1, 2015\nIn the movie, Davis’ character plays a NASA engineer back on Earth who helps track Watney’s movements and communications. The panel also included Chiwetel Ejiofor, the actor who plays the mission's director, who said it wasn't hard to make the part realistic because of the story's \"seamless\" merging of fact and fiction.\nOn Mars, Watney attempts to grow potatoes in his habitat to avoid starving with a rescue mission potentially years away.\n“Potatoes are a good choice,” confirmed Ray Wheeler, a plant physiologist at KSC.\n“Until you run out of ketchup,” joked Jim Green, planetary science chief at NASA headquarter in Washington, D.C.\nStudents from six local High Schools attended the Kennedy Space Centers So you want to be a Martian panel Discussion on future missions to Mars Thursday afternoon held in the Operations support building at the Kennedy Space Center . (Photo: Craig Rubadoux/FLORIDA TODAY )\nNo one would wish Watney’s predicament on a real crew, but Nicole Stott, a former NASA astronaut who lived on the International Space Station, said days rarely go exactly according to plan. She said the crew in the movie’s harrowing opening scenes accurately depicted how astronauts would try to cope with a crisis.\n“It’s hitting the fan and they respond in a very — I don’t want to say emotionless — way, but the kind of way you would need to deal with each other to be successful,” she said.\nMore artistic license may have been taken concerning astronauts' musical tastes. KSC Director Bob Cabana, a veteran of four shuttle missions who called the book a page-turner with a \"very plausible'' plot, said he couldn’t guess which real astronaut would be most likely to bring disco to Mars, like the commander of the fictional Ares 3 crew.\n“It wouldn’t be me,” he said. “That period of music can just go away as far as I’m concerned.”\nWhy go to Mars at all?\nGreen said it was to establish Earth 2.0, protecting against the possibility of a cataclysmic asteroid strike that wipes out humanity.\nJust like a computer hard drive, he said, “We have to be able to back up our human race.”\nMackenzie Davis Actress in the new movie The Martian signs autographes at the Kennedy Space Centers after So you want to be a Martian panel Discussion on future NASA missions to Mars Thursday afternoon held in the Operations support building at the Kennedy Space Center . (Photo: Craig Rubadoux/FLORIDA TODAY )\nGioia Massa, a KSC plant scientist leading an experiment that is growing vegetables on the space station, took that notion a step further.\n“You can also think of it as a backup planet for all life on Earth,” she said. “We’re kind of everybody else’s only hope as well, all the animals and plants and everything.”\nAsked what technologies need to be developed for Mars missions, Dave Lavery, NASA’s program executive for solar system exploration, answered, “All of them.”\nThose include life support systems, systems for landing on Mars and getting off of it, a habitat and radiation shielding.\nHe said NASA’s recent announcement about finding water that actually flows on the surface at times, and is not just locked in polar ice caps, could be a “game-changer” for human exploration missions, providing a potential source of drinking water and components for rocket fuel.\n“It really changes the whole scenario, the whole architecture for how do we get to Mars and get back,” he said.\nStudents asked tough questions about NASA’s flat budget, which has prompted more than one independent report to question whether NASA can possibly launch a human Mars expedition on the timeframe it says it is working toward.\nCabana noted that NASA’s budget now is less than one half of 1% of the federal budget, compared to more than 4% during the Apollo program, but said the agency has a sound plan.\n“It’s very well staged out how we develop these capabilities as we progress given the flat budget,” he said.\nAt least as long as The Martian remains part of the public consciousness, it might help make NASA’s journey to Mars feel more real and imminent, just as it could inspire young people to pursue science and technology careers.\nMovies “let you get to have a model for a person that you can get to know on an emotional level,” said Mackenzie Davis. “And then the job that seems far away, or that you hadn't seen represented before, feels closer to you.”\n11 CONNECT 76 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1RjsxtE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
