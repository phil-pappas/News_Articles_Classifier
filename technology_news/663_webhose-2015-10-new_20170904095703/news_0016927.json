While you could go ahead and change the DPI setting of Windows 10 to 100% again to fix the issue, it may not be always an option especially if you require the larger DPI. \nYou can also run programs in Windows 8.x compatibility mode to fix the issue but if you experience the issue in several applications, it may not be an option as well since you would need to configure them all to run in compatibility mode. Plus, you may not be able to do so for some system programs. \nEnter Windows 10 DPI Fix , a free program that has been designed specifically for this case. The program switches from using Windows 10's scaling method for DPI to that of Windows 8 instead. \nOnce you run it, you will notice that the blurry font issue has been resolved in Windows 10. \nRunning DPI Fix \nJust run the program after you have downloaded it from the site linked above. The interface displays the two scaling options provided by it: Use Windows 10 default DPI scaling. Use Windows 8.1 DPI scaling. \nThe first option is selected by default. Simply switch to the Windows 8.1 scaling option instead and set the DPI scale according to your needs. \nA click on apply reminds you that you need to restart the PC before the changes take effect. Once restarted, you should noticed that the blurry fonts issue has been fixed in the operating system. \nCaveats \nWindows 10 DPI Fix needs to start with the Windows 10 operating system for the fix to work permanently. The program won't run in the background during the whole session though as it exits automatically once it has made the required changes to the system on start. \nYou may also notice that some Flash objects display too small in Microsoft Edge but that appears to be only an issue in the browser and not in others (including Internet Explorer).
