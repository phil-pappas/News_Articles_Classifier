Analysts had predicted 240.9 million pounds on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As measured in U.S. dollars, ARM said sales rose 17 percent.\nThe company is overcoming a slowdown in smartphone growth with its higher-margin designs for 64-bit semiconductors. These more powerful chips are found in newer devices that need to process more information, such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone 6 and Samsung Electronics Co.’s S6, and may ultimately end up in half of all smartphones, ARM has said.\nShipments of smartphones are expected to grow 10.4 percent this year, down from 27.5 percent in 2014, because of a dramatic slowdown in China, the largest market for the devices, researcher IDC said in August. The smartphone market in China will grow 1.2 percent this year, down from 19.7 percent growth in 2014, IDC said.\nNewly appointed Chief Financial Officer Chris Kennedy said last month that ARM will increase its investment in technologies for the “Internet of things” and servers to win market share in industries beyond the smartphone market. The investments will ramp up through 2017, when they’ll cost the company 40 million pounds, and then taper off. ARM says the payoff will be $200 million in added sales by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:58:38.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
