Fairfax Officials over the moon However, the mistake-free liftoff and separation from the rocket prompted cheers from NBN officials including chairman Ziggy Switkowski, chief operating officer Greg Adcock, program director Matt Dawson and space architect Julia Dickinson , who watched the launch from a control room in the Arianespace launch centre on the edge of the Amazon Rainforest.\nMr Switowski, a trained nuclear physicist, described the launch as, \"loud, explosive and muscular\" and \"then graceful\".\n\"It is a historic day,\" he said.\n The financial cost of an explosion or other form of launch failure would have been covered by an insurance policy believed to cost about $50 million. However, it would have delayed the provision of peak broadband download speeds of 25 megabits per second for about 3 per cent of population located in remote areas that can't be reached by the NBN's fibre or fixed-wireless services.\nChampioned by Turnbull Sky Muster and a second satellite expected to be launched in the first half of next year have been championed by prime minister Malcolm Turnbull – in his former role as communications minister – as an answer to the slow broadband speeds and limited data allowances under the current interim satellite service, where capacity is rented from private operators such as Optus.\nMr Turnbull had previously criticised the NBN's new satellite service – which was approved by former Labor communications minister Stephen Conroy – when he was in opposition as an overly-expensive \"Rolls Royce\" option.\nThe launch took place on a warm and clear evening in French Guiana, a French territory close to the equator on the north coast of South America. At about 5:30pm local time, the Ariane 5 rocket carrying Sky Muster and a smaller Argentinian ARSAT communications satellite lifted off, trailing an orange flame and massive plume of smoke across the sky.\nThe rocket was out of sight from the ground in less than three minutes. By the time it had jettisoned its two 277-tonne booster rockets at the two-minute mark it had travelled almost 150 kilometres.\nSky Muster was the first satellite to separate from the rocket after 28 minutes. Three minutes later, it was followed by the Argentinian satellite. It was at that point the Arianespace control room – which had been mostly quiet during the early stages of the launch – erupted into cheers and applause.\n\"People increasingly need a reliable and affordable internet connection for essential services, such as education, banking and health. The successful launch of Sky Muster is an important milestone in the delivery of fast broadband services to regional and remote Australia,\" said Teresa Corbin, head of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network.\n\"When these services become available to consumers in the first half of 2016, ACCAN hopes they will meet consumer need and be sold at a comparable cost to services sold in the rest of Australia.\"\n* The reporter travelled to French Guiana as a guest of NBN .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/government-it/meet-the-2-billion-broadband-woman-fast-internet-heading-to-the-bush-as-nbn-co-announces-satellite-ground-stations-complete-20150208-1392sd.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:23:14.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
