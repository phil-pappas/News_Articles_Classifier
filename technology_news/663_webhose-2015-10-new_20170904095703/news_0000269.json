(AP) -- New York's attorney general has asked three major Internet providers to validate claims that customers are getting the access speed promised, especially for premium services. \nThe attorney general's office says it's \"concerned\" consumers paying for service from Time Warner, Cablevision and Verizon might not be getting the speeds advertised. \nThe request seeks the providers' total broadband customers since 2011 and respective service levels, all disclosures to actual or potential customers about Internet speeds since 2013, substantiation for specific claims, customer complaints and copies of Internet interconnection agreements. \nCablevision says its Optimum Online service \"consistently surpasses\" advertised broadband speeds. \nTime Warner said it's confident they provide what they promise. \nVerizon didn't immediately respond Monday to requests for comment. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
