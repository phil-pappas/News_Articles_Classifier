While the app gained popularity because of its disappearing videos, photos and text messages, the company also made a foray into providing news content with the launch of its Discover platform in January.\nThat section of the app serves up swipe-friendly content from publishers like Comedy Central, National Geographic and CNN, interspersed with ads.\nA Snapchat Inc. spokeswoman said Snap Channel is winding down but didn't rule out future plans to produce original content.\nCopyright 2015 the Associated Press\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 13, 2015 22:25 ET (02:25 GMT)\nPrint Comment Recommend (-) Comments - of - Comments < Previous 10 Next 10 > Add a Comment Please login or register to comment.
