But some complained on Twitter that they had been locked out of their email before they were told they were out, or had been given the bad news by voicemail. \nRead more \nThe next day, the company announced a very important appointment: hiring Omid Kordestani as executive chairman. With the veteran of Google (employee number 11 no less) and Netscape at the helm, Mr Dorsey said Twitter was striving to have one of the best boards in the world. \nJust hours later, Mr Dorsey’s second company, Square, announced it had plans for an initial public offering. In a filing it revealed net revenues of $199m during the six months of the year, up 67 per cent from the same period the year before, but net losses of $77.6m. \nHis busy week served to highlight a warning in the Square prospectus that juggling the two roles “may at times adversely affect his ability to devote time, attention, and effort to Square”. \n● Related Lex note: Twitter: cut to the chase \nVolkswagen’s chemical reaction \nVolkswagen announced an overhaul of its diesel strategy in the wake of the emissions cheating scandal, which this week triggered a mandatory recall of some 8.5m affected vehicles in Europe, writes Chris Bryant . ©AFP \nVW’s diesel technology has been discredited by revelations that it fitted up to 11m vehicles worldwide with software capable of understating nitrogen oxide pollutants in laboratory tests. \nOn Tuesday VW’s core passenger car brand therefore said that “as soon as possible” it would switch to using a different diesel emissions control technology in Europe and North America known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which involves using a chemical called urea to break down harmful nitrogen oxide emissions. \nIn the wake of the scandal VW is also set to intensify development of hybrid and electric vehicles and will look at whether small cars such as the Polo should use gasoline, not diesel. Diesel currently accounts for more than half of VW’s European sales. \nHerbert Diess, head of the VW brand, said the carmaker was “repositioning itself for the future”. \nHowever, VW’s attempts to repair its damaged reputation in the US — where the cheating was first uncovered — suffered an early set back this week. Winfried Vahland, chief executive of VW-subsidiary Skoda, resigned after declining to take up a new post as head of VW’s North American operations. \nVW’s shares have fallen 35 per cent since the cheating was exposed last month as some analysts estimated the German carmaker could face more than €30bn in repair costs, fines and lawsuits. \nAddressing top VW managers in Leipzig this week, new VW group chief executive Matthias Müller insisted VW was made of “strong stuff” and had a good chance “to shine again in two to three years”. \n● Related Craig Smith comment: The problem with those who cheat \nValeant pricing under investigation \nValeant Pharmaceuticals announced it is being investigated by federal prosecutors this week, as pressure grows over how the Canada-based company prices its drugs, writes Nicholas Megaw . \nInvestors pushed down the share price by as much as 9 per cent on Thursday, after the news that US attorney’s offices in Manhattan and Massachusetts have issued subpoenas related to Valeant’s drug pricing, distribution policies and patient assistance programmes. \nThe assistance programmes are designed to mitigate the effect of high drug prices — and the bad publicity they bring — by offering help to low-income patients. \nAnti-kickback rules ban drugmakers from giving direct aid to patients on government-funded healthcare programmes, but many companies give money to independent foundations that assist patients. \nCorporate Person in the News: Danny Meyer \nAfter shaking up fine dining and fast food, inequality is next on the menu for restaurateur, writes Kadhim Shubber. \nRead more \nThe company said it was reviewing the subpoenas and providing information to assist investigators. \nValeant has been criticised for relying on so-called “buy and raise” deals that involve buying old drugs and massively increasing the price. The tactic is common in the US, but Valeant has a particular reputation for price rises : so far this year it has increased the price of 81 per cent of its drugs, by an average of 66 per cent. \nThe group’s share price has dropped 28 per cent since Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticised “outrageous” price gouging in the pharmaceuticals industry on September 21. Chief executive Michael Pearson has said he would eschew such deals in the future. \nWalmart warning spooks investors \nThe world’s largest retailer lost a tenth of its $200bn-plus market value this week after warning that investment in ecommerce and wages would hit profits over the next few years, writes Lindsay Whipp . ©Bloomberg \nArkansas-based Walmart , which serves about 260m shoppers every week, is struggling to catch up with Amazon in ecommerce, as its arch rival sets a fast pace for innovation in areas such as delivery services, often at the expense of profit margins. \nCoupled with its earlier decision to raise hourly wages by $1 to $10 and spend more on training, the investment in ecommerce means Walmart expects earnings per share to fall between 6-12 per cent in the year starting next February, whereas consensus forecasts had been for 4 per cent growth. \nIt also cut its sales forecast for the current fiscal year as the strong dollar eats into its foreign revenues. \nWalmart’s shares fell sharply, closing down 10 per cent in New York at $60.03, their lowest for more than three years. The fall came despite Walmart’s promise to buy back $20bn worth of its shares over the next two years. \nThe bleak outlook comes amid an uncertain consumer recovery in the US, where Walmart said earlier this year that it has yet to see a benefit from the fall in fuel prices. Instead Americans are either banking those savings or spending them on eating out. Retail sales rose a tepid 0.1 per cent in September, according to data released on Wednesday. \nWalmart will invest $1.1bn in ecommerce in its next fiscal year as it develops a system where customers can shop across different digital platforms and tests a delivery service to rival Amazon Prime. Its aim is to be the world’s biggest retailer with a tech company contained inside. \nAnd finally . . . the lighter side of the news \n● 007 is back behind at the wheel of an Aston Martin , but while a suave manner and a discretely wielded firearm might be enough to have a Martini bar tab wiped clean, it is not helping his carmaker make up its losses. So the marque is launching a restructuring programme and scrapping its ‘Q-branch’ experiments with electric cars. No word yet on who might be in the line of fire. But the ejector seat team has been rather jumpy of late. \n● Streaming used to be most commonly associated with the state of one’s nose when gripped by a head cold. Now, it is all about listening to something for nothing and leaving a bum note in record companies’ accounts. In fact, competition for these services has reached fever pitch, hence French group Deezer launching an initial public offering to raise €300m. Who knew Johnny Hallyday was so popular with “les youths modernes”? ©Bloomberg \n● Heartbreaking news for philanthropists who selflessly invest in big pharma, Eli Lilly has been forced to declare that a potential blockbuster cardiac drug is not the jump start for hearts it hoped for. The manufacturer withdrew the product from expensive trials in an effort to arrest losses, but this was in vain as shares took a 10 per cent hit. Plans for other high-risk ‘moon-shot’ medicines will also suffer a body blow. Maybe the R&D department needs a transfusion of fresh blood. ©Getty \n● Shimano , the Japanese manufacturer of gears and brakes for many a penny farthing, has reason to feel pumped up. Cycle racing’s panjandrums have lifted a ban on disc brakes being fitted to high-tech racing machines. Maybe the sporting elite will inspire commuters to fit them to their (only slightly) more modest bicycles. That way, they might stop at red lights instead of careening into pedestrians who are using the crossings.
