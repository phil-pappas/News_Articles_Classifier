The tax agency denied the request, but Yahoo said it would go ahead with the spinoff by year-end anyway. \nMany analysts attribute little value to Yahoo's core business without its Asian assets, which also include a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. \nApart from the Google deal, the only other good news came results came from Yahoo's emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising. \nRevenue in that area rose 43 percent to $422 million in the quarter. Native advertising refers to ads that blend into the type and style of the content being viewed. \nExcluding items, the company earned 15 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 17 cents. \nRevenue after deducting fees paid to partner websites fell to $1.0 billion from $1.09 billion, and the company forecast a drop to $920 million-$960 million in the current quarter. \nTraffic acquisition costs, the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to its websites, jumped to $223 million in the quarter from $54 million a year earlier. \nGAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThrough Tuesday's close of $32.83, Yahoo's shares had lost 35 percent this year. \n(Reporting by Lehar Maan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Arathy S Nair; Editing by Ted Kerr) An illustration picture shows the logos of Google and Yahoo connected with LAN cables in a Berlin office October 31, 2013.
