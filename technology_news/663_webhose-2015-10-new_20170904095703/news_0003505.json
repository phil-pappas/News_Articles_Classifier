Since the addition of e-signatures, LOTWI has been able to automate workflows, enabling the completion of paperwork in a matter of minutes and 100 percent correctly, as well as add efficiencies by automating previously manual tasks. \n“We are committed to leveraging technology to help deliver a better experience for our customers,” said Tracy McDonald, CEO of Lake of the Woods Insurance. “By implementing e-SignLive, we are now e-signing all new business and have the flexibility to support our processes and needs as we expand the use of this technology across the organization.” \nThe brokerage initially added e-signatures to its online processes to save customers from having to come in to a branch or needing a broker to drive out to meet a client. The success was so great, LOTWI has now implemented e-signatures across the organization, from new business and policy changes, to endorsements and human resources onboarding. \nFor the insurer, the benefits of e-signature technology extend beyond its ability to offer an improved customer service. By adopting technologies such as e-signatures, organizations can strengthen compliance and security while also increasing efficiency and customer service. This compliance benefit is a main reason LOTWI now offers e-signing even to those customers it does business with in-person. \n“We’re seeing a trend in regulated industries, with organizations deploying e-signatures in one line of business and then expanding to additional ones because e-SignLive is so flexible – it can be used in the simplest to the most complex use cases, regardless of requirements or delivery channel,” said e-SignLive CEO Tommy Petrogiannis. “In fact, we’ve seen our customers grow their use of e-SignLive by an average of 15 percent every year – that’s a big testament to how easy it is to implement our e-signatures.” \nThanks to e-SignLive’s partnership with IBAO, Ontario insurance brokers are also embracing e-signatures because the solution meets in-country data residency requirements, and has strong security and enforceability built into the solution. \nTo hear more about how Lake of the Woods Insurance implemented e-SignLive, watch the webcast recording at www.silanis.com/resource-center/broker-panel-discussion-on-e-signatures/ . \nAbout e-SignLive™ by Silanis Businesses of all sizes choose e-SignLive™ by Silanis when electronic signatures matter.
