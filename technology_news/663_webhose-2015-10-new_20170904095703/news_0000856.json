Lease papers were exchanged on Wednesday, and LCMC Health wired Jefferson Parish the lease's $200 million up-front payment.\nThe deal puts the Marrero public hospital in the same non-profit system as Children's Hospital, Touro Infirmary, University Medical Center and New Orleans East Hospital. They are part of LCMC Health, which in six years has expanded from one hospital, Children's, to five.\nWest Jefferson Chairman Harry \"Chip\" Cahill said the deal closure is a \"very momentous occasion\" for the community, marking the end of a lengthy and sometimes controversial process . \"We sat down with several hospitals. We found the one that we felt was the greatest fit for us. And it all worked out in the end,\" Cahill said. \"Everybody's happy.\"\nFollowing a public hearing on Monday, the Louisiana attorney general's office signed off on the deal on Tuesday, completing the last step necessary before the parish and LCMC could close the deal.\nWest Jefferson has been struggling financially . Cahill said it's not possible for a stand-alone community hospital to survive in today's health care market. Signing on with LCMC will give the hospital the opportunity to expand into other communities and take advantage of the economies of scale that a larger system provides, Cahill and other officials say.\nPatients won't immediately notice many changes; the doctors and other staff will stay the same, Cahill said. LCMC said patients \"will not experience any disruption in care during or following the transition.\"\nBut soon, the new operators are expected to start working on upgrades to the hospital. Under the 45-year lease agreement, LCMC must invest $340 million in capital improvements over the next 15 years, including $95 million by the end of the fifth year.\nThere are currently no plans for what to do with the $200 million that the parish has received for the hospital. Deputy Parish Attorney Ed Rapier said the money will be in the bank, collecting interest, unless the Parish Council decides it wants to spend it. Because the money derives from a hospital services taxing district, the money may be used only for health care within the district itself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:46:50.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
