Taking its place: computing, of course, which lives inside cars now. And not just computers , but also the culture of computing. One of the benefits of buying your electric car from a quirky, tech billionaire whose other hobbies include private rocketry , subsonic pneumatic freight , and planetary exfiltration is that some of those quirks find their way into your vehicle as inside jokes and easter eggs. \nFor example, the newly released Tesla Model X apparently contains a Bioweapon Defense Mode button that configures the vehicle’s air filtration system more aggressively. It should be useful “if there’s ever an apocalyptic scenario of some kind,” according to Tesla Motors founder, CEO, and quirky billionaire Elon Musk. \nWhile not all of its quirks are quite so zomboid in nature, Bioweapon Defense Mode is hardly the first example in Tesla vehicles, such as the volume control seen above. Some others: \nAfter entering Ludicrous Mode —the car’s bonkers acceleration booster—you can hold down the button for a clip honoring Space Balls, whose Ludicrous speed was the inspiration for the feature:\nYou can change the car displayed on the Suspension settings menu from a Tesla Model S to the submersible Lotus Esprit from The Spy Who Loved Me:\n(Apparently it’s a favorite of Musk’s. He even paid $1 million for the prop in the hopes of converting it into a working submarine.)\nThe earliest software easter eggs were inserted by programmers as rogue signatures , usually because corporations didn’t want to acknowledge the work of individuals. The Model S tips its hat to this lineage, too. Press the Tesla logo on the display screen, then hold the lower right corner to display a photo of the development team:\nGiven the gravity of automotive conveyance, I’m not sure I want a billionaire making jokes inside my vehicle. But that might be an old-fashioned worry. Cars have been run by computers for a long time, but now computation is becoming visible within them. Easter eggs are a customary and even expected feature of software. It’s no surprise we’d find—and even want—them in automobiles.\nMore Notes From The Atlantic If You're in D.C.

Ruben The idea that citizens have an unfettered constitutional right to carry weapons in public originates in the antebellum South, and its culture of violence and honor.\nGun-rights advocates have waged a relentless battle to gut what remains of America’s lax and inadequate gun regulations. In the name of the Second Amendment, they are challenging the constitutionality of state and municipal “may issue” regulations that restrict the right to carry weapons in public to persons who can show a compelling need to be armed. A few courts are starting to take these challenges seriously. But what the advocates do not acknowledge—and some courts seem not to understand—is that their arguments are grounded in precedent unique to the violent world of the slaveholding South.\n\r \r Claims that “may issue” regulations are unconstitutional have been rejected by most federal appellate courts—that is, until last year, when a court in California broke ranks and struck down San Diego’s public-carry regulation. This year, a court did the same with the District of Columbia’s rewritten handgun ordinance. Both decisions face further review from appellate courts, and perhaps also by the Supreme Court. If the justices buy this expansive view of the Second Amendment, laws in states such as New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Hawaii with the strictest public carry regulations—and some of the lowest rates of gun homicide—will be voided as unconstitutional.\n\r \r Continue Reading Greg Kahn The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration Ta-Nehisi Coates American politicians are now eager to disown a failed criminal-justice system that’s left the U.S. with the largest incarcerated population in the world. But they've failed to reckon with history. Fifty years after Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s report “The Negro Family” tragically helped create this system, it's time to reclaim his original intent. \nBy his own lights, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ambassador, senator, sociologist, and itinerant American intellectual, was the product of a broken home and a pathological family . He was born in 1927 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but raised mostly in New York City. When Moynihan was 10 years old, his father, John, left the family, plunging it into poverty. Moynihan’s mother, Margaret, remarried, had another child, divorced, moved to Indiana to stay with relatives, then returned to New York, where she worked as a nurse. Moynihan’s childhood—a tangle of poverty, remarriage, relocation, and single motherhood—contrasted starkly with the idyllic American family life he would later extol.\nContinue Reading Mike Blake / Damir Sagolj / Reuters / alessandro0770 / Shutterstock / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War? Graham Allison In 12 of 16 past cases in which a rising power has confronted a ruling power, the result has been bloodshed.\n\nWhen Barack Obama meets this week with Xi Jinping during the Chinese president’s first state visit to America, one item probably won’t be on their agenda: the possibility that the United States and China could find themselves at war in the next decade. In policy circles, this appears as unlikely as it would be unwise.  \n\r \r And yet 100 years on, World War I offers a sobering reminder of man’s capacity for folly. When we say that war is “inconceivable,” is this a statement about what is possible in the world—or only about what our limited minds can conceive? In 1914, few could imagine slaughter on a scale that demanded a new category: world war. When war ended four years later, Europe lay in ruins: the kaiser gone, the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, the Russian tsar overthrown by the Bolsheviks, France bled for a generation, and England shorn of its youth and treasure. A millennium in which Europe had been the political center of the world came to a crashing halt.\n\r \r Continue Reading Brad Flickinger / Flickr When Schools Overlook Introverts Michael Godsey As the focus on group work and collaboration increases, classrooms are neglecting the needs of students who work better in quiet settings.\nWhen Susan Cain published Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking nearly four years ago, it was immediately met with acclaim. The book criticizes schools and other key institutions for primarily accommodating extroverts and such individuals’ “need for lots of stimulation.” Much to introverts’ relief, it also seeks to raise awareness about the personality type, particularly among those who’ve struggled to understand it .\n\r \r It seems that such efforts have, for the most part, struggled to effect much change in the educational world. The way in which certain instructional trends—education buzzwords like “collaborative learning” and “project-based learning” and “flipped classrooms”—are applied often neglect the needs of introverts. In fact, these trends could mean that classroom environments that embrace extroverted behavior—through dynamic and social learning activities—are being promoted now more than ever. These can be appealing qualities in the classroom, of course, but overemphasizing them can undermine the learning of students who are inward-thinking and easily drained by constant interactions with others.\n\r \r Continue Reading Courtesy of Liberty Counsel Why Did Pope Francis Meet With Kim Davis? Emma Green The Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk spoke with the pontiff during his visit to D.C., her lawyers and the Vatican have confirmed.\nThe pope has left the United States, but details are still coming out about his trip. Here’s a big one: Last Thursday afternoon, during his time in Washington, D.C., he met with Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk who has refused to perform same-sex marriages, her lawyers say.\n\r \r “She left at 1:15 exactly, and she was at the Vatican [embassy] a hour and a half or so, maybe up to two hours, waiting, and that also included the meeting,” said Mat Staver, her attorney at the firm Liberty Counsel, said. Davis and her husband, Joe, met with the pope for “under 15 minutes,” Staver said. “The pope came out and greeted her, held out his hand, ask Kim to pray for him, and she clasped his hands with her hands, and asked the pope to pray for her.”\n\r \r Continue Reading Mike Blake / Reuters What's the Matter, Whole Foods?

On the same day as the announcement, Whole Foods co-CEO Walter Robb told the crowd at a Fortune conference the entire food industry is in the midst of a “tectonic shift” as organic food goes mainstream.\n\r \r That’s a pretty breezy explanation from the co-head of a company whose shares have fallen about 38 percent this year. It’s true that Whole Foods’s storied growth has been undercut by all the grocers muscling in on the company’s turf. As Helaine Olen noted in Slate :\n\r \r \r Once an upstart, Whole Foods is now so successful that it’s spawned its own competitors. A decade ago, organic and other food like gluten-free items were considered specialty products.
