It now seems forever ago, but in late September she was being heralded as the next big thing in the Republican primary field—the outsider candidate who could marshall establishment support, and finally slay the Trump dragon.\nNow look at the polls. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll Monday has her at 7 percent, running behind the much-maligned Jeb Bush. That’s down from 11 in late September . A CNN poll released Tuesday is even bleaker . She comes in fourth—tied with also-ran Chris Christie and behind Rand Paul, who’s on campaign deathwatch. That’s even worse that it seems, because in mid-September she was at 15 percent in the same poll, good for second place.", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/NBCWSJSept2015.pdf", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/19/rel11b.-.republicans.pdf", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-and-ben-carson-gain-strength-in-poll-of-republicans-1445288400"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:43:31.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
