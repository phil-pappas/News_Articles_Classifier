It actually kept me up. When I went to fetch Isis the next day I told the inspector at the SPCA and he followed me home,” he said.\n“When we got into the bush Isis picked up the scent and took us straight to the puppy. We literally found him in minutes. He had been caught by his back legs in the snare which had been made out of the brake cable from a bicycle,” Crawford said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:03:29.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
