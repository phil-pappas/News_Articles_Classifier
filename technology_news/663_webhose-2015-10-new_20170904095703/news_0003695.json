Moments helps you find the best of Twitter as easily as tapping an icon.\" \nA new lightning bolt icon at Twitter takes people to lists of \"moments\" that promise to stand out from the maelstrom of tweets, according to Muthukumar. \nStories in the Moments list are updated throughout the day, and the feature also lets people swipe through topics such as \"Entertainment\" and \"Sports\" to find relevant tweets from previous days. \nAt launch, most of the offerings at Moments were selected by a Twitter curation team, but there were also contributions from partners including Getty Images, Fox News, NASA and The Washington Post. \nTwitter plans to expand the list of partners. \n\"We look forward to seeing new and exciting uses of Moments from more partners soon,\" Muthukumar said. \nThe Moments feature was added to Twitter applications for smartphones powered by Apple or Android software and to Twitter's website accessible from desktop computers. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:43:06.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
