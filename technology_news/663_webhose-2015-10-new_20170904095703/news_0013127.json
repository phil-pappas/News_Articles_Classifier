Telos is supporting the project by providing the technical knowledge and resources to help develop the research center. Mr. Robinson, former chief information officer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, will lead various projects focusing on algorithm development for contextual and predictiv analytics. \n\"The American experience clearly shows that collaboration between academia and industry helps to promote more rapid technological advances, which in turn spur economic growth and development,\" Telos CEO John Wood said. \"In this same light, our partnership with VSTC will lead to real-world solutions addressing the most complex and critical concern of our time - how to assess risk and maintain security in a world of ever-changing threats - and will help further establish Northern Virginia's leadership role in cyber security.\" \nThe partnership is the latest development in a well-established relationship between GW and Telos. Telos has served as an industry partner in GW's annual Teachers in Industry Project , offering educators a multi-day externship at their headquarters to show them the skills students will need to get a job with the company after college. In addition, Mr. Wood serves on the advisory board for the VSTC. \nVirginia Secretary of Technology Karen Jackson applauded the announcement, saying, \"This collaborative research agreement between George Washington University's Virginia Science and Technology Campus and Telos Corporation represents another big step in Virginia's efforts to bring together the best and the brightest in the Commonwealth to tackle the tough challenges our nation faces in cyberspace. I want to thank GW and Telos for taking the initiative to create this partnership and further help make Virginia a leader in cyber security.\" \n\"Our collaboration with Telos is based on achieving mutually beneficial results and is a model of the relationships GW continues to develop with corporations , \" said Tom Russo , assistant vice president for industry and corporate research at GW. \"Telos is a visionary company and we have identified multiple areas where our interests are aligned. We are looking forward to many future opportunities to work together.\" \nGW Virginia Science and Technology Campus \nThe GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus is strategically located in the Northern Virginia technology corridor near Dulles International Airport. The Campus focuses on interdisciplinary STEM research , including biological and health sciences, big data and analytics, high performance computing, energy science and technology and infrastructure safety engineering. The campus, established in 1991, offers approximately 20 academic degrees and certificate programs in business, cybersecurity, education, engineering, health sciences, information technology and nursing.
