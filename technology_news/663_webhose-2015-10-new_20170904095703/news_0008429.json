October 22, 2015 Brad Harbison \nBy Brad Harbison \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. — NPMA CEO Bob Rosenberg was announced as recipient of this year's NPMA Pinnacle Award, prior to the Thursday general session at PestWorld 2015. NPMA’s Pinnacle Award is the association’s highest honor and it is presented annually in recognition of an individual for their outstanding contributions to both the NPMA and the industry. NPMA President Russ Ives presented the award to Rosenberg. Ives noted that Rosenberg spent his first 24 years at NPMA focused on regulatory and legislative affairs before being named CEO in 2012. During his three years as CEO Rosenberg has been a steady presence and he and the NPMA staff have worked diligently to improve the association’s effectiveness. \"Whether we are aware of it or not, there is not one person in this audience who hasn't been positively impacted by Bob,\" said Ives. \"His enthusiasm for this industry, and the people in it, is infectious, and I cannot be more pleased to have the opportunity today to present him with this award.\" In accepting the award Rosenberg joked that he was reminded of PestWorld 1992 when NPMA presented the first-ever “best booth” award to…NPMA. He then commented that “it’s been an honor and a privilege every single day to be associated with this industry.” He added, “I interviewed in 1988 with Chuck Tindol’s grandfather, Red. I was this left-of-center Jewish kid from New York who was not real sure about being associated with pesticides. So, I met this guy from Georgia named Red and he said he had a son named Bubba, and I remember thinking, ‘This is not going to be a great fit for me.’ I never would have supposed that 27 years later I would still be here and have some of my best friends in the world come from this industry.” (Pictured: NPMA's Bob Rosenberg (left) accepts the Pinnacle Award from NPMA President Russ Ives) Convention Conversation: Russ Ives October 20, 2015 \nNPMA’s new president talks about NPMA Academy, NPMA personnel changes and what’s planned for the association in the next year.
