Hence, South Korea’s two biggest tech companies, Samsung SDI and LG, have come up with prototypes of thin and flexible batteries. \nThe prototypes were showcased at the InterBattery 2015 exhibition in Seoul on Wednesday, which should solve the long time problem for wearables and smartphones. \nSamsung SDI dubbed their limber batteries as ‘Band’ and ‘Stripe’. The company claims it can increase battery life by up to 50%. These batteries are also super-bendy and can be wrapped around the human wrist or two fingers. They can withstand 50,000 bends in test conditions. \nZDNet.co.kr reported a Samsung SDI engineer at the show estimating the commercial deployment of the new battery as early as 2017. \nLG also showed off its ‘wire battery,’ a similarly flexible battery that can flex into a 15mm radius back on itself to fit perfectly inside a watch band. Other batteries can only reach a 30mm radius. LG’s G Watch R \nLG’s representative at the exhibition also said the battery can potentially double its capacities from current smartwatch batteries. That would mean, the wire-shaped battery may be able to last four days, compared to two days with the current LG G Watch R. \nWearables like smartwatches are expensive and many feel it is a luxury to own one. Especially considering the high maintainance it requires. Longer battery life would certainly makes it more appealing because we already have to charge our smartphone daily- and our laptops and our tablets. Let’s just hope this new technology will not hike up the price of wearables even more.
