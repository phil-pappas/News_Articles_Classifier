Lodge, 20, who has had brushes with NSW authorities for alleged domestic violence, was arrested at 4.52am on Friday at an apartment block on Manhattan’s upper-west side.\n“Matthew Lodge followed two women home,” NYPD officer Arlene Muniz told AAP.\n“The suspect made statements to the women while they were going into the building.\n“The suspect also made his way into the building and then in the man’s apartment who let the women in.\n“The suspect assaulted the male and damaged the apartment.”\nLodge, who was holidaying in New York, was charged with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, assault and menacing.\nIt is the criminal mischief charge, a felony, that could put him in jail for a maximum four years.\n“Felony is a felony,” officer Muniz said.\n“You get a maximum for whatever the charge is for that felony.”\nThe criminal mischief charge relates to intentionally damaging someone else’s property.\nWests Tigers chief Justin Pascoe announced the club had terminated Lodge’s playing contract after the New York arrest.\n“The club is incredibly disappointed to learn that Matthew Lodge has been charged by police while overseas on holiday,” Pascoe said in a statement.\nThe club would continue to offer welfare and counselling options to ensure he had the support he needed, he said.\nThe charges come just months after the young player was stood down by the Tigers over similar domestic violence allegations. Lodge was granted strict bail conditions after facing court in August for six offences including stalking, intimidation and assault.\n* National domestic violence helpline: 1800 737 732 or 1800RESPECT.
