It dropped the offering to $12 to $13 a share due to weak demand, and then dropped it farther.\nThe first day of trading Friday suggested the company might have left money on the table. Shares rose as high as $13.40 before closing at $12.17, a gain of 21.7 percent.\nCPI Card Group's IPO was the second largest of five in the U.S. this week. The company has seen business surge as banks and other issuers replace magnetic-stripe cards with ones also containing an EMV chip designed to reduce fraud.\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or @aldosvaldi\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:28:40.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
