Based in Akron, Ohio, fanDaction is the only fantasy sports company offering first and second half contests, horse racing matchups, credit lines, and kiosks in sports bars across the country.\nUnlike other fantasy sports sites, fanDaction’s platform broadens the fan’s experience at all levels by inviting more creative game offerings than the competition. In addition to the daily and weekly salary cap contests for NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NASCAR, PGA, College Football, and College Basketball, fanDaction will also offer Pick5 and Pick10 non-salary cap games.\nTo appeal to both existing horse racing fans and millennials who have never been to the track, the company will offer horse racing matchups that extend far beyond the traditional glorified handicapping contests. Available at all thoroughbred tracks in the U.S., fanDaction’s horse matchups allow for 12 hours of fantasy racing daily.\nfanDaction also drastically changes how fantasy sports are played by providing more ways to compete than ever before, including first and second half partial fantasy challenges. Playing a first half contest allows players quicker gratification and more opportunities to play; second half contests get players more involved in the games and provide a chance for additional fantasy action.\nAnother unique component to fanDaction’s approach to fantasy sports is its exclusive offering of credit lines. The company guarantees 100 percent credit approval for college students to have fun and establish credit for their future. fanDaction will extend credit to all other customers based on credit score and history.\nfanDaction also plans to revolutionize the world of fantasy sports by taking its truly fan-driven and interactive platform where the fans are, by placing kiosks in sports bars across the country. The kiosks, which will be available in hundreds of sports bars year one, will offer something no other fantasy sports site does—private fantasy contests that extend the duration of a patron’s bar stay.\nTo learn more about fanDaction or start playing, visit fanDaction.com.
