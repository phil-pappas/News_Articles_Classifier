IAC will retire at least $400 million of IAC 2022 Notes and/or IAC 2018 Notes through the Exchange Offer, the concurrent Tender Offer or a redemption of the IAC 2018 Notes. IAC has advised Match Group that, promptly following the closing of the Exchange Offer, Match Group will be designated an unrestricted subsidiary of IAC for purposes of the indentures governing the IAC 2022 Notes and the IAC 2018 Notes and the IAC Credit Agreement. Upon such designation, Match will no longer be a guarantor of such debt of IAC or any other debt of IAC.
