Good customer service has a profound, long term impact on the airline brand. It was critical that we worked with Conversocial to add this expertise in our Lab,” said Shashank Nigam, CEO, SImpliFlying . \nConversocial works with a number of airlines, including Alaska Airlines and Air New Zealand, to improve productivity and operational efficiency by managing the flow of customer service inquiries and discussions on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram and YouTube. \nThe Marketing Innovation Lab precedes the SimpliFlying Awards for Excellence in Social Media . Established in 2010, these are the longest-running awards dedicated to social media practices in the aviation industry. The award organizers are dedicated to raising the standard of social media use across the aviation industry, promoting the exchange of knowledge and recognizing the best airlines, airports and travel providers on social media. \n“In 2006, Facebook and Twitter became broadly available to consumers and brands – and airlines moved fast to embrace these channels,” said Paul Johns, CMO, Conversocial . “In the last nine years we have seen these channels take a lead in how airlines can identify, reach out and engage with consumers. But now airlines and other brands are know that social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are not one-way broadcast media, they are two-way channels that consumers can – and do – use. Consider the 500 million tweets sent a day, or the 75 million daily Instagram users – these are conversations that have been started by consumers and are there for brands, including airlines, to participate in and to do so in service. We are committed to helping airlines be remarkable in how they use social media, so we leapt at the opportunity to be involved this open and innovative event.” \nFor more information about Airline Marketing Innovation Lab, please visit: http://simpliflying.com/airline-marketing-innovations-lab/ \nAbout Conversocial Conversocial ( http://www.conversocial.com/ ) is trusted by global brands in hospitality, utilities, airlines and consumer brands for social customer service solutions that improve productivity and operational efficiency by managing the flow of customer service inquiries and discussions on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram and YouTube. \nBrands including Hyatt, Spring, Barclaycard, ConEdison, Co-operative Bank, Travelex and Google use Conversocial’s enterprise-class platform for a single view of the social customer via: Comprehensive APIs that seamlessly integrate into CRM and contact center technologies Resolution management on social media Intelligent prioritization, so the complexity of social conversations are presented to customer service teams in a logical manner An intelligent social routing system that distributes conversations based on agent specialization, rules, and agent presence to deliver the quickest and most helpful answer to the customer Relevant messages from public posts, private messages and other customers, threaded into a single conversation to provide full context at a glance Analytics to provide accurate, actionable insights on customer trends over time \nConversocial is a Twitter Certified Partner and a Facebook Preferred Developer.
