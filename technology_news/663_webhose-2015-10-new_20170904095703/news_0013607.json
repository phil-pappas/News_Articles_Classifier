(CSI) (OTCQX: CSVI), a provider of end-to-end financial technology solutions, honored three institutions for their outstanding approach to technology and service as part of the company’s third annual Seeing Business Differently Awards: Citizens National Bank, The Eastern Colorado Bank and Cornerstone Bank. The awards were presented during this year’s CSI Customer Conference, which drew more than 1,000 attendees comprising financial institutions, business customers and technology partners. \nEach year, CSI’s Seeing Business Differently Awards highlight the ongoing efforts of customers that are taking a unique, meaningful approach to maintaining success through a variety of strategies and tactics. Specifically, nominees are evaluated on a series of key metrics, including adding new products to improve profitability, incorporating new approaches that result in efficiency gains and growing market share as a result of new techniques. \n“Fierce competition, combined with evolving customer demands, are constantly shifting the financial industry, and CSI is proud to showcase our customers that stand out for their strategic use of technology,” said Steve Powless, CSI’s chief executive officer. “The recipients of our third annual Seeing Business Differently Awards have all deployed technology-based, service-focused initiatives that have resulted in their becoming more competitive in their markets.” \nAlthough each honoree was judged based on the award’s established criteria, the specific tactics behind their successes differed among each institution. To remain competitive in their marketplace while staying technologically relevant for customer convenience, Citizens National Bank (Cheboygan, Michigan) developed its own “Virtual Branch.” The Virtual Branch directs customers to open new accounts through CSI’s NuFund, download CSI’s Mobile Banking App and explore the rest of the bank’s website, which is an artist’s rendering of one of the bank’s physical branches. The visual nature of the website, combined with the latest technological features, gives the bank’s current and new customers a sense of recognition and familiarity while creating a forward-thinking experience for users. \n“Through our Virtual Branch, we are focusing on our digital channels to not only enhance our service offerings, but also attract new customers,” said Victoria Hand, senior vice president at Citizens National Bank. “We see this as part of creating an omnichannel experience that allows us to provide relevant online tools as well as grow market share.” \nThe Eastern Colorado Bank (Cheyenne Wells, Colorado) increased meaningful engagement between the bank’s staff and customers while also empowering self-service options for their customers by leveraging new technology. The bank recently moved to CSI’s Cloud, enabling it to both improve productivity and better serve its customers. Through cloud-based technology , the bank has gained access to more reliable infrastructure that enhances operational efficiencies. The cloud also eliminates the bank’s need to maintain and manage such on-site hardware as routers, switches and servers. The bank can now focus on consumer-facing technology that enhances the banking experience for both customers and staff. \n“At The Eastern Colorado Bank, we are using cloud technology to reduce the time we spend managing servers and equipment, so we can focus more attention on what’s most important to us—customer relationships,” said Megan Harmon, the bank’s chief operations officer. “Already, we’ve been able to deploy mobile remote deposit capture as a self-service convenience as well as reposition our branches to offer more proactive support services.” \nFinally, Cornerstone Bank (West Union, West Virginia) has adopted an enterprisewide risk management program that reinforces and supports the bank’s strategic vision. Risk management and regulatory compliance demand large amounts of resources and often hinder product innovations; however, Cornerstone Bank addressed these concerns by overhauling its risk management program. By establishing an enterprise risk management (ERM) team that includes representatives from all levels of the bank as well as launching CSI’s SmartRisk IQ platform, Cornerstone created a culture in which employees are cognizant of the risks involved with new products and services and are constantly thinking of ways to mitigate those risks. The bank’s adoption of an ERM mindset positions it for success in today’s heavily regulated environment. \n“Cornerstone engages in a wide range of activities, all of which give rise to some level of risk,” said Lorraine Brisell, president and chief executive officer. “We realized that if we are going to achieve our strategic initiatives, then we needed to manage risk from an enterprisewide perspective. Our ERM program, which is supported by SmartRisk IQ , has transformed our risk management approach and strengthened our employees, our bank and our board.” \nCSI Customer Conference 2015 was held Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 in Nashville, Tennessee. CSI will host next year’s customer conference Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 in San Antonio, Texas. \nAbout Computer Services, Inc. \nComputer Services, Inc.
