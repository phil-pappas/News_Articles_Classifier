KG (Hirth Motors) have launched a new 4103 engine based on their highly successful 4102 engine which to date has flown over 20,000 missions in theater. The 4103 engine is an air-cooled, rotary valve controlled 2-stroke boxer engine with electronic fuel injection (EFI) and has been updated with the latest engine technology to create a new consumer off the shelf (COTS) propulsion system which meets the demanding requirements of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market. \nFeatures include: advanced closed loop fuel control to optimize performance, CAN bus or RS485 interface for easy communication with the UAV flight computer, shielded ECU/harness to protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and optional lightweight 500W starter/generator to provide remote start and air vehicle electrical power. It also features automatic altitude and temperature compensation enabling reliable start and operation in a wide operating range. Temperature: -40 to +50 degree C (-40 to +122 degree F). Altitude: 0 –6000m (0 – 20,000 ft.). \nHirth has been producing engines since 1917 and their reputation for reliable lightweight 2-stroke engines in the sport aviation market has helped expand their UAV business over the years as the global demand for UAV engines increases. Hirth is currently flying on several high end global UAV platforms and has been advancing their engine technology to improve performance and reliability for the UAV market. \nHirth’s CEO, Siegfried Goebler, stated “The 4102 engine has been successfully flying in demanding theater environments and the advances we have made to this new 4103 engine make it world class in this size engine family. UAV manufacturers want to purchase an existing engine for their application and not have to invest in a custom engine development program. We are continually expanding our consumer off the shelf (COTS) line of engines to meet the UAV demand for reliable lightweight engines from 8hp to 100hp.” \nHirth Motors are available in the US through UAV Propulsion Tech .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:26:38.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
