In this Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015 photograph, students study at Hopeworks ‘N Camden, a nonprofit organization that teaches high school students and young adults how to build websites and use software, in Camden, N.J.

Reyes wants to become a police officer. But after spending the last few months learning to build websites, he’s thinking that might be a fallback job, or a way to make some money on the side. That’s a big change, he said. “I was terrible with technology,” Reyes said, “If you asked me to print something out, I’d have a panic attack.” Mel Evans AP Photo In this Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015 photograph, student Gabrielle Lee talks about her training at Hopeworks ‘N Camden, in Camden, N.J. Lee says she wants to get out of Camden but then return to teach English to residents who don’t know the language and do other things to help. She sees online learning as a part of the efforts she’d like to make.
