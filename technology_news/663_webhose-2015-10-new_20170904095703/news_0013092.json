It will set off in 2017 on a journey to the smallest and least explored terrestrial planet in our Solar System, following in the footsteps of Mariner 10 and Messenger. \nOn 4 October, ESA's ESTEC technical centre opened its doors to the public. On display that day were the two BepiColombo orbiters and the electric propulsion module. \nThis photograph shows BepiColombo literally in the spotlight. On the left, lit in blue, is ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter, which will study the surface and internal composition of the planet. In the centre, under the red spotlight, is the Mercury Transfer Module, also provided by ESA, which will carry the two orbiters to their final destination. Completing the trio is Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, glowing green, which will study the planet's magnetic field . \nAll three were displayed behind glass within the cleanroom conditions of the Test Centre, where they are being tested. Image: Inside BepiColombo's mercury transfer module October 3, 2014 \nThis labyrinth of power, data and propellant lines is found inside the Mercury Transfer Module, the powerful haulage vehicle tasked with transporting ESA's BepiColombo mission on its 7.5-year journey to the innermost planet. Image: Moving Bepicolombo into ESA's space simulator November 18, 2014 \nOn 30 October, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, one of the two spacecraft of ESA's BepiColombo mission, was installed in the Large Space Simulator at the ESTEC technical centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

Image: Messenger's iridescent Mercury June 16, 2015 \nTo the human eye, Mercury may resemble a dull, grey orb but this enhanced-colour image from NASA's Messenger probe, tells a completely different story. Swathes of iridescent blue, sandy-coloured plains and delicate strands ... Image: Heat testing on Mercury-bound antenna July 22, 2015 \nThe antenna that will connect Europe's BepiColombo with Earth is being tested for the extreme conditions it must endure orbiting Mercury.
