(GuideVine), an online platform that provides consumers with a \"match.com\" style algorithm to find a right-fit financial advisor, announced the launch of its monthly Philanthropy Partnership Program. The first partner is Watsi , a non-profit, web-based global crowdfunding platform that funds life-changing healthcare for patients in the developing world, who could not otherwise afford care. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272360 \n\"We are excited to kick off our philanthropy efforts by partnering with Watsi,\" said GuideVine CEO and Co-founder Raghav Sharma. \"GuideVine is dedicated to helping consumers find unbiased financial advice that meets their needs by facilitating connections with professional financial advisors. For each consumer who has an initial meeting with an advisor during the month of October, we will donate $100 to Watsi. I believe our partnership with this fabulous, innovative organization enables people to make a difference in patients' lives, and at the same time, take steps to secure their own financial future.\" \n\"We are thrilled to have been chosen as GuideVine's first philanthropy partner,\" said Watsi head of marketing and co-founder Grace Garey. \"It's amazing to see a company whose core mission is to help people by giving them control of their financial futures take that commitment a step further by empowering them to pay that help forward to someone across the world. We can't wait to see these advisor meetings turn into life-changing impact for patients around the world.\" \nWatsi enables anyone to directly fund life-changing healthcare for people around the world. To date, 13,683 donors have contributed $5 million to fund life-changing healthcare for 5,192 patients in 20 countries. Fully 100% of donations on Watsi fund care, with any operating costs covered separately by support from private donors. Watsi works with in-country medical partners - carefully screened, on-the-ground organizations that provide reliable healthcare to underserved populations in low-income countries. Medical partners provide profiles of patients who meet Watsi criteria, which are then posted on the website, where donors can contribute as little as $5 to directly fund their care. \n\"The more we learned about Watsi and the work that they do, the clearer it became that this was an organization we would be honored to partner with,\" said Sharma. \"This is more than a simple win-win situation. Individuals receive much needed medical care, Watsi increases its ability to provide care, and consumers make a difference in patients' lives while taking the first step toward planning for their financial futures via the GuideVine platform.\" \nGUIDEVINE FREE SERVICE FOR CONSUMERS \nConsumers can research the more than 170 advisors on the GuideVine platform.
