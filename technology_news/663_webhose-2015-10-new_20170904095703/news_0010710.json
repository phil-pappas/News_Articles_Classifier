Mr. Manjoo is off this week, so Mr. Isaac is conversing with fellow tech reporter Nick Wingfield. Mike: Hello, Farh— wait a minute. You aren’t Farhad. It’s special guest and able-bodied reporter Nick Wingfield! Hello, Nick! Nick: What am I doing here? I feel like I walked into the wrong restroom. Mike: You have no idea how often I hear that. So it has been another busy week in tech. Which seems to be a theme for, oh, the last two decades. YouTube introduced a fancy, questionably named new service this week, YouTube Red, where folks can pay 10 bucks a month for an ad-free version of the online video site. Sounds like a deal! Jack Dorsey, chief of Twitter and Square, keeps giving away huge chunks of his stock to employees and foundations, which also sounds like a good deal. Oh, and Amazon and The New York Times got into a very public sparring match over a rather unflattering article on Amazon’s grueling work culture . Jay Carney, Amazon’s head of public relations, said the company got a raw deal. Our boss, Dean Baquet, disagreed big time. And the tech pundits had a field day because the whole thing played out on Medium, the blogging platform. Nick: I think the name YouTube After Dark would have been better. Not to change the subject on Amazon, did you notice that Jeff Bezos bought something big from Costco this week? Mike: Whoa, a jet. My biggest Costco purchases are usually 40-packs of toilet paper and five-pound wheels of Parmesan. The thing I want to talk about is Microsoft — a sentence I never thought I would hear myself say. Apparently the company did quite well in its earnings report this week, and it has had a spate of news recently around new devices and other stuff. I guess folks are more bullish on Microsoft than ever, or at least that seems like the positive sentiment I’m hearing lately. Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Bits Newsletter News, insight and analysis about the technology industry, delivered to your inbox Monday-Friday by New York Times reporters and editors. On Saturdays, you will receive a roundup of the week’s news from Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac. You, Nick, are our resident Microsoft expert. Tell me everything, starting with why they seem to be on a roll lately. Nick: One word: the cloud. Actually, that’s two words. The money they are making from it is now big enough ($5.9 billion) and growing fast enough that investors feel as if the company has a grip on one of the most important technology trends out there. Mike: The cloud! I can’t say the cloud without yelling it feverishly. I don’t really know what it means other than servers and Amazon Web Services and Google. Which, in my tiny mind, is something that makes me wonder whether Microsoft will be able to lock in that cloud power. What makes Microsoft better than Amazon — which has a booming business in A.W.S. — or Google, which also offers a bunch of cloud stuff? Nick: Why is Microsoft better? I’m not sure they are, but there are some differences with Amazon. Microsoft says it is a “hybrid” cloud company. Customers can put all their stuff in Microsoft’s data centers, or if they’re just getting comfortable with the cloud, they can keep some of their data on their own premises. The choice with Amazon is more binary — you’re in their cloud, or you’re not. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:06:41.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
