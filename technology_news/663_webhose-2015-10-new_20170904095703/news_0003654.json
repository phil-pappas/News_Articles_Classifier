Secrets servers offer important advantages compared to storing secrets in configuration management. From a security standpoint, secrets servers speed the path to security and compliance certification, offering capabilities such as end-to-end encryption, access control, detailed auditing of access, purpose-built APIs, dedicated management and reporting tools, and support for auto-scaling deployment architectures. Furthermore, using a secrets server enables DevOps teams to roll back the “lockdown” and re-establish the collaborative workflows that configuration management was developed to encourage. \nJosh Bregman has 20 years of experience successfully architecting, evangelizing and delivering innovative identity management and security products to customers.
