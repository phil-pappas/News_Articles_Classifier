On Sunday, Netanyahu ordered security forces to speed up the process of demolition of terrorists’ homes and to continue to use administrative detentions against terrorists.\n\"I’ve instructed to speed up the demolition of terrorists' homes, the expansion of administrative detention of rioters, further reinforcement of forces in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria and the removal of inciters from the Old City and the Temple Mount,” said Netanyahu. Israel was \"waging a fight to the death against Palestinian terror\", he added.\nArab riots on the Temple Mount began on the eve of Rosh Hashanah and have continued ever since, but in recent days tensions have risen in the wake of ongoing terrorist attacks in the region.\nBennett's wife, Adelle Banita, 22, and their two-year-old son were also injured in the attack Saturday night.\nThat same night, a 15-year-old teenager was stabbed near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City, suffering moderate-to-serious wounds.\nTags: Arab terror house demolition", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:13:40.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
