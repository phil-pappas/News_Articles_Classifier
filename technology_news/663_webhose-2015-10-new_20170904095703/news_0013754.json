Golner’s talk, titled “Beyond The Gateway” will take place at 3pm on Tuesday October 20 at the Seattle Sheraton Hotel & Conference Center. “AllJoyn is a software framework for products and applications to directly communicate with each other without the cloud. That’s an important and fundamental design element,” said Golner. “However, leveraging the power of cloud computing to augment functionality of the local network will have a transformative effect for consumers, businesses, and third parties that can offer value-added services.”\nIn his presentation, Golner will discuss how the AllJoyn Gateway agent is a key component that enables a well-defined, cloud-based network of interconnected data, applications and multi-vendor AllJoyn and non-AllJoyn devices to create a better user experience for consumers and new opportunities for businesses. The AllJoyn connection is private and secure, allowing cloud-based services access to devices. Once connected, a business or service provider has a consumer-permission based, well-defined method to access and manage devices in the network. Golner will also explore use cases and applications of cloud-based data services operating in conjunction with AllJoyn devices.\n“The power of the cloud goes beyond the ability to control devices remotely and to update firmware,” Golner added. “It enables features such as customizable end-user notifications, energy peak-shaving, automatic ordering of consumables, and analytics for improving product design and performance. Connecting device data to the cloud with wot.io’s data service exchange opens a whole new world of possibilities.”\nAbout Mitchell Golner\nMitchell Golner, VP of Product Management at wot.io, is a seasoned product manager with more than 20 years of experience in the high-tech industry.
