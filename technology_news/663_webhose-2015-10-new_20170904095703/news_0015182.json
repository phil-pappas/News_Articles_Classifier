They also complained about body and sunroof squeaks, rattles and leaks.\n“As the older vehicles are getting up on miles, we are seeing some where the electric motor needs to be replaced and the onboard charging system won’t charge the battery,” said Jake Fisher , Consumer Reports’ director of automotive testing. “On the newer vehicles, we are seeing problems such as the sunroof not operating properly. Door handles continue to be an issue.”\nFisher said the flaws could signal future problems for the brand, which plans to roughly double production next year. It has just begun deliveries of a second vehicle, the Model X electric crossover, and intends to introduce the Model 3, a smaller, less expensive electric car, in 2017.\nThrough the first nine months of the year, the automaker has delivered only 33,117 vehicles. Current Tesla models sell for about $100,000.\n“Going forward, this poses the question whether they will be able to keep quality up as they increase volume and add models to the mix,” he said.\nThe risk is significant because the vehicles are becoming more complex, he said. For example, a signature feature of the Model X is its Falcon Wing doors that swing out and fold up. Fisher asked how reliable those will be if Tesla already is having trouble with door handles.\nWhile wealthy Tesla owners are likely to have other cars, making problems less of a hassle, if Tesla reaches its 2020 goal of selling several hundred thousand Model 3s annually, buyers might not be as forgiving, Fisher said.\nTesla spokesman Ricardo Reyes said the Palo Alto automaker keeps in close communication with its customers to “proactively address issues, and quickly fix problems.”\nHe noted that over-the-air software allows Tesla to diagnose and fix most bugs without the need to come in for service.\n“In instances when hardware needs to be fixed, we strive to make it painless,” Reyes said. “Consumer Reports also found that customers rate Tesla service as the best in the world.”\nConsumer Reports slammed Tesla’s Model S on reliability even though it loves the way the car drives.\nJust last month, the magazine awarded one version of the car — the all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S P85D — 103 points, a tally so high it broke the Consumer Reports road-test ratings system. Its driving performance was better than any other vehicle the magazine has evaluated.\nBut Fisher said road-test scores are based on the performance, comfort and road manners of the cars Consumer Reports buys and evaluates.\nThey are separate from new-car predicted-reliability scores. A great-performing vehicle still might be a service nightmare while an uninspiring, appliance-like model could be trouble-free.\nThe Model S ratings are not representative of new-technology electric cars, Consumer Reports noted. Nissan’s electric Leaf earned average reliability marks this year and generally has rated above average in previous years.\nWhile Consumer Reports graded the Model S, it didn’t include Tesla in its annual ranking of 28 auto brands because until last month, the car company had only one vehicle in the market. But if it were scored as a brand, the automaker would have placed 19th, Consumer Reports said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:08:12.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
