Bhavish Aggarwal, the co-founder and CEO of Ola, declined to comment. Bansal did not answer phone calls or reply to text messages.When Bansal, 42, was quizzed by reporters about his plans after Infosys, he gave this cryptic reply: \"Our paths will cross again. Whether it will be at a private equity fund, a large business house or a startup, I can't say at the moment. But I am looking forward to working in a value creation space.\"Mitesh Shah is now the CFO at Ola. The taxi app, which competes with Uber, has been on the lookout for a finance chief for about a year, people who interviewed for the job told ET.Bansal, who joined Infosys in 1999, was appointed as the CFO of Infosys in 2012.
