By contrast, drivers on the UberX service, launched in Brussels in early September, number only in the dozens.\nUber has faced numerous lawsuits and protests by conventional taxi companies who see the service, which operates through an app, as unfair competition. Taxi drivers typically have to pay for a taxi licence and clear certain checks.\nUber, which has financial backers such as Goldman Sachs, Google and venture funds Benchmark and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has also seen its UberPOP service outlawed in France, Italy, Spain and Germany.\n(Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Adrian Croft)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-14T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:46:20.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
