A passenger asked the officials for identification. The officials, in turn, became suspicious and asked the man for identification. The man then began trying to steal the officers’ weapons, at which point they fired at and killed him.\n“When I arrived with the ZAKA team at the site of the supposed terrorist attack, it seemed to be a ‘standard’ current terrorist attack, a stabbing attempt, and the terrorist was apprehended,” recounted ZAKA chairman Yehuda Meshi Zahav, as reported by the Jerusalem Post.\n“I wanted to cover the body in a black bag [reserved for terrorists]. After I was asked to take care of the body I saw that he was a Jew, and that it was mistake to speak of a terrorist. I immediately notified the police and we switched to a white ZAKA body bag.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:05:15.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
