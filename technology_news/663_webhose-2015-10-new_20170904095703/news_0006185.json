The following examples show a set of Bedep malware attacks originating from the webmail logout page of T-Online.de. These attacks were detected and blocked by Invincea Advanced Endpoint Protection, preventing compromise of the users' machines. In each case, the attack exploited a Flash vulnerability and then pivoted to use the native Windows utility cmd.exe. The attack employed sophisticated techniques including just-in-time (JIT) malware assembly and Windows utility-based scripting to evade network and endpoint defenses other than Invincea. \nIn the Bedep attack timeline image, a filename beginning with \"rad\" followed by a hexadecimal random character string is ultimately created on the endpoint. Invincea's secure virtual container and behavioral detection capabilities detected and blocked the attack in real time, removing the malware and preventing it from accomplishing its objectives. \nAt least one sample of this click-fraud malware was submitted to VirusTotal, as shown here. \nThe exploit kits used for these attacks used many domain names, but these domains pointed to a common set of IP addresses. Using passive DNS lookups, one can see the domain names associated with the IP addresses used in the T-Online malvertising attacks. Examples of the DNS logs are provided at this location and this location . \nThe Tinba rootkit attacks employed a Flash exploit, followed by the installation of the malware directly onto target endpoints. A log file showing a Tinba attack from the T-Online malvertising is shown in the Tinba attack timeline image. As in the previous case, Invincea's secure virtual container and behavioral detection capabilities detected and blocked the attack in real time, removing the malware and preventing it from accomplishing its objectives. \nAccording to VirusTotal , this malware beacons to several .ru and .su domain names: DNS requests:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:14:24.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
