Performance improvements, increased automation, new precious metals and natural gas functionality and more flexible reporting options highlight key improvements for Aspect customers. Instantly rolled out in the cloud to existing AspectCTRM standard edition users, version 15.2 of Aspect’s cloud-based solution is the result of more than 700 man days of development effort, changes and enhancements to 10% of the code base, and more than 100 separate improvements.\nAccording to Aspect Business Development VP of Metals Justin Howat, “Precious metals traders in particular will benefit from the new release. Many of their trading processes can now be automated, reducing significantly the time needed to capture trades and prices while at the same time eliminating manual data entry errors.”\nVersion 15.2 adds for the first time fully-featured precious metals trade and risk functionality for OTC trades, including:\nCapture of OTC spot and forward trades, lease trades and options Fixed price and averaging trades (including a contango feature for the latter) Multiple currencies Automatic calculation of OTC forward curves based on spot prices and forward rates Automatic selection of MTM instrument based on precious metal product and location Valuation of depository accounts Automatic generation of metals transfer orders\nThere are significant enhancements in natural gas, concentrates and base metals functionality, too. Natural gas physical and pipeline trades are now standard together with measurement by BTUs or Dekatherms. Also, swaps and physicals can now be priced on holidays and at weekends. Payable metals in concentrates can now be priced against multiple optional quotational periods, optimized for either buyers or sellers. Improved integration with third party accounting solutions ensures uniformity of data across all systems, avoiding the need for time-consuming and laborious reconciliations.\nCore enhancements are automatically available to all users with no deployment or feature fees and include new features unique to Aspect’s solution. These include instantaneous profit and loss (P&L) reporting, highly customizable and flexible reporting using Aspect’s own scripting language and the ability to investigate data in depth, drilling down into how P&L and positions are calculated, thereby easing further analytics or troubleshooting work.\nThe upgrade also includes new features requested by customers, a move to more in-memory processing and improved third-party software interfacing for greater speed, new functionality around creating and emailing bookmarked reports according to schedules, not just at close of book, and the ability to expand and collapse OLAP reports.\nFree trials are available for qualified companies here: http://www.aspectenterprise.com/?p=1842 .\nAbout Aspect\nAspect is a leading global provider of multi-commodity trade, risk and operations management applications delivered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) in the cloud.
