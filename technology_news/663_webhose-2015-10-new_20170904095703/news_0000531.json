Many no longer believe a two-state solution is realistic and support political violence.\nAbbas could try to align himself with a frustrated public by shifting to a more confrontational policy, including ending security cooperation with Israeli troops against a shared foe, the Islamic militant Hamas group.", "external_links": ["http://palestine.dk/palestine/government/"], "published": "2015-09-29T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:05:28.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
