Good question. You can find all sorts of dictionaries online, but only a few are aimed at children. You want to look for ones that are age-appropriate and use language accessible to young(er) readers. Here are a few that we think fit the bill. Blend Images - JGI/Jamie Grill/Brand X Pictures/Getty Images • Word Central Student Dictionary Word Central uses the Merriam-Webster dictionary to provide results. If a user misspells a word, the dictionary will provide suggestions for the correct spelling. It also provides suggestions for words that may have multiple interpretations. For example, a search for \"Scientist\" offers a number of options including \"earth scientist,\"\"social scientist\" and \"political science.\" Each definition includes a sound file for pronunciation. Nice dictionary for kids. More » • Little Explorers Picture Dictionary \nThis dictionary is geared towards very young learners and is designed to be browsed, rather than searched. It behaves more like an encyclopedia than a dictionary. Each entry has an illustration and a couple of sentences about the topic. Many entries include a link to find more information. The words in the Little Explorers dictionary range from extremely common (\"hair\") to relatively obscure (\"Queen Alexandra's birdwing butterfly\" - the largest butterfly in the world, according to Little Explorers). The site now includes multi-language versions include, English-French, English-Dutch and English-Japanese. More » • Wordsmyth Wordsmyth is a full-featured dictionary including pronunciation, animation, synonyms, photographs and etymology. Users have the option to search with three different levels: Beginner's, Children's, and Advanced. The Beginner's level is the most simple, focusing on a simple primary definition. Children's is slightly more complex with multiple simple definitions. The site will also create a few different types of quizzes, so kids can use it for a practice tool as well.
