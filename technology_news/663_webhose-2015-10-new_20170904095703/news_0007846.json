They have changed, improved and evolved. But even after so many years we have not been able to fully exploit this mode of transit. With advancement in technology, more and more people are moving towards urban areas so it becomes imperative that trains are developed in such a manner that they become the only mode of transit with unimaginable amenities, technology and precision. For that we should follow a five pointer plan. Get more trains It is expected that by 2030 60 percent of the world population will start living in urban centres. This implies that the load on public transit systems is going to increase substantially. The easiest solution can be: increasing the number of trains, whether it is a Subway, a tube or a metro, trains will have to make an entry into the places where there are none till now. Not only that, these trains will have to adapt to the changing needs of the people travelling in them and also to the changing scenario of public transit systems. Many countries have realised the need for this and have started on this track. For example in the US, metro systems are being built in cities that aren’t known as public transportation hubs. And it’s a long list: Phoenix , Houston , Denver , Salt Lake City , Los Angeles , and Miami , have either started construction on or shown interest in building a public train system of some kind, like a light rail or subway, or expanding what they already have. With more and more young people choosing to dwell in urban areas for their careers and living, the coming years are going to be no less than a “passenger rail boom”.
