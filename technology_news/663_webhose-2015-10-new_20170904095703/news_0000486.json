Territory Sales Manager, Ron held the company record, serving 38 years at SIFCO ASC and EHS Manager, Bob also served a credible 13. The pair retired within just a couple of months of each other. \nLee Shelton commented: \"We have recently recognized the retirements of two dedicated, loyal and well-respected colleagues. Each of them was unique in his own way and SIFCO ASC benefited greatly from their knowledge and experience in their respective fields. Both Ron and Bob will be missed for who they are and what they brought to our company over and above their mere experience and knowledge. We wish them each a long, healthy and happy retirement.\" \nSherri Beedles added: \"Employees have an innate need to understand the value they bring to the organization, and to know that they are making a valuable contribution. We have been so fortunate to have a group of people that have been steadfastly committed to the mission and vision of SIFCO ASC so it was in the natural order of things to recognize and thank our employees for giving of themselves. \n\"What I also found most rewarding were the work reflections from many that had been with us five years to more than 35 years!\" Follow Us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:06:20.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
