The loss in its accounts, published last week, was a result of the soaring cost of wages and benefits for its 362 British staff, who received share-based benefits of £35.4m, on top of an average basic wage of £112 718. \nThe tax figure is likely to increase pressure on Facebook UK over the low level of tax it pays each year - following two years when it paid no tax at all to the UK government. \nFacebook said this weekend it was “compliant with UK tax law and in fact all countries where we have employees and offices”. \nTHE INDEPENDENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:16:07.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
