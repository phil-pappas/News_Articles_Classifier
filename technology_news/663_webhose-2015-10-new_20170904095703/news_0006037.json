(NYSE: TYL) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. \nThird Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights: Total revenue was $150.8 million, up 17.2 percent from $128.7 million for the third quarter of 2014.

Non-GAAP operating income was $39.3 million, up 21.5 percent from $32.4 million for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $41.8 million, up 21.8 percent compared to $34.3 million for the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income was $25.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, up 22.4 percent compared to $21.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2014.

On September 30, 2015, Tyler signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held New World Systems Corporation for $670 million in cash and stock. The Troy, Michigan-based company has more than 2,000 public sector customers and more than 470 employees. Under the terms of the agreement, Tyler will acquire all of the equity in New World Systems for $360 million in cash and approximately 2.1 million shares of Tyler’s common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015 and is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. \n“Tyler’s third quarter results once again exceeded our expectations, with double-digit growth across all revenue lines,” said John S. Marr Jr., Tyler’s president and chief executive officer. “Quarterly revenue surpassed $150 million for the first time, led by growth in subscription revenues of almost 28 percent. Despite some gross margin headwind from expenses associated with onboarding new professional services and development staff in recent quarters to support our growing backlog, we expanded our non-GAAP operating margin by 100 basis points to 26.1 percent. \n“Bookings this quarter increased nearly 26 percent from third quarter of 2014, and bookings for new SaaS contracts were the highest in Tyler’s history. As a result, our backlog reached a new high of $758 million as of September 30. \n“We enter the fourth quarter with a great deal of momentum and look forward to building on that with the acquisition of New World Systems. We believe that this acquisition will be beneficial to the clients, employees and shareholders of both companies. We are excited about this opportunity to continue to execute our strategy of being an industry leader in all major enterprise applications essential to local government.” \nGuidance for 2015 \nAs of October 21, 2015, Tyler Technologies is providing the following guidance for the full year 2015: Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $578 million to $583 million. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.01 to $2.07. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.56 to $2.62.

Capital expenditures are expected to be between $14.0 million and $15.0 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $15.5 million and $16.0 million, including approximately $7.0 million of amortization of acquisition intangibles. \nNote that our guidance does not include any impact from the proposed acquisition of New World Systems, as the completion and timing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. \nConference Call \nTyler Technologies will hold a conference call on Thursday, October 22, at 10:00 a.m. EDT to discuss the company’s results.

This information includes non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Tyler’s ongoing operational performance. Tyler believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures discussed above exclude share-based compensation expense, employer portion of payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, acquisition-related costs, and expenses associated with amortization of intangibles arising from business combinations. We use these measures and believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional insight in comparing results from period to period. \nNon-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures used by Tyler Technologies may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. \nForward-looking Statements \nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as “believes,”“expects,”“anticipates,”“foresees,”“forecasts,”“estimates,”“plans,”“intends,”“continues,”“may,”“will,”“should,”“projects,”“might,”“could” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (2) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (3) material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (4) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (5) general economic, political and market conditions; (6) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (7) our ability to achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (8) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure for new products or services; (9) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (10) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the detailed “Risk Factors” contained in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.
