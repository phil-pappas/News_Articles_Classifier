Users who clean install Windows 10 can enter the product key from prior versions of Windows during setup. This means that you are not stopped dead in your tracks anymore if you are asked for a Windows 10 product key if you don't have one. \nDoes this mean that you don't need to have Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 installed on a PC anymore before you can upgrade to Windows 10? It appears that this is the case but I did not have time to test this yet. \nIt would certainly improve the installation process significantly since you would no longer be required to install (or already have installed) a previous version of Windows on a computer before making the \"initial\" upgrade to Windows 10. \nSince the product key is used anyway to identify whether a system can be upgraded, it makes sense to use it exclusively for that.
