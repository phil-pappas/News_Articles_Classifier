However, there are a few key things you can do to create the most shareable content that your customers and/or consumers will want to post on their own social media accounts\". \nHere are a few tips on how to encourage consumers to share your content: \n1. Create great content \nPeople will be much more likely to share content that resonates with them, and provides a value to their friends and family members- for example a how-to video, a useful statistic, or a funny photo. Social media users will share things that they think their own network will enjoy. \n2. Use engaging marketing \nMany consumers will come to your site once and be done with it. So it is crucial to utilize email marketing and remarketing campaigns to get people back to your site to engage in your content. Include things like open-ended questions in your posts to initiate feedback and responses from your followers. \n3. Focus on value-added content \nConsumers typically don't like to be directly advertised to, so focus on sharing more valuable content. Rather than posting about the product or service your business is trying to advertise, post useful and entertaining content. For example, if your business provides plumbing services, post videos on how to fix common plumbing issues for everyday people. \n4. Make it easy to share with icons \nPosting great content is crucial, and providing your followers with the tools to easily share that content is the next step. Utilizing social sharing icons with your content can seriously increase the extent to which people share your posts. These icons make it super simple for users to share your content right away. \nfishbat is a full-service online marketing company and social media agency dedicated to connecting all types of businesses with their target audiences in the most effective and efficient way.
