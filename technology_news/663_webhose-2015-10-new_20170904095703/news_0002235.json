The onion supplies are expected to improve further as crop in most states is in good condition.\n\"Although production may come down in Maharashtra due to deficit rains, the country's overall output is expected to be more or less at last year's level,\" Gupta added.\nOnion production stood at 18.73 million tonnes in the 2014-15 crop year (July-June), slightly lower than 19.40 million tonnes in the previous year.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:50:04.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
