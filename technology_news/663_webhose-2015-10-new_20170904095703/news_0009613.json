The Hyphen mobile app anonymizes the user, empowering employees to connect securely anytime, anywhere, and makes it enjoyable for employees to share their opinions through a gamified user interface.\nHyphen offers a suite of advanced data analytics for Executives, team leaders and Human Resources leaders to access unfiltered information in real-time, identify issues previously unspoken, and course-correct with timelier and better informed decisions that improve employee retention and productivity. Hyphen's algorithms categorize employee feedback and provide an instant snapshot of trending hot topics, red flag issues, and suggestions that could be applied across the organization.\nHyphen is one of the few companies selected to be in the Startup Pavilion at this year's Human Resources Technology Conference (HR Tech) held at Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, from October 18-21, 2015.\nHyphen co-founder & CEO Arnaud Grunwald said, \"Organizations, whether small or large, need to move quickly in today's environment to stay competitive and it is imperative to engage employees in order to retain them - especially the newer Millennials, Gen X, Gen Z generations of employees. Many organizations collect feedback from customers but struggle to get candid input from their own employees. With Hyphen, organizations can apply the same rigor to employee issues as they apply to their customers. We are pleased with the positive response from both employees and organizations who want to bridge the gap in their workplace with Hyphen. Our customers' C-levels or VPs of Human Resources understand that the future of workplace feedback is employee-driven, anonymous, real-time and mobile-first. They love being able to uncover and solve issues everyday rather than seeing them on Glassdoor when it's too late.\"\nMost employees don't feel empowered to share their candid thoughts about their workplace while Management and Human Resources executives often play the guessing game to help their employees. Traditional top-down surveys leave the management with many blind spots and delay their ability to address issues. With Hyphen, organizations now have their finger on the true pulse of their employee experience, something they can't do with infrequent reviews and top-down surveys.\nEmployee engagement still averages at a worryingly low 30%, according to Gallup, though studies regularly show that giving a true voice to employees in the workplace leads to effective decision-making, higher employee retention, and boosts morale and productivity within the organization. \"Hyphen is helping organizations create an inclusive workplace where everyone can be heard\", says Sarah Brennan, founder of Accelir and a Human Resources technology industry thought leader. \"Hyphen has the potential to surface issues Human Resources and Executives never knew about, let alone asked about, and helps them harness the impact that engagement can have on customer retention and overall profits.\"\nHyphen customer Sourabh Ahuja, CTO of Schoold.co, a mid-sized firm that is building a mobile App for college planning and funding, said, \"Our teams were growing rapidly and with two offices in San Francisco and Austin, we were focused heavily on development. With Hyphen, we can visualize the hot button issues of our employees, and sometimes make changes within hours. Onboarding new employees has improved as they can ask questions via the Hyphen app without feeling embarrassed. Additionally, our employees are happier knowing that their opinions via the Hyphen app are being heard, and they have an important voice in influencing the company's course of action.\"\nFor more information or to schedule a demo, visit us at: http://hyphenapp.io .\nLearn more about us: https://youtu.be/F8YfmBKfW0Q\nAbout Hyphen ( http://www.hyphenapp.io )\nHyphen is democratizing the global workplace by empowering employees to share their ideas and opinions anonymously.
