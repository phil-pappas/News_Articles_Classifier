Budhani’s presentation, “Security Practices that Can Hinder Your Business,” will focus on how DevOps teams can avoid the friction that common security approaches impose on businesses in today’s cloud-based sharing economy.\n“There are numerous complications that can arise as organizations seek to secure their applications and network resources, whether they are based on premise or in the cloud,” Budhani said. “During my session, we’ll look at how to ensure secure access for badged employees, partners, contractors and customers while minimizing attack surface exposure.”\nBudhani will discuss a number of issues that arise related to IP address white listing, making apps available directly on the Internet, VPN-based user access, treating third parties like badged employees for access purposes and integrating a variety of features ensure secure connectivity for end customers. He also will explain the best ways to secure today’s mission-critical applications and how using a cloud-based security solution enables users to create a DMZ between the Internet and their network resources.\n“Security Practices that Can Hinder Your Business,” will take place on November 4, from 5:40 p.m.-6:15 p.m.\nAbout Soha Systems\nSoha Systems is the innovator of Enterprise Secure Access delivered as a service. The Company's solution, Soha Cloud, creates a “cloud perimeter” to protect an organization’s infrastructure from Internet threats, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and botnets. Soha Cloud minimizes a customer’s attack surface, hides applications from public exposure and grants authenticated users micro-granular access to specific applications. Soha Cloud can be deployed as an application's first line of defense in minutes, instead of months, at a tenth of the cost of build-it-yourself solutions. The result is a secure application delivery model that enables a zero CapEx, low OpEx model for critical workloads deployed in public and private clouds.
