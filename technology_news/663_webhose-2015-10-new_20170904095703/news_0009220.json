They include major polluters such as China, the United States, the 28-member European Union, India and Russia. \nBut several major oil producers such as Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (the only G20 member yet to submit its data), Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela have not. \nFabius said he welcomed the publication of data from 70 nations, notably Brazil, India and South Africa ahead of last Thursday's informal deadline for emissions pledges. \nA review published on the deadline day warned that based on the carbon-cutting pledges as of Thursday, Earth could warm 2.7 degrees C this century. \nThe data submissions, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs, will form the backbone of a universal climate rescue pact which the conference is to ink in Paris.

World on track for warming 'far above' 2C target: analysts September 2, 2015 \nInadequate national targets for curbing climate-altering greenhouse gases meant emissions would be \"far above\" the level required to stave off disastrous global warming, analysts warned Wednesday. Carbon cut pledges 'still not enough to cap warming to 2 degrees' October 1, 2015 \nEarth is on track for average warming of 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, outstripping the UN target, said an analysis Thursday of country pledges for curbing climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions.
