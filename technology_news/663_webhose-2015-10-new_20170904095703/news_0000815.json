When the old guard carriers refused to eliminate this archaic practice, John went to social media to see what sort of message he should send to really get their attention. After polling his followers, skywriting was the clear medium of choice. Where: John’s message to Verizon will be visible over the Verizon Wireless Headquarters (1 Verizon Way, Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920) and downtown Newark. \nBroll and still shots will be made available later today on the T-Mobile Newsroom . \nFor media inquiries, please contact Rachel Cooper ( Rachel.Cooper26@t-mobile.com ). \nAbout T-Mobile US, Inc .: \nAs America's Un-carrier, T-Mobile US, Inc.
