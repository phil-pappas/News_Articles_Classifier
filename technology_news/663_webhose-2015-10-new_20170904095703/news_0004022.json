This new strategic alliance will improve the software company's ability to communicate effectively in all markets while ensuring efficiency, quality and meet market-specific requirements. Over the last year, the software publisher began expanding its presence to an increasing number of countries in Europe , Asia and Southern America, and was facing a growing demand for translation into foreign languages. All communications and product development being managed from the head office, it was quickly becoming a burden to find resources to deliver quality translations for both their technical documentation and marketing materials in all languages. They needed a partner who could help them centrally manage all languages, and they chose Traducta.\nTraducta, as a specialized multilingual translation firm, enables global companies to outsource their translation projects to a single vendor, eliminating the hassle of managing separately each language. From a single online portal, the client can manage multiple translation projects, specify which languages are needed, select deadlines, provide references, review and approve quotations and add special instructions as needed. Once the project is launched, the client can monitor its progress and retrieve translated files directly from the portal. If needed, a collaborative work environment is made available to the client, to have in-country subject matter experts validate client-specific terminology.\nEarlier in 2015, Traducta announced it had extended its language pair offering to most languages in the Americas, Europe and Asia via a comprehensive network of in-country professional translators from across the globe, and ensures consistent quality with a mix of qualified project managers, professional translators and cutting edge technology.\n \n\nSOURCE Traducta\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.traducta.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:09:57.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
