The article lists numerous benefits retailers anticipate from customer Wi-Fi, mobile POS systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, as well as a long list of devices currently in use or soon to be found in retail environments. All of the technologies discussed will put additional strain on existing networks, hence the admonition to increase network bandwidth.\n“Soon, businesses of all sizes will be offering Wi-Fi and using mobile POS systems,” stated Jennifer Mazzanti, President, eMazzanti Technologies. “Increasing a retailer’s network bandwidth is necessary to accommodate these changes and those that will surely follow.”\nBelow are a few excerpts from the article “ Increase Store Network Bandwidth to Prepare for Revenue-enhancing Technologies ”.\n“Mobile point of sale systems (mPOS) and customer Wi-Fi are among the most common innovations paying dividends, finding their way into even the smallest retail businesses. Retailers offer wireless in their stores to increase visitor store browsing time and same store sales from customers seeking Wi-Fi inspiration. mPOS systems are adding efficiency and scalability while enhancing the customer experience and service quality.”\n“On the forefront of technology are the limitless number and variety of devices categorized as the Internet of Things (IoT). Retailers expect IoT devices to lower operating costs and improve operational performance in every area. They anticipate huge efficiency gains from actionable real-time information applied to everyday processes.”\n“To anticipate and prepare for the new bandwidth-hungry technologies, or even to prevent current mPOS systems from locking up, retailers will need to beef up their networks to dramatically increase their bandwidth (data transmission capacity/speed).”\n“Getting the right high-speed Internet service is a critical step in preparing the business for emerging technologies. Working with an Internet service provider (ISP) specialist or consultant can help retailers obtain the best Internet service to handle anticipated needs for the best price. Prices and options for Internet service change so quickly that engaging an expert will pay off nicely in savings.”\nThe article concludes with instructions on how to get started with new retail technologies and increase network bandwidth, and advises retailers to consult with an expert. Getting help from experienced retail network and security consultants will maximize growth opportunities while saving time and money and preventing potential business-ending security breaches.\nRead the full article here .\nRelated resource information:\nHow to Get More Internet for Less\n5 Things Retailers Should Know about the Shift to EMV Card Technology\nAbout eMazzanti Technologies\neMazzanti’s team of trained, certified IT experts rapidly deliver cloud and mobile solutions, multi-site implementations, 24×7 outsourced network management, remote monitoring and support to increase productivity, data security and revenue growth for clients ranging from professional services firms to high-end global retailers.\neMazzanti has made the Inc. 5000 list six years running, is a 2015, 2013 and 2012 Microsoft Partner of the Year, and a 5X WatchGuard Partner of the Year.
