(Photo: Martha Kenney via Facebook)\n10 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE SAN FRANCISCO — Airbnb, the booming accommodation rental startup, apologized Thursday for a series of snarky outdoor ads that had some locals riled.\nThe ads implied that many city services, from libraries to parking enforcement, should be grateful to Airbnb due to the hotel taxes the company contributes to city coffers. Read one bus stop ad: \"Dear Public Library System: We hope you use some of the $12 million in hotel taxes to keep the library open later. Love, Airbnb.\"\nDay Around The Bay: Is This An Actual Airbnb Ad? https://t.co/xvVO7JdJOS pic.twitter.com/F8FKtCMVTR\n— SFist (@SFist) October 22, 2015 After critics of the ads took to social media, the company responded via Twitter Thursday: \"We apologize for Wednesday’s SF ads. They displayed poor judgment and do not live up to the values and humanity of our global community.\" The company said it would be taking down the ads.\nReactions to the ads included those who did see the arch humor in them, and lamented that others were taking quick offense. \"TBH (to be honest), they were funny,\" tweeted local Emily Green.\nAirbnb ads, part of $8M fighting Prop F, highlight $12M in taxes, backfire immediately. https://t.co/lAYGYNOJFc pic.twitter.com/BmfjKWTJu7\n— Matt Stempeck (@mstem) October 22, 2015 But other tweaked residents pointed out that of the $12 million paid by Airbnb hosts and guests, only a small percentage would actually find its way to the individual municipal services targeted in the ads.\nMartha Kenney wrote on Facebook: \"Out of your $12 mil of hotel tax, only 1.4% percent goes to the SF Public Libraries. So that's $168,000. Divided by the 868 library staff, we have $193 per person. Assuming each employee works 5 days per week minus holidays, this is $0.78 per employee per day. Since that's significantly under San Francisco minimum wage ($12.25/hr), I doubt that your hotel tax can keep the libraries open more than a minute or two later.\"\nFollow USA Today tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava .\n10 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LPd1W6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mstem/status/657043824875843584", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50117b4bfe181f32492ec4d414638d7c08e560e6/r=500x400/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811184231165380-air.jpg", "https://t.co/BmfjKWTJu7", "https://t.co/lAYGYNOJFc", "https://t.co/F8FKtCMVTR", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35b62d15554d3787a3014f89533cd5bd2da9a5c4/c=0-48-599-498&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811184231165380-air.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LPd1W6&text=Airbnb%20apologizes%20for%20snarky%20San%20Francisco%20ads&via=usatoday", "https://t.co/xvVO7JdJOS", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LPd1W6&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LPd1W6", "https://twitter.com/SFist/status/656996851766292480", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811184231165380-air.jpg", "http://twitter.com/marcodellacava"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:07:37.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
