As excitement builds for their album launch and upcoming tour, the duo trip eagerly through Brooklyn's thriving DIY music scene. But as hype slams into reality, the film crew realizes they may have stumbled upon a story more interesting than the one they anticipated. \nWritten and directed by Kevin Alexander (an Emmy-award winning former producer for New York's PBS affiliate, WNET/Channel 13), Hunter&Game is a mockumentary comedy starring Nico Tortorella (Scream 4, Odd Thomas, TV's \"The Following,\" and TV's \"Younger\") and Cameron Scoggins (The Happy Sad, currently in \"Hir\" at Playwrights Horizons, NY). Other cast members include: Audrey Jessup, Erin Darke (Love and Mercy, Still Alice), Dan Bittner (The Wolf of Wall Street, HBO's \"The Leftovers\"), Stephen Singer (Don Juan de Marco, Obvious Child), Libby Woodbridge (\"House of Cards\") and Britne Oldford (TV's \"The Divide\", Syfy's upcoming \"Hunters\"). Five original Hunter&Game songs performed in the movie were written by sound/performance artist Jonathan Pfeffer, former leader of the \"confrontational cubist-pop ensemble\" Capillary Action. \nHunter&Game was shot almost entirely in Brooklyn, showcasing real bands and venues including performances by electronic music star Pictureplane and other acts at 285 Kent--in some of the last video shot at the legendary, now-defunct Williamsburg club (called a \"beacon of underground culture\" by the taste-making music website Pitchfork). Other locations in the film include the Bushwick's Bossa Nova Civic Club, Brooklyn Bowl and the famed Cake Shop on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Among the many bands featured is Ava Luna, described by Time Out New York as \"a brilliant, up-and-coming Brooklyn quintet with a sound perched between angular indie rock and supple soul.\" \nHunter&Game premiered at the LA INDIE Film Festival in October 2014, where it won the Best Feature and Best Direction of a Feature awards. The film had its East Coast premiere at the Art of Brooklyn Film Festival in May 2015, where it won the Best Feature award. \"We were thrilled to screen the East Coast Premiere of Hunter&Game,\" says Joseph Shahadi, Executive Director, The Art of Brooklyn Film Festival. \"It's a funny, well-made film with standout performances from stars Cameron Scoggins and Nico Tortorella. Brooklyn-born director Kevin Alexander's Best Feature award was very well-deserved!\" \nProduced and distributed by Intrepid Fox, the film will release on both Indieflix and Brooklyn on Demand on November 3, 2015. \nTo view the trailer:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:12:38.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
