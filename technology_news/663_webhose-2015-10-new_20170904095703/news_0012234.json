Planetary Science Division Director for NASA Dr. James Green stated that \"Mars is not the dry arid planet that we thought of in the past. Today we are going to announce, that under certain circumstances, liquid water has been found on Mars.\" Images were shown on screen explaining how the discovery was made and the potential implications is has. Footage courtesy of NASA\nSeptember 29th 2015 21 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/World/ Is there water on Mars?\nROHAN SMITH news.com.au THE life-on-Mars narrative flipped this morning. It went from far-fetched to feasible. There’s water on the red planet, so why not Martians?\nThe announcement was one of science’s biggest discoveries — another great find in a golden era for astronomy. But it posed just as many questions as it answered.\nHow much water is there? Why can’t we see it? Will a hypothetical future mission to Mars be able to use it as a resource? Where is it coming from?\nNASA tried its best to answer the tricky questions in a Reddit AMA this morning.\nIt descended quickly into chaos.\n“Where da aliens at?” one user asked the chief scientist behind the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, who appropriately ignored the question.\n“When do we start drilling for oil?” another user asked.\nTo get to the bottom of what this morning’s announcement really means we asked a man who has dedicated his life to looking up to the stars and a woman who plans to visit Mars in the next 20 years.\nOne called it “a game changer for crude missions to Mars”. The other said it’s “the most significant link to alien life” we’ve ever seen.\nDark, narrow streaks on Martian slopes such as these at Hale Crater are inferred to be formed by a seasonal flow of water on contemporary Mars. Picture: NASA Source: Supplied\nWHAT NASA ACTUALLY SAID\nJim Green, the Director of Planetary Science at NASA, told waiting media that a spacecraft had found “liquid water”.\n“As we inject the soils, they’re moist, they’re hydrated, they’re full of water,” he said.\n“Mars is not the dry, arid planet that we thought of in the past. Liquid water has been found on Mars.”\nWhat they found were streaks on the planet’s surface and a “very small amount of water, maybe enough to wet the top layer of the surface of Mars”.\nThe streaks are known as recurring slope lineae (RSL) and they were discovered using infra-red light technology. The streaks are 4-5m wide and 200-300m long.\nScientists also found salts — Perchlorate salts — that absorb water until the salt dissolves and forms a liquid solution.\nShort of telling the world that our roving four-wheeler had spotted actual aliens, the announcement was warmly welcomed . Then it left us wanting more.\nWater discovered on Mars, says NASA. Source: Supplied\nNASA scientists find evidence of flowing water on Mars. Source: Supplied\nWHAT THAT REALLY MEANS\nSwinburne University Astronomer Alan Duffy has a way with words. He coined the term “soaking gun” this morning after NASA made its big announcement.\nHe told news.com.au the science behind water on Mars might be complex but understanding its significance was simple.\n“Very simply, for my entire academic career, Mars has been a desert. The discovery that there’s flowing water is stunning. This is the first world apart from Earth where it’s happened. NASA now has a guide: Where there’s water there’s life, just follow the water.”\nDr Duffy said the water could be coming from a two different sources. It could be coming from moisture in the air or from ice beneath the red planet’s crusty outer layer — known as subsurface ice.\nThe difference would not be visible to the naked eye but it could be the difference between sustaining human life on Mars or struggling to survive.\nDr Duffy explains: “The subsurface ice implies that there might be a big reservoir and if you scratched away the dust you’d find melted ice.”\nHe said it could point to the whereabouts of oceans that vanished from the Mars surface two billion years ago.\n“We know Mars had oceans potentially a kilometre or more deep. Have they gone underground, have they frozen?”\nThe Mars 100 2:33 Meet the Mars 100. These men and women from around the globe face the third round in Mars One's Astronaut Selection Program.\nApril 26th 2015 6 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR FUTURE MARS MISSIONS?\nSonia Van Meter is preparing to farewell her home planet for a life on Mars. Or, at least, part of a life.\nThe 36-year-old Texan is one of the final 100 people to be short-listed for the audacious Mars One mission which aims to establish a permanent human settlement on the red planet. More than 200,000 people applied for the job and next year she finds out if she has to quit her job and train full time for the mission.\nShe said she was “terribly excited” when she heard the news of water on Mars. She believes it’ll be difference between living and dying on Mars.\n“This is a game changer for crude missions to Mars,” she told news.com.au from her home in Houston.\n“We know for sure that there is water there that we can use as a resource. More than that the presence of water increases the likelihood of recognisable life. That’s really something. I think this is a magnificent announcement.”\nMs Van Meter, who would be leaving behind her loving husband and two stepchildren for the one-way mission aiming to leave in 2026, said her and the other candidates have been talking about water on Mars all day.\nSonia Van Meter wants to see what’s on Mars for herself. Source: Supplied\nDr Duffy said the discovery “ranks in the top discoveries in the search for life” and he believes the first person to walk on Mars is alive right now.\n“This justifies all the effort we’ve spent on Mars trying to find life. We were actually looking in the right place the whole time,” he said.\nBut he cautioned against seeing water as the only prerequisite for life. He said other organic material would be needed but water was a good start, even if it were frozen.\n“People think microbes couldn’t form in such salty, cold water but we know that there exists microbes on Earth that could. Something might’ve evolved. After all, it was pleasant on Mars a couple of billion years ago.”\nWE NEED TO KEEP OUR DISTANCE\nThe one big problem with this morning’s announcement was that we’re limited in what happens next. It makes sense for the Mars Rover to make tracks for the watery streaks but NASA won’t be doing that.\nDr Duffy said NASA can’t send a craft to investigate because it would likely bring with it bacteria from Earth.\n“NASA intentionally landed probes far from sites that could be inhabitable because they don’t want to contaminate them,” he said.\nJohn Grunsfeld, associate administrator at NASA's Science Mission Directorate, talks about the \"strongest evidence yet\" of salty liquid water on Mars. Source: AFP\n“If we try to go to one of these dark streaks, it’s going to be so difficult to know if it’s Martian bacteria or something we’ve brought with us.” That means sterilising the craft and, likely, another mission.\nSo what’s next? NASA says it will send the InSight lander to Mars in 2016 to focus on another aspect of interplanetary discovery — Mars-quakes. A new rover is in development for the 2020s.\nDr Duffy said NASA would turn its attention to discovering the source of the water. But there’s something else on Mars worth looking into: Methane.\n“We’ve discovered that methane is coming from the surface of Mars. Methane on earth is from life. Identifying the source of the methane will be a huge question to answer.”\nHe said he was still buzzing from this morning’s announcement.\n“It’s one thing to say two billion years ago we had water there but it’s another thing entirely to say it’s there now and if you went there you could touch it.”\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4eda2832d75caf6cc933d28ac7f7f792", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2F4wYmxxdDoHmdhrjlGcHY8xOPUQbIWhQs%2FrQqFhpGihXXoLKSn4xMDoxOjBtO_wVGe&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7fc3310ca5f50f007645a3b91c5ae0af", "http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9d12933ea8af0e102b78c3072bb3e0a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ddd7b7a22587a7cdceebb3e443a1e78a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e29c4498c09f4a6ff66695e29f02ead7", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9b036b5d225a92bf050c0977a66efaeb", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FpucGF0dzq4HERiVeowBH3h0n2JQSRq3g%2Fpromo267797587&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-09-30T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:28:31.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
