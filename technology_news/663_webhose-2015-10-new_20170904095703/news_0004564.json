Throughout the year, Viking Branch personnel wear blue ShuBee booties during their service to residential clients as well as when servicing sensitive accounts that require protective footwear. CEO and Owner Ed Bradbury started this years ago to show Viking customers that “We Care”. President Ryan Bradbury took the opportunity to partner with Forshaw Distribution in 2014 when they announced their Pink ShuBee campaign for Breast Cancer Awareness in 2014 and again in 2015. We receive many compliments from our customers on our footwear policy and even more during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, states Ryan Bradbury. Pictured below are several of our branches, ready to support Breast Cancer Month. We wear the Pink ShuBees during the entire month of October in support of this great cause.

The fundraising campaign will run through the month of October in conjunction with Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Arrow Exterminators service professionals are wearing special pink shoe covers during the month of October. d. Customers are asked to take a photo of their Service Professional’s pink shoe covers and then post the picture to one or more of their social media accounts using #ArrowCares. Arrow Exterminators will donate $1 to the National Breast Cancer Foundation for each of these posts. Arrow team members will also be wearing pink ribbons to show support to those surviving breast cancer and to remember those who have lost their fight against this disease. During the month of October, McCloud service specialists are encouraged to wear pink exam gloves on the job to build awareness, offer support and foster hope for those fighting breast cancer. The company has purchased the Generation Pink Gloves through Medline Industries, which donates and supports the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Additionally, all office team members are encouraged to participate and show their support by wearing pink each Friday during the month of October. Atlantic Pest and Termite Management is donating to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) .
