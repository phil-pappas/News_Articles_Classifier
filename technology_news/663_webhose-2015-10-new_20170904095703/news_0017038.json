Indebtedness is indifferently cited to as a reason for suicide. Some compensatory amount is handed to the bereaved family and the issue is relegated to a dark corner of our collective national consciousness. No concrete attempt is made to unearth the reasons for the indebtedness of the farmer or revise policies to brighten up the dark world of cultivators. The National Sample Survey office (NSSO) releases key indicators of debt and investment in India decennially. Task forces are set up to examine data. Yet, policy revision based on such data receives scant attention. Satish Verma’s book Rural Credit and Financial Penetration in Punjab, under the aegis of the RBI Chair in CRRID, is an honest attempt to analyse data on rural credit in Punjab in the context of the plight of the indebted farmer. Verma examines the financial penetration of institutional as well as non-institutional sources of rural credit, ascertain their distinctive features and highlight the major reasons for the rural reluctance to rely on public-sector banks for loans. Our history books, Premchand’s literature and films like Mother India highlighted how the money lender perpetrated the vicious cycle of eternal debt of the farmer during the British times. However, primary data culled from a cross-section of rural households in banked and unbanked villages of Punjab show that the situation is not significantly different today. Although, in the early decades post-Independence, the surge of the co-operative movement and nationalisation of banks brought some succor to the debt-be-devilled farmer, contrarily, the period of banking reform did not help. The share of institutional rural credit fell from a peak of 15.3 per cent in 1987 to 8.4 per cent in 2006. The post-reform period, consequently saw the return of the money lender in Punjab, albeit in a new avtar — that of the commission agent or arthiya. As Verma points out personal dealing, flexibility of the loan amount, no collateral and minimum documentation has made this new money lender very popular with the rural populace. This credit source accounts for 54 per cent in the state of Punjab as compared to the average of 45 per cent across India. Verma has also examined various causes that affect financial penetration in Punjab. The average annual income is an important barometer for rise in number of bank accounts. Gender also plays an important role, while surprisingly literacy levels have nothing to do with selecting an institutional or non-institutional source of credit. Despite the academic conclusions drawn, the problem remains that non-institutional sources of credit outweigh institutional sources of loan by a significant 15 per cent. The reasons are not difficult to pinpoint. In banked villages, the main problem reported is malpractices and harassment by the bank officials or mediators. In unbanked villages, formalities galore discourage the rural population from approaching banks of neighbouring villages. Thankfully, Verma does not leave us wrestling with the problem but incorporates suggestions made by respondent households. Simplification of loan procedures, loan schemes for poor and landless, a strong monitoring mechanism to take erring officials to task, waiving away of guarantees et al. are some of the suggestions made. It is also suggested that rules to regulate non-institutional credit be mooted. The author also suggests some policy initiatives for minimising dependence on the arthiya. He is of the view that the institution of co-operative society should be strengthened and possibility of assigning it the role of a marketing agency should be explored. Business facilitators can also play an effective role in checking non-institutional sources of credit. The book makes no pretense about being an easy read. It is full of mind-boggling data which has to be sifted through patiently to make sense of the conclusions drawn by the author. It is essentially an academic treatise that lays bare the bones of the skeletal financial penetration in rural areas. To the sympathetic reader, it also reveals the state of extreme poverty and indebtedness of the rural cultivator as well as the small trader and landless farm worker. One can only hope for a quick respite for the beleaguered rural households through serious policy-revision measures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:03:48.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
