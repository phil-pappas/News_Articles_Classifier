Scientists also will be testing a new method of fabricating the payload that creates the most forward part in one step. The conventional machined and welded construction process is costly, adds weight and introduces more risk, according to NASA.\nBrilliant night launch of a Black Brant IX rocket from @NASA_Wallops - anyone off station see it? https://t.co/1KUv8XCJuE\n— David Dickinson (@Astroguyz) October 7, 2015 Orbital ATK, a private contractor that uses Wallops for International Space Station resupply missions, also will be using the vehicle to test three different materials that could prove valuable in future aerospace and defense products.\nUSA TODAY\nVideo: Antares rocket explodes at NASA facility\nThe rocket also will release vapor clouds using a new ejection system. Such clouds are used to study wind in space and the ionosphere. The new system could allow researchers to study wider areas during future launches, officials say.\nThe vapor, which is to be released about 130 miles above the Earth, will contain a barium-strontium mixture that produces a cloud with a mix of blue-green and red colors.\nOn Thursday, United Launch Alliance aims to launch its second Atlas V rocket in less than a week with a blastoff planned from California's Central Coast.\nWatching inside NASA command center on UStream while outside watching rocket launch w/ 1st grader was so exciting! Thank you @NASA_Wallops !\n— Beth Crook (@bethcrook) October 7, 2015 The rocket is targeting a liftoff at 8:49 a.m. PT from Vandenberg Air Force Base, carrying a classified mission for the National Reconnaissance Office.\nThere's a 70% chance of acceptable weather at Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex-3. The full launch window has not been disclosed, but a longer launch \"period\" ended at 9:30 a.m. ET.\nUSA TODAY\nAtlas V rocket lifts off with Mexican satellite\n\"We are excited and ready to take on our first Atlas launch of 2015,\" said Col. J. Christopher Moss, commander of the 30th Space Wing, in a statement Wednesday. \"Our team and mission partners have put a lot of hard work into preparing for this important mission for our nation.\"\nThe NROL-55 payload, encapsulated in a 4-meter diameter payload fairing, was mated to an Atlas V booster inside the Mobile Service Tower, or MST, at Vandenberg Air Force Base's Space Launch Complex-3. (Photo: United Launch Alliance)\nAmateur spacecraft observers speculate that the rocket is carrying a pair of satellites updating the Naval Ocean Surveillance System, or NOSS.\nIn addition to the primary mission, the rocket's Centaur upper stage will deliver a group of 13 experimental and student-developed CubeSats to orbit.\nThe tiny spacecraft include nine missions sponsored by the NRO and four by NASA. Kennedy Space Center's Launch Services Program was responsible for securing the ride for the NASA-sponsored payloads known as ElaNA-12.\nA successful launch would keep ULA on track to return to Cape Canaveral for an Oct. 30 launch of the Air Force's next Global Positioning System satellite on an Atlas V. The booster for that mission was delivered to the Cape on Tuesday.\nAn Atlas V last Friday successfully delivered Mexico's Morelos-3 communications satellite to orbit, completing ULA's 100th launch since Boeing and Lockheed Martin formed the joint venture in December 2006.\nContributing: James Dean, Florida Today\n13 CONNECT 43 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1Rut5wZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NASA_Wallops", "https://twitter.com/Astroguyz/status/651898054954627072", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/193eacf33d74f120664be6ccc53c21366b67bfa0/c=0-73-851-1208&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Brevard/Brevard/635798360884508904-nrol55-av-mate-vafb-05.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2014/10/29906170001_3863552448001_thumb-fcf8c4fd6797d62a630f6a7067004d60.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/05/Salisbury/Salisbury/635796379976396971-nasarocketview.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rut5wZ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/477b74b9f1e0354bd39a9c6ff4073a19d84d62f4/c=274-0-1516-1242/local/-/media/2015/10/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635793672925454079-atlas-launch-100215-2.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/159ff3b07fa297f694ea06da537309f7e1b78343/c=171-0-2395-1672&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/05/Salisbury/Salisbury/635796379976396971-nasarocketview.jpg", "https://t.co/1KUv8XCJuE", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rut5wZ&text=NASA%20sounding%20rocket%20launched%20from%20Wallops%20Island&via=usatoday", "http://delmarvane.ws/1OhRaZp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/363d7d9b62691694d8308dfc65e908739402b5ad/r=500x348/local/-/media/2015/10/05/Salisbury/Salisbury/635796379976396971-nasarocketview.jpg", "https://twitter.com/bethcrook/status/651900082640551936", "http://usat.ly/1Rut5wZ"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:21:20.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
