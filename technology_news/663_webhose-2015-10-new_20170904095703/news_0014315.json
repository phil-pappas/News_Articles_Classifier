CannaRegs will have 60 seconds to convince the judges that it should be awarded a coveted table in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt in London or New York. CannaRegs’ inclusion in the Denver event may signal a change in approach for the vaunted startup launching pad.\nCannabis companies have encountered difficulties at prior TechCrunch conferences. No such company has ever won Disrupt. One cannabis-related company claims it won the popular vote at last year’s Disrupt, but was not advanced to the Startup Battlefield. Additionally, last week, a cannabis-related company advanced to the final round at Disrupt in San Francisco, although they did not take home the top prize. Now, CannaRegs has its chance to compete for a spot at the main TechCrunch Disrupt conference.\nCannaRegs is a perfect example of disruptive technology in the cannabis industry. It changes the way cannabis businesses access the cumbersome and ever-changing government rules and regulations that must be followed. Instead of hiring expensive lawyers or wading through endless regulations, CannaRegs subscribers can find the specific information they need in just a few easy clicks. CannaRegs also keeps its users up-to-date on any changes to the rules relevant to them and provides rare and unpublished content, such as a database of business violation reports.\n“We are honored to compete at this year’s event, and we are thrilled that cannabis startups are finally getting the recognition they deserve,” says CannaRegs Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Amanda Ostrowitz.\nThe TechCrunch Disrupt Pitch-Off will take place at 6 p.m. on Oct. 1 at 1644 Platte Street in Denver.\n-###-\nCannaRegs is a web-based subscription service that provides enhanced access to cannabis rules and regulations.
