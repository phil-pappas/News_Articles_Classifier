For every person who sends a picture to CrowdChange through Snapchat, text or email, the company or one of its marketing partners is donating $1 to a charity of their chapter's choice. The members of the chapters themselves are also rewarded.  For example, when 50 people send in a picture on behalf of a specific chapter, all of the students in that chapter earn $50 off a pair of sunglasses from Waveborn, a high-quality sunglasses company. \"One person told us that CrowdChange has created the 'picture perfect' way to make charity cool. We've tried to make raising money for charity both easy and fun\", according to CrowdChange's Founder & CEO, Russell Citron .  \n\"It's fun for the students, it helps good causes, but it also creates value for our marketing sponsors.  The program provides sponsors with a platform to speak directly to large groups of students with targeted messages, and provides students with incentives to purchase their product.  CrowdChange also offers modern social media activity that further enhances the engagements.\"\nMany companies make charitable donations to good causes.  Many companies also invest a significant amount of their marketing dollars to target students.  What CrowdChange has done is marry the two of them.  \nFraternity and sorority students are often portrayed in movies as being interested only in parties.  The reality is that millennials over-index in caring about social causes.  They don't necessarily have the deep pockets, but they do have the energy and the ability to raise funds for causes they care about.  This is particularly so with platforms such as CrowdChange, when the fundraising is both exciting and easy.\nCrowdChange launched its beta test two weeks ago with a chapter at The University of Florida.  It has since gained thousands of followers on its Snapchat account.  The program is currently launching with more than 100 chapters throughout North America .\nDownload CrowdChange for free on iOS or Android .\n\nSOURCE CrowdChange Inc.\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.crowdchangeapp.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:32:11.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
