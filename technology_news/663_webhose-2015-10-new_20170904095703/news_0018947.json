The company and its competitors -- Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. -- are producing more than enough chips to meet lackluster demand, causing prices to fall. Investors may use the company’s outlook as a bellwether for reports by larger U.S. and global technology companies later this month.\nMicron shares rose as much as 7.7 percent in extended trading. They had earlier fallen 1.4 percent to $14.77 at the close in New York.\nMicron is the largest remaining U.S.-based maker of computer memory, also known as dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips.
