The mobile devices were being shipped in the United States by FedEx. \nProsecutors say the FedEx workers used fake corporate shipping accounts to print labels. Prosecutors say the workers placed those labels on boxes of wireless devices, and the boxes were then sent to co-conspirators in New York and other places. Each box contained thousands of dollars' worth of devices. \nThe defendants are charged with interstate shipping theft and conspiracy.
