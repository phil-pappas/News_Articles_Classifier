This changing landscape is creating a large number of opportunities as well as some additional challenges, resulting in a high level of new business activity alongside an increased investment pipeline. As noted in the interim report, the increased competition within the customer base may lead to further closures and consolidations, and whilst similar levels of growth to those seen in the first half are anticipated for the year as a whole, this may result in a higher level of headwind into 2016.\nLooking ahead, Fidessa believes that it is entering a period where significant opportunity is returning to the markets. Further strong progress with the multi-asset initiative is expected and Fidessa will continue its research into the rates segment of the fixed income market, although no decision has yet been made to provide support for this asset class. Fidessa remains excited by the potential for its service-based offerings across all asset classes and believes that there are increasingly few vendors capable of meeting customers' business requirements whilst also having the scale and infrastructure necessary to handle the latest compliance demands being made by the regulators. Fidessa believes that it will continue to play an increasingly important role as customers focus on efficiency, transparency, compliance and performance, and expects that as markets stabilise it will see a return to growth rates similar to those seen in the past.\nFidessa continues to have a strong balance sheet with strong reserves, no debt and substantial levels of recurring revenue. Strong cash generation has continued through the period and Fidessa expects to be able to announce a further special dividend with its preliminary results in February 2016 . Furthermore, Fidessa does not currently believe that an investment in providing support for the fixed income asset class is likely to have a material impact on its ability to pay further special dividends in the future.\nEnquiries:\nChris Aspinwall, Chief Executive Edward Bridges Andy Malpass, Finance Director FTI Consulting LLP www.fidessa.com Tel: +44 (0) 20 3727 1000 Tel: +44 (0) 20 7105 1000 Email: [email protected] About Fidessa group\nExceptional trading, investment and information solutions for the world’s financial community.\nNew technology, new regulation, new challenges: making money in today’s financial markets is all about staying ahead of the curve.
