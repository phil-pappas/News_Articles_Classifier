But there’s still no clarity on how the sum will be divided and whether it will be sufficient.\nMr Patton added that the cost burden of the scheme was almost certain to slug consumers.\n“The government’s budgeted amount is well below the likely total costs for the industry and that means that consumers will eventually pay more in internet access fees,” he said.\n“It’s extraordinary that an act of this complexity is due to come into effect before anyone knows how much they will receive to cover their costs of compliance.\n“International experience has found that data retention is of limited, if any, value in the fight against terrorism, which was the government’s reason for the act.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/quick-review-sought-for-data-retention-act/story-e6frgakx-1227566540591"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:12:41.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
