Twitter is preparing to open up Twitter Amplify to any publisher who wants to make money on the videos it posts to the microblogging site. More than 200 publishers, sports leagues and TV networks in 20 countries have joined Twitter Amplify to monetize their video content since the service launched two years ago. Up until now, advertisers have had to forge direct deals with publishers like the NFL, MTV and Fox Sports to participate. Twitter is now expanding the program to a beta test in the U.S. so that any publisher can make money off their videos with preroll ads. New Amplify publishers include Sports Illustrated, AOL, Vox Media, Maker Studios and Fullscreen. Publishers like the NFL that want full control over which brands buy ads can continue to sell them through their own sales reps. Or publishers can use Twitter's ad-targeting technology to serve ads. To make a media buy, brands choose the type of content and demographic they want to run their ads against. Twitter's technology then plugs their ads into videos that people are watching. The Twitter Amplify announcement is part of an event Twitter is hosting today in New York to talk all things video, which is likely going to include more information about how its livestreaming app Periscope and Vine fit into bigger marketing plans for brands and agencies.
