Matsui (D-CA) entered into the Congressional Record her statement recognizing the third annual International Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW), to be celebrated October 11-17. IPAW is sponsored by the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) and its member companies, and is designed to: Raise global awareness about plasma donation Recognize the contributions of plasma donors in saving and improving lives Increase understanding about lifesaving plasma protein therapies and rare diseases \nPlasma protein therapies , which include plasma-derived therapies and recombinant analogs, are used to treat chronic, life-threatening diseases including bleeding disorders, primary immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and certain rare neurological disorders. In addition, these therapies are used in emergency and surgical medicine. \nPPTA applauds Congresswoman Matsui for her continued support of the plasma protein therapeutics industry and its patients. She is a longtime champion of rare diseases and access to care issues, with an important focus on Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PIDD) patients. Rep. Matsui co-authored and advocated for the passage of the Medicare IVIG Access Act, which allows PIDD patients to receive life-saving therapies in their homes. \n\"The Source plasma industry appreciates Congresswoman Matsui's continued support of patient access to plasma protein therapies. Her recognition of the lifesaving role of source plasma donors to help patients live productive lives is exemplified in today's Statement,\" said Joshua Penrod , PPTA Vice President, Source and International Affairs. \nCongresswoman Matsui's statement in recognition of IPAW is important in creating awareness of the life-saving gift of plasma protein therapies.
