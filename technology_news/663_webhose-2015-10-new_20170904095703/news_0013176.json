Arrow was recognized, along with other Colorado-based organizations, at the 16 th annual Environmental Leadership Awards held at the Wings over the Rockies Museum. \nThe awards recognize Colorado organizations with gold, silver and bronze designations for voluntarily going beyond compliance with state and federal regulations and for their commitment to continual environmental improvements. Arrow’s Value Recovery business is one of 12 new companies designated a Gold Leader this year. \n“Arrow’s Value Recovery business kept an estimated 54 million metric tons of e-waste out of landfills last year because we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously,” said Mark Majeske, president of Arrow’s global reverse logistics business. “Arrow is honored to receive this Gold Leader designation from the Colorado Environmental Leadership Program.” \nArrow’s Value Recovery business works with its customers to securely refurbish computers, tablets, smartphones and other electronic devices for additional use, or repurpose their still-valuable component parts for other uses. Whenever possible, Arrow emphasizes extending the life of these devices by selling them, redeploying them within organizations or donating them. Arrow has been recognized as a global leader for its value recovery work by the independent information technology research and advisory firm Gartner. \n“We are proud to recognize all of Colorado’s environmental leaders today, including Arrow Electronics,” said Lynette Myers, Environmental Leadership Program coordinator at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. \nAbout Arrow Electronics \nArrow Electronics ( www.arrow.com ) is a global provider of products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions.
