The slow-growth U.S. economy that we've seen during the past several years cannot be further challenged by the fiscal instability that default would bring. This is an opportunity for government to lead, and to instill some certainty and stability into our economy that will help to build business confidence over the long-term. Failure to act could mean severe consequences to the U.S. economy and our workers, further erode the country's credit position, and unnecessarily rattle already fragile financial markets around the world. We must act now.\" \nMedia Contact", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:45:11.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
