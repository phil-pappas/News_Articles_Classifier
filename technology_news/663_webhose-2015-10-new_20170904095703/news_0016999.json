The program recognizes the best employers in New York City based on data supplied by a contracted independent research firm Best Companies Group. Companies selected for the list are given a ranking based on their benefit to the city's economy, workforce and other businesses. This year's list is comprised of 100 companies and appears on www.crainsnewyork.com . \"Foothold Technology is dedicated to transforming the way human service organizations operate. Our customers perform essential services and it's our goal to create a working environment in which those organizations are liberated from the constraints of information management, and are free to focus on their missions,\" says Foothold Technology co-founder Nick Scharlatt . \"The core of our company is our staff and they are the driving force behind our success.  Our dedicated team is committed to acting with integrity, responsibility and a profound respect for the work of our clients. We work hard, but like to have fun, too. Whether we're planting a garden at a public school or rating our favorite sandwiches on summer Fridays, we are driven to make Foothold a place we're all proud to work. One of our most important policies is 'No Gossip.' In our minds, gossip is a poison that rots a company's morale from the inside, creating factions and outgroups. Our No Gossip policy has yielded a company where everyone knows where they stand and to whom they go to resolve issues.\"\nMore than 900 agencies nationwide count on Foothold's AWARDS software to manage their services, including Mental Health, Alcohol & Substance Abuse, Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities, Homeless & Housing, Employment & Training, Seniors, Veterans, Youth & Family, and more.
