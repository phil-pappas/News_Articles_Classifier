The Philadelphia-based company said the move would also improve the trading liquidity of its publicly traded stock.\nComcast plans to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the reclassification. Shareholders of record on Oct. 20 are entitled to vote at the special meeting.\nShares of Comcast shed 9 cents to $61.89 in light premarket trading.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-26T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:51:39.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
