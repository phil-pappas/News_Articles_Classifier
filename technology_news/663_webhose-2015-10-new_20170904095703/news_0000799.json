After co-founding Twitter in 2006 and serving a previous two-year stint as CEO, Dorsey returned to the top job last week. His first moves: slashing staff and touting new features intended to draw in more users. \nDorsey clearly aims to follow in the footsteps of Apple's Steve Jobs, who returned 12 years after his 1985 ouster to lead a legendary corporate revival. But not all companies can be Apple, and not all boomerang founders can be Jobs. \n____ \nSTEVE JOBS, APPLE \nAny such list has to start with Jobs, who was famously forced out of Apple nine years after he and Steve Wozniak launched the company. Apple's board wooed Jobs back in 1997 as it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. \nJobs oversaw a series of blockbuster new products, including the iPod, iTunes and the revolutionary iPhone. The latter now brings in nearly two thirds of Apple's annual revenue, which rose above $180 billion last year. \n___ \nJERRY YANG, YAHOO \nAfter co-founding the Internet company with David Filo in 1994, Yang handed the reins to \"professional\" managers in the mid-1990s. But the company was later eclipsed by Google. Yang returned as CEO in 2007—and was gone again two years later. \nTrue, he fought off a takeover bid from Microsoft and made a $1 billion investment in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba—one valued at more than $49 billion last year. But Yang wasn't able to reignite Yahoo's growth, a problem his successors haven't solved, either. \n___ \nMARK PINCUS, ZYNGA \nZynga, which Pincus launched in 2007, soared thanks to its popular Facebook-based games like Farmville. Then Facebook opened the doors to rivals, and Zynga's fortunes went south. \nPincus stepped down as CEO in 2013, then reclaimed the top job earlier this year. Zynga's still on a roller coaster; Pincus has cut staff and scrambled to roll out new games for mobile phones. \n___ \nMICHAEL DELL, DELL \nMichael Dell famously launched what became the world's largest personal-computer company from his dorm room in 1984. He stepped down as CEO in 2004, but returned to the top job in 2007 as PC sales slumped. \nSince then, Dell has taken his namesake company private and is remaking it as a seller of computer hardware and software for business. This week, Dell said it's buying business computing giant EMC Inc. in a blockbuster deal valued at $67 billion. Zynga founder Pincus leaving operations role April 23, 2014 \nOnline game maker Zynga says company founder Mark Pincus is stepping down as chief product officer, less than a year after he was replaced as the company's CEO. Gaming group Zynga brings founder back as CEO April 8, 2015 \nZynga, the struggling social gaming group, announced Wednesday that co-founder Mark Pincus would return as top executive, less than two years after being replaced. Zynga's new game: cut costs, jobs May 6, 2015 \nZynga said Wednesday it was cutting staff by 18 percent amid ongoing losses, as the social games pioneer seeks to reboot its strategy. Report: Twitter founder Jack Dorsey to be CEO for second time September 30, 2015 \nTwitter may be about to end its three-month search for a new CEO where it started: with once-ousted co-founder Jack Dorsey running the short-messaging service.
