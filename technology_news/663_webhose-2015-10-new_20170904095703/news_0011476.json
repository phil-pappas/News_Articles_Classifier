It is rare that such rugby and human expertise is demonstrated by the primary match official, in such an important game.\nCongratulations, Sir, for ensuring that it remained always a fair contest, and that the Lions were not disadvantaged by the clear attempts to cheat by the Cheetah's, especially when deliberately collapsing their own attacking scrum, when they only had six forwards on the field. You have, indeed, been blessed with a keen eye for fairness, the insight to determine what constitutes an even contest, and a mind for what the paying rugby public desires to see happen on the field. I reckon no side could have any complaints about your wonderful performance today, for surely there can certainly be no criticisms that the ref played any part in the final result.\nMy only question, is how come you have been overlooked for the 2015 RWC referee panel? Oh well, I guess their mistake, is our good fortune. We can only hope the 'Boks get a similarly discerning referee in their quarter against Wales, who will take a leaf out of your book and leave his big personality at home, for the benefit of the game.\nWell done, once again! I wonder which mayor will approach you first for a very well deserved 'Freedom of the City' award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:53:00.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
