A patent application published this week describes an interactive ring that could work in conjunction with other devices such as a phone.\nApple says it could feature a touchpad or touchscreen, which would be worn on the index finger and be controlled using the thumb.\nThe firm says it could include a microphone for dictating commands, as well as built-in vibration to let the wearer know that something has happened.\nNot all of Apple's patents end up on the production line\nThe filing suggests the ring could even be able to determine what you're writing by following the motion of your hand.\nApple says current generation touchscreen devices \"may be cumbersome, inconvenient, or inefficient for certain tasks and applications\".\nIt said the ring could also have a use as a personal safety tool.\nThe patent filing said: \"The light emitted by a touchscreen may be inappropriate in certain social environments or even dangerous if it gives away the position of a threatened user.\n\"A need therefore exists for a more discreet, safer, more efficient, or more ergonomic way to interact with touch pads or touch screens.\"\nLike most companies, most of Apple's patents never make it to the production line, but it's still an interesting look at the directions Apple is exploring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:16:31.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
