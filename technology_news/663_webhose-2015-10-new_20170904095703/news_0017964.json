In recent years, the spotlight has been on the cloud, wearable technology, IoT applications, network devices, and semiconductors, as ICT companies compete for business opportunities in the wake of the Internet of Things (IoT). In 2016, COMPUTEX will debut two new exhibits, SmarTEX and InnoVEX. These two exhibits will focus on networking technology and applications and offer a stage for startups and teams all around the world to display their new ideas and attract international investors. SmarTEX will showcase the 6 major applications of IoT—security, smart home and entertainment, wearable technology, automotive electronics, 3D printing, and smart solutions. Domestic and overseas exhibitors will display trending products. The organizers will also invite global system integration providers to visit this area, which will be located in TWTC Exhibition Hall 1. InnoVEX is designed as a “startup village” in TWTC Exhibition Hall 3. In addition to out-of-the-box, open booths and conference spaces, InnoVEX also features forums, seminars, and business networking to satisfy every startup’s needs, including investor matchmaking. The tiny companies of today may become household brands of the future. COMPUTEX wants to introduce startups to international buyers and venture capitalists. Other areas of the exhibition include Systems & Solutions, Smart Business, and Embedded & Smart Manufacturing.
