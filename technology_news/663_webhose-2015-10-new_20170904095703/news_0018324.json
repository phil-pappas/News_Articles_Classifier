In light of this decision, U.S. companies that have been relying on the Safe Harbor framework should immediately take steps to (1) ensure and document their compliance with current safe harbor requirements and (2) implement an alternative method — likely a contractual arrangement — to lawfully permit the flow of personal data from the EU to the U.S. \nWhat the Decision Means to Businesses \nUntil now, there were four methods for complying with EU data privacy laws for EU to U.S. data transfers: Consent of the individual Model contracts with standard contractual clauses Binding Corporate Rules \nWith the Safe Harbor invalidated and due to the complexities and lengthy time delays associated with relying on consent and Binding Corporate Rules, most U.S. companies will likely rely on putting model contracts with standard contractual clauses (model contracts) in place. The model contracts have been approved by the European Commission as providing adequate contractual protection to ensure the privacy rights of individuals are respected as required by EU privacy law. While the European Court of Justice’s ruling could be used by individuals to challenge the validity of transfers based on model contracts, for the time being at least, model contracts remain a viable method for complying with EU’s privacy laws. \n— whether affiliated or non-affiliated — that send personal information to the U.S. to get the contractual protections under the model contracts in place. \n’s decision. \nation. The European Commission had ruled that U.S. law does not adequately protect personal information to the same extent as required under EU law. This led to the agreement and decision in 2000 approving the Safe Harbor framework pursuant to which U.S. companies could self-certify as to compliance with the Safe Harbor framework and principles, thereby permitting companies in the EU to transfer personal information to Safe Harbor certified companies in the U.S. \n’s PRISM program, U.S. governmental authorities were able to access personal data transferred from the EU to the U.S., and use it for purposes incompatible with the purposes for which it was originally transferred, beyond what was strictly necessary and proportionate to the protection of national security. The Court further noted that the individuals had no administrative or judicial means of redress enabling, in particular, the data relating to them to be accessed and, as the case may be, corrected or deleted. \nThe ECJ ruled that under EU law, U.S. law permitted general storage of all the personal data of all the individuals whose data is transferred from the EU to the U.S. without any differentiation, limitation or exception being made in the light of the objective pursued; and without an objective criterion for determining the limits of the access of the governmental authorities to the data and of its subsequent use. Thus, the access available to U.S. law enforcement agencies was inconsistent with the EUs fundamental rights to respect for private life. \nBased on these finding, the ECJ declared the Commission decision in 2000 approving the Safe Harbor framework invalid. The case began when Maximillian Schrems, an Austrian resident and Facebook subscriber, complained that Facebook improperly transferred his personal information from Ireland to the U.S., notwithstanding Facebooks certification under the Safe Harbor framework. The decision has the practical effect of requiring the Irish data protection authority to examine Mr. Schrems’ complaint and to decide whether the transfer of the data of Facebook’s European subscribers to the United States should be suspended on the basis that the U.S. does not afford an adequate level of protection of personal data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:50:38.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
