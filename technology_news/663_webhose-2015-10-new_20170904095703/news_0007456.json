This mobile app accolade was awarded by Clutch, an independent research company who identifies leading software service companies who deliver top results for their clients. Clutch recognizes industry leaders through a combination of traditional B2B research methodology and extensive consumer reviews. Affirma's Clutch consulting profile can be found at: https://clutch.co/profile/affirma-consulting . \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275736 \nAffirma received a rating of 'Excellent' in both the categories of 'Market Presence' and 'References.' To qualify, a company must exhibit a keen focus on mobile app development as a critical part of their business and also possess proven project results. A Microsoft partner commented on their relationship with Affirma during a recent project, \"Affirma consistently engages its clients at the business strategy level helping them to solve strategic business problems, and in the process, delivering a rapid return on investment that is mandatory in today's economy.\" \nAffirma recently created a unique mobile app for Advantage WayPoint , a national company who offers both sales and marketing services to clients in the food service industry. Types of Advantage WayPoint's expert support include: menu or recipe development, distribution coordination, interpreting sales data in real time, and fulfilling order placements. Advantage WayPoint needed to transfer all data from their current web portal into functional Android and iOS apps. These mobile apps needed to include a large database of distributor, operator, and sales associate information, but also be creatively interactive. Affirma enabled barcode scanners so sales associates could order product samples at any time. The scanners had direct access to Advantage WayPoint's extensive database, so detailed product information and images could be accessible in real time on the sales floor. \nAffirma is established as a reliable firm, focused on innovative mobile app solutions across various industries. Its proven ability to deliver results while sustaining excellent customer satisfaction are the key components that make Affirma a market leader in app development. \nAffirma is an award-winning full service technology consultancy based out of Bellevue, WA.
