He is now looking for someone who will support his idea a local publication reported Monday. \nAhmed's father Mohammed said that his son uses all his spare time to make various devices. 'We find it difficult to work out when he is playing and when he is not.' \nMohammed said that Ahmed once objected when his mother took ice cream sticks from his bedroom because he had been using them for over a year to build a house. \nAhmed said that the clock he made consisted of items he had collected that no one else wanted including old phones televisions and pagers. 'It was easy to make' he said. He has 13 other inventions that he hopes would be made into products. \nAhmed's treatment caused a media storm in the United States with President Barak Obama and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg supporting him. He has received offers to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and offered jobs by Google and Twitter. \nMicrosoft sent him a computer and printer; and a company that previously rejected his inventions and wanted him to pay them 10000 to develop his idea now wants him to work for them according to the report. \nMohammed said the family was shocked when Ahmed was arrested because America is supposed to encourage scientists and scholars. It appeared Ahmed was singled out because of the prejudice that still prevails against Islam and Muslims he said. \nThe young inventor has a hobby of fixing electronic gadgets for his friends and teachers. He made a remote control mechanism to switch off a projector. He also helped his older sister with items needed for her medical engineering studies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:08:32.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
