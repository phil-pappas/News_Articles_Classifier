This revolutionary emotion tracker is for users and their family, assuring their loved one’s safety around the clock. ForceEmotion is designed to silently keep track of what its owner feels – therefore it picks up even the subtlest mood swings. Its technological sensors make it possible for the device to recognize an increase in emotional tension, to track swings in the level of stress as well as changes in the heart rate. With the free app, users can monitor the measurements of those parameters and compare the person’s current state of emotion with the parameters they had in the past or ordinary, balanced level of emotion. \nForceEmotion has equipped their device with a fall-down sensor. If a device owner happens to fall down for whatever reason, a user will immediately receive a notification about it and will be able to react in a timely manner. It’s also completely waterproof and includes a panic button and a GPS – providing safety twenty-fours a day. It also can go a week without charging. However, before everyone can use this incredible emotion tracker, ForceEmotion needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $30,000 by November 6, 2015. The funds raised will go towards marketing, patents, and production. \nTo help bring this innovative monitor to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered by December 2015 and January 2017. \nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help ForceEmotion reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive. \nPhone: 38 (050) 442 27 5538 (099) 731 96 73", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:04:04.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
