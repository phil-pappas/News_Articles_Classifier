It now expects to achieve revenues of between $690 and $724 million (an increase to the upper end of the range of $14 million or 1.97%) and Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of between $3.73 and $4.13 (an increase in the upper end of the range of $0.16 or 4.03%). Due to the timing and nature of the recent acquisition activity, most of the financial impact of these acquisitions during 2015 will be realized in the fourth quarter. \nAs previously noted, Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2015 excludes share-based compensation of between $11 and $12 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the impact of any other currently unanticipated items, in each case net of tax. \nIt is anticipated that the normalized tax rate for 2015 (excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results) will be at the higher end of the previously provided range of between 27 and 29%. \nAbout j2 Global \nj2 Global, Inc. provides Internet services through two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media.

These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These factors and uncertainties include, among other items: the Company's ability to grow fax and non-fax revenues, profitability and cash flows; the Company's ability to identify, close and successfully transition and integrate acquisitions; subscriber growth and retention; variability of the Company's revenue based on changing conditions in particular industries and the economy generally; protection of the Company's proprietary technology or infringement by the Company of intellectual property of others; the risk of adverse changes in the U.S. or international regulatory environments, including but not limited to the imposition or increase of taxes or regulatory-related fees; and the numerous other factors set forth in j2 Global's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The forward-looking statements provided in this press release and particularly those contained in Hemi Zucker's and Scott Turicchi’s quotes and the “Business Outlook” portion regarding the Company's expected fiscal 2015 financial performance are based on limited information available to the Company at this time, which is subject to change. Although management's expectations may change after the date of this press release, the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update these statements. \nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nAs used is this Press Release, Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for 2015 excludes share-based compensation of between $11 and $12 million, amortization of acquired patents and other intangibles, acquisition-related integration costs, interests costs in excess of the coupon rate associated with convertible notes of the company, and the impact of any other currently unanticipated items, in each case net of tax. \nWe use Adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these Adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these Adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These Adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. We believe these Adjusted Non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. However, the presentation of Non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
