(Photo: Universal Pictures)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE LOS ANGELES - It’s no surprise that Steve Jobs widow didn’t want to see the new film about the late Apple co-founder get made.\nIn Steve Jobs , which stars Michael Fassbender, he is portrayed as a ruthless, unsympathetic monster. It’s writer Aaron Sorkin’s version of A Christmas Carol , with Jobs as Scrooge, at three key product launches, as his consciences come to visit him right before he goes on stage.\nThey include the daughter he initially claimed wasn’t his, Lisa, John Scully, the man who fired Jobs from Apple, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Andy Hertzfeld, an engineer who helped create the first Macintosh computer.\nAs a film, Steve Jobs is entertaining, fascinating to watch and tough. The Jobs here has little redeeming qualities, as he barks at folks and treats them horribly.\nBy all accounts, Jobs was said to be insanely tough to work for--but also inspiring. Those parts are missing from the film.\nBut I’m more concerned about the missing truths.\nMany folks get their history lessons from watching movies like this. I loved the Social Network , which was also written by Sorkin, and assumed the story of the college kid who stole an idea for a new website from two rich twins and drove it to amazing success was the true story of Facebook.\nBut who knows?\nIn the Jobs film, Sorkin has said his goal was to paint a portrait of what Jobs was like--so once you get past the basics--the daughter he didn’t initially acknowledge, his fights with ex-girlfriend Chrisann and that he launched the Mac, NeXt computer and the iMac--you get lots of invented words and situations that probably never happened.\nOne day, someone will make the definitive film of the adopted kid and nerd from Cupertino who went on to change the world with the personal computer and most beloved consumer device of our lifetimes--the iPhone.\nThe new Steve Jobs movie isn’t it.\nSTITCHER\nSteve Jobs movie review - he's a monster from USA TODAY TalkingTech\nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist and #TalkingTech host Jefferson Graham on Twitter, where he's @jeffersongraham , and listen to his daily audio tech reports on TuneIn, iTunes and Stitcher.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1LkdvmQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540730178001_video-still-for-video-4540693595001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540730174001_thumbnail-for-video-4540693595001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798284365753944-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-DCB-74914270-1-.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540730178001_video-still-for-video-4540693595001.jpg", "http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/usa-today/talking-tech/e/steve-jobs-movie-review-hes-a-monster-40763798", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LkdvmQ&text=Steve%20Jobs%20movie%20great%20film%2C%20but%20much%20truth%20left%20out&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4540730178001_video-still-for-video-4540693595001.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LkdvmQ", "http://twitter.com/jeffersongraham", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b0a390367608d96dde7695f23077e449ab1b6d0e/r=500x207/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798284365753944-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-DCB-74914270-1-.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1Rw9Lzo", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LkdvmQ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/502f2e956f52b25a5b46950cfc41c11aed5d74b5/c=156-0-2144-1495&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798284365753944-XXX-STEVE-JOBS-MOV-DCB-74914270-1-.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56a981eff38774468cd6ba241dd4b0b3c54c54ca/r=300/http/ec-cdn-assets.stitcher.com/episodeimages/480x270_40763798.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:57:45.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
