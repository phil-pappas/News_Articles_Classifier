Our team is looking for a talented process chemical engineer with great problem-solving skills and extensive experience of developing processes to take novel chemistry & materials from laboratory to industry. \nTo thrive in this project, you’ll need to be resourceful and creative, with the ability to work closely with our team of research chemists. You will need expert knowledge of industrial processes in polymer synthesis, post-processing and handling. You will benefit from the ability to apply process engineering principles to scale-up and cost-optimisation, for the production & purification of fine chemicals and polymers. \nProject Scope \nYour primary responsibility within this exciting and challenging project will be to develop and validate the process engineering required for production of our catalysts, translating lab-based chemistry to industrially and economically viable solutions. \nYou will work closely with our research team, external consultants, potential customers and suppliers, to ensure both a robust & efficient process to manufacture our catalysts, whilst enabling novel Econic catalyst technologies to be deployed by our customers. \nSuccessful delivery of this first commercialisation project will create the foundation for future novel catalyst development and its adoption by industry. \nKey tasks within this project will include: Assess of the industrial process engineering requirements of potential customers in order to define relevant process conditions for viable Econic catalyst use. Develop process engineering options, tested at lab and pilot scale, for effective use of our catalysts in polymer production to validate their industrial viability. Develop process engineering solutions, tested at lab and pilot scale, for effective purification and isolation of materials to validate industrial viability of the products made using Econic catalysts. Establish the protocols and technical data packages to meet the technical and regulatory needs of customers, and to assure efficient & safe use of Econic catalysts. Establish process cost models based on use of Econic catalysts to enable cost comparison both between generations of catalyst and with existing or competitive production process alternatives. Work with toll manufacturing partners to develop, understand and validate a robust commercial scale catalyst manufacturing process. Validate full process economics for the manufacture of our catalysts to support a value chain assessment and to assure toll manufacturing terms which are preferential to Econic. Documenting and capturing all project work and outcomes in a clear, organised and comprehensive manner. \nExperience Process Engineer with 5 years or more of industry experience, including concept development & scale-up of new processes in the (relevant) fine chemical or materials areas. At least a 2:1 or 1st class degree in chemical engineering or equivalent. Experience in prioritising, planning, monitoring and managing different work streams. Experience with customer- and supplier-facing interactions, including the ability to identify and work with third parties to develop and validate unit operations. \nSkills Practical lab and/or pilot plant skills to design and test engineering options, either in-house or through third parties, along with excellent analytical skills. Ability to generate & analyse reliable scientific/engineering data A passion for innovation and problem solving, along with the ability to work independently with minimal expert guidance. The ability to communicate effectively in both spoken & written form, across cultural and organisational boundaries, to build excellent working relationships both internally and externally. \nEligibility and Expectations In order to qualify for this position you will need to be authorised to live and work in the UK and able to occasionally travel to other countries in Europe and globally. You must have respect for others and a commitment and enthusiasm for high standards and continuous improvement. At Econic Technologies we value diversity. We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome employees who meet the requirements of the job, regardless of gender, ethnic origin, disability, age, religion or sexual orientation. \nThis is a full time position, with a 3-month probationary period.The salary range is £40,000 - £50,000 per annum, depending on experience.To apply for this role please send your CV with a cover letter to: jobs@econic-technologies.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:49:08.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
