Ice that calves off the Columbia Glacier near Valdez has to travel farther to reach shipping lanes because the glacier has receded more than 10 miles since 1980, according to the report prepared for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. The longer distance to Prince William Sound means icebergs have more opportunity to shrink from melting and fracturing. The citizen's council was created in the aftermath of the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker that struck Bligh Reef on March 24, 1989. The crew of the Exxon Valdez had received permission to stray from shipping lanes to avoid Columbia Glacier ice. The trans-Alaska pipeline these days carries an average of 496,571 barrels of Alaska North Slope crude oil per day. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:25:30.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
