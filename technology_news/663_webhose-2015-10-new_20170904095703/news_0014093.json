RIVA Audio, the lifestyle brand of Audio Design Experts, Inc. (ADX™), recognized for its best-in-class audio products, announced the availability to purchase its newest Bluetooth® Wireless mobile speaker the RIVA S. With innovative new functions like TrueWireless™ technology that allows for a true stereo speaker arrangement, best-in-class audio performance from the proprietary Trillium™ technology employing ADX audio drivers, and numerous other features like high-quality speakerphone and Charge Out functions, the RIVA S is designed to amaze. This revolutionary Bluetooth® mobile speaker delivers an unmatched personal entertainment system that perfectly compliments on-the-go modern lifestyles for awesome audio anywhere. Thanks to the high-quality battery, the RIVA S will last up to an impressive 13+ hours at 73db, and 5+ hours at the single speaker's maximum 94+dB output, giving you a full day's worth of audio at the beach, in the backyard or around the house. That portability can even include the pool—the speaker is certified with an IPX4 rating that means it is fully water resistant and can take splashes from any direction. And now with TrueWireless™, you can take your sound to the next level by syncing two RIVA S speakers together to create true left and right channel stereo imaging—for when you want that Hi-Fi experience in a more portable location.\nRIVA Audio continues to utilize ADX's proprietary Trillium audio technology to deliver immersive, high quality sound. The unique Trillium audio processing enlarges the audio image while reproducing the power of the audio signal without excessive compression. Trillium Surround will further enhance the audio-visual experience of music, movies, videos games, TV and more.\n\"The RIVA S is designed to amaze!\" said Rikki Farr , RIVA Audio and ADX Chairman and Chief Creative Officer. \"RIVA S delivers clarity and separation that are audible from all the instruments and voices playing, allowing you to hear the true bass, all the drums, the passion, the nuance, the expression of words and all that was so carefully put together in the recording studio. We also included in the package everything necessary for traveling the world or visiting your next-door neighbor. There are no extras to be bought; in fact, we have even included a unique phono EQ mode that allows you to play your vinyl, a world's first. When seen against comparable products for the sound, the features and the accessories, RIVA S is fully loaded and therefore unrivaled.\"\nThe RIVA S delivers unparalleled audio quality as a result of its 3 full-range, custom, 40mm ADX drivers and 4 custom dual-piston bass radiators all powered with a best-in-class 30-Watts amplifier. Bluetooth® wireless sound quality is improved further through the addition of AptX® technology. The speaker is also packed with unique and convenient features like a dual-microphone speakerphone with noise and echo cancellation processing technology for crystal clear conference calls, and a USB Charge Out allows you to recharge your mobile devices when you're away from a wired outlet. While RIVA Audio includes unique Capacitive Touch controls to make it easy to operate the speaker in the dark, the RIVA Audio mobile app allows the user to manage the entire listening experience from a phone or tablet. Available for iOS or Android™, the RIVA Audio app is available for free from the App Store SM or Google Play™.\nIt's no wonder the 2015 RIVA S, like the Turbo X in 2014, was named a 2015 CES Innovations Award Honoree. RIVA S is available for purchase in November in the U.S. at www.rivaaudio.com for $249.99 . It will also be available at select authorized RIVA dealers including Amazon, Crutchfield and BestBuy.com.\n|About RIVA Audio|\nRIVA Audio was born from a simple yet powerful idea: That legendary audio guru Rikki Farr (Chairman of ADX) coupled with passionate designers, patent awarded engineers, pioneering rock 'n' rollers and leaders from the world of commerce could create a real alternative to much of today's over processed audio.

RIVA is a philosophy, a bold new standard and a defiant rejection of the idea that people can't afford great audio and therefore must accept the bland experience of today's tin-can wireless speakers.
