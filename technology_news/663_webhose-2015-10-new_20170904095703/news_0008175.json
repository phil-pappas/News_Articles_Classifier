All other reagents and organic solvents were of the highest grade available. Synthesis of hydrophobic NaYF 4 nanoparticles doped with Yb/Er \nHydrophobic, lanthanide-doped NaYF 4 nanocrystals were prepared via a modified procedure as reported by Zhang et al . 31 YCl 3 ·6H 2 O (0.78 mmol), YbCl 3 ·6H 2 O (0.20 mmol), and ErCl 3 ·6H 2 O (0.02 mmol) were used for the synthesis, which were dissolved in approximately 5 mL of methanol by sonication. The resulting clear and optically transparent solution of rare earth chlorides in methanol was transferred into a 50 mL flask, mixed with 8 mL of oleic acid and 15 mL of 1-octadecene under an atmosphere of nitrogen and heated to 160 °C. A homogeneous, clear solution was formed after 30 min at 160 °C under vacuum. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 10 mL of methanol containing NaOH (0.25 M) and NH 4 F (0.4 M) was added immediately. The colloidal dispersion was heated to 120 °C and stirred for 30 min. The resulting colloid was refluxed at approximately 325 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the UCLNPs were precipitated by addition of approximately 20 mL of ethanol and isolated via centrifugation at a relative centrifugal force (RCF) of 1000 g for 5 min. The pellet was washed several times by dispersing it in small amounts (approximately 0.5 mL) of chloroform and cyclohexane, followed by precipitation by the addition of a large excess (approximately 15 mL) of ethanol and acetone. A white solid was obtained, which could easily be re-dispersed in cyclohexane to form a clear dispersion. \nSynthesis of the NaYF 4 shell YCl 3 ·6H 2 O (1 mmol) was dissolved in approximately 5 mL of methanol by sonication in a 50 mL flask, and mixed with 8 mL of oleic acid and 15 mL of 1-octadecene. The solution was heated to 160 °C under an atmosphere of nitrogen. A homogeneous, clear solution was formed after 30 min at 160 °C under vacuum. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 80 °C. UCLNPs (ytterbium/erbium (Yb/Er) or ytterbium/thulium (Yb/Tm)) dispersed in cyclohexane were then added and the cyclohexane was evaporated. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then 10 mL of methanol containing NaOH (0.25 M) and NH 4 F (0.4 M) was added immediately. The colloidal dispersion was heated to 120 °C and stirred for 30 min under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The resulting colloid was refluxed at approximately 325 °C for 15 min.

A white solid was obtained, which could be easily re-dispersed in cyclohexane to form a clear dispersion. The size of the obtained monodisperse, hexagonal crystals was approximately 40 nm, which was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Preparation of sensor particles \nTypically, 100 mg of PPSQ was dissolved in 500 µL of chloroform. Then, 10 mg of UCLNPs and 0.5 mg of organic dyes were added and the mixture was homogenized. In the case of magnetic sensor particles, an additional 5 mg of magnetite nanoparticles (EMG1300) were added and mixed thoroughly. After complete removal of the solvent, the blend was sintered for 4 hours in a drying furnace at 230 °C. Finally, the composite material was manually grounded in a mortar until a fine powder was obtained. The microparticles were dispersible in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and water. Luminescence measurements—setup and fitting of the fluorescence spectrophotometer \nFluorescence measurements were performed with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorimeter from Metrohm Inula GmbH (Vienna, Austria, http://www.metrohm.com ) equipped with a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube R9876 (PMT) from Hamamatsu Photonics (Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany, http://www.hamamatsu.com ). A self-made fitting ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) was installed, enabling the excitation with a diode laser. The fitting allows for thermostatted and stirred measurements. A 120 mW laser diode with a peak emission at 980 nm, an NIR interference filter (980 nm, FWHM: 10 nm) from Melles Griot GmbH (Bensheim, Germany, www.cvimellesgriot.com ), and a collimator lens were used for luminescence measurements. \nOxygen partial pressure was adjusted using a gas mixing device of Vögtlin Instruments (Aesch, Switzerland, www.red-y.com ), nitrogen gas, and compressed air. The gas mixing device was triggered by a self-made LabVIEW code. Lifetime measurements \nThe setup ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) consisted of 980 nm CW laser module (200 mW, 130 W cm −2 ) from Picotronic (Koblenz, Germany, www.picotronic.com ) and an optical chopper (MC2000 with two-slot chopper blade MC1F2) from Thorlabs (Dachau, Germany, www.thorlabs.com ). We used optical bandpass filters (FF01-535 and FF01-665/150/25) from Semrock (Rochester, NY, USA, www.semrock.com ) for measuring single emission bands. The signal was amplified using a photomultiplier unit (PMT) from PreSens (Regensburg, Germany, www.presens.com ) and analyzed using a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO 8204) from Voltcraft (Wollerau, Switzerland, www.voltcraft.ch ) in combination with a home-made LabVIEW code. Transmission electron microscopy \nUpconverting nanoparticles have been characterized by TEM studies performed by using a 120 kV Philips CM12 microscope from FEI (Hillsboro, OR, USA, www.fei.com ).
