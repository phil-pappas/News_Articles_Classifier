With the increasing need of eco-friendly and green energy, for example, solar energy and wind energy, the demand for relays is showing tremendous growth in the global market. High capacity power relays are used to cut off safely the high DC voltages used in solar applications. The main reason for cutting the panels includes emergency response, bypassing and maintenance of the panels efficiently. In addition, multi band wireless technology is also an important factor in driving the growth of relays globally. Moreover, smart grids have also created healthy growth in relays market. Rising demand for electricity led to the implementation of smart grids. These grids need to be protected from overload of current or any faults, which is possible if relays are used in the grids.
