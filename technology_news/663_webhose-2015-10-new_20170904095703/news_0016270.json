The fiscal 2014 net loss included $0.02 from discontinued operations and ($0.05) from continued operations.\nTony Otten , CEO of Versar, said, \"We achieved record revenues in fiscal 2015, as we saw increased market demand for our unique service offerings and our proven ability to deliver customized solutions in any environment. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated our continued momentum as evidenced by record revenue growth, margin improvement and enhanced profitability. The Dover Air Force Base contract remains a key driver of our revenue growth and we expect to see strong activity related to that contract through 1Q16 and beyond. Funded backlog remains strong at $179 million and our pipeline is substantial, as recognition of our extensive capabilities, customizable solutions and ability to deliver results in the most challenging circumstances, create more opportunities in the marketplace.\"\n\"Following the close of the quarter, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Johnson Controls Security Systems (JCSS), a leading security systems integrator serving federal and other clients with design, installation and support of complex physical security, network security and facilities management systems. We believe JCSS is a great strategic fit that will allow us to further expand our portfolio of products and services, allowing us to generate more work with existing clients and to more effectively compete for new customers and projects.\"\nIncreased Funded Backlog\nAs of June 26, 2015 , Versar recorded funded backlog of approximately $179 million , an increase of 57% compared to $114 million of funded backlog at the end of fiscal year 2014.\nDuring the quarter, the Company's J.M. Waller subsidiary was awarded a $2.8 million General Services Administration (GSA) contract to provide engineering, program management and support for civil engineering activities at the Air National Guard Readiness Center at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\nAdditionally, the Company's Geo-Marine subsidiary was one of five unrestricted firms awarded a prime contract with a maximum value of $290 million , from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to provide repair and renewal services for government facilities throughout the U.S., U.S. territories, Japan and Korea. The contract has a maximum 24-month base period and three 12-month optional order periods, for a total of five years.\n\"Versar's fiscal 2015 performance benefitted from the full integration of the acquisitions we completed in 2014, which have strengthened our market position by broadening our ability to meet the needs of our existing customers and to win new contracts. As we enter fiscal 2016, we believe we are well positioned for continued growth and profitability,\" Mr. Otten concluded.\nConference Call:\nThe Company will hold a conference call at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Tuesday, September 15 , to discuss the Company's operational performance and financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended June 26 , 2015.\nThe dial in number for the US and Canada is toll free, 877-407-8033.
