Following the success of the ‘My World Global Employee Engagement Survey’ in 2008, 2011 and 2013, DP World enlisted global research and consulting company Towers Watson to conduct the fourth review.\nThe survey gives DP World’s employees and stakeholders an opportunity to express their views in a variety of matters relating to the organisation.\nThese range from corporate and environmental responsibility, communication, customer service diversity, pay and benefits, performance management and career development opportunities.\nThe survey revealed a strong and positive sentiment toward induction and orientation training for new joiners, as well as a continued focus on existing staff to ensure they are adequately prepared to carry out their responsibilities.\nSupporting diversity was another top scorer, highlighting DP World’s effort to  provide a work environment that is accepting of ethnic, gender and religious differences.\nThe survey also revealed that the company could be more proactive in its sustainable  engagement efforts by continuing to focus on specific key drivers of sustainable engagement, such as promoting career development through training and encouraging communication from top management, as well as upholding its focus on providing a working environment that is safe for all.\nSultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman of DP World, said: “Our people are our greatest asset. Their skills, expertise and professionalism lie at the heart of our success over the years and into the future. We believe that employees need to be engaged, enabled and energised to perform, something that needs to be sustained over time.\n“All of us want to work in a healthy environment that promotes well-being and this survey contributes to the way we look after and develop our people. Only by benchmarking employee needs and getting their feedback can we move forward as a global company and the ‘My World’ survey provides valuable insight for us to do that, shaping the direction we take as a business.”\nDP World is working towards a ‘Sustainable Engagement Model’, which argues that it is no longer enough for employees to be engaged for them to perform at the level required, they also need to be enabled and energised. \nDP World believes that enabled employees are those who have the skills and tools to translate their engagement into productivity and energised employees work in a healthy environment that promotes their well-being on a social, physical and emotional level.  \nFor all the latest on DP World, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:23:09.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
