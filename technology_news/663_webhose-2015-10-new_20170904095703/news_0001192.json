This counters widespread speculation the store would be opening in the vast space left vacant when Vox Cinemas moved to the mall’s new third-floor extension.\nTim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, visited the UAE in February, meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.\nMr Cook also toured the Etisalat headquarters.\nIn August, it was reported Apple had been granted exemption from the country’s foreign ownership laws , meaning it retains full ownership of its operations in the UAE.\nAt the same time, The National reported the UAE was a target market for the technology giant.\n“The UAE is an important country for Apple,” said a spokesman. “We launched the Apple Online Store UAE in 2011 and it’s one of our fastest-growing markets around the world.\n“We look forward to opening a physical store in the region and sharing Apple’s unique shopping experience and services that have been incredibly popular around the world, in the near future.”\nnewsdesk@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:35:04.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
