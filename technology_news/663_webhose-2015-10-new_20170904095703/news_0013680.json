The training entitled “Android + iOS: Looking For Solutions” aimed to increase students’ technical capabilities when developing mobile applications, while at the same time busting some myths about the mobile world. Members of Belatrix’s Mobile Lab spoke about the most popular operating systems, their pros and cons, as well as their rapid evolution over the past few years. In addition the fragmentation of the mobile market was discussed, as well as an open discussion about the future of mobile and how best to build a career in the field, whether as a developer or in another position.\nMaría Luz Costa, Talent Acquisition Manager at Belatrix, commented that “In Mendoza and Lima we have a regular presence in the educational sector and strong ties with universities. Belatrix’s innovation centers in Buenos Aires have only recently opened, so we’re just starting to offer our expertise to the community. This initiative is the first of many.” María Luz Costa also shared that Belatrix recently held a major event, the IoT Hackathon – which was a coding marathon held at Palermo University, Buenos Aires. The event brought together the tech community in the region to discuss the emerging world of the Internet of Things.\nAbout Belatrix Software\nBelatrix Software helps clients achieve the full impact of their R&D capabilities developing high quality, innovative software, QA, testing and mobile solutions that enables clients to generate best-in-class software products, decrease time to market, and gain competitive edge.Belatrix's clients include both established Fortune level and emerging, venture backed firms.
