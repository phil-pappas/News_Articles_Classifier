They gave their expertise – adding the engineering for example – and then came back to us.” \n\"Client feedback is very important to us,\" says Damen Shipyards Hardinxveld Managing Director Jos van Woerkum. \"It has been great to work so closely with Delta Marine to develop this new design.\" \n“Damen are very good at developing their vessels,” continues Mr McNaughtan. “Even their established vessels like Multi Cats and Shoalbusters are continually getting better.” \nThe new design, having evolved from a Multi Cat, proves his point: “We have changed the design by moving the wheelhouse forward and leaving the aft deck open. Crucially, we’ve managed to keep it under the 500-tonne mark. \nThis was a critical factor – one that will help keep the costs down.” \nThe Renewables Service Vessel 3315 will be able to take on a lot of the work larger offshore construction vessels currently perform, says Mr Naughton. \"We'll have full DP2 capability and, with such a wide deck, we'll be able to fit a cable lay carousel, work class ROVs or cable trenching machines.\" The vessel will also be fitted with two large HS Marine cranes and a 4-point mooring system. \nFollowing fabrication of the hull in Poland, Damen Shipyards Hardinxveld in the Netherlands will complete the final outfitting process. With the launch scheduled for Q1 2017, the Delta Marine team are looking forward to taking delivery: “With Damen, you get more than quality. You also get the excellent backup of the whole organisation. And that is worth its weight in gold to us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:13:29.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
