( www.hbm.com ), a leading manufacturer of data acquisition systems, analysis and calibration software, strain gauges, transducers and sensors, has upgraded its Perception software to new Version 6.60 for high-speed data acquisition applications. Perception Version 6.60, now includes a variety of capabilities that make it easier to perform high speed data acquisition on electric inverters and drive systems, along with new user customization features. \nPerception is designed for fast and reliable processing of large amounts of data—able to process 100 GB within 10 seconds. No other software package on the market can perform live torque and rotational speed measurements and calculations so quickly. \nThe software’s new “eDrive” application included in Version 6.60 makes it easier to make measurements on electric inverters and drive systems. HBM’s eDrive system allows users to more easily visualize torque and rotational speed as live curves. Other new live computations in Version 6.60 include Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and fundamental RMS. Because of its massive high speed data processing capability, there are no long wait times for data processing, and users can access and work with their data live while the measurement is running. \nPerception’s new Version 6.60 allows users to create individual “workbenches” that can be defined with distinct restrictions, test functions and capabilities, and password-protection capability to protect settings that workbench’s unique settings. These capabilities ensure that formulas for calculations or protocols in the worksheet remain protected and no unintentional changes are made. \nPerception language support and user manuals have been updated in Version 6.60 to include eight languages (English, German, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Portuguese). All eight languages are part of the Perception installation, and the software’s user interface makes it easy to change between them during operation. Reinstallation is not necessary. \nMore information can be found at http://www.hbm.com/en/menu/products/software/data-acquisition-software/perception/ or by contacting HBM at: \nHBM, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:45:42.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
