Picture: Facebook \nTHE odds are staggering but a Faceook user who logged onto a female stranger’s account due to a simple glitch has found love and the pair have married. \nSix years ago on October 4, Schuler Benson switched his mobile phone on to find it was logged in to a female stranger’s Facebook account. \nThe woman, Celeste Zendler , had no mutual friends and Schuler, a writer, had never seen or even heard of her before. She lived in Colorado, which is over 1,600 kilometres away from his home in Arkansas. \nTEN SECRETS TO A LASTING, LOVING RELATIONSHIP Schuler Benson accidentally logged into a stranger's Facebook account and sparked a love affair that has turned into marriage. Picture: Facebook \nSchuler was stuck in Celeste’s account for a week and the pair began to communicate as ‘This is Celeste’ and ‘This is NOT Celeste’.
