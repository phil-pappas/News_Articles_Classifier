The unamplified 120 km reach is achieved as a result of Menara’s superior performance of its optical transmitter and receiver designs, and the integrated Forward Error Correction coding gain afforded by Menara’s proprietary integrated circuit. Menara 10 Gbps XFP 120 km reach transceivers are MSA compliant and Telcordia qualified, compatible with both 10G Ethernet and 9.96 Gbps SONET/SDH line rates, consume under 3.5 Watts, and are compatible with all major routers and MPLS switches in the industry. \n“We are proud to bring another differentiated solution to our customers and partners,” observes Salam ElAhmadi, Menara co-Founder and CTO. “As our customers continue to add Data Centers and Central Offices to cope with the explosive digital services growth, the industry’s limit of 80 km reach could no longer meet their needs. Menara’s totally passive 100% MSA compliant optical module based solution for a 120 km reach allows our customers to interconnect their data centers and COs without being burdened by the footprint, power, and cost of a DWDM system.” \nAbout Menara Networks \nMenara Networks develops innovative products and solutions that greatly simplify today's layered optical transport networks. Leveraging the company's proprietary high speed ICs and its extensive expertise in optical networking and system design, Menara portfolio of OTN XFP, SFP+ and CFP modules provide optical networks with superior performance and improved service velocity while drastically reducing floor space, power consumption and overall network cost. The company’s unique solutions continue to save carriers millions of CapEx dollars and eliminate the need for footprint, heat, and power associated with DWDM transponders in central offices and data centers around the world.
