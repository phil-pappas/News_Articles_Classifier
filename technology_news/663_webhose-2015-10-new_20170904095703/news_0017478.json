In September 2015 BT pledged to increase the universal service commitment to offer 5-10Mbps broadband to 100% of UK homes and business, to extend its FTTC roll-out, and to offer ultrafast broadband over copper to 10 million properties by 2020, using G.fast technology. R&D hostage to fortune \nIt warned that to separate Openreach would put investment in UK broadband at risk, as it would be harder for Openreach to access the wider resources and expertise BT holds – a reference to its R&D facility at Adastral Park in Suffolk, which is currently working on G.fast, among other technologies. \n“BT is trying to create the idea that an Openreach owned by BT is the only way to guarantee investment – and that is simply not true,” said Charles Bligh, managing director of TalkTalk Business, speaking to Computer Weekly in September 2015. \n“I think a separate Openreach wouldn’t be constrained by BT in the near and medium term. It would invest in the long-term future.” \nMarket commentator Paolo Pescatore of CCS Insight said that to separate Openreach would be a big call for the regulator and the competition authorities to make – carrying a lot of risk – and would take a long time to implement. \nPescatore sided with BT, which has argued that the review is fixated on its relationship with Openreach and how that affects competition – while Sky is allowed to dominate the pay TV market. \n“Calls for Openreach separation have overshadowed the wider review of the digital communications market,” said Pescatore. \n“Ofcom needs to take into account the growing presence of OTT players and pay TV, which have not been subject to the same review as fixed-line broadband. For now it seems there is more than adequate competition in retail fixed-line broadband, but less in pay TV. \n“For now it seems that the likely outcome is to retain the current functional separation with additional remedies and stipulations.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.
