The cross-platform headset can be used to play games as well as watch films and programmes from Netflix or YouTube. \nThe Bluetooth-enabled headset sports a 5-inch display capable of 1080p HD video and 100 degree field of vision. Users can participate in games via a Bluetooth game controller. \nWhile virtual reality has been a topic of increasing interest over the past few years, none of the most innovative headsets have yet made it to market as complete consumer units. \nOculus Rift first launched as a Kickstarter project in 2012, promising to \"take 3D gaming to the next level\". The project surpassed its target in less than 24 hours, and by the end of the campaign had received almost $2.5 million from 9,522 backers. \nOculus revealed the first consumer version of its Rift headset back in June, and announced a partnership with Microsoft's Xbox, putting it in direct gaming competition with Sony's Playstation VR, formerly known as Project Morpheus. The company estimates it will go on sale in the first three months of 2016 , priced at around $1,500 (£968). \nAuraVisor claims to sidestep the issue of latency - a delay between the headset wearer acting and moving and their virtual environment reflecting this; which leaves some users feeling nauseous - as the wearer can move their head freely. \n\"The AuraVisor has its own operating system and battery on board and you can use it completely wirelessly, allowing you to completely immerse yourself in the experiences on offer,\" said James Talbot, director of AuraVisor. \"You are free to rotate 360 degrees or more without tangling or tripping over wires. \n“Because AuraVisor has been designed from the ground up to specifically function as VR, the initial set up is quick and simple and the graphics do not pixelate. The headset does not suffer from noticeable latency or lagging issues as you move your head freely,” he added. \nOther Kickstarter success stories include the Pebble smartwatch , which raised $10.3m on the platform in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:05:25.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
