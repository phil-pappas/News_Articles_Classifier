We can help them optimize operations, routing and scheduling, making them more cost-effective and efficient so they can better compete against larger firms.” \nOMVS is also conducting preliminary due diligence on possibly acquiring one or more small, independent trucking firms. The company believes that with the contacts it has made during the ongoing development of the shared economy trucking platform that should an acquisition be made, it can hit the pavement running and quickly generate a revenue stream. \nRecent studies forecast a coming shipping capacity shortage that could spell opportunity for new entrants into the industry. Adding to that, another report revealed small, independent firms are among the nation’s fastest growing small businesses . \nFor more information on OMVS, please visit www.onthemovesystems.com . \nAbout On the Move Systems, Inc. \nOn the Move Systems, Inc.
