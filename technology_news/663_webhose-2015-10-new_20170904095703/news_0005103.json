The beneficiaries of the project are the elderly, who are alone and fragile. The TamTam instrument detects, through a system of sensors installed at home, a series of information about the status and autonomy of the person being monitored. The occurrence or otherwise of an act or even the system communicates information and, consequently, allows a medical staff who work remotely the choice of one share over another. The added value of the project is the realization of a prototype client-server application that allows to support and to follow discretionarily, where necessary, and without a real physical presence, a person who is in a condition of dependency, to detect when an event occurs or does not occur, with the best support methodology available at the time choose the next most appropriate practices for the proper management of any emergency.\nIt appears the need to assist people without invading their sphere of confidentiality is increasing, ensuring proper support to all those who experience this need without distinction of sex, discrimination and marginalization. Not only the elderly who live alone need to be supported in their daily lives, but also the families who live with one or both aging parents have the same problems if the latter are left alone during the day in the house because of labor problems, the children, the school of the children or other commitments and, not least, for economic problems. The instrument will provide assistance to any person in need of medical care and monitoring, overcome discrimination and without prejudice to any and all social condition by providing equal dignity of every man and every woman. Therefore, it is quite clear that the system can be offered to all social strata. Given that the project initially involves 20 subjects to be monitored in psycho-attitudinal appropriate use of these technologies and that, in the future, based on the results of the technical experimentation - health achieved will be used for patients with different diseases and different gravity, it is easy to imagine a long list of recipients not only sites in their homes, but also in inpatient facilities, shelter and hospitality in the most diverse living conditions. The monitoring system reveals the status at the time in comparison with that note in order to predict and adopt the best medical care in real time not otherwise be proposed in different conditions. However, before this technology can help thousands of elders, TamTam Technology needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign. The goal of this project is to raise €150,000 by November 29, 2015.\nTo help bring this innovative hardware to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here. Perks will be delivered between December 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help TamTam Technology reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: L.O.A.D. - Dario Ugenti and Ernesto Nataloni\nTitle: TamTam Tecnology\nPhone: +39 388 928 6524 and +39 345 430 6212\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
