Indoor will be hosting its first event in Asia on January 19-20, 2016 to discuss the prospects for this tech-rich industry in the region. The two-day seminar will be hosted at Microsoft’s campus in Marina Bay, Singapore, and is tailored toward corporate executives from the technology, investment, vertical and greenhouse farming, and food and beverage industries, along with hydroponic, aquaponic and aeroponic startups and urban farmers. “As a company that is all about empowering organisations and people to achieve more, we are very committed to growing the startup ecosystem. Microsoft is excited to partner with Indoor Ag-Con for its inaugural Asian event and looks forward to the innovation that will be showcased as well as germinated in the areas of tech-focused indoor agriculture,” said Nobuhiro Ito, Director for Developer Experience & Evangelism, Microsoft Singapore.\nThe event will consist of keynotes from industry leaders and academics, panel discussions and extended networking breaks. The first day of the event will be co-hosted with The Foundation for the Development of Controlled Environment Agriculture, a non-profit entity devoted to academic advancements in the industry; “we’re gathering leading academic speakers from across the region to address growing in tropical climates“ added Chris Higgins, co-founder of the foundation and general manager of leading industry supplier Hort Americas. The second day will focus on commercial aspects of the industry. Participants will also have the opportunity to network at a drinks party on the first evening.\nAs with each Indoor Ag-Con event, the event’s focus will be on networking: “it’s great that the Asian industry will have a new opportunity to meet up with fellow growers and technologists” commented local Upgrown Farming Co distributor and SG Farming Blog owner Lionel Wong. Agriculture technology companies, suppliers and automation companies will have the chance to meet and mingle with leading vertical farmers and commercial greenhouse operations.\nThe event has previously been hosted in Las Vegas, NV and New York, NY. In its first three years, Indoor Ag-Con has captured an international audience and attracted some of the top names in the business. It has welcomed over 800 participants from 8 countries, as far away as New Zealand and the Philippines. Vendors in its sold-out exhibition halls have included LED lighting systems, nutrient delivery systems, and an automated aeroponics technology. The 2015 event’s sponsors ranged from retail majors such as Overstock.com and Whole Foods Market, to leading equipment suppliers such as BioSafe Systems, CropKing, Dosatron, Illumitex and Hort Americas.\n“As a former resident of Singapore, one of my personal goals has been to bring Indoor Ag-Con to this vibrant region” added Con. “Indoor Ag-Con is growing along with the industry that it serves, and we’re delighted to expand our events to Asia for 2016”. conference, Asia\nDates – January 19th & 20th, 2016 Place – Microsoft, 1 Marina Blvd, Singapore 018989 Ticket Prices – from S$399 Features – Two day seminar, with keynotes, panel discussions, and a drinks party.\n indoor.ag/singapore or call 65.9624.9210", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRvb3IuYWc="], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:22:51.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
