Our results show that Xero is meeting and possibly even exceeding the expectations of its customers, while significantly growing its subscriber base to 250,000 Australian small businesses. “The battle for cloud accounting supremacy is also being won by the consumers, with some very competitive prices for increasingly impressive software features and tools now on offer.” \nThe Canstar Blue research found value for money to be comfortably the greatest driver of overall satisfaction for small business customers. Drivers of customer satisfaction After sale service / warranty 21% Software features 11% Customer support 10% Point of sale service 7% \nThe survey also found that accounting software is more a necessity than a luxury for small business owners, as 80% declare it crucial for their business. In addition 38% said that before purchasing accounting software, their business made financial mistakes. “We’ve always strived to build the best possible cloud accounting software to our small business customers for great value and with awesome customer support, so it’s fantastic to be recognised for our efforts by Canstar,” said Chris Ridd, Xero Australia Managing Director. “We’ve delivered more than 1000 customer-facing updates to Xero in the past 18 months alone and we don’t intend to slow down anytime soon. Small businesses clearly love Xero and we can’t wait to show them what we have in store for the future.” For more information:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:44:42.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
