At the same time, the marketing ­department’s digital strategy ownership fell from 80 to 71 per cent\n“When CIOs demonstrate they are just as passionate about customer outcomes as CMOs (chief marketing officers) and take a genuine interest in ­marketing technology they can add significant value and play a leading role in digital strategy,’’ said panellist Richard Burns, who is general manager of ­customer ­experience and technology at Aussie Home Loans.\n“For many years, CIOs have been easily bypassed by marketing technology vendors who ­successfully targeted the CMO as their customer,” he said.\nASX application development general manager Katherine Squire, who was also a panellist, said a good digital strategy was built on seamless ­integration with new and existing systems.\n“Digital disruption has given CIOs a ‘wake-up call’ to pay much greater attention to their customers, their CMO and has highlighted the need for a new approach in IT.’’\nThe global survey, of almost 3700 IT executives across 50 countries, reported 44 per cent of CIOs had seen an increase in budget, while 33 per cent saw it remain static and 23 per cent experienced a decline.\nThe data also found that ­globally one in 10 organisations appointed a chief digital officer (CDO) for the first time last year. This means 17 per cent of organisations now have a CDO, up from 7 per cent last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:44:13.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
