Its presentation and depiction in movies and on television is almost exclusively negative, dark and sinister. From the release of 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968, to The Terminator in 1984, The Matrix in 1999, and the recent TV hit Humans the message has been the same: super-intelligent machines pose a massive threat to us all.\nAt the heart of all these depictions is the unfounded belief that the human race is on the brink of being destroyed by its own creation of super-robots, capable of mimicking the human brain.\nIn fact, AI is not simply the creation of intelligent robots, but a term that describes a group of techniques and approaches in engineering and technology. And some of those techniques are already working quietly in the background, making our everyday lives better and easier, even though we may not realise it.\nAccentuate the positive Making people fully aware of the benefits they already receive from AI is the kind of positive publicity that is needed. Those of us working in the field need to show the public how and why our research and work is so important. Informed debate can allay many of the unfounded fears that exist.\nIt should also be pointed out that we are many years away from having the technology to create anything that could rival the complexity of the human brain. It remains the most complicated and complex structure in the known universe. With it we process vast amounts of information and deal with multiple, complex problems simultaneously.\nWe have the ability to learn new things and retain old memories; we can solve problems, generate ideas and create amazing art, music and artefacts.\nThat’s all very difficult to replicate with artificial systems. Currently, the creation of super-intelligent, self-thinking, human-like robots, remains possible only in sci-fi films. Science reality is that AI is working for us in a myriad of ways, with not a robot in sight. Embedded and invisible, phones, digital cameras and even washing machines already use some of the techniques that fall under the general description of AI.\nOur smartphones are smart, in part, because of embedded AI in their software systems. The technology used to connect your mobile to the best available network when you are out and about is based partly on how ants in the natural world forage for food.\nAnts set up a circuit of permanent pathways – much like the network of mobile phone towers – from which they search locally. They also create complex communication networks using trails of pheromones that can be detected by other ants.\nUnnecessary fears In fact a lot of new developments in AI are attempts to replicate systems from the natural world, where millions of years of evolution have resulted in systems that work well for particular problems or situations.\nHuman society is also developing all the time and we are now seeing the development of smart cities , intelligent transport networks and massive connectivity.\nAgain these smart or intelligent systems use different aspects of AI to help solve specific problems, usually with AI embedded in systems that are invisible to most of us. AI is helping doctors, engineers, scientists, bankers, and even weather forecasters to do their jobs better, and to create healthier, more prosperous societies. That’s the story that isn’t being told or portrayed in the media.\nThe key thing is that AI is aiding, not taking over from, humans. Be it AI in your digital camera or in your washing machine or microwave, it only works when you want it to. You switch it on or off – you are the master.\nRelated: How to prevent creeping artificial intelligence becoming creepy\nThis takes us to the heart of another important issue, which needs to be carefully considered as we see AI techniques and approaches develop. It centres on a difficult but important ethical question that the television drama Humans helped highlight recently.\nMost of the negative representations of AI revolve around computer systems, or robots that become conscious, meaning self-aware and acting independently of human control. There is a real question as to what conscious even means, but it asks us some very tricky questions when we look to the future.\nFor example, if I have created some intelligent software that learns and develops, and develops consciousness, but it only exists on my computer, if I switch off the machine have I killed it? And do I have the right to do so? Can conscious AI systems suffer?\nThese may seem to be just abstract, philosophical questions at the moment. However, as AI continues to develop over the decades they are questions that will become more relevant. It is only right that we start that debate now.\nProfessor John MacIntyre is the dean of the Faculty of Applied Sciences and pro vice chancellor at the University of Sunderland .\nTo get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media & Tech Network membership .\nAll Guardian Media & Tech Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled “Brought to you by” – find out more here .", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator", "http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34249500", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33978561", "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2985100/robotics/instead-of-robots-taking-jobs-ai-may-help-humans-do-their-jobs-better.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_(TV_series)"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:55:36.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
