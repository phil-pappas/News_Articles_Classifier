(\"Valeant\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: VRX ), during the period between February 23, 2015 and October 20, 2015 inclusive. (the \"Class Period\"). \nThe lawsuit alleges that during the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose adverse information about the Company's business and prospects, including that the Company was using a network of specialty mail-order pharmacies that it actually controlled to prop up sales of its high-priced drugs and to keep patients and their insurance companies from switching to less costly generic drugs, that Valeant's undisclosed use of specialty pharmacies left it subject to increased regulatory risks, and that without the use of the specialty pharmacies, Valeant's financial performance and Class Period financial guidance would have been negatively impacted. \nNo Class has yet been certified in the above action.
