This lesson was learnt by the (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee government and hope (Narendra) Modi will learn it too,\" said the former union minister in response to a question over the fate of GST (Goods and Services Tax) Bill during an interactive session hosted by ORF.\nHe said if the government - led by Prime Minister Modi - is of the opinion that their version of the GST is the only version which needs to be passed, \"things will not work out\".\nRamesh termed Modi as one lacking the ability to listen to others' points of views while framing policies.\nComparing Modi with former prime minister Narasimha Rao, he said: \"Rao and Modi are completely different characters. Modi has (an) inability to listen while Rao had the ability to listen to multiple criticisms and viewpoints.\"\nHe refered to the land acquisition bill as a case demonstrating utter lack of political communication. \"If the attitude of any prime minister is 'my way or the highway', things are not going to change,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:49:50.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
