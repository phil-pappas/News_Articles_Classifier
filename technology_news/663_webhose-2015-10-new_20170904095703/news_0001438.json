The database will be used to track drones back to their owners in the event of an issue with the popular devices. \nThe FAA will establish a committee of government and industry officials, as well as drone users, to work out the details of the registration system. It's unclear if all drones will have to be registered, though the AP reports that toy and other small devices will likely be exempt. \nOfficials hope to have the rules in place by Christmas, when as many as 700,000 drones are expected to be sold. \nCurrently, only commercial drone users are required to register with the FAA. Other drone users are required to fly devices below 400 feet and obtain FAA permission before operating within five miles of an airport. Operators are also supposed to avoid passenger planes. \nThe registration is the latest effort to solve safety concerns over the use of unmanned vehicles. \nPilots reported 650 drone sightings this year, quadruple the number seen in previous years, the FAA reported. Just last week, a drone flying illegally over the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where it crashed near the White House. Police confiscated the drone and issues a criminal citation to its owner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:30:51.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
