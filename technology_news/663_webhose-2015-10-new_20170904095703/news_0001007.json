But until end-January, other arrangements for data transfers to the U.S., such as standardized contracts, could still be used.\nThe court decision created uncertainty for thousands of companies shifting data to the U.S., affecting billions of dollars of trade in the online advertising business, as well as more quotidian tasks such as storing users' account histories.\nThe ruling said national data-protection authorities had the right to override any data-transfer agreements if they found cause for concern about the way Europeans' data were being handled.\nAfter meeting in Brussels, the EU's 28 national data-protection regulators said Friday they would look into the implications the ruling had on the other arrangements for transferring personal data.\nThe regulators called on the European Commission, the EU executive body, and the U.S. to find \"political, legal and technical solutions\" that would allow for data transfers to the U.S. in a way that respects EU citizens' privacy rights\nBut if by the end of January no solution is found, and depending on the regulators' assessment of the alternative data-transfer tools, the national authorities \"are committed to take all necessary and appropriate actions, which may include coordinated enforcement actions,\" they said.\n\"Today's opinion should be welcomed for enabling ongoing data transfers… but we certainly aren't out of the woods yet,\" said Ross McKean, a data protection attorney at law firm Olswang. He said some national regulators are already hinting at a more restrictive approach to transferring data.\nEven with the grace period, regulators said they still have the authority to investigate particular cases and to exercise their powers to protect citizens.\nIt is also unclear how much legal certainty a new transfer pact could bring firms if, as the court said in its judgment, national authorities must be able to investigate personal data transfers with \"complete independence.\"\n\"The problem the court had with Safe Harbor could apply to any other way to transfer data,\" said Eduardo Ustaran, a privacy lawyer for tech firms at Hogan Lovells. \"In theory, any legal mechanism is vulnerable to indiscriminate access to data—that is a level of uncertainty we have to live with.\"\nFor 15 years, the Safe Harbor framework allowed companies based in the U.S. to store personal data about Europeans—for instance, account details or payroll information—on U.S.-based computer servers without running afoul of Europe's strict privacy rules. In return, the companies pledged to abide by a series of EU principles, enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\n\"We have been more cautious than most in the sense that we had two data-transfer mechanisms in place including Safe Harbor—but that's just a temporary safety net for us, there is a genuine uncertainty as to what will happen next,\" said Rene Summer, a government and industry relations director at Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson AB.\nMeanwhile, political pressure is ramping up on the European Commission to adhere to strict privacy principles in its negotiations over the new data-transfer pact with the U.S. Lawmakers at the European Parliament this week passed a resolution saying too little had been done to ensure that European citizens are protected from electronic mass surveillance.\nEnsuring privacy in commercial transactions \"is a very basic thing, this is not some kind of outlandish human rights request,\" said Claude Moraes, chairman of the Parliament's civil liberties committee, in response to the ECJ ruling.\n\"We can see now a scramble, certainly in the United States, for companies who were pretending that everything was okay.\"\nSam Schechner contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 16, 2015 15:25 ET (19:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:18:04.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
