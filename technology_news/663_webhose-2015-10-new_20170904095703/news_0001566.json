We are aiming to bring more of our production to the Asia Pacific region, where we will be closer to our direct customers and more closely in tune with the needs and the developments of key markets. \n\"Our midterm goal is that 75% of what we sell in this region is also produced in this region.\" \nBMC chairman Yu Xizhi said: \"MPCC is one of the largest refining companies in Sinopec, with excellent economic performance that matches the foremost enterprises of the Sinopec group. \n\"As the leading chemical company, BASF brings both technological and economic strengths. \n\"With this cooperation, the resources of the two partners complement each other, creating a win-win strategic fit that will boost the growth of both companies.\" \nINA is high molecular weight phthalate plasticiser used for the production of diisononyl phthalate. \nThe high molecular weight phthalates, including diisononyl phthalate (DINP) is expected to drive the demand for INA in the future. \nDINP is widely used as a plasticiser in industrial sectors such as the automotive, wires and cables, floorings, building and construction markets. \nIn 2013, Basf and Sinopec founded the joint-venture for isononanol production. \nCurrently, BASF is engaged in expansion activities in Asia, and is planning to more than double its revenues in the region, from €13bn in 2010 to €29bn in 2020.
