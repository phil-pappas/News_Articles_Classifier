Bernie Sanders clashed on U.S. involvement in the Middle East, gun control and economic policy as they opened the first Democratic debate Tuesday, outlining competing visions for a party seeking to keep the White House for a third straight term. \nClinton was an aggressor from the start, an unexpected shift for a candidate who has barely mentioned her Democratic rivals since launching her campaign six months ago. Until now, Clinton and Sanders — who has emerged as her toughest competition — have circled each other cautiously and avoided personal attacks. \nAfter Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist derided \"a casino capitalist process by which so few have so much,\" Clinton said it would be a \"big mistake\" for the U.S. to turn its back on the system that built the American middle class. Asked whether she thought Sanders, who has a mixed record on gun control legislation, had been tough enough on the issue, she said simply,\" No, I do not.\" \nSanders defended his gun control record, and called for better mental health services, stricter background checks and closing a loophole that exempts gun shows from background checks \nThe two also tangled over foreign policy, an issue where Clinton is often more hawkish than others in the Democratic Party. The former secretary of state reiterated her call for more robust U.S. action to stop the Syrian civil war and defended her judgment on international issues, despite having voted for the 2002 invasion of Iraq. \n--- \nThe Latest: O'Malley raps Clinton's no-fly zone in Syria \nLAS VEGAS (AP) — The latest on the Democratic presidential debate at the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas (all times local): \n--- \n6:40 p.m. \nGun laws have emerged as an important issue in the Democratic presidential debate. Polls show Democrats are largely united on the subject, even as Americans as a whole are more ambivalent. A CBS News poll conducted in July and August found that 77 percent of Democrats, but just 52 percent of Americans overall, said gun laws should be made stricter. \nBut Americans are united on one gun policy proposal. A July Pew Research Center poll showed that 85 percent of Americans, including 87 percent of those in gun-owning households, support requiring background checks for private sales at gun shows — a fact that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to during the debate. \n--- \n10 Things to Know for Wednesday \nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Wednesday: \n1. HOW HILLARY CLINTON HOPES TO WIN HER PARTY'S NOMINATION \nThe Democratic front-runner has increasingly moved to the left on domestic policy since announcing her campaign this spring. \n--- \nAP FACT CHECK: Clinton offers revisionist history on TPP trade deal in Democratic debate \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Rodham Clinton offered some revisionist history Tuesday night when insisting she's not a flip-flopper on a trade deal that she heartily promoted as secretary of state but turned against last week as a Democratic presidential candidate. \n\"I did say, I hoped it would be the gold standard'\" of trade agreements, she said of the Trans-Pacific Partnership when asked about her changing positions in the Democratic presidential debate. \nActually, Clinton did not say anything about hope in her many speeches around the world in support of the trade deal. \nOn Nov. 15, 2012, in Adelaide, Australia: \"This TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) sets the gold standard in trade agreements, to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" \nIn Honolulu, Nov. 10, 2011: \"There is new momentum in our trade agenda with the recent passage of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and our ongoing work on a binding, high-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership.\" \n--- \nIsrael leader vows 'aggressive steps' against Palestinians as wave of violence worsens \nJERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's prime minister on Tuesday said he would take a series of \"aggressive steps\" to halt a wave of violence in Israeli cities after two attacks in Jerusalem left three Israelis dead. Three Palestinians, including two attackers, were also killed. \nThe attacks in Jerusalem, including a deadly shooting and knifing spree on a bus and a violent hacking attack caught on video, escalated the monthlong unrest and raised the pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take action. The government has been unable to stop the violence, carried out mostly by young Palestinians unaffiliated with known militant groups and apparently acting on their own. \n\"Today we will decide on a series of additional aggressive steps in our war against terrorists and inciters,\" Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament. \"We will use, and not hesitate to use, all means at our disposal to restore calm.\" \nNetanyahu left a meeting of top security officials to deliver the speech, and quickly returned. The deliberations continued into the early hours of Wednesday morning when Netanyahu's office announced that several new measures were approved. \nIt said that police are now authorized to \"to impose a closure on, or to surround, centers of friction and incitement in Jerusalem, in accordance with security considerations.\" Many of the recent attackers were from Arab areas in Jerusalem. \n--- \nPalestinians attacking Israelis often young, leave behind ordinary lives in snap decisions \nJERUSALEM (AP) — They lived ordinary lives with ordinary ambitions — an electrician saving up to get married, a fitness buff, a worker in a butcher shop, a teen with plans for study in Europe after high school. But then these young Palestinians seemingly snapped. \nAccording to police accounts, some of them disputed, they stabbed Israelis in \"lone wolf\" attacks. Motives often remain murky, but attacks have been escalating, with eight Israelis and 12 suspected assailants killed over the past month, many in Jerusalem. \nThe violence comes amid growing Palestinian hopelessness, particularly in the Israeli-annexed Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem. Social media amplifies the anger and promotes revenge attacks as amateur videos make the rounds showing Israeli forces seemingly using excessive force, or angry bystanders cursing at wounded Palestinian assailants. \n--- \nSubhi Abu Khalifeh grew up in the Shuafat refugee camp, one of the poorest areas of east Jerusalem. Shuafat, like several other Arab neighborhoods in the city, has been cut off from the rest of Jerusalem by Israel's West Bank separation barrier. Services are spotty, with garbage often piling up in the streets. \n--- \nCubs clinch postseason series at Wrigley Field for 1st time, beat Cardinals 6-4 to win NLDS \nCHICAGO (AP) — For the Chicago Cubs and their ever-hopeful fans, this bash was a long time in the making. \nKyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez homered and the young Cubs clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field for the first time ever, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Tuesday to win the NL Division Series in four games. \nOnly once since they last brought home the World Series in 1908 had the Cubs won a playoff series and never before had they finished off the job at their century-plus-old ballpark. \nBut with a raucous, towel-waving crowd jamming the Friendly Confines, the North Siders gave generations of fans exactly what they wanted. \nCloser Hector Rondon struck out Stephen Piscotty on a pitch in the dirt, and catcher Miguel Montero scooped the ball and made the tag to end it. That sent the Cubs streaming out of the dugout to start a wild celebration. \n--- \nDutch investigation: Missile fired from war-ravaged eastern Ukraine downed Malaysian jet \nGILZE-RIJEN AIR BASE, Netherlands (AP) — The missile shot skyward from war-ravaged eastern Ukraine. With deadly accuracy more than six miles up, it detonated just in front of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner, sending hundreds of jagged steel shards ripping through its aluminum skin at up to 5,600 mph and shearing the cockpit from the rest of the plane. \nThe two pilots and purser in the cockpit died instantly, and the Boeing 777 disintegrated and fell to earth, killing the rest of the 298 men, women and children aboard Flight 17 on July 17, 2014, Dutch investigators said Tuesday in a long-awaited report. \nSome of the victims may have been conscious for 60 to 90 seconds, the Dutch Safety Board said, but they probably were not fully aware of what was happening in the oxygen-starved, freezing chaos. The tornado-like airflow surging through the doomed jet as it came apart was powerful enough to tear off people's clothes and leave naked corpses amid the fields of sunflowers. \nThe 15-month Dutch investigation blamed a Soviet-made surface-to-air Buk missile for downing the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight, but it did not explicitly say who had fired it. It identified an area of 320 square kilometers (120 square miles) where it said the launch must have taken place, and all of the land was in the hands of pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces at the time of the disaster, according to daily maps of fighting released by the Ukrainian National Security Council. \nThe Dutch Safety Board also found that the tragedy wouldn't have happened if the airspace of eastern Ukraine had been totally closed to passenger planes as fighting raged below. \n--- \nUS providing anti-tank missiles, but not anti-aircraft weapons as Russia bombs moderate rebels \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Russian military intervention to prop up Syria's government has brought new scrutiny of the CIA's secret support to Syrian rebels fighting Bashar Assad. But how far is the U.S. willing to go to empower its proxies to take on Vladimir Putin's allies? \nThe answer seems to be: Not very far. \n\"Countering Russia's involvement in Syria doesn't rate nearly as high on the scale\" as battling the Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate across parts of Syria and Iraq, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. \nAfter the CIA spent more than two years secretly working with Arab allies to arm, train and fund thousands of so-called moderate rebels to oppose Assad, American officials have watched in recent days as Russian bombs and missiles have targeted those groups. \nU.S. officials and outside experts say the Obama administration is unlikely to protect CIA-backed rebels from Russian air strikes — by providing them with surface-to-air missiles, for example — for fear they could fall into the wrong hands and be used against passenger jets in a terrorist attack. There is also little appetite in the White House for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone in Syria, officials say. \n--- \nJury: Gun shop that sold weapon used to shoot, wound Milwaukee cops must pay nearly $6 million \nMILWAUKEE (AP) — Jurors ordered a Wisconsin gun store to pay nearly $6 million on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by two Milwaukee police officers who were shot and seriously wounded by a gun purchased at the store. \nThe ruling came in a negligence lawsuit filed by the officers against Badger Guns, a shop in suburban Milwaukee that authorities have linked to hundreds of firearms found at crime scenes. The lawsuit said the shop ignored several warning signs that the gun used to shoot the officers was being sold to a so-called straw buyer who was illegally purchasing the weapon for someone else. \nOfficer Bryan Norberg and former Officer Graham Kunisch were both shot in the face after they stopped Julius Burton for riding his bike on the sidewalk in the summer of 2009. Investigators said Burton got the weapon, a Taurus .40-caliber handgun, a month before the confrontation, after giving $40 to another man, Jacob Collins, to make the purchase at the store in West Milwaukee. \nOne bullet shattered eight of Norberg's teeth, blew through his cheek and lodged into his shoulder. He remains on the force but said his wounds have made his work difficult. Kunisch was shot several times, resulting in him losing an eye and part of the frontal lobe of his brain. He said the wounds forced him to retire. \nJurors sided with the officers, ruling that the store was negligent. Jurors ordered the store to pay Norberg $1.5 million, Kunisch $3.6 million and punitive damages of $730,000.
