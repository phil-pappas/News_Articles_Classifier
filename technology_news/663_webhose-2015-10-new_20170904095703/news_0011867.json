Here in New York, it is time for more companies to take action on climate by acknowledging, on their books, that carbon emissions carry a price. \nAccording to a new report from CDP, the environmental nonprofit I lead in North America, New York-based Colgate-Palmolive, Goldman Sachs and Hess Oil are among 437 global companies already planning for a low-carbon future by assigning a price to the greenhouse gases they produce. Nearly triple last year’s number of companies have told us they’re using carbon pricing as a tool to offset the risks of greenhouse-gas emissions and, in some cases, to finance the cost of cutting them. \nCarbon pricing means applying a price to each ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent released into the atmosphere as a result of manufacturing processes, or the burning of fossil fuels for energy. In most of the U.S., it costs businesses nothing to emit carbon. However, with an internal carbon price, a company emitting, for example, 50,000 metric tons of globe-warming CO2 into the atmosphere per year would multiply that figure not by zero dollars but by an allocated price. Companies who do this use a range of prices internally: $10, $20 or even $150 per ton. \nOur data, collected on behalf of 822 investors managing assets of $95 trillion and a group of purchasing giants with over $2 trillion in combined corporate procurement, show carbon pricing is moving into the mainstream. Other companies who say they use carbon pricing to strengthen their competitive advantage include General Electric, General Motors, Campbell’s Soup and Fruit of the Loom, as well as technology leaders Microsoft, Google, LG, Hitachi and NEC. \nVoluntary carbon pricing—or internal carbon pricing—is different from the cap-and-trade system known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, under which New York utilities such as Con Ed trade their emissions under a cap at prices set at auction. It is also different from carbon taxes, in which governments compel companies—and not society—to bear the cost of their pollution. \nIn-house prices on carbon pollution are used for many reasons, but they all alter how companies calculate their return on investment in projects that curb the use of fossil fuels. Some companies charge the estimated costs of each ton of carbon emissions to the business units that produce them, giving managers bottom-line incentives to find energy efficiencies and to switch to cleaner fuels. Other businesses use a range of prices in scenario analyses to guide decision-making, anticipating government caps or taxes on carbon that can range from high to low. \nStill others actually set aside money from polluting business units to finance the shift to renewable energy throughout the corporation. For example, Microsoft channels the money charged to its business units per ton of their CO2 emissions into a common fund that invests in sustainability projects. Over time, these projects will help the company reduce its CO2 emissions. \nAmong New York-based companies, Colgate-Palmolive this year first disclosed using carbon pricing as part of its goal to reduce factory emissions by 25% by 2020. Colgate purchases green power and charges its cost to its global sites in proportion to their emissions. This sends “yet another important financial signal to our sites,” the company said in its disclosure to CDP, giving them financial incentives “to consider the potential opportunities associated with reducing their carbon emissions.” \nGoldman Sachs has business units “factor an internal price on carbon into energy efficiency, renewable energy and other emission reduction activities,” using a return-on-investment model. \nMore than 500 other companies including Yahoo say they expect to use carbon pricing within two years, which will push the total above 1,000. \nThe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that governs New York state utilities generates funds from its emissions trading framework and uses them to incentivize carbon reduction. Many companies voluntarily pricing carbon are doing the same within their operations as part of their overall strategy. \nAs successful companies around the world bet on a world where their carbon emissions will increasingly be linked with the costs of polluting, New York companies can powerfully shape the trend, integrating new tools like carbon pricing alongside their established ones, and innovating for a sustainable future. \nLance Pierce is president of CDP North America, a nonprofit group that works with companies to tackle climate change.
