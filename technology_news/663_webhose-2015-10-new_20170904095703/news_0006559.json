(AP) -- Western Digital is buying SanDisk in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $19 billion. \nThe buyout values SanDisk's stock at about $86.50 per share, a 15 percent premium to Tuesday's closing price. \nIf a previously announced investment in Western Digital from Unisplendour closes prior to the acquisition, Western Digital will pay $85.10 per share in cash and 0.0176 shares of its stock per share. If not, the price will be $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 shares for each share of SanDisk Corp. \nThe boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is targeted to close in 2016's third quarter. It still needs approval from SanDisk shareholders. \nShares of Western Digital Corp. dropped more than 3 percent in premarket trading Wednesday. Shares of SanDisk gained more than 5 percent. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
