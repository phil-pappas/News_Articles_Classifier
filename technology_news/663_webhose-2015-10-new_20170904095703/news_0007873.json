Target markets are for confined spaces. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/275953 \nComplete report on Snake Robots Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2015 to 2021 across 465 pages, analyzing 5 major leaders and supported with 206 Tables and Figures is now available at http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/427673-snake-robots-market-shares-strategies-and-forecasts-worldwide-2015-to-2021.html . \nConfined spaces exist. A confined space exists because of a lack of ability to take apart or dismantle components. Confined spaces exist in nuclear reactors where radiation is dangerous for human, aircraft inside the wings and other small spaces that need to remain intact, the human body which likewise cannot be dismantled easily, industrial processing plants that have containers, underwater environments, ship-building, and space. Buildings, roads, pipelines and other man-made spaces all have confined spaces. The world is full of awkward confined spaces. \nSnake-arm robots are self-contained portable devices and extensions to existing systems. These products build on software and hardware technology. \nThe automated process revolution has come to robotics, used in surgery, industry, ships, airplanes, first responder help, and communications. Automated process is being implemented via robots. Robots are automating systems, providing significant improvement in the accuracy of surgery and penetration of spaces that were previously impenetrable. \n\"A confined space needs long smooth snake shapes to achieve access. Confined spaces exist by design (aircraft engine), by failure (collapsed building) or naturally (human body). Existing open surgery can be replaced in large part by robotic and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Minimally invasive surgery MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and emerging interventional surgical approaches complement robotic surgery techniques as a replacement for or complement to open surgery. The snake robot reduces the number of ports needed to gain access and repair the heart.\" \n\"The companies that get an early foothold in the market have significant strategic advantage. The robotic snake leverages a new technique for robotic movement that benefits users by providing efficient access to difficult spaces. This factor is driving demand for snake robot systems. Since robotics provides a precise, repeatable and controlled ability to perform procedures in tight spaces, they are increasingly in demand.\" Order a License Copy of Snake Robots Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2015 to 2021Report at http://www.reportsnreports.com/Purchase.aspx?name=427673 for US $4000. \nDuring a robot assisted surgical procedure, the patient-side cart is positioned next to the operating table with the electromechanical arms arranged to provide access to the initial ports selected by the surgeon. Metal tubes attached to the arms are inserted through the ports, and the cutting and visualization instruments are introduced through the tubes into the patient's body. The surgeon performs the procedure while sitting at a console, manipulating the instrument controls and viewing the operation through a vision system. When a surgeon needs to change an instrument the instrument is withdrawn from the surgical field using the controls at the console. This is done many times during an operation. \nThe technology is proven, there are 100 successful reference accounts in a variety of industry segments, and the products serve a useful purpose. \nSnake-arm robots have a long, slender and flexible design without any protrusions. Generally they are modular with a follow me software implementation. They can effortlessly fit through small openings and maneuver around obstacles. They do not have prominent elbows that potentially snag or cause damage to sensitive equipment and they are easily maneuvered into position and retracted back without disturbing their environment. \nCompanies Profiled \nMarket Leaders: OC Robotics, HiBot, Medrobotics, Hirose Fukushima Lab ACM and Sarco \nMarket Participants: Applied Robotics Technologies, LLC, Fanuc, Kawasaki Robotics, Kuka , Mitsubishi, Sintef, Tesla, Tokyo Institute of Technology Research Laboratories, Unifire, University of Michigan Mobile Robotics Lab Omnitread, Yaskawa and Selected List of Robots, University and Research Snake Robots. \nExplore Other Reports by WinterGreen Research at http://www.reportsnreports.com/publisher/wintergreen-research/ . \nOther Related Report: \nThe Robot Doctor Will See You Now--Patent Analysis and Business Opportunities of Medical Robots ( http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/397088-the-robot-doctor-will-see-you-now-patent-analysis-and-business-opportunities-of-medical-robots.html ): Medical robots are a cross-disciplinary endeavor to facilitate disease diagnosis, surgery, radiation therapy, rehabilitation, and telepresence diagnosis.
