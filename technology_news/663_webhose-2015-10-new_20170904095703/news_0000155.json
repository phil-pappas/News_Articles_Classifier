This includes a new Cinder driver and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Ecosystem certification. It is now simpler than ever for organizations to deploy or grow their OpenStack footprint on Tintri storage. \nTintri is the first and only provider to offer VM-aware storage to OpenStack users. The Tintri Cinder driver, combined with Tintri's unique VM-aware storage technology, lets users analyze individual Cinder virtual machines and volumes from the Tintri user interface. Organizations can use Tintri's operating system and real-time analytics to manage and troubleshoot workloads at VM and volume level. This enables simple scaling with consistent performance, sub-millisecond latency and no noisy neighbors for each Cinder virtual machine and volume across every OpenStack tenant. The Tintri Cinder driver has been contributed to the OpenStack community and is part of the OpenStack Liberty release. \nTintri is a Corporate Sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation and is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Ecosystem partner. Both designations symbolize Tintri's commitment to offering customers more choices and more product innovation. \n\"We are delighted that Tintri has signed on as a Corporate Sponsor of the OpenStack community,\" said Heidi Bretz, Director of Business Development at the OpenStack Foundation. \"We look forward to Tintri's engineering team helping the community accelerate innovation in storage solutions powered by OpenStack.\" \n\"Tintri continues to show outstanding leadership in the OpenStack space, and Red Hat is pleased that this extends into providing a certified and supported product on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform,\" said Mike Werner, Senior Director, Global Technology Ecosystems at Red Hat. \"Tintri is a great example of an innovative company delivering innovative solutions to a broad customer base. We look forward to continued collaboration with Tintri as an important member of Red Hat's OpenStack and Technology Partner ecosystem.\" \n\"OpenStack is well suited to cloud environments -- and this is where Tintri's value proposition is very strong,\" said Ken Klein, CEO and Chairman of Tintri. \"OpenStack customers need predictable performance and ready scaling without management complexity; that's precisely what Tintri VM-aware storage offers. Our customers can move to OpenStack at their pace, adding virtual machines to a VMstore already operating one or more other hypervisors. And while Red Hat represents an important first OpenStack distribution for Tintri, we will continue to work with other major distributions to offer our customers the most choice in storage.\" \nFor more information about Tintri's support of OpenStack, please visit www.tintri.com . \nAll trademarks and copyrights are the property of their respective owners. \nAdditional Resources", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:44:47.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
