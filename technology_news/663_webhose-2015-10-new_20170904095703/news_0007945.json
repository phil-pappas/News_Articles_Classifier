The environment forces you to embrace technology. So it does not matter to which category the consumer belong; sooner or later, one has to learn to be in touch with the times. Whether one likes it or not, you become a part of the change,\" he said. \nAt this week's Gitex, Peter promised that Panasonic will be \"bringing a range of amazing products and solutions catering to various industry verticals\". \n\"Our products and solutions will transform the way retail, hospitality, entertainment to name a few industry verticals, will see the future of their business unfold.\" \nPeter added that smart technology and the Internet of Things provides the ability to inter-link products and make things easier for consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:44:53.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
