See \"Growth in Constant Currency\" for more information. \nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding VMware's results, VMware has disclosed in this release the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. VMware has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP in that they exclude stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition and other-related items, each as discussed below. \nVMware's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short- and long-term operating plans, to calculate bonus payments and to evaluate VMware's financial performance, the performance of its individual functional groups and the ability of operations to generate cash. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect VMware's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in VMware's business, as they exclude charges and gains that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating VMware's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. \nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others in assessing VMware's operating performance due to the following factors: Stock-based compensation . Stock-based compensation is generally fixed at the time the stock-based instrument is granted and amortized over a period of several years. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of VMware's employees and executives, the expense for the fair value of the stock-based instruments VMware utilizes may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond VMware's control. Additionally, in order to establish the amount of expense to recognize for performance-based stock awards, which are also an element of ongoing stock-based compensation, VMware is required to apply judgment to estimate the probability of the extent to which performance objectives will be achieved. Management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of VMware's core business and to facilitate comparison of its results to those of peer companies. Employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions . The amount of employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation is dependent on VMware's stock price and other factors that are beyond VMware's control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets . A portion of the purchase price of VMware's acquisitions is generally allocated to intangible assets, such as intellectual property, and is subject to amortization. However, VMware does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle. Additionally, the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition. Therefore, VMware believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that adjust for the amortization of intangible assets provides investors and others with a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Acquisition and other-related items. Acquisition and other-related items include direct costs of acquisitions and dispositions, such as transaction and advisory fees. Also included are accruals for the portion of merger consideration payable in installments that may be paid in cash or VMware stock, at the option of VMware. These accruals are primarily composed of amounts VMware has committed to make to designated founders and key executives of AirWatch, subject to employment conditions and indemnification claims, if any. Additionally, charges recognized for non-recoverable strategic investments or gains recognized on the disposition of strategic investments are included as other-related items. As VMware does not acquire or dispose of businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction, VMware believes it is useful to exclude these items when looking for a consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods. Tax adjustment . Non-GAAP financial information for the quarter is adjusted for a tax rate equal to VMware's annual estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income. This rate is based on VMware's estimated annual GAAP income tax rate forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP income in calculating VMware's non-GAAP income. VMware's estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income is determined annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that VMware management believes materially impact the estimated annual rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses and other significant events. Due to the differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from non-GAAP earnings, as well as the methodology applied to VMware's estimated annual tax rates as described above, the estimated tax rate on non-GAAP income may differ from the GAAP tax rate and from VMware's actual tax liabilities. \nThe use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations because they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect VMware's operations. Specifically, in the case of stock-based compensation, if VMware did not pay out a portion of its compensation in the form of stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect VMware's cash position. VMware compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of VMware's liquidity. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Management encourages investors and others to review VMware's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. \nGrowth in Constant Currency \nA majority of VMware's sales are denominated in the U.S. dollar; however, VMware also invoices and collects in the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Chinese renminbi in their respective regions. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of VMware's legal entities. At the time a non-U.S. dollar transaction is recorded, the value of the transaction is converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect for the month in which each order is booked. \nAs a result, the amount of license and total revenues and unearned revenues derived from these transactions will be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations. In order to provide a comparable framework for assessing how VMware's business performed adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, management analyzes year-over-year license and total revenue growth on a constant currency basis. \nRevenue Growth in Constant Currency and Sequential Change in Unearned Revenues \nLicense and total revenues recognized during the current period derived from non-U.S. dollar based transactions were converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates that were effective in the comparable prior year period. The calculated current period license and total revenues, adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations, is compared to the license and total revenues of the comparable prior year period, as reported, in calculating license and total revenue growth in constant currency. \nUnearned license revenues and unearned total revenues at the end of the period, derived from non-U.S. dollar transactions recorded during the current period, were adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations using the exchange rates that were effective in the comparable prior year period. Unearned license revenues and unearned total revenues, adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations at the end of the period, are compared to unearned license revenues and unearned total revenues at the beginning of the period, as reported, in determining the sequential change in unearned revenues.
