Wahltv will allow people to watch live TV worldwide on all electronic devices through the internet. No longer will live content be restricted geographically. Instead of using traditional satellite in space and other equipment to bring live content to peoples' homes. Wahltv's finished state-of-the-art software and hardware will accomplish the same with a fraction of the cost by using the power of the internet. Over the past 50 years, the price of cable has incrementally increased significantly while premium contents have gone down drastically. For the last 35-years, satellite has done the same. People now are paying way more for less. Wahlv will change that!\nWahltv will revolutionize the world of television. Wahltv proprietary software and servers receive a live signal from broadcasters and content owners. Their system will then break it down, and clean it up. It’ll then convert it to RTMP stream, M3u8 stream, RTSP Stream, and HLS stream, amplify the signal, and send that live signal to their receiver through the Internet. In turn making live content available on any viewing screen in Ultra HD. All users need is high-speed Internet and the receiver. However, before this software can be enjoyed by everyone, Wahltv needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $65, 000 by October 31, 2015. The funds raised will go towards production and manufacturing.\nHowever, before this software can be enjoyed by everyone, Wahltv needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $65, 000 by October 31, 2015.

Perks will be delivered between December 2015 and February 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward.
