Suitebox, a New Zealand video software startup combining virtual meetings with document collaboration, is using Oracle Cloud Platform and Infrastructure services as part of its plans to scale for global growth.Founded by technology entrepreneur Craig Meek, SuiteBox is a unified communications and collaboration software platform that allows financial advisers to invite clients to a virtual meeting room on any connected device, record all or part of any video meeting, and share and electronically sign digital assets, embedding this interaction together into any current CRM solution.Suitebox, whose customers range from small businesses to some of the largest global banks and insurance companies, is using Oracle Java Cloud Service to provide easy implementation and integration with Suitebox’ video and VoIP communication layers, as well as integration with third-party enterprise CRM and ERP applications.“Oracle provides Suitebox with a highly intuitive and simplified integration platform in the cloud, with point-and-click web-based design features, a comprehensive library of adapters, intelligent mapping capabilities and a rich dashboard for managing and monitoring integrations in one place,” said Mr Meek.“We are a young company, and our customers want to know that Suitebox services run on infrastructure that is secure, scalable and agile, and this is why we chose Oracle as our technology partner from the beginning. Oracle Cloud Platform gives us access to premier grade solutions at a much lower cost, giving our company and customers a robust platform that can scale as more users are added.”Suitebox is also using the Oracle Storage Cloud, part of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure , as well as the Oracle Database Cloud Service and Oracle Java Cloud Service, both part of the Oracle Cloud Platform. These services provide the company with reliable performance, easy integration, and personalized application delivery, while enabling them to keep infrastructure costs down, deliver solutions rapidly, and standardise the application architecture.“Many New Zealand start-ups are thinking global from the start, and are looking for infrastructure solutions that will scale as the business grows,” said Robert Gosling, Managing Director, Oracle New Zealand. “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure gives both fast-growing start-ups, as well as larger established companies an innovative way to design and deliver integrations in the cloud, accelerating application development and deployment and transforming our customers’ businesses.“We are excited to be working with Suitebox, a company recognised by Deloitte this year as a potential ‘Rising Star’ in its annual celebration of New Zealand’s fastest growing companies,” said Robert Gosling, Managing Director, Oracle New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:00:08.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
