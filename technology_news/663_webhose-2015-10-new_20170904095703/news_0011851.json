We know that the battle for shoppers is a tough one – and providing a speedier checkout experience is one major way retailers can differentiate themselves from the competition.\" \nHowever, 70% of those surveyed believe that the new £30 limit on payments using wearable technology is still too low. Only 30% are happy with the current limit which recently came into force. Nearly a third (32%) want the limit lifted to £50, while 16% are in favour of a £100 limit and the same percentage want no limit at all. Only 6% wanted a £40 limit. \n\"Making wearable technology part of a consumer's shopping experience is not a given,\" Pepper continued. \"To make the most of this opportunity, retailers will have to ensure they have the right infrastructure and at some point, the payment ceiling will have to be lifted, as many shoppers clearly think the current limit is too low.\" \nAsked which types of stores would be most suitable to payment by wearable technology, the overwhelming majority (70%) said supermarkets, followed by coffee shops (66%) and bus stations, railway stations and airports (63%). \nDiscount or pound shops were seen as least suitable for wearable technology, with only just 25% saying they would pay for goods in this method.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:19:19.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
