It offers a creative space in which to play but, until now, didn’t have a story.\nMinecraft Story Mode is an action-adventure created in the Minecraft world by Telltale Games.\nThey have made popular narrative experiences for older players like The Walking Dead and Back to the Future.\nRather than exist in Minecraft itself this is a separate downloadable set of episodes , each of which tells some more of the story about Jesse a young adventurer on a quest to save the world.\nIt all looks very much like Minecraft but with a high-gloss finish. Both visuals and voice-work feel more like something you would find in a movie than a kids' video-game.\nVideo loading\nAlong with this comes a bit of bad language (hence its PEGI 12+ rating) but more importantly a meaningful story about friendship, creativity and collaboration.\nPlayers of Telltale Games’ previous titles will be right at home here. Minecraft fans may take a little longer to acclimatise but they too will enjoy the experience.\nMinecraft Story Mode will be released on the majority of home consoles, tablets and smartphones although the console versions will be out first.\nWii U gamers will even see the game come to their system — a first for the Microsoft owned property.\nWhere Story Mode shines is when parents and children play it together. This gives young enthusiasts a chance to teach mum and dad about the game they live, while at the same time offering.\nGame-play consists of story scenes, button mashing action sections and more considered conversation choices. As players choose how to respond to different situations the game evolves in new directions.\nAt the end of each chapter you can see how your choices compared to other that had played the game, another standard aspect of Telltale’s games that works well here.\nVideo loading\nThe overall result is a first chapter that is an enjoyable experience. Subsequent episodes will be released over the coming months. Each one lasts around 2 hours.\nThe entries series can be purchased online or in a boxed copy for around £23.99. This comes with the first episode on the disc and grants access to downloading the rest as they are available.\nIf you have a Minecraft fan in the house this could well be on their Christmas list.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpxpnUWTT9E?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "https://www.game.co.uk/en/minecraft-story-mode-756111?pageSize=40&searchTerm=minecraft+story+mode&catGroupId=", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwvGocOm0jI?enablejsapi=1&version=3", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/GeekDadGamer", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHOVPPXc2Y8", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:32:21.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
