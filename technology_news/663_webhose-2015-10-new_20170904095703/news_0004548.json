The system helps solo and small law firm practices profitably provide the 55 legal services most often required by this underserved segment of the consumer market. PlanetXLaw is now available for attorneys in Michigan and plans to add additional states beginning in early 2016.\nThe PlanetXLaw platform is unique in that it collects the intake data, retrieves the appropriate court forms, includes all supporting documents, and assembles the documents for each of the 55 services. In addition, each of the services includes a venue-specific “How To” guide that provides step-by-step instructions outlining the necessary documents, the number of originals and copies required, where to file/apply/petition, and the filing fees required. No other legal document assembly software includes practice guides with the level of detail offered by PlanetXLaw.\nPlanetXLaw’s Founder and CEO, Bert ‘Tiger’ Whitehead, IV, Esq., originally developed the software for use in his consumer-based practice, Access Legal Care . The firm, founded in 2011 in Garden City, MI is committed to providing high-quality legal services to consumers for 40-60% less than average legal rates. Since its founding, the firm has helped thousands of individuals with free phone consultations, and provided low-cost legal advice and tailored legal services to hundreds of clients. In 2013, Mr. Whitehead and Access Legal Care received the ABA Louis M. Brown Award for Legal Access , which honors programs and projects who show successful and innovate approaches to meeting the unmet legal needs of the middle class and those of moderate incomes with lawyers who provide affordable information, services, and representation.\n“The PlanetXLaw platform has allowed me to profitably provide low-cost legal services to clients who want and need legal representation,” said Tiger Whitehead, founder and CEO of PlanetXLaw. “Developing the software and fine-tuning it over the last four years has resulted in a platform that enables attorneys to build profitable practices while helping to close the nation’s justice gap.”\nAbout PlanetXLaw:\nPlanetXLaw is an innovative cloud-based document automation platform designed to help lawyers profitably deliver affordable legal services to low and moderate income consumers.
