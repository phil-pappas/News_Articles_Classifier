An 11.8 percent increase in net interest income, to $17.4 million, and lower operating expense were partly offset by a reduction in noninterest income and an increase in the bank's provision for loan losses.\nTotal assets were $2 billion, up 9 percent from Dec. 31.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
