Last year’s CES saw an explosion of new products and even new categories, and the wealth of ideas highlighted on our site every day shows there’s plenty of innovation yet to come. Our Top Tech of CES awards give us a chance to sort through it all and bring you the best of the bunch.” \nDigital Trends will announce winners at CES on Thursday, January 7. As the official Digital Home media partner at CES for the third year in a row, Digital Trends editors and writers will be on site delivering breaking news of the hottest and most innovative electronics and gadgets arriving in 2015 — and highlight the smart appliances and platforms that have so captured the public’s attention. \nTo be considered for Digital Trends’ Top Tech of CES awards, products must be aimed at consumers (not businesses) and make their formal debut at CES 2016, which takes place in Las Vegas, Nev., from Jan. 6 – 9. Products will be judged on use of innovative technology and their ability to enhance people’s lives in new ways. Multiple entries will be accepted, and all embargoes and NDAs will be honored.
