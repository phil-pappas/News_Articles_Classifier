IANS | 05 October 2015, 4:14 PM IST Share LONDON: British researchers have developed a new mobile app that could involve people with autism in the development of new technologies for their own use.The app called \"ASCmeI.T.\" enables people with autism spectrum conditions - as well as families, teachers, professionals and anyone who supports someone with autism - to share their ideas on what kind of new technology would best help.\"If you have ever had a moment where you wished there was a useful technology out there to help you, or someone else, with something related to autism, this is the chance to get your idea heard,\" said one of the researchers, Sarah Parsons from University of Southampton.\"We want to use this new app to crowdsource ideas which we can blend with latest research and development,\" Parsons noted in an official statement.Through the app, users can upload a one-minute video explaining their idea, which will be shared with researchers, so that new developments in digital technologies for autism can be matched to support the needs of users.\"This project is totally unique and encourages 'citizen science'. ASCmeI.T is a simple yet highly effective way to enable people with autism to get their voices heard and to allow the creativity of a previously neglected group to be realised,\" co-investigator on the project Mark Brosnan from the University of Bath pointed out.This free mobile app can be downloaded for both Android and Apple devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:05:19.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
