Regions with higher concentrations of hemoglobin may indicate higher blood flow due to an abnormality such as a tumor.\nThe optical analysis developed offers several benefits over mammography, with no ionizing radiation dose and fewer issues imaging dense tissues.\n\"Eventually, we hope that physicians will be able to use this for real-time imaging of breast tissues as part of regular visits by the patients\" adds Anu Godavarty, also an author of the paper. \"We're current working on the mathematical tools required to process the images and produce 3D tomographic images, in order to determine tumor size and depth.\"\nThe researchers' on-going efforts involve extensive clinical work to demonstrate the capability of the device to pre-screen for any breast abnormality, followed by seeking FDA approvals prior to clinical use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:41:27.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
