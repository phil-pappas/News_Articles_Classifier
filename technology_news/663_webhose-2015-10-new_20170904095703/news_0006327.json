(Supplied) \nSaudi Arabia has recalled more than 83,600 iPhone 6 plus just days after it was imported by the largest Arab economy on the grounds it has a faulty rear camera. \nThe Ministry of Commerce published serial numbers of the US-made handsets recalled from the market on its website. \n“These handsets have been recalled because of a problem in the back camera. This is resulting in a foggy picture,” the Ministry said. \nIn August, the phone’s manufacturer Apple said it was recalling a limited number of iPhone 6 Plus phones due to faulty back cameras that take blurry photos. \nThe affected phones were mostly sold in a 4-month period between September 2014 and January 2015, Apple said on its website. \nThe company said it would replace the phone's camera free of charge if it takes blurry photos and falls into a particular serial number range.
