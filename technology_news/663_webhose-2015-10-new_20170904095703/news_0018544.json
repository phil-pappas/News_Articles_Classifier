Seamless has secured a new order in Africa for its proprietary wireless POS terminal. \nThe order is worth USD 2.4 million and is the latest in a series of orders that the Transaction Switch division has received during the third quarter in the rapidly growing African market. In total, Seamless has now received orders valued at USD 5.3 million in Africa. \n“This is an important order for us in many respects. With our proprietary terminal, we have broadened our business and thus account for a larger share of the value chain in our industry. This also marks the first step into a high-growth market for our proprietary hand terminal, which is both smarter and more effective than other solutions,” says Peter Fredell, CEO of Seamless. \nSeamless Wireless Point of Sale Terminal, WiPOS, is an integrated part of the ERS 360° transaction platform. In simple terms the terminal can be described as a mobile phone with the capacity to print receipts and vouchers for loading prepaid cards as well as enabling other valuable transaction types. In contrast to other hand terminals, the Seamless product connects to the GSM network, thus substantially improving coverage while simultaneously reducing costs. Customers in the Seamless Transaction Switch division include international telecom companies and distributors. \nSeamless is also the provider of SEQR, a complete financial ecosystem in which SEQR users can buy and sell goods, connect loyalty systems, redeem offers, and transfer money to and from one another.
