In fact, his invention uses just 25% of the power of an old-fashioned, incandescent bulb and lasts around ten times longer.\nToday CFLs are standard in homes and offices around the world and many countries have phased out incandescent bulbs , including an out-right legal ban in Argentina. If the electricity that lights the bulb is created from coal, then the invention has saved 500 pounds (227kg) of coal per bulb .\nRelated: Smart solutions put energy efficiency in the spotlight in Latin America\nInnovation is constantly improving the sustainability and the reach of the energy sector. Technological advances have brought the cost of solar panels down by 80% since 2008 , meaning that this renewable energy source is now a cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels.\nAnd off-grid solutions are improving access to energy in remote parts of Africa with many NGOs offering solar-powered lamps and innovative financing methods .\nSo what are the best ways to nurture and develop innovation in the sector? Should incentives be offered to encourage inventions that benefit developing countries? And is there a danger that too much focus on technology risks reliance “quick fixes,” rather than working on less exciting, more effective solutions, like energy-saving?\nJoin a panel of experts to discuss these questions and more on Thursday 8 October 1-3pm BST.\nThe live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below).
