By Coral Garnick Seattle Times business reporter \nT-Mobile US said Thursday that approximately 15 million people may be victims of a cyberattack on one of its vendors, Experian credit-services company. \nJohn Legere, CEO of Bellevue-based T-Mobile, said in a statement that the hacked records include those of new applicants requiring a credit check for service or device financing from Sept. 1, 2013, through Sept. 16, 2015. \nThe records include information such as name, address and birthdate, as well as encrypted fields with Social Security number and ID number (such as driver’s license or passport number), and additional information used in T-Mobile’s own credit assessments, Legere wrote in announcing the breach Thursday. \nExperian is the company that Premera used to offer two years of free credit monitoring to the 11 million people affected by a cyberattack against the health insurer.
