The 2015 list is the publication’s 34th annual ranking of companies on the rise, and represents the most comprehensive look at the most important segment of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs. Businesses such as Yelp, Pandora, Timberland, Dell, Domino’s Pizza, LinkedIn, Zillow, and many other well-known names have been members of the Inc. 5000. Lightwell, a provider of solutions and services for Ecommerce, order management, B2B integration, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) , and supply chain management, also appears on the ranking subsets of fastest-growing IT Services companies and the fastest-growing companies in Ohio and the Columbus metropolitan area.

The companies on this year’s Inc. 5000 list collectively created 647,000 jobs and generated $205 billion in aggregate revenue in the past three years.\n\"The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top,” says Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg. “You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012. Business owners don’t achieve that kind of success by accident.\"\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000 can be found on the Inc. 5000 website.\nAbout Lightwell\nLightwell develops and implements technology solutions that answer critical business challenges.
