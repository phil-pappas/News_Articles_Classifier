The conference will showcase the latest breakthroughs in genetics research and its practical, clinical applications to medical practice, patient care and public health. \nReporters will hear about the latest medical genetics research; have the opportunity to interact with doctors, lab professionals and genetic counselors about what is happening right now in genetics and genomics; and view the latest products available in the extensive exhibit hall. \nTopics range from common conditions to rare diseases and from ethical to technological issues. Sessions include information of interest to the general public, to health professionals across all disciplines and primary care and to the industry/trade. \nThe ACMG Meeting is the genetics meeting most focused on the practical applications of genetic discoveries in the clinical setting. The 2015 Meeting shattered records with a record number of abstracts; and attendee registration and exhibitors were at an all-time high. \nThree Genetics Short Courses on Tuesday, March 8: \nAdvanced Molecular Cancer Genetics: State of the Art Today and Beyond* Tools and Approaches to Assess the Genetic Basis of Disease NAMA at the ACMG: The Best of the North American Metabolic Academy \nProgram Highlights: \nFrom Guidelines to Clinic: Incorporating Pharmacogenetics into Clinical Practice and the Electronic Health Record Therapies for Genetic Diseases: New Options Cancer Prevention and Screening for Children at Hereditable Risk Classic and new Approaches to Variant Interpretation in the Genomic Era From Gene Discovery to Gene Therapy: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Other Neuromuscular Disorders Reproductive Genetics: Implications of the Latest Technologies Prenatal Diagnostic Dilemmas The Right Test for the Right Patient at the Right Time: Working With Your Institution to Make Genetic Testing Useful \nTo see the complete program, visit http://www.net . \nPhoto/TV Opportunity: The ACMG Foundation for Genetic and Genomic Medicine will present bicycles to local children with rare genetic diseases at the Annual Day of Caring at the Annual Meeting. \nSocial Media for the 2015 ACMG Annual Meeting: As the ACMG Meeting approaches, journalists can stay up-to-date on new sessions and information by following the ACMG Social Media pages on Facebook and Twitter and by using the NEW Twitter hashtag #ACMGMtg16 for Meeting-related tweets. \nCredentialed media representatives on assignment are invited to attend the ACMG Annual Meeting on a complimentary basis.

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics provides education, resources and a voice for nearly 1800 biochemical, clinical, cytogenetic, medical and molecular geneticists, genetic counselors and other healthcare professionals, nearly 80% of whom are board certified in the medical genetics specialties. The College's mission is to develop and sustain genetic initiatives in clinical and laboratory practice, education and advocacy. Three guiding pillars underpin ACMG's work: 1) Clinical and Laboratory Practice: Establish the paradigm of genomic medicine by issuing statements and evidence-based or expert clinical and laboratory practice guidelines and through descriptions of best practices for the delivery of genomic medicine. 2) Education: Provide education and tools for medical geneticists, other health professionals and the public and grow the genetics workforce. 3) Advocacy: Work with policymakers and payers to support the responsible application of genomics in medical practice. Genetics in Medicine, published monthly, is the official ACMG peer-reviewed journal. ACMG's website offers a variety of resources including Policy Statements, Practice Guidelines, Educational Resources, and a Find a Geneticist tool. The educational and public health programs of the American College of Medical Genetics are dependent upon charitable gifts from corporations, foundations, and individuals through the ACMG Foundation for Genetic and Genomic Medicine . \nDisclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:27.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
