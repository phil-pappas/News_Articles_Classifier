The Agile Methodology’s promise of reducing overhead, delivering better solutions with improved client satisfaction, while at a lower cost are realized by few organizations leading to projects that experience cost overruns and poor quality.\n“Vizuri’s history of delivering successful agile developed systems is largely due to process. \" said Joe Dickman, SVP Vizuri, “We understood early that following a disciplined process provides a predictable, systematic mechanism for assessing and mitigating risks that would ultimately affect systems delivery. Our years of experience delivering solutions and mentoring clients will help Agile Strategies customers evaluate their current investment and enable them to make better decisions and take advantage of this key and essential methodology.”, said Dickman.\nUnder this partnership, Vizuri will deliver professional services through Agile Strategies to mitigate risks, educate customers, accelerate adoption and integrate Agile best practices and safeguards into their SDLC.\nAgile Strategies combines project management with legal forensics to rescue clients who have lost control of the level of effort on a software/hardware professional services engagement due to the mismanaged implementation of the very methodology that is supposed to streamline the identification of the key requirements necessary to achieve the end product.\n“The percentage of professional services engagements utilizing agile methodology for IT customization that are not completed within budget and timeline is staggering. And yet clients continue to not only accept the overruns and poor implementation of agile methodology but go back to the same IT vendors for their next project”, states Agile Strategies’ CEO, Patricia Block. “Agile Strategies not only acts as a marriage counselor to rescue a project and get it back on track but now, partnering with Vizuri, we can offer additional layers of protection, assessment and implementation to our clients to ensure that resets become a thing of the past.”\nHeadquartered in Herndon, VA, Vizuri is one of the leading IT consulting firms, bringing a disciplined approach to providing solutions that are unique, highly valued, and repeatable. Agile Strategies, based in Gaithersburg, MD, provides consulting services that rescue IT projects, institute a reset and redefine requirements in order to bring a project to completion.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13033697.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13033697.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:55:56.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
