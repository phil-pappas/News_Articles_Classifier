And you need to install Buttons Back, a Firefox add-on that moves the stop/reload and home buttons back to the start of the address bar. \nDownload the theme from Deviant Art once you have installed the two add-ons in Firefox and restarted the browser. Extract it afterwards on your system and open the folder afterwards. \nOpen the Main Theme folder and load the text file located in it in a plain text editor. Use Ctrl-a to highlight everything and Ctrl-c to copy the contents to the clipboard. \nSwitch to Firefox afterwards, load about:addons in the address bar and hit enter. Switch to the user styles sidebar entry and select \"write new style\" from the top. \nEnter a name for the new style and paste all contents into the editor afterwards using Ctrl-v. Click the save button in the end to complete the process. \nYou should see the changes immediately as the style information are picked up by Firefox automatically when you hit the save button. \nIf everything went well Firefox should now look a lot more like Microsoft Edge. This not only includes colors and the general layout of the browser but also the menu which looks more like Edge's menu when you open it as you can see on the screenshot above. \nI have not tested this under older versions of Windows or other operating systems but I see no reason why the theme should not work in those versions as well. \nYou can undo all changes at any time by disabling or removing the Edge style again from the Firefox browser in the add-ons manager. \nNow You : Are you using a custom theme in Firefox?
