Although the manufacturer could be working on this mini model, it is yet to reveal its hardware details. \nNow, GforGames has claimed that it has received tips from sources who disclosed a bunch of hardware specifications. However, the prototype details are at least a couple of months old and could be subjected to change in due course of development. \nAccording to the site, the OnePlus Mini will pack MediaTek's Helio X10 chipset, that features an octa-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz with 64-bit computing, paired with 2GB (LPDDR3) RAM. Besides, it will have 32GB storage capacity, which is expandable via microSD card. As its name suggests, the phone will sport a 5in screen with resolution at 1920x1080 pixels. Corning's Gorilla Glass version 3 or, 4 will cover the screen that will be protected by an oleophobic and hydrophobic coating. \nThe device will incorporate Sony's 13 megapixel IMX258 camera sensor at the back, which is capable of 4K video recording at 30FPS and a dual-tone LED flash. In the front, expect a five megapixel selfie camera with 1080p video recording feature. \nOnePlus' rumoured mini model might end up using the same camera and display as we have seen in Xiaomi's Mi 4c. Other key elements are a non-removable battery of 3000-3100mAh power, USB Type-C connector with Quick charger 2.0, Bluetooth v4.1, IR Blaster, front-facing speaker of 1.2W. The NFC chip in the mini phone will support Android Pay in conjunction with a fingerprint scanner at the back of the phone. \nMediaTek might also make a kernel source code available allowing developers to build custom ROM for the smartphone. Besides, the Mini version will have the ability to render 3D games at 720p resolution and upscale the image back to 1080p. This is to improve the performance, while reducing the heat output and power consumption. \nThe handset is rumoured to be launched by the end-2015 and is likely to be priced at $250 (Â£165).
