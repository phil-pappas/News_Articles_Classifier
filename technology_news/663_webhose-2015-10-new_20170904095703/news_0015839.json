This year’s Fast 100 assessed companies from nearly every industry and found SunLink to be the fastest growing solar company in a region known for its rapid pace of business. Making number 23 on the list of overall companies, SunLink is a leader in the solar energy project solutions space, regarded for its highly engineered products and solar project-related services that have been implemented in connection with more than 1GW of solar projects across North America. \n“The solar industry is at a pivotal point where we’re moving from a decade best described as the 'wild west' to a more mature playing field where the companies with bold vision and solid execution are driving not just renewables but the entire energy sector to the next level. As this award and our growth underscores, SunLink is one of those propelling the industry forward,” said Michael Maulick, CEO of SunLink. “Like so many of our distinguished peers on this list, we’re moving faster and further ahead by removing the barriers that hinder our industry’s momentum; dreaming big and pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone; and investing in an incredibly talented team that is extremely creative and methodical - structurally, and mechanically. In addition we execute! This honor is shared with the entire SunLink family, who are working tirelessly to achieve what we all aspire our company to be – the energy solutions company leading the way to universal solar power adoption and a brighter future for generations to come.” \nThe growth recognized by the Fast 100 is illustrated in part by SunLink’s series of successes including new product and service offerings, large customer project wins and a renewed leadership team. SunLink CEO Michael Maulick took the helm starting in January 2015 and has grown his executive team with key hires such as a recently appointed new CFO , Ken Schwarz.
