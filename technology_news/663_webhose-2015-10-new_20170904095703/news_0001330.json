The company said a contractual option covers the overhaul of Markersbach's four remaining generators at a rate of one unit per year. \nWork from the first contract is expected to be completed in the coming spring, with the second contract to be finished by February 2017. \nMarkersbach was commissioned in 1979 and is the second-largest pumped-storage project in Germany. Alstom said the rehabilitation project is necessary due to a number of machine components reaching the end of their service lives. \nVattenfall Europe Generation, the German unit of Sweden-based Vattenfall AB, has performed numerous modifications to Markersbach since it was put into operation. In 2013, it took bids to expand the upper and lower reservoirs of the project. In 2012, the utility took bids for concrete work at 11 hydro projects including Markersbach. Most recently, Vattenfall sought bids to upgrade and repair pump-turbines and other equipment in March 2014 . \nFor more rehabilitation and repair news, visit here . Did You Like this Article?
