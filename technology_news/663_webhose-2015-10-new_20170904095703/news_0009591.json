The Career Color Test, according to Myverse, is based on psychometrics, a field of psychology that attempts to discover how an individual's mind works in a quantifiable way. \nIn the early 1900s, researcher Max Luscher, studying color psychology, found that colors cause certain emotional responses in most people. Psychometrics advocates today believe that determining which colors people respond to are indicators of that person's emotional state. \nThe MyVerse tool uses the color data to tell students what careers best match their psychometric profile. Next, it leads them to videos about the careers and to a list of higher education institutions that may be appropriate. \n\"MyVerse provides a fun, yet reliable, color quiz that speaks the language of today's 21st-century, tech-savvy student,\" said company founder Wayne Sharp. \"We have set out to revolutionize the way students and educators look at education.\" About the Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:48:37.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
