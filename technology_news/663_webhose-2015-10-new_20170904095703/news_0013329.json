Advertisers are expected to spend $70.6 billion this year on TV and $58.6 billion on digital media including mobile, according to research firm eMarketer.\nAs more eyeballs shift to online video on digital services and advertisers get used to the flexibility of buying, selling and placing digital ads on the fly, the pay-TV industry has come under pressure to employ a similar strategy.\n\"Our goal is to go get online (advertising) budgets,\" Gaynor said.\nPay-TV providers like Dish collect customer data through their set-top boxes that is already being used for targeted advertising. Dish will use 80 specifications such age, gender, and education and plans to bring in more data sets moving forward to make targeting more sophisticated, Gaynor said.\nDish's set-top boxes collect data on whether the ad ran on the TV set or was skipped that is feedback for advertisers, Gaynor said.\nOn the Web, ads can be placed instantly. Television ads can be bought in real-time but it takes a couple of days to be slotted into programing, he added.\nLate last year, Walt Disney Co's ( DIS.N ) ESPN experimented with programmatic ad auctions for its SportsCenter show. Disney's ABC and Comcast Corp's ( CMCSA.O ) NBC have dipped their toes into programmatic ad-buying on their online video offerings but not yet on television programing.\nWhile the networks ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox and their affiliates sell ad slots independently, programmers such as the Food Network could use Dish's automated ad market, Gaynor said.\n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:38:44.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
