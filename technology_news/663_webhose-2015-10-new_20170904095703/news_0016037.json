The school is scheduled to open in fall 2016. Harford, who serves as a founding board member of the school, volunteered for the position. “I am so pleased Joe is serving as a founding member of our virtual school, and now the entire board is especially grateful to have him as our board secretary,” says David Taylor, president of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association. “We have every hope that the Commonwealth will approve this cutting-edge opportunity for students to receive individualized, information-technology-powered online instruction that helps each one reach the fullness of his or her God-given potential.”\nAdvance's mission is to help each student maximize his or her potential and meet the highest performance standards through a uniquely individualized learning program through flexible pacing and 21st century learning opportunities including hands on STEM activities and experiences.\n“What a terrific concept,” Harford says. “There is clearly a need for alternative ways of learning so kids can take an individualized approach to their education.” He says the school’s emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) will help the state’s students gain valuable skills for workplace success in the 21st Century.”\nHarford has a passion for education and volunteers regularly for the Foundation for Free Enterprise Education.\n###\nAbout Reclamere - http://www.reclamere.com\nReclamere, Inc. is a data security company offering a full range of specialized data destruction and data security services.
