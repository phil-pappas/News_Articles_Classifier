Microsoft is set to unveil the new devices at an event in New York City beginning at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday. While Microsoft is keeping its agenda under wraps until the big event, the company has sent out a few emails teasing the big surprises. Windows 10 Is Here: What You Need to Know The main attraction is expected to be a follow-up to Microsoft's popular Surface Pro 3 tablet, which offers the same utility as a tablet and when paired with a snap on keyboard, becomes a laptop. \"Both Google and Apple have followed Microsoft's lead creating the 2-in-1 category and this event will reveal how Microsoft one-ups the companies who recently launched the Pixel C and the iPad Pro,\" Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told ABC News. Microsoft is expected to release at least one new smartphone, hoping to drum up excitement in an area where the company has lagged behind competitors. \"Microsoft hasn't been doing well in phones, so they will need to show off something big to become relevant again in smartphones,\" moorhead said. Also look for an update to Microsoft's first-ever wearable, the Microsoft Band. The sensor-packed wearable measures everything from sleep, activity and heart rate while also giving users the option of receiving haptic feedback throughout the day so they can be alerted to new text messages or Twitter mentions. The launch will kick off a slew of more hardware events -- this time with partners -- on Microsoft's schedule for October. Following the Windows 10 event, Microsoft executives will be in Barcelona on Wednesday with HP, New York on Thursday with Dell and in San Francisco on Friday with ASUS. The schedule is also packed the following week with an event in Taiwan with Acer, in Tokyo with Toshiba and culminating with a Lenovo announcement in San Francisco. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:49:52.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
