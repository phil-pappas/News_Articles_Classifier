The firm owns Facebook shares. “They’ve seen strong growth in advertising spending and viewership.”\nThis isn’t Facebook’s first flirtation with the $100 level. On July 21, the stock came within 1.6 percent of breaking it. It then became mired in the August stock market selloff, dropping 14 percent over three days to a two-month low. Since then it’s shown resilience, rallying back 21 percent.\nFacebook joins 109 other members of the benchmark index in the three-digit club amid speculation that the company will continue to increase mobile-advertising sales on its application and others. Its ascent comes at a time when stock splits are increasingly rare in an American stock market that is dominated by institutional investors and exchange-traded funds that don’t care about the absolute price of a share.\nAlong with Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc., Facebook is one of a quintet of technology giants that together make up almost 10 percent of the S&P 500 and more than a third of the Nasdaq 100. It’s the world’s seventh largest company, surpassing old economy stalwarts such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Johnson & Johnson.\nTechnology stocks have been by far the biggest contributors to S&P 500’s recovery from a 10-month low, rising 14 percent since the market bottomed on Aug. 25 and contributing 17.5 points to the S&P 500’s 184-point increase.\n“Facebook has really established itself as a force,” Ghriskey said. “Reaching this level is a testament to the job management has done and the dominant product it is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:00:02.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
