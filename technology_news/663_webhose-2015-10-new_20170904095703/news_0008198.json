After a fruitful internship beginning in September last year, Iyayi started a full-time role at the company as a Commercial Strategy Analyst at the beginning of this year.\n\nHaving just completed a Masters degree in Engineering Management, Iyayi believes that his unique skillset, communications techniques and general competence were the factors that helped his success during the competitive recruitment process. \n\n\"I heard about the position when I was contacted directly by Philip Morris International after UOWD's Career Fair. I was attracted to the role because as a Commercial Analyst you can have an impact on all functions within an organisation. I really enjoy working in a team that constantly seeks new ways to help the business innovate\" Iyayi said of his success.\n\nMaster of Applied Finance and Banking graduate Adeyemi David Adebanjo is also thriving in his role as a Corporate Office Executive Assistant at Khalifa Port. \"My strong head for numbers and logical way of thinking has really helped me to expand my role to encompass project management and financial modelling \" the Nigerian explained. \"The support given by UOWD's career department helped the recruitment process run smoothly and I can't thank them enough for their efforts in facilitating the process.\"\n\nCornelio Gomes, UOWD's Career Development Centre Coordinator said, \"Nothing gives more job satisfaction than learning that UOWD's students and alumni are thriving in roles at some of the most well-respected firms in the UAE. The three students mentioned are just a small number of a plethora of others who have been successful in securing their dream first step on the career ladder, which I believe is a huge testament to how UOWD is focused on understanding and meeting the demands of businesses in the UAE and beyond.\" \n\nAbout 3 UOWD \n3 UOWD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:50:52.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
