Now, civil rights groups say it's \"dangerous\" and an invasion of your privacy. \nRight now, police cars across the nation are taking hundreds of photos. Every car that passes by in front, in back, and even on the side is targeted. Police even inspect each car's make, the model, and the license plate. \nNew cameras are helping police track criminals across the country, suspects they couldn't normally spot. In Louisiana, cops found a kidnapping suspect using these cameras. The same thing with this suspect wanted for shooting and killing a college professor. Even for the reporter and her cameraman gunned down during a live news report in Virginia, police used this camera technology to find the suspect. \nSo just how does this work? Corporal Kenneth Michels explains that the device is made up of three cameras, all mounted at different angles. \n\"It captures the tags and then runs it through the database,\" Michels said. \nIn Coatesville, Pennsylvania, police invited NBC News in to show it off. Instantly, alarms are going off for cars with open violations. \n\"Every car we're passing or that is passing us, no matter if it's parked or moving, the camera is picking it up and running it,\" Michels explained. \"They're extremely helpful to us. I can't run every tag that I pass or passes me without it.\" \nAnd it's not just random. Police can actually target track specific cars. \nBut critics say this new technology is a violation of our rights as an invasion of privacy with cops knowing where you are, when you're there, and then save the information. \nThe ACLU even filed lawsuits against it in at least four states. \n\"What's being created here is the potential to hit rewind on anybody's life,\" ACLU's Jay Stanley stated. \"If for some reason you come up to the attention of the authorities, they can pull up this database. If they have years and years of your comings and goings, that's a very powerful set of information that could potentially be used against you.\"Police have fired back saying you have no expectation of privacy when you're out on the street and in public. \nIn Coatesville, Pennsylvania, the police department says they store the data for about 30 days, but other police departments keep it for much, much longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:07:45.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
