The TIO results are backed by our quarterly national polling which also shows steady improvements in customer satisfaction since the commencement of the polling two and a half years ago,” Communications Alliance Director of Program Management, Christiane Gillespie-Jones, said.\n“This improvement stems from various factors, including huge investments into improved networks, a strong Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code and, most importantly, an industry-wide commitment to deliver an outstanding customer experience to customers.”\nLandline complaints also increased slightly year-on-year.\nNBN has been contacted for comment.\nThis article was first published in The Australian.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:42:43.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
