Allan Reinikka Rokascience Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nAGRICULTURE of the future will see farmers testing and tracking every aspect of their property to make specific decisions unique to their crops or livestock. \nThat's the view of CQUniversity Agriculture Professor Dave Swain, whose research has looked at how studying livestock behaviour can give information about various elements of management. \nProf Swain spoke to The Morning Bulletin about Rockhampton Regional Council's plans to incorporate more technology into the city, focused on supporting agriculture, aquaculture and mining sectors. \nWhile he didn't want to talk specifically about council's plans without detailed information on the strategy, Prof Swain said it was good for the region to start focusing on smart technology for agriculture. \nProf Swain has been working to develop technology across a range of platforms, providing the most up-to-date information from data banks to farmer. \nSome of the technology includes walk over weighing technology, and information to identify when and where cows calve. \nThe data gathered can help producers improve their herd genetically, as Prof Swain said the dairy industry had done to improve milk production. \nIn the future, Prof Swain sees farmers testing across their whole property to make more informed decisions for their livestock. \n\"We're taking the research methodology and making it available for every farmer,\" he said. \nProf Swain said an increased focus on emerging technology in Rockhampton could produce a new way of looking at science, the environment and agriculture. \nHe cited the early 1990s, where a vision to map the human genome seemed like a distant goal but, as the science developed, there was a massive change in scientific discovery, making it now possible to map a genome in days, not years. \n\"At a philosophical level, the investment and development of high-tech information communication science in the heart of an agricultural region could completely revolutionise the way science underpins agricultural innovation,\" Prof Swain said. \n\"We do need to think carefully about what that technology is, ensuring we are using appropriate technology to meet emerging industry needs. \n\"The council proposal would make most sense if it's coupled with the university's focus on precision agriculture and precision livestock so that we can create real value.\" agriculture", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:22:42.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
