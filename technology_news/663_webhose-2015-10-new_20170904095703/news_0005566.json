With Libris, the institutions can automate image distribution, tag images for search, grant permissions, preserve and protect image use and archives. The platform also allows schools to sell images, turning campus photography into a revenue stream. \n\"With the popularity of social media, we like to get images out while events are still going on,\" said Paul Sadler, creative services manager at Purdue University, in a statement. \"We usually have photographers shooting five or more events each weekend with hundreds of images being uploaded at a time. During a football game, our photographers will upload a few select images every time out and then our social media operators and designers in the press box can grab them from the Libris gallery to post in-game graphics on our social outlets. Libris makes it easy for all of our sport communication directors to access and share their photos in one central location.\" \n\"Showing how we're the right choice for prospective students and their parents involves high quality, creative and compelling images,\" noted Steve Latham, director of photographic services at Jacksonville State University. \"Without a way to get those images to our marketing team members and public relations specialists, well, that story is much harder to tell and makes competing with other higher education institutions much more difficult. Libris enables us to quickly and efficiently distribute images to campus clients, media, printers, publications, etc. — helping us more effectively tell the JSU story.\" \n\"Visual asset accessibility and searchability were a huge challenge for us. We receive hundreds of images from virtually every one of our university events — and with 16 intercollegiate sports, that's a lot of photos,\" said Andy Seeley, assistant director of athletics at the University of Central Florida. \"We now have the ability to quickly and easily access, search and share images with media members, colleagues and others who need them.\" \nFor more information, visit the PhotoShelther Libris site .
