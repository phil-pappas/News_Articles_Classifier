This consistent design provides customers the choice of switching silicon options in one open switch platform, thereby reducing service and support costs and speeding development and deployment of common software applications across 100GbE switch offerings. \n“Cloud data center operators, telecommunications service providers and enterprises are all planning the deployment of next generation 25GbE and 100GbE infrastructures that can support increased capacity and services delivery with the automation, choice and control that open infrastructures provide,” said George Tchaparian, GM Data Center Networks at Accton Technology and CEO at Edgecore Networks. “Accton’s contribution of our second 100GbE switch design to OCP, and the industry’s first OCP contribution based on the Cavium XPliant switch ASIC, will further expand open network choices for use cases ranging from cloud data center fabrics and data center interconnect to central offices, Internet Exchanges, monitoring and analytics networks, and web-scale enterprises.” \nFeatures and Availability \nAccton’s subsidiary, Edgecore Networks, is now offering prototype units of the AS7500-32X 100GbE open network switch for evaluation and software development. Edgecore Networks will exhibit its open network switches at VMworld Europe 2015 in Barcelona in booth E146 from October 12-15, and at the SDN & OpenFlow World Congress in Dusseldorf from October 12-16. \nThe Edgecore AS7500-32X switch has thirty-two QSFP28 ports in a 1U form factor, with each port supporting 100GbE, 2x50GbE, 40GbE, 4x25GbE or 4x10GbE connections. The AS7500-32X design is based on the Cavium XPliant switch ASIC, with a choice of CPU daughter modules based on Freescale™ T2080 processor, Intel® Atom®C2538 processor and Intel Xeon® D processor. The design supports options required in data center environments with AC, -48VDC or 12VDC power inputs, power-to-port or port-to-power airflow direction, and mounting in standard 19” rack or in an OCP Open Rack with the Open Rack Switch Adapter. \nThe Edgecore AS7500-32X switch supports the following OCP open source software: Open Network Install Environment (ONIE), the universal Network Operating System (NOS) loader, which enables automated loading of compatible commercial and open-source NOS software; Open Network Linux, an open-source reference OS platform for organizations developing and customizing switch software applications; and Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI), a standard interface to ASICs from multiple vendors, allowing greater portability and faster introduction of NOS and application software for open switches. \nSupporting Quotes \n“Accton is a strong contributor to OCP, with earlier contributions of 10GbE, 40GbE and 100GbE switch designs, and as a charter member of the UNH-IOL Open Networking Test Services Consortium which publishes interoperability test results for OCP networking equipment. We welcome Accton’s contribution of this additional 100GbE switch design, the first design submitted to OCP based on the Cavium XPliant switch ASIC, which further assures network operators that the open community is providing more technology choices as they increase the capacity of their web-scale infrastructures. Further, as it supports OCP software such as ONIE, Open Network Linux and the Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI), this new switch is truly advancing the disaggregated hardware and software vision of the OCP Networking Project. We are looking forward to discussing and reviewing Accton’s latest contribution within OCP’s networking community.”— \nOmar Baldonado and Carlos Cardenas, OCP Networking Co-Chairs \n“Cavium has worked closely with Accton on the design of the AS7500-32X open network switch and is pleased to see its contribution to OCP. The combination of the leading performance and programmability of the Cavium XPliant switch ASIC, the availability of open source software tools to speed switch software development, and Accton’s opening of the switch design will allow customers to migrate to 25 GbE and 100 GbE open network infrastructures with advanced automation and analytics capabilities.”— \nEric Hayes, VP/GM Switch Platform Group, Cavium \n\"We're excited to see this contribution by Accton of its second 100 GbE switch design to the Open Compute Project, and pleased to collaborate with Accton to enable Open Network Linux support on this Cavium XPliant-based switch. This is further proof of the power of the open network community to deliver an increasing set of choices to customers as they implement open network infrastructures.\"— \nRob Sherwood, CTO, Big Switch Networks \n“Open networking is accelerating and the eco-system is getting richer with more choices. Accton is a leader in open networking hardware, offering broad choice of switch configurations and now silicon options. This enables an open market for networking and ultimately provides customer value.\"— \nWilliam Choe, VP Products and Alliances, Cumulus Networks ® \n“Accton’s AS7500-32X switch offers a powerful new option for data center administrators looking to build open network solutions based on an open and standard Linux ecosystem. Our PicOS network operating system is an important part of the overall open network ecosystem, bringing both Layer 2/Layer 3 networking as well as OpenFlow-based SDN to network architects.”— \nJames Liao, CEO, Pica8 Inc. \nAbout Accton Technology \nAccton Technology Corporation is a global premier provider of networking and communications solutions for top tier networking, computer and telecommunications vendors.
