Hoverboard company comes up with boxing clever solution to beating the ban. AirWheel \nThe hoverboard has been officially banned for use on public roads and pavements, but that hasn't stopped one manufacturer coming up with a cheeky way to try and beat the ban. The electric self-balancing boards, which users stand on to be whizzed about, were hit with a 180-year-old Highway Act stating vehicles must be registered and drivers insured, and as they can't they were banned. \nAirWheel, a producer of a number of Segway style gadgets that are now curbed by the law, has launched a product to make a statement against the ban: the Hover Box . The tongue-in-cheek item, which is essentially a tatty cardboard box with two leg holes haphazardly cut out, covers the hoverboard and is \"designed to allow users to ride without unwanted attention\". \nNothing to see here officer. SIGN THIS AND LETS GET THESE LEGAL https://www.change.org/p/george-eustice-mp-david-cameron-mp-rt-hon-patrick-mcloughlin-to-review-the-laws-of-using-electric-self-balancing-boards-and-unicycles-in-public-places?recruiter=84028980&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylinkwww.theairwheel.com Posted by Scott Young on Tuesday, 13 October 2015 \nIt appeared on the AirWheel website's shop section retailing at £4.99 (but obviously out of stock as it's still not legal to use it) as a way to show how ridiculous and unfair they feel the ban is . \"We've done it to retaliate in a bit of a ridiculous way to what is a ridiculous law. The law shouldn't apply to our units. It was created over a hundred years ago. It even mentioned a horse and cart,\" Scott Fidgett, AirWheel Director, told the Independent . \nThe company also posted spoof videos on its Facebook page of the 'high-tech solution' titled \"Nothing to see here officer\", where the Hover Box is in action with a fake police office featured in the clips looking comically confused as a user hovers past with a cardboard box covering his feet. \nAirBoard customer finds a sneaky way around the \"law\" We are in the process of finding out exactly how on earth these units fit under this \"law\" Posted by Airwheel on Tuesday, 13 October 2015 \n\"The world's going mad. I mean, where will it all end? You'll get to the point where people won't even be able to walk down the street,\" Fidgett explained. \nThe stunt has received positive reaction, clocking up over two million views, and will add weight to the company's campaign along with their petition to politicians to overturn the archaic ban. \nThose who think this is an actual legal loophole to beat the ban and still use your hoverboards on public roads and pathways must realise that it is not. It's a joke. Using your hoverboard could result in a £500 penalty and your cardboard box taken away. \nDo you think the hoverboard ban was unfair?
