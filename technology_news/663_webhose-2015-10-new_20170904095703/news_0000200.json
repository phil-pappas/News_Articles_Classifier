Revenue grew 9 percent to $404 million.\nIt was forecast to earn 98 cents a share on revenue of $403 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\"This is another good quarter with cyber security tailwinds and healthy execution helping the company navigate a choppy IT spending environment,\" said FBR Capital Markets managing director Daniel Ives, noting the company was well positioned to gain market share.\nCheck Point, which has added over 600 workers in 2015, forecast fourth-quarter EPS excluding one-time items of between $1.10 and $1.18 on revenue of $440 to $470 million. Analysts were forecasting it will earn $1.11 on revenue of $456.5 million.\nShwed raised his full-year adjusted profit forecast to between $4.08 and $4.16 a share from a previous $3.90 to $4.02 and narrowed the range for his revenue outlook to between $1.612 and $1.642 billion.\nIves, who rates Check Point \"outperform\", said the outlook was \"better than feared\" after companies such as Fortinet and Barracuda Networks disappointed investors in recent weeks.\n(Additional reporting by Steven Scheer ; Editing by David Holmes )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:43:05.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
