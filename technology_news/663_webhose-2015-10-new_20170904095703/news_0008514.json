As well demonstrating the strength and capacity of the Ooredoo Supernet, supported by Nokia Networks' technology, it also provided an ideal test for the next generation of NETGEAR Wi-Fi hotspots. Ooredoo has recently signed an agreement with NETGEAR to launch a new range of 4G and 4G LTE smart devices in Qatar, the company said in a statement.\n\nWaleed Al Sayed, Chief Operating Officer, Ooredoo Qatar, said: \"The Ooredoo Supernet is setting new records across the region through its speed, quality and coverage. By reaching this peak data rate of close to 600 Mbps in test conditions, we are setting new benchmarks for what can be achieved.\n\nThe next generation of mobile networks will provide the foundations for the smart city environments of the future and ensure we are fully-ready for 5G, which is why we're working with our partners to push the top speed and capacity limits.\" While the 600 Mbps speeds are currently not accessible on commercially-available devices in Qatar and outside of speed test conditions, Ooredoo is continuing to deliver performance upgrades and network enhancements to keep the Ooredoo Supernet at the cutting-edge.\n\nBernard Najm, Vice President and Head of Middle East and Africa, Nokia Networks, said: \"With our sharp focus on innovation in our technologies, we are committed to supporting Ooredoo in setting new benchmarks and providing higher speed networks to cater to the ever increasing demands of its customers. Nokia Networks continues to deliver LTE-Advanced data rates in all three technology dimensions spectrum, cells and efficiency and we're proud to build on our relationship with Ooredoo to bring these new breakthroughs to Qatar.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:46:18.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
