To serve this market HT Micron has invested over R$ 165 million to build the largest semiconductor facility in Latin America. With 10 thousand square meters that includes 7,500 m&sup2; of cleanroom, the company produces some of the world's most advanced technologies for Packaging and Test of NAND and DRAM.\nThe MES was considered critical to success. In the short term, the company needed it to get on the approved vendor list of global Tier 1 customers. But mid to long term, HT Micron needed it to stay efficient and flexible as volume and product mix grow.\n “cmNavigo is a well-designed system compared to demos and site visits of the competition. We believe Critical Manufacturing has the best chance to succeed in meeting our goals. They were agile in implementation. Given our time constraints, their speed is hard to match.” -- Scott Van Etten, Plant Manager, HT Micron.\nUpon the selection of Critical Manufacturing’s MES, The first phase of the implementation project was a success with a record time implementation, which allowed HT Micron to successfully qualify for the Tier 1 customers that they targeted in 2015.\n “Ever heard of a high-volume semiconductor back-end implementing MES in just two months? Now you have” -- Julie Fraser, Principal Consultant at IYNO Advisors.\nDetails on selection and implementation process are available in a new case study now available from IYNO Advisors, titled “Greenfield Speed to MES Delivers First Round Win” .\nABOUT IYNO ADVISORS\nIyno Advisors combines experience, intuition, intellect, and research to focuses on how manufacturing and production companies and their network of partners can best benefit from software applications and services.\nwww.iyno.com +1 508.362.3480\nABOUT CRITICAL MANUFACTURING\nCritical Manufacturing provides innovative software technology and advanced services that empower operations for some of the most advanced manufacturers worldwide.
