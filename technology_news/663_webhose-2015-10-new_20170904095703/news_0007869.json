In response, Ergotron, Inc., a global leader of ergonomic healthcare mounting and mobility solutions, has launched the SV10 series of its StyleView® Medical Carts, its lightest cart yet, for a wide array of laptops and tablets. In addition, one cart, the StyleView S-Tablet Cart SV10 was developed exclusively for Microsoft Surface and is compatible with all Surface devices. The SV10 series is the first new offering and collaborative design from Ergotron and Anthro Corporation engineering, since the acquisition earlier this year . \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275848 \n\"When it comes to quality patient care, proper device and equipment use has many challenges,\" said Bob Hill , Ergotron's healthcare industry manager. \"If the necessary equipment doesn't fit within nurse's clinical workflow or is uncomfortable to work on, not only will EHR systems never reach their full potential, but it can also limit caregivers ability to execute their jobs and can ultimately impact the quality of care patients receive. By placing the technology in a format nurses already trust, such as Ergotron's StyleView Medical Cart line, those challenges are diminished, helping to ensure positive patient outcomes, and extending nurse comfort.\" \nWeighing just over 30 lbs. (15 kg), the SV10 cart has a patented lift engine that offers caregivers 15\" (38 cm) of vertical travel for both seated and standing use. Its integrated hand-brake secures the platform height to provide an ultra-stable worksurface that is smooth and easy to clean. The t-slot channel interface on the cart's column allows for integration of accessories to customize a solution that's right for a variety of applications for both nurses and technicians. Ergotron's Add-on Power systems can be used to help power a tablet or laptop throughout a shift. \n\"Nurses have been asking for a lightweight cart that would still offer all the features they love, but in an entirely smaller form factor,\" continued Hill. \"With the SV10, hospitals and IT staff have a customizable solution that will address their growing device usage from a brand they already trust.\" \nThe SV10 series will be debuted at the 2015 Cerner Health Conference in Kansas City .
