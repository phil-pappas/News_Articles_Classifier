Picture: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg \nYou might have heard of the newest app controversy surrounding Peeple, an app that lets you rate human beings like restaurants or hotels. It’s caused a chuckle or two in recent days, so we thought we’d cast a glance at some of the other worst apps to grace your devices. \nI Am Important \nThe iOS app, which was released in 2011, sought to make users feel important by creating fake contacts and diary events. The app also asked you about your day, presumably because no one else would. \nWill you marry me? \nWe’re loath to tell anyone how to propose as it’s entirely up to individuals how and if they ever want to do it. Except for this: do not use this app to propose. This is a line in the sand of society no one should willingly cross. \nSend me to heaven \nThis app records how high you throw your phone and places you on a global leader board for the highest throws. Presumably there are hundreds of scores which could not be logged because of the sheer distance the phones were launched, before landing on an unforgiving surface. It was removed by the Apple App Store, but remains, unfathomably, available on Android devices. \nTweetpee \nTweetpee consists of a sensor that you attach to a child’s nappy, which will send a tweet to the parent when the child has urinated and the parent has the option to immediately retweet. While the sensor idea is possibly quite useful to new parents, the tweeting part of the whole procedure is an unmitigated disaster. No one wants to know when your child has peed. \nIAmAMan \nThe idea of a man checking a woman’s menstrual cycle is a little creepy, as there are few reasons this wouldn’t be used as an invasive monitoring tool. But let’s give the app the benefit of the doubt – maybe it’s for family planning for hopeful fathers? Somehow? \nHere’s the app’s description of features: \n– Trace your girlfriend’s periods. \n– Set a master password for the whole program. \n– Set personal passwords for every girl. \n– Make calls by simply tapping on her name. \nOh, okay then, never mind. \nI am Rich \nThe sole purpose of the app, which cost £599.99, was to show people that you could afford it. The application was removed from the App Store the day after its release. “You there. Look at this app I’ve just purchased.”– The Independent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:58:06.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
