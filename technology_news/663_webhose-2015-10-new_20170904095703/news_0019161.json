Its revenue also dropped sharply to NT$21.4 billion from NT$41.9 billion in the same period last year.\nThe downbeat results came as no surprise as HTC has issued a profit warning and announced a series of restructuring efforts including job cuts in response to sluggish demand and weak sales in China.\nOnce the world's top smartphone maker by volume, HTC in 2013 fell out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments. The Taiwanese company's global market share has dropped to less than 2% in the past few years from double digits previously.\nWrite to Lorraine Luk at lorraine.luk@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\nOctober 05, 2015 07:45 ET (11:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:29:35.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
