La Monica @CNNTech Jack Dorsey takes helm at Twitter Jack Dorsey is Twitter's new CEO -- permanently. \nInvestors had been calling on the company's board to appoint co-founder Dorsey as permanent CEO since July 1, when he was named interim chief after Dick Costolo stepped down . Twitter made it official Monday morning. \nDorsey will also remain CEO of Square, a mobile payments startup he also co-founded that is reportedly preparing for an IPO. \nWhether he would hold the top job at both companies had been a matter of speculation. \nShortly after Twitter named Dorsey interim CEO, the board put out a statement that seemed to rule him out of the running, saying it only wanted candidates \"in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter.\" \nBut Dorsey tweeted on Monday that \"I've been CEO of both companies for over 3 months now. I have the smartest, strongest, and most determined leaders in the world on my teams.\" \nTwitter director Peter Currie, who led the search committee for a new CEO, said the company interviewed a wide range of candidates and found that Dorsey was \"not just meeting but surpassing expectations as CEO.\" We are naming @adambain COO of Twitter, we're working to change the composition of our Board, and I will serve as CEO of Twitter and Square! — Jack (@jack) October 5, 2015 \nTwitter said in an SEC filing that there are currently no plans to provide Dorsey with any compensation for his role as CEO. But Dorsey is one of Twitter's largest shareholders. His stake in the company is currently worth $575 million. \nDorsey co-founded Twitte ( TWTR , Tech30 ) in 2006, as social media networks were gaining popularity. It quickly took off as an easy and efficient tool to chat and share information online, especially among the tech and media communities, but failed to gain traction among new users. \nDorsey acknowledged this sentiment during a recent Twitter earnings call. \nTo turn around, Dorsey said Twitter must do three things: have more \"disciplined execution\"; simplify so people can learn how to use the service faster; and market it better so people understand why it's important. \n\"'Why Twitter' must be articulated clearly,\" Dorsey said. \"What should you expect from Twitter? To be as easy as looking out your window to see what's happening. To show you what's happening in the world [first], directly from the source.\" \nShares of Twitter rose more than 1% in premarket trading Monday. But the stock has plunged more than 25% this year and has been hovering around $26, the price that Twitter first sold shares to the public at in November 2013. I've been CEO of both companies for over 3 months now. I have the smartest, strongest, and most determined leaders in the world on my teams. — Jack (@jack) October 5, 2015 \nDorsey will no longer serve as Twitter's chairman, and Currie said the company was actively looking for someone to fill that role. \nTwitter also announced that it was promoting Adam Bain, its head of revenue and partnerships, to the role of chief operating officer. \nBain is highly respected at Twitter and has been an instrumental in signing new partnerships at the company, included a recent deal with the National Football League.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:03:44.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
