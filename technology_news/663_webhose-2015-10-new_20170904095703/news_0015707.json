Otherwise it is just on paper,\" he said.\nUnveiling its recommendations on Monday, the OECD said they represented a fundamental shift, though critics said they did not go far enough.\nThe OECD said a conservative estimate of the amount of untaxed money moved by companies into tax havens was $100 billion to $240 billion annually, suggesting tens of billions of dollars in lost tax revenue.\nTax advisers agreed that the measures - which had been debated over the past year - could force many companies to restructure their operations and rethink how they fund themselves.\nThe rules that govern taxation of profits from international commerce date back almost a century.\nHowever, globalisation and technology that allows products and services to be delivered in non-traditional ways have created opportunities for companies to shift profits out of the countries where the money is earned and into jurisdictions such as Luxembourg, Ireland or Bermuda which do not tax them.\nThe technology giants are seen as the most adept at exploiting loopholes, but drug makers, medical device groups, banks, fast food groups and retailers all commonly use contrive arrangements to cut their tax bills.\n(Reporting by Paul Carrel ; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:13:43.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
