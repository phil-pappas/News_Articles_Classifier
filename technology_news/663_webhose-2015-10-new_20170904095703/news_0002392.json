There’s no new navigation interface, no surprise menus, and basically no big changes that will disrupt a traditional Office workflow. Dig past the first impressions, however, and you’ll find that Microsoft has devoted a lot of time to rethinking the way it makes Office, and has laid the groundwork for more flexible, responsive and modern programs down the line. \nCollaboration is the key theme. After watching consumers turn to competitors for cheap and easy collaboration tools, Microsoft started to develop some of those features for the web versions of its programs. With Office 2016, it hit the PC and expanded meaningfully from what we saw in Office 2013. To get a taste of Office 2016, Microsoft lent The Post a Surface tablet pre-loaded with the latest programs. \nPerhaps the biggest everyday user perk is real-time collaboration in Word, giving users the ability to share documents and see what others are typing as they type it. This is something already done in Google Docs. The difference in Office is that, though multiple users can change a document simultaneously, they cannot edit the same line, defusing some of the possibility for tension – and pranking – over a single sentence. \nFast collaboration can still mean potential for mistakes. Mercifully, it’s easy to access the version history in the new Word as well. \nThe focus on collaboration fits right into the messaging we’re seeing from Microsoft’s projects such as Sway, the free online layout and presentation collaboration tool released early last month. The program, which gives you good-looking, no-brainer templates for websites and presentations, is part of the Office suite. \nOther upgrades are welcome, if not earth-shattering. Excel’s main upgrade includes six new chart types, which give you more options for visualising certain data sets. Outlook offers the option to attach a file by putting a link from Microsoft’s OneNote service rather than actually attaching the file, matching Google’s Drive. It also introduces a “Clutter” filter designed to weed out those newsletters that you want but don’t necessarily read all the time – it’s a feature that requires some training to be fully useful, but a great option. PowerPoint remains mostly the same; it could have benefited from the collaboration features we’ve seen in Word – something Microsoft promises is on the way. \nThe real changes are undoubtedly all about access. Crucially, Office 2016 lets you get to your documents from anywhere and on any device, whether that’s a Mac, PC, tablet or phone. \nConstant updates are a perk, and welcome in a technology landscape where new features quickly become must-haves. It’s nice not to have to wait for new features. – Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:24:53.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
