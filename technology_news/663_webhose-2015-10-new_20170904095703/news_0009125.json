This way a number of carbon-based molecules, for instance two active ingredients in sunscreen, can be produced. The results are published in the next edition of the journal Green Chemistry . \nBy combining three different catalytic processes where electrons are moved in a set path, the team has managed to connect aldehydes with alcohols, both carbon-based compounds , by using oxygen. This way they have managed to create new carbon compounds , with water as the only byproduct. \n\"We have developed a catalytic method to use oxygen directly from the air as a raw material in an organic synthesis of fine chemicals. Using oxygen from the air is very desirable since it doesn't cost anything. Three of the molecules we can produce this way is today used in different sorts of sun protection. Two of them, amiloxate and octinoxate, are very common in sunscreen,\" Henrik Sundén says. \nOne advantage with connecting three different catalytic systems is that ineffective and high molecular oxidants may be replaced with oxygen which leads to better atom economy, and a more sustainable process environmentally. It may also be of economic benefit in production of many different carbon compounds. The three solar absorbent molecules are examples of what can be accomplished with the new method. The article shows a total of 20 molecules that the team has produced, but this is merely a selection of what the method can be used for. \n\"We don't know what the current production cost are for these solar absorbent compounds, but since oxygen is free and the method may be used in large scale we are pretty sure that our discovery may lead to a lower production cost. The method, except from lowering the costs, may also enable a reduction of chemical waste from production,\" Henrik Sundén says. Chemists devise better way to prepare workhorse molecules June 9, 2011 \nIn chemistry, so-called aromatic molecules compose a large and versatile family of chemical compounds that are the stuff of pharmaceuticals, electronic materials and consumer products ranging from sunscreen to plastic soda ... Researchers discover a way to tease oxygen molecules from carbon dioxide October 3, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —A small team of researchers with the University of California has found a way break apart carbon dioxide molecules and get carbon atoms and oxygen molecules instead of carbon monoxide and an oxygen atom. In ... Porous material converts CO2 into carbon monoxide and oxygen August 21, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California has developed a porous material that is able to split carbon dioxide molecules into carbon monoxide and oxygen. ...

Surprising source for ancient life biomarker found October 20, 2015 \nStanford scientists have discovered a surprising source for an organic molecule used as an indicator for life on early Earth. Super-slick material makes steel better, stronger, cleaner October 20, 2015 \nSteel is ubiquitous in our daily lives. We cook in stainless steel skillets, ride steel subway cars over steel rails to our offices in steel-framed building. Steel screws hold together broken bones, steel braces straighten ... Why van Gogh's Sunflowers are wilting October 20, 2015 \nThe colour of Vincent van Gogh's famous Sunflowers is changing over time, because of the mixture of pigments used by the Dutch master in his painting. Evidence for the process now comes from a detailed spectroscopic investigation ...
