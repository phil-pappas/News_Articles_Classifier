Ferrari will not receive any of the proceeds from the $859 million IPO, at the midpoint of the range; they will mostly go to Fiat Chrysler.\nFiat Chrysler will maintain an 80 percent stake after the offering and plans to distribute the rest to Fiat Chrysler’s investors by 2016, according to the filing.\nFerrari’s history is rooted in racing. Enzo Ferrari started a team in 1929 called Scuderia Ferrari, but the company didn’t produce its first car until 1947. Two decades later, Fiat acquired a 50 percent stake, which increased to 90 percent after Enzo Ferrari died in 1988. His son, Piero Ferrari , holds the remaining 10 percent, which he will keep after the IPO.\nFerrari shipped a mere 7,255 cars last year, a tactic the company uses to cultivate a reputation for exclusivity. Of course, this low-volume strategy also limits revenue and profit growth, as Ferrari said in the section of its regulatory filing that describes potential risks of investing in the IPO.\nFor the six months through June, net revenue increased 2.8 percent from the same period in 2014, and net profit rose 10 percent, according to the filing.\nOne of Ferrari’s crucial sources of marketing is through its Formula One racing team, which has won 224 Grand Prix races and 15 drivers’ world championships since Formula One began in 1950, the filing showed.\nOther IPOs have sputtered this week. Pure Storage, a data-storage provider, was priced at the midpoint of its marketed range and decreased in its first day of trading Wednesday, while Digicel Group , a mobile and cable services provider, canceled its IPO.\nFerrari’s stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RACE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:28:37.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
