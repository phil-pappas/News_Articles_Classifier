The XSLATE B10 is one of the industry’s most featured, fully rugged tablets to date. The Xplore XSLATE B10 is powered by the latest Intel Core i5-535OU 1.8GHz processor, 8GB RAM, and a 128GB solid state drive. An Intel Core i7 processor is available as an upgrade, as well as 256GB solid state drive. Comprehensive standard I/O features include two USB 3.0, micro SDXC, micro SIM card reader, micro HDMI-out, RS-232 serial-ready port, DC power, and headphones/speaker mini-jack stereo. Integrated options for CAC, NFC, and 1D/2D scanner, give the B10 the flexibility to meet exact user needs. A multi-modal communications suite, including 802.11ac WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, and optional 4G LTE mobile broadband, enables real-time data transfer and uninterrupted communications for field workers. Other integrated features include front and rear cameras and a fingerprint scanner. The XSLATE B10 rugged tablet is a reliable and versatile tool for mobile workers in demanding markets such as telecommunications, utilities, manufacturing, transportation or distribution.\nThe XSLATE B10 tablet includes a Wacom pen digitizer and active pen, the xCapture Pro camera application and an optional integrated barcode scanner. The XSLATE B10 has optional accessories including a removable companion keyboard, office or vehicle docking stations, kickstand, a second hot- swappable battery to extend system runtime to 20 hours, and 2-bay or 6-bay simultaneous battery charging options.\nThe XSlate B10 is remarkably rugged for such a lightweight tablet. It meets MIL-STD 810G and IP65 standards for durability and protection against dirt, dust, water, motion, vibration, temperature, and other factors that would quickly damage a commercial-grade tablet. The tablet can start up in temperatures as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit and operate in temperatures as low as -30 and as high as 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 to +60 degrees Celsius), enough for virtually any conceivable deployment.\n\"The XSLATE B10 is the hardest worker yet. After spending a day on the job with the XLATE B10, you’ll understand why this truly mobile, fully featured tablet PC sets a new standard in ruggedness and connectivity,\" said Mark Holleran, Xplore Technologies President and COO. “Built with unfailing protection in mind, it endures extreme work environments.
