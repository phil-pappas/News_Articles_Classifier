Still, Dudley and Lockhart both cautioned that they would closely monitor the economic data to determine whether and when to endorse a rate increase. \nA third Fed official, Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, also spoke Friday and delivered a more-cautionary message: He urged the Fed to remain patient because inflation remains well below its 2 percent target. \n“Before raising rates, I would like to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to move higher,” Evans said in a speech in Milwaukee, urging an “extra-patient approach” to rate policy. \nEvans is among the Fed’s “doves” – officials who worry more about threats from economic weakness than do “hawks,” who focus more on the risk that inflation could run too high. \nThe mixed messages delivered Friday won’t resolve the uncertainty that has seized investors over whether the Fed will start raising rates from record lows by year’s end. Dudley did signal that though a rate hike at the Oct. 27-28 meeting remains theoretically possible, any increase would more likely occur at the Dec. 15-16 meeting. \n“Have we seen enough information between September and October to convince us to do in October what we didn’t do in September?” Dudley said. “That would be the question I would ask.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:25:29.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
