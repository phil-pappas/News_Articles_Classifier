We’ve done this by running VMware View for VDI, apps (including VDI) in our stores, and internal testing and development. We’ve been impressed with SimpliVity and would recommend them as a vendor partner.” “The University of Namibia saw the value of SimpliVity’s hyperconverged infrastructure just one week after deploying the solution for VDI – increasing our IT performance by 75%,” said Angelo Hammond, System Administrator at the University of Namibia Computer Centre. “Cost-effective VDI was crucial to our implementation, and we needed something in a single, easy-to-manage, scalable package. SimpliVity not only provided those functionalities, but also other key features, including disaster recovery and inline deduplication, compression, and optimization, which put their solution over the top. Plus their customer support is stellar. I have never seen or experienced the level of support from other vendors that SimpliVity provides.\" “Every virtual machine and application that is critical to our business runs on SimpliVity, including VMware View VDI for all task workers. It all goes over our 100Mbps pipe on 15-minute intervals from Alabama to Texas for secure disaster recovery. It’s amazing and has simplified our IT,” states Jeff Byers, IT Director at High Cotton. “SimpliVity continues to make great strides with every release and the new VDI performance results are another testament to their execution excellence,” said Michael Burke, Managing Partner, Virtual Dynamix (VDX). “Their unprecedented desktop density – 250 desktops per node – with high availability and user experience will offer us to offer a more economical solution to our customers without compromising enterprise-grade availability and a consistent end user experience.” “More and more enterprises are looking for an alternative to traditional IT infrastructures for deploying VDI. These enterprises want more than just VM mobility, they want data mobility and more control of their infrastructure,” said Colm Keegan, Senior Analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group, Inc. “Hyperconverged infrastructure is starting to fill that role in the enterprise and will be a game-changer for VDI by allowing enterprises to be more agile, move faster and focus their budgets on what matters – adding business value, not keeping the lights on.” “VDI is often plagued by high costs, unsatisfied users, massive complexity, scaling issues, low performance, and high data protection risks,” said Doron Kempel, CEO, SimpliVity. “Only SimpliVity’s hyperconverged infrastructure has the power to deliver the high performance, scalability, and availability to solve those problems for VDI without compromising user experience or cost efficiency.” \nResources Read the ESG Report and blog Read SimpliVity’s blog on VDI Read more SimpliVity case studies Learn more at SimpliVity’s blog Follow SimpliVity on Twitter , LinkedIn , Facebook , YouTube and Google+ . \nAbout SimpliVity Founded with a mission to simplify IT, SimpliVity is a pioneer in the hyperconverged infrastructure market, disrupting the status quo of complex and cumbersome legacy IT systems.
