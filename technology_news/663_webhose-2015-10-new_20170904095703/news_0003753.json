Educational institutions in this region mostly prefer low-end and mid-market digital oscilloscopes.\" \nAccording to the 2015 edition of digital oscilloscope market research, digital oscilloscopes are more user-friendly than other equipment used to measure electrical voltage or current, as they enable technicians to obtain a graphic visualization of signals during unexpected voltage fluctuations. Other devices such as voltmeters and analog oscilloscopes can indicate and measure signals that occur as a result of unexpected voltage, but digital oscilloscopes are superior because they offer a more comprehensive, visual display that shows the precise shape and timing of the pulse. \nFurther, this digital oscilloscope market report states that standard digital oscilloscopes are not as user-friendly as other models, as they have a black and white digital display that makes it difficult to spot glitches or any other rare and unexpected disturbances and occurreces. Companies like Agilent Technologies, Danaher (Tektronix, Fluke, Keithley Instruments), Teledyne LeCroy, GWInstek America, Rohde & Shwarz, Yokogawa Electric and ZTEC Instruments are mentioned in this research report available for purchase at http://www.rnrmarketresearch.com/contacts/purchase?rname=421069 . \nThis report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global digital oscilloscope market for the period 2014-2019. To calculate the market size, the report covers the sales of digital oscilloscopes worldwide. However, the report does not consider the following to estimate the market size: analog oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, mixed-signal oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, components or devices used in the production of digital oscilloscopes, and aftermarket sales of digital oscilloscopes. \nThe report, Global Digital Oscilloscope Market 2015-2019, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the Americas, APAC, and EMEA; it also covers the landscape of the global digital oscilloscope market and its growth prospects in the coming years.
