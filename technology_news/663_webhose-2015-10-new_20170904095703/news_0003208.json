(NASDAQ: GRMN), today announced the babyCam, the first in-vehicle video monitor that functions wirelessly with a compatible Garmin GPS navigator. 1 Aimed at facilitating driver safety, the babyCam conveniently transmits video 2 to the GPS navigator display. This allows parents or caregivers the benefit of daily route guidance while the babyCam monitors their children in the back seat of a vehicle. Thanks to its night vision, the babyCam also lets drivers view little passengers at night or in low-light conditions without disturbance. The Garmin babyCam is being announced in conjunction with the ABC Kids Expo in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, and will be showcased for the first time in booth #3134. \n“We are excited to be the first company to create a new product category that integrates passenger video monitoring with GPS navigation,” said Dan Bartel, Garmin vice president of worldwide sales. “Having to awkwardly turn around or pull over on the side of the road to check on your child is simply unsafe. With babyCam, parents can easily monitor children as often as they need while running daily errands.” \nDrivers can easily mount the babyCam unit to a front- or back-seat headrest 3 within minutes. The babyCam’s adjustable viewing angle can monitor multiple children in the rear seats of a vehicle. After driving to a destination, the babyCam reminds drivers to check for passengers before exiting the vehicle. This useful on-screen alert helps avoid incidents where a sleeping child or a loved one is accidentally left unattended inside a vehicle. In an effort to keep both hands safely on the wheel, drivers can use compatible voice-activated navigators to control babyCam with their voice. A simple voice command allows users to switch from the Garmin navigation display to the babyCam view. \nWhen paired with a broad range of Garmin navigators 1 for cars, trucks and RV devices, the babyCam syncs seamlessly to the compatible device. Furthermore, the babyCam can be powered wirelessly with two AA batteries (not included), or with a USB power cable (sold separately). The easy-to-use babyCam monitor features a child-friendly design with no sharp edges. \nThe Garmin babyCam is expected to be available in January of 2016 with a suggested retail price of $199.99 (Garmin GPS navigators sold separately).
