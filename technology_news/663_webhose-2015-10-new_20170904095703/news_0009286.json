Drones have been prohibited in Washington since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nThe incident is the third time this year that a drone has landed near the White House.\nIn May, authorities caught a man flying a drone in front of the White House. Another drone crashed onto the White House grounds in January, triggering a lockdown.
