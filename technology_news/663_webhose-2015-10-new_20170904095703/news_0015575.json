The software speaks to you, intuitively leads you to what you need to know and do. That's why Steve Jobs often said that Apple was 'a design company,' not a hardware company.\" \nAnd it's also why, Hambrose adds, many of the 65 people who work at Electronic Ink are behavioral scientists, and why their lab work - studying user interaction, including eye motion - is just as crucial for execution as the data crunchers and graphic designers who package what's up in the client's world. \nSuch as . . . tracking the national power grid in Britain to spot overtaxed regions that \"could bring the system down,\" Hambrose said. An operator once had to consult many screens, risking whiplash. E.I. boiled down the big-picture view to one screen and essential pictorial. \nThe firm also took on a big challenge to make it \"quick and easy\" for people \"of varied experience\" to work equally well as counter persons at a fast-food chain, by having them input orders on an icon-based cash register. \nFor one of the world's leading stock trading institutions, they made it a lot easier to spot fraud that formerly took months of spreadsheet study to find. \nWhen developing tools for clients - such as J&J, Deutsche Bank, Exelon, Reuters, and Comcast - E.I. designers may take the team to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \nWhy? \nThe artful balance of elements in a painting, the way a tapestry weaver has managed to tell a complete story in a single piece, helps the designers craft a similar, multi-scene story that can be read in a glance on a screen. \nSo at an E.I.-enhanced call-center, when a customer's phone number comes up, so too does a visual depiction of his/her \"history\" with the company - a pattern of circles (each representing a year), and graphic icons standing in for products and issues. \nIs the caller a longtime customer who's never phoned in before? Or a distraught sort who's complained numerous times? If the latter's the case, why is the case still open? \nThe screen is designed so all this can be grasped quickly, without an operator putting you on hold. \nA Carnegie Mellon School of Design grad, Hambrose, 48, first aimed to \"work on Madison Avenue, creating glossy advertising campaigns.\" \nThen he lucked into gigs with Citibank, working on their first ATM interface, and in OS2 software design for IBM in Britain, as the only Yank. There's been no turning back. \nWhile software is rarely honored for its aesthetic charms, one E.I. screen for a 911 radio command center made it into an exhibit at New York's Museum of Modern Art. \nAnd this year, E.I. is popping the champagne on its 25th year, always based in Philadelphia for its \"top talent pool,\" Hambrose noted. \"I recently met with a major Silicon Valley investor who said if we'd been based out there, we'd have been 'snapped up years ago by a larger company.' But we've stayed ahead of the curve. We serve an international base of clients. We're definitely happy here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:06:59.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
