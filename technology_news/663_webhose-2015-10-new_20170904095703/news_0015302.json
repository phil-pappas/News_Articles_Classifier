This letter, led by Ellmers, Tom Price, M.D. (R-GA), and David Scott (D-GA) is the latest push from Congress to delay Stage 3. Recently, during a Senate hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, once again pushed for a delay himself, citing the need to push back the making of a final rule until Jan. 1, 2017 due to physicians telling him they are “terrified” of the impending stage of the program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:57:22.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
