By Erin Harris , editor-in-chief, Innovative Retail Technologies \nNovember 2015 Innovative Retail Technologies \nA major technology upgrade helped LIDS Sports Group streamline POS operations and introduced true omni-channel inventory visibility. \nSpecialty omni-channel retailer LIDS Sports Group (LIDS) operates more than 1,300 North American stores as well as a thriving e-commerce site. The company has grown exponentially over the years; in addition to its direct-to-consumer business, LIDS operates Locker Room By LIDS, Clubhouse, and LIDS Team Sports. Like all retailers, inventory visibility is essential to top and bottom line improvement, and LIDS is no different. Because the retailer’s brick-and-mortar stores are regional in nature, each location is packed with products from that particular region’s beloved sports teams as well as national teams. As such, from store to store, as much as 65 percent of stock differs. Larry Havlik, VP of IT systems, and Kevin Thompson, director of applications at LIDS, explain why the company’s goal of making its entire inventory of team-specific sports apparel and memorabilia available in-store, online, or via a mobile device would require a much-needed technology upgrade.
