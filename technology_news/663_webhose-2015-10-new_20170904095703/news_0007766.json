To support its growth plans, API needed to replace its disparate collection of legacy business systems with an integrated enterprise software suite that could help them capitalize on opportunities both now and in the future. \nFollowing a one-year evaluation process involving several major ERP vendors, API chose IFS Applications 9 based on its rich project management functionality and flexible scalability. \n“The patchwork of old business systems often led to incorrect or incomplete calculations of production capacity and sales revenue targets,” said Afif Kamal Fiska, Project Manager for ERP at Arkon Prima Indonesia. “In addition, the non-integrated systems made API’s business processes very complex, even resulting in the company failing to fulfill deliveries promised to clients.” \nIFS Applications will manage Arkon’s complete manufacturing and supply chain requirements with the ability to support both configure- and make-to-order production. Additionally, IFS Applications will also support operational functions within Arkon, including HR, finance, payroll, manufacturing, procurement, inventory planning and replenishment, preventative maintenance, fabrication, and work orders for maintaining the company’s equipment. In addition, IFS Applications will help prepare and track the documentation of all processes. \nPresident Director of Arkon Prima Indonesia, PT Ari Slamet Notokoesoemo added, “IFS Applications is the ultimate operational tool to help API meet current and future challenges and opportunities. The solution will support API’s business transformation process by offering a single-instance ERP solution across all of our departments.” \n“We are delighted and proud to be working with API to implement a comprehensive project-based ERP solution that will support API’s growth and transformation plan,” said Sutan Simandjuntak, President Director at IFS Indonesia. \nFor more information about how IFS helps customers in the manufacturing sector, please visit www.ifsworld.com/en/industries/industrial-manufacturing/ . \nAbout Arkon Prima Indonesia \nArkon Prima Indonesia, PT is a leader in supplying, detailing, fabricating and erecting steelwork in Indonesia established in 1972.
