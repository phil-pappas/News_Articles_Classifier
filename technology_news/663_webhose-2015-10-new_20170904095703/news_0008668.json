Applications last touched that level in July, but before that hadn’t been so low since November 1973.\nThe four-week average of applications, a less volatile measure, dropped to 265,000, the lowest since December 1973.\nThere are signs the economy has slowed in recent weeks, in part because the strong dollar has cut into exports and overall hiring has weakened. Americans have also been reluctant to spend. But faltering growth has not yet led to job cuts.\nStreaming\nNBCUniversal\nadds channel\nNBCUniversal is joining the increasingly crowded streaming party with an advertising-free digital comedy channel called SeeSo that will cost $3.99 a month and offer a mix of original series, NBC late-night shows and content from the broadcaster’s archives.\nUnveiled Thursday morning at the new lower Manhattan offices of NBCUniversal’s Digital Enterprises, the service will start in January and will target an audience of “comedy super fans” with weekly programming, including more than 20 exclusive original series in its first year.\nSeeSo’s programming roster includes an animated series about lobsters; a stand-up series featuring lesbian couple Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher; and a sketch series from the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improv and sketch comedy group. SeeSo will also have scripted series, such as a half-hour comedy about real estate agents called “Bajillion Dollar Propertie$” and “HarmonQuest,” about fantasy role-playing and starring Dan Harmon , the creator of “Community.”\nThe service will also offer NBC classics, including “30 Rock” and “The Office,” and a themed selection of two to five films each month.\nSeeSo will have to battle for attention, because the number of options for streaming television has increased exponentially. At the same time that the streaming services Netflix, Amazon and Hulu pour resources into building out their offerings, traditional media companies like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced digital offerings.\nAutomobiles\nKia recalling\n419,000 SUVs\nKia will recall more than 419,000 SUVs in the U.S. and Canada because the transmission can be shifted out of park when the driver’s foot isn’t on the brake, a violation of safety laws.\nThe recall covers Sorentos from the 2011 through 2013 model years. The cars can roll away unexpectedly and cause a crash, Kia says in documents posted Thursday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .\nThe problem happens when the gear-shift lever is pushed too hard, causing a part in the shift mechanism to crack. It has caused three injuries.\nKia says it began investigating the trouble in August when it got a letter from a lawyer saying that a child moved a Sorento shift lever out of park and the SUV rolled in a parking lot. The child’s father stood in front of the SUV and was joined by his son. The son got between the Sorento and a stopped vehicle and suffered a broken leg, according to the documents.\nEconomy\nConsumer\nprices fall\nThe Labor Department says U.S. consumer prices were dragged lower again last month by plunging energy costs.\nThe consumer price index fell 0.2 percent in September, after a 0.1 percent drop in August. Gas prices fell 9 percent last month after dropping 4.1 percent in August. Overall consumer prices were unchanged over the year.\nExcluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core consumer prices rose 0.2 percent from August and 1.9 percent from September 2014.\nThe Federal Reserve wants to see annual inflation running close to 2 percent. The overall number is well short of that goal, but core inflation is close. \nHousing\nMortgage\nrates go up\nAverage long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose this week yet remained below 4 percent for a 12th straight week.\nMortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.82 percent from 3.76 percent a week earlier. The rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 3.03 percent from 2.99 percent.\nDespite the increase, rates remained well below last year’s levels, providing an inducement for potential home buyers.\nA year ago, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 3.97 percent, while the rate for 15-year loans was 3.18 percent.\nIn recent days, two influential members of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body spoke in favor of postponing an increase in its key short-term interest rate. The Fed has been expected to raise the benchmark rate this year for the first time in nine years.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:25:25.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
