The company defines fair price as one within the 75th percentile of prices available for the member’s local area for substantially similar services on the Angie’s List marketplace. Angie’s Fair Price Guarantee is immediately available to all Angie’s List members. \nAngie’s Service Quality Guarantee promises that if a member purchases services through Angie’s List’s ecommerce marketplace and is not satisfied with the quality delivered by the provider, Angie’s List will help make it right or refund up to the purchase price of the ecommerce offer, up to $100,000. The Service Quality Guarantee is available to Plus and Premium members. Basic membership is not eligible. More information on both guarantees is available on the Angie’s List site. \n“We are so confident in our 20 years of experience and in the quality of the highly-rated service providers, that we have put together what we believe is the most compelling local home services guarantee in the industry,” said Angie’s List Founder Angie Hicks. “We want our members to know that they are getting reliable services at fair prices and that Angie’s List is willing to stand behind their purchases.” \nAngie’s List introduced the Fair Price and Service Quality guarantees to its members through a national TV commercial featuring Angie Hicks. The spot began airing on national cable and broadcast TV this week. \nAngie's List helps facilitate happy transactions between more than three million consumers nationwide and its collection of highly rated service providers in 720 categories of service, ranging from home improvement to health care. Built on a foundation of authentic reviews of local services, Angie's List connects consumers directly to its digital marketplace of services from member-reviewed providers, and offers unique tools and support designed to improve the local service experience for both consumers and service professionals.
