The device saves the user from having to constantly look up words in dictionaries and translation guides. It fosters communication between individuals who speak different languages. The unit eliminates guesswork and confusion. It is designed for ease of use. Additionally, the device is ideal for use by travelers.\nThe original design was submitted to the Ft. Lauderdale office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
