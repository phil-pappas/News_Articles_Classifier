It features a positive displacement auger mechanism in a short, disposable fluid path which minimises cleaning and maintenance.\nThe DFS is an accurate, repeatable dispensing valve suited to a wide range of medium-to-high viscosity materials, such as two part adhesives, solder pastes, RTV silicones, SMD adhesives, thermally conductive pastes and greases. The valve’s disposable auger fluid path module enables the use of materials with a short working life, with challenging cleaning needs, or which are abrasive, and minimises gaps in production which would otherwise require lengthy cleaning of the valve - simply replace the module and continue dispensing. The DFS has a short fluid path overall with no dead space to minimise material wastage and contains a hard wearing acetal auger screw with low surface energy for clean dispensing.\nThe positive displacement auger design ensures precise, repeatable dots and beads for any automated or manually operated dispensing application. The motor-driven auger is run by a fully programmable control unit, with inputs such as speed and time readily saved.\nFor further information please see www.intertronics.co.uk/dv5005dfs or visit their blog at www.adhere.uk.com – also see www.youtube.com/intertronicsadhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:35:56.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
