What we have worked out is a way of automatically assessing the relative impact of these sound errors.\" \nThe algorithms, which makes it possible to tag content and quality, has already been applied to an app for assessing wind noise, which alerts the user when there is significant risk of the sound being affected. \nThe three-year Good Recording Project, led by Salford University, is a response to increasing demand from consumers and from broadcasters who often use amateur footage which is compromised by sound quality . \n\"We're used to having visual processing improving our photos, such as the camera that spots faces and changes exposure, but we have not had the same tools to do the audio equivalent, added Cox. \nRapid quality assessment could determine whether the sound is of broadcast quality without time consuming manual auditioning. Recreate the concert in the living room December 17, 2012 \nHear music of concert hall quality at any place in the room from a stereo recording. The device created by EPFL spin-off Illusonic creates an \"acoustic space.\" Don't shout to be heard—just reduce your acoustic reverberation July 11, 2013 \nSound travels as waves, which continue to bounce off surfaces like walls and ceilings.
