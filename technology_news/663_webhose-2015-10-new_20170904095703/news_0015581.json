It provides a simple way of measuring lung volume and capacity, and is used in pulmonary tests. It helps in diagnosing respiratory diseases (such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and COPD), shortness of breath, exposure to chemicals at work, lung function before surgery, effect of medication, and progress in disease treatment. \nMost spirometers depict a volume time graph and a flow volume graph, which help in examining a patient's pulmonary functions. The application of spirometers has become easier with the help of technological advancements in the field of respiratory care devices. Key factors influencing the growth of the market in the U.S. and Europe are policies mandating the use of respiratory devices, and lack of awareness of respiratory diseases and their symptoms. \nGrowing aging population, rising incidences of chronic obtrusive pulmonary diseases (COPD), technological advancements in the field of respiratory care devices, and tight budgets of healthcare institutions are major factors influencing the growth of the spirometer market. Along with this, high incidences of respiratory diseases, government initiatives, rise in the number of smokers, increasing focus on monitoring respiratory diseases, home use of spirometers, and increasing awareness regarding sophisticated diagnostic techniques are additional factors propelling its market growth. In contrast to this, economic downturn, lack of awareness regarding respiratory diseases and related symptoms, and issues related to reimbursement are some of the major factors restraining the growth of the global spirometer market. \nAsk for PDF Brochure: http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownload.asp?id=18015659 \nSome of the major companies operating in the global Spirometer Market include CareFusion (U.S.), Philips Healthcare ( Netherlands ), Schiller ( Switzerland ), Welch Allyn, Inc.
