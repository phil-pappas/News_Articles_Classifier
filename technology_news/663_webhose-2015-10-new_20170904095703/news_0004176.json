I broke my leg a few months ago I am currently still on crutches! After hours of support, I went to finish an assignment and tried to leave the university a few hours later. I was met as a white women of white privilege, not as a comrade. Irrespective of the fact that I'd been supporting for hours before, I was pushed around, surrounded and screamed at. All sorts of profanities about white privilege were thrown around and I was called a racist. If the fees increase, I will not be able to afford to go to university anymore. I was in tears! All I wanted to do was to go home! It just proves that it turned into a race issue, not a financial one. I am appalled! This incident has been so traumatic for me!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:19:50.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
