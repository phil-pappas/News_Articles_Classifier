Doyal is well-steeped in ethanol production and well-versed on its benefits.

This Saturday, Doyal will brief Car Clinic listeners and viewers on how the ethanol market is evolving and how Minnesota’s initiative in the industry is serving as a blueprint for helping solve future energy & economic challenges. Doyal previews, “Ethanol’s track record of continuous improvement is impressive, but that drive for constant improvement is characteristic of the creative people who make up our industry. The ethanol industry has significant potential to continue to evolve in ways that cannot be matched by petroleum fuels.” He adds, “I will admit that with all the information and misinformation about ethanol, it is sometimes difficult to separate fact from fiction. But I believe that an honest evaluation of our nation’s ethanol industry will reveal a success story of which the American people can be proud. The ethanol industry embodies the kind of forward-thinking and pragmatism that will be needed to meet our nation’s future energy and economic challenges.” Likis remarks, “I’ll ask Randy to tackle some commonly held ethanol myths and to comment on the most pressing continuation of the Renewable Fuel Standard.” He invites, “Drivers, consumers, voters: tune in to Car Clinic for Randy’s plain-speak about ethanol...then you make an informed decision.” To view Doyal’s interview in its entirety, visit www.WatchBobbyLive.com on Saturday, October 17, at 10:41a ET.
