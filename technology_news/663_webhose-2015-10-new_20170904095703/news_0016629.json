Reuters/Joshua Lott by Dina Bass and Brian Womack Dell is reportedly offering about $US33 a share to acquire EMC Corp, in a deal that would create a computing colossus and help both companies cope with a demand slowdown.\nThe proposal includes a tracking stock in VMware valued at about $US8 a share that would be issued to EMC shareholders, said a person familiar with the story. A deal may be announced as soon as Monday, the person said. Dell is speaking to banks about raising at least $US40 billion to finance the purchase, a person with knowledge of the matter has said.\nA deal would bring together the largest storage maker and the No. 2 server company as the industry undergoes rapid change with the shift to mobile and cloud computing. Dell, which was taken private for about $US25 billion in 2013, will use the combination to expand its product lineup in high-end data storage equipment as it tries to lure customers away from Hewlett-Packard Co. and other rivals. For EMC, the agreement resolves a long overdue leadership succession and a standoff with activist investors.\nThe current plan would have Michael Dell run the combined entity, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. EMC and Dell both need ways to manage a slump in their main businesses, with EMC weighing strategic options amid pressure from shareholder Elliott Management Corp. Though the combination would be costly and difficult to finance, it would provide a one-stop shop for EMC's digital storage products with Dell's servers, which help businesses tackle mammoth computing tasks.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG are among the banks that have been approached about financing the deal, people said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:17:58.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
