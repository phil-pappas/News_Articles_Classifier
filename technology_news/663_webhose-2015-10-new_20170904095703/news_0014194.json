Bloomberg Share on twitter by John Davidson Not long after he announced his intention to make the biggest takeover in the history of technology, Michael Dell picked up the telephone and called most of his competitors.\nMr Dell's deal to acquire the data storage conglomerate EMC for $US67 billion ($93 billion) was announced on October 12 but is not expected to be completed till mid-2016 at the earliest. The deal would, among other things, give him control of VMware, a separately listed subsidiary of EMC whose virtualisation software is used in most of the world's biggest data centres, including in data centres built around competitors' hardware and software.\nMr Dell, who owns roughly 75 per cent of the privately owned Dell, needed to reassure the competitors they would still be able to partner with VMware, without fear that the partnership would be undermined by its new owner.\n\"One of the first things that I did was I called the top 15 or so VMware partners, which would include most of my competitors, to explain to them and to reassure them that we're going to treat VMware very much in the same way that EMC has,\" Mr Dell told The Australian Financial Review in an interview at Dell's annual Dell World user conference.\nWhile many of the partners were \"very reassured to hear it\", according to Mr Dell, the stock market has yet to be reassured. A week after the Dell takeover was announced, shares in VMware plunged 20 per cent, in part due to warnings of lowered operating margins in the coming year, and in part due to a warning from VMware's chief financial officer, Jonathan Chadwick, that the Dell deal will muddy the waters in the near term, even though it will eventually result in $US1 billion in \"revenue synergies\".\nDisruptions expected \"Although we expect the Dell acquisition of EMC will give rise to significant revenue synergies for VMware over time, we believe it is realistic to anticipate various disruptions in the near term,\" Mr. Chadwick said in a conference call to analysts.\nIt's the first hiccup in the deal, and undoubtedly it won't be the last. Merging Dell and EMC into one of the biggest tech conglomerates of all time runs counter to the current trend of divesting businesses to allow companies to focus on just the one, core competency.\n HP, which has been critical of the Dell/EMC deal, has recently completed a de-merger that split it into two parts: HP, which will focus on printers and PCs; and HP Enterprise, which will focus on the hardware, software and services used by businesses.\nDell executives already boast their company is the last remaining \"end-to-end\" computer company, not quite as end-to-end as IBM in its heyday - IBM used to design and build its own microprocessors to power its own operating systems running on its own PCs, servers and mainframes - but the modern equivalent nonetheless.\n\"Our version of end-to-end starts from understanding customer needs, which is consulting, and creating a solution from hardware, software and services - writing applications - and providing business process outsourcing,\" says Prasad Thrikutam, who runs Dell's Application Services business.\nIf the acquisition of EMC makes it past the regulators and past EMC's own \"go-shop\" period, when it courts rival offers, then Dell will still be the tech world's last remaining end-to-end company â€“ only on an even grander scale, says Mr Thrikutam.\nCompeting with smaller rivals For his part, Michael Dell says the merged company can still compete with smaller rivals, both because it will often operate like smaller companies, and because it will have a type of agility on a global scale that smaller companies can't match.\n\"What I've learned growing our company is that the things that make you agile are different depending on your size,\" Mr Dell said.\n\"We are launching a new service called Pro Deploy. We're actually launching it in 160 countries. This is what you call being agile when you're big. If we had told 160 countries to go create a deployment service, they would all do it and each one would be a little bit different. It would take longer and it wouldn't be as efficient. And so there are ways to be agile, even when you're large.\"\nThough he intends to merge Dell and EMC at the corporate level, Mr Dell says that at the branding level, both Dell and EMC will still continue to operate separately. Their various sub brands will enjoy varying degrees of autonomy, depending on how closely they're aligned with the overall goals of the conglomerate.\nHe doesn't want a lot of the brands to be seen as part of the big complex organisation, because they will be confused by all of the bigger things that the company is trying to do.\n\"In Dell we have a company called Boomi, which is all about cloud data integration. It has nothing to do with PCs. It has nothing to do with a lot of things that we do at Dell. But it solves a very big problem that many customers have,\" Mr Dell says.\n\"So we provide them with capital, we help introduce new customers, we invest in them, but it's a model of incubating a new company within a business.\"\nHe says that is how a lot of the businesses in the merged Dell/EMC will operate: as a \"strategically aligned family of businesses and companies\" rather than as a monolithic company.\n\"We think all the brands that we have are quite powerful, and so we're not planning on retiring or changing any of the brands ... We'd be crazy if we did anything else.\"\nJohn Davidson attended Dell World in Austin, Texas, as a guest of Dell.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-10-26T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:19:46.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
