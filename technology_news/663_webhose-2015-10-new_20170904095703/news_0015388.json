For example, if bags could be scanned more efficiently, that would avoid the need for people to unpack and then repack their hand luggage during security checks.\n\"It's about things happening smoothly without interrupting the flow... where everything gets out of the way of the customer,\" Tyler told journalists.\n(Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Keith Weir )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:17:56.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
