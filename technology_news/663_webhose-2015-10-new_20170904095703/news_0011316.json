Cloudian was chosen because of its 100 percent S3 compatibility and ease-of-use. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20120918/SF75609LOGO \nPT Infinys is based in Jakarta, Indonesia and provides revolutionary cloud solutions to its customers, which include consumers, SMEs, enterprises and government agencies. With over 7000 customers, it uses a combination of open source as well as proprietary technology to deliver rock solid cloud services that help its customers manage their data and run their businesses. \nPT Infinys was the first cloud provider to introduce Storage as a Service in Indonesia, and thus needed a reliable, cost effective storage solution that was easy to use. \n\"We looked at a number of other vendors, but there was no comparison that Cloudian was the best option. Cloudian HyperStore has more enterprise-ready features compared to other products, and its 100 percent S3 compatibility was key to our decision, as most of our customers are already familiar with S3 so there is no need to educate them on this new protocol. It also means customers are able to migrate easily to our service,\" explained Dondy Bappedyanto, General Manager of PT Infinys. \n\"Choosing Cloudian was a great decision. Its smart data storage solution is so easy to use, maintain and manage. Moreover, by using Cloudian we were able to launch our service much faster. We already have 10 servers running Cloudian HyperStore software but our goal is to rapidly grow the service over the coming 12 months, which is an achievable goal with Cloudian supporting us.\" \n\"Innovative organizations such as PT Infinys are showing how Smart Data Storage is becoming a vital component for rapid, high performance service as a service delivery,\" said Paul Turner, Chief Marketing Officer at Cloudian. \"We are delighted to see HyperStore being used to help deploy cloud services such as this, and we believe PT Infinys will retain a strong competitive edge as they continue to develop the solution.\" \nAbout PT Infinys Founded in 2007, PT Infinys System Indonesia is a leading cloud services provider in the country.
