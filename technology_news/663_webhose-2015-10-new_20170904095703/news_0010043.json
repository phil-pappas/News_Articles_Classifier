It is also a new standard that relies upon various supporting technologies including millimeter wave propagation, IPv6 transmission protocol, and many others including some that are still in the R&D stage with major infrastructure providers. Among other major differences as compared to the fourth generation of cellular, 5G network demands higher data rate in a range of several gigabits per seconds (Gbps) and this can achieved using steerable antennas with Millimeter Wave (mmWave) technologies. \nSome technologies will become standardized and well-known components of a 5G system whereas other aspects may be optional and even proprietary adjuncts to a standardized system. As with all game-changing technologies of the past, software, platform, and infrastructure providers have a lot at stake in terms of the prospect of their offerings becoming part of the de facto standard or being left behind with stranded R&D expenditures. \nKey Topics Covered: \n2.0 Introduction To 5G Technology \n3.0 5G Enabling Technologies \n5.0 5G Service Applications In M2M And Iot Environment \n6.0 5G Ecosystem \n7.0 5G Standardization And Research \n8.0 5G Vendors And Company Analysis \n9.0 5G Investment And Subscription Forecast \n10.0 5G Implication For Telecom Industry \n11.0 Conclusions And Recommendations", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:08:13.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
