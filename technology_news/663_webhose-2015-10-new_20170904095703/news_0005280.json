Both suspended accounts regularly use gifs of highlights from sporting events, including NFL games. The SB Nation account that was suspended, @SBNationGIF, specializes in such highlights. The main Deadspin account was down for roughly an hour before being re-activated around 8pm EDT, while @SBNationGIF was still suspended.\nBoth Deadspin and SB Nation still had NFL video highlights featured on their sites, and the Deadspin account still included posts with gifs from NFL game broadcasts when it was re-activated.\nDeadspin, which doesn’t hide its disdain for the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, announced its return by tweeting a photo linking to a story titled “The Many Horrible, Stupid Faces Of Roger Goodell: A Gallery Of Authoritarian Derp.”\nIn August, the NFL and Twitter announced a two-year content and advertising deal that expanded upon prior relationships between the league and the social media platform. The deal promised to funnel more NFL video highlights and pictures from games through Twitter, with the site using an automated formula to prominently display NFL tweets and related ads in the streams of accountholders likely to enjoy the information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:57:11.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
