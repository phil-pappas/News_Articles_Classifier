October 23, 2015 -- \nSILICON VALLEY, Calif., Oct. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Travel Startups Incubator announced its $25,000 investment in Chronicles of the Earth, a mobile app aimed at adventure travelers. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151023/279979LOGO \nChronicles of Earth , in beta and available in the Apple App Store is a mobile app and social network for travelers where they will be able to define themselves by the trips they take and the stories they share. Stories are told with Chronicles, which are journals of multimedia vignettes located on a map and positioned in time. The mobile app allows users to add photos, video, audio annotations and text to each Vignette (or chapter) to build a complete picture of their experiences. Travelers can create travel journals and albums and then establish their credentials and trust through the stories and media they share with their friends, family and followers. \n\"Chronicles of Earth is a new way for travelers to share their stories and learn about the world,\" says Chronicles of Earth CEO and Founder of Uber-acquired deCarta, Bill Schwegler . \"It's a network for real travelers and real stories. Our mobile app differentiates itself through trust; Chroniclers will be able to follow people on their journeys, building relationships and rapport - instead of having to rely on the advice and opinions of strangers, which is the case for most other travel review websites.\" \nTravelers looking for adventure and inspiration will be able to search for their next trip by keyword, location, area of interest, and Chronicle author. Additionally, users can take their journeys offline; saving their Chronicles as travel journals or albums in PDF format that is ready for printing as a soft or hardback book. \nChronicles of Earth finds its competitive edge in evocative storytelling and being able to share with anyone on any device or social media site through a network focused specifically on travelers and tourism. \n\"I created my first Chronicle on a camping trip to the Yosemite High Sierra Camps, using a very early prototype,\" adds Schwegler. \"I was able to take photos, videos, record audio annotations and - even with this rudimentary version - I was able to capture the spirit of my companions and the essence of our trip, and then share it with my friends. I treasure that memory, and I hope that's what Chronicles of Earth can bring to the public; storytelling is in our genes, after all.\" \n\"Bill and his team are proven Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that are working on a big idea to help travelers share their adventures and travel stories in a new and extraordinary digital experience. As travelers who are always connected we are looking for expressive ways to not only preserve our memories but to share our amazing experiences with friends, family and like-minded travelers. Chronicles of Earth will help enrich our lives. We are very pleased to have them be a part of Travel Startups Incubator, says Matt Zito , Managing Partner.\" \nAbout Chronicles of Earth \nChronicles of Earth is founded by colleagues Bill Schwegler , former CEO at Uber-acquired deCarta, and Ann Cowan , former deCarta VP of Engineering. With years of combined experience in geospatial technology and application and platform software development between them, they teamed up again to form Chronicles of Earth, a network of storytellers sharing their stories as multimedia Chronicles online and making printable albums and journals. \nAbout Travel Startups \nTravel Startups Incubator was founded in August 2014 by the husband and wife team Matt and Nicole Zito .
