With the Winter release we are, for the first time, applying the same logic to generate time & cost savings for FP&A professionals,\" says Koester. \nFiREapps' new currency analytics are designed to drastically reduce the time required to perform constant-currency and scenario-based analyses; drive on-demand, strategic insight into the currency composition of revenues and expenses; and establish a single, collaborative environment for teams operating in multiple currencies at a global scale. \n\"Ultimately, there are a number of teams tasked with answering the CFO's questions, on-demand. And this record year of volatility & currency impact made it more apparent than ever that every area of finance requires quick visibility into their systems that frankly, many still do not have. But we are working diligently on that and this release marks a major step in that direction,\" says Koester. \nAbout FiREapps FiREapps is the leader in big data analytics for corporate finance.
