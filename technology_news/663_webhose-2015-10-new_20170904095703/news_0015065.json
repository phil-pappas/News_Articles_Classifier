Maybe the Chinese will prove we're not alone in the universe.\nPoll loading â€¦\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:37:19.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
