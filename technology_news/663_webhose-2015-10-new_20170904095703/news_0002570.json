Osamu Terasaki and Peter Oleynikov \nCapturing CO 2 from the air is one way to minimize climate change. Until this research, CO 2 capture has been difficult to achieve as it cannot be absorbed properly when water is present, but complete dehydration is not an economical process. \nThe newly developed microporous crystal material is not only stable but also recyclable. Various adsorption sites are present in the micropores of the crystal, with separate sites adsorbing CO 2 and water. \n“As far as I know this is the first material that captures CO 2 in an efficient way in the presence of humidity. In other cases there is competition between water and carbon dioxide and water usually wins. This material adsorbs both, but the CO 2 uptake is enormous” says Osamu Terasaki, Professor at the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry at Stockholm University. \nThe innovative material is a copper silicate crystal, and has been named “SGU-29”, after Sogang University in Korea. The material came to fruition due to the efforts of the international cooperation. The material has the ability to capture CO 2 from the air, and is particularly useful for cleaning emissions. \n“CO 2 is always produced with moisture, and now we can capture CO 2 from humid gases. Combined with other systems that are being developed, the waste carbon can be used for new valuable compounds. People are working very hard and I think we will be able to do this within five years. The most difficult part is to capture carbon dioxide, and we have a solution for that now” says Osamu Terasaki. \nThe findings of this research have been reported in the scientific journal, Science.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:18:21.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
