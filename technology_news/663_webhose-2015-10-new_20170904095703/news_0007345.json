We are certainly in for a treat as we get to meet the LG G4 Dual and Samsung Galaxy A8 Dios, both parading their own strengths against each other. \n- Advertisement - \nThe G4 Dual is regarded as LG’s best flagship for quite some time now since its release back in May this year. They have been quite fortunate and remained at the top for a few months and stay on top of things, until the great Samsung Galaxy Note 5 reclaims that status. \nAs for the Galaxy A8, it has been a part of the premium metal Galaxy A series from Samsung. We already met with A3, A5 and A7 and they all seem to grow in size and specs with each increase in number. With the Galaxy A8, it is set to be the best yet they have to offer for this A-lineup. \nThe G4 Dual has a body of 149 x 76.2 x 9.8 mm (5.87 x 3.00 x 0.39 in) and weighs just 155 g (5.47 oz) for its size. Inspired by precision, the G4 Dual premium back cover come in genuine leather (Galaxy Note 4 anyone?). The chic colored backs are distinguished by a textural hammered-array pattern. While the classic leather option is available in a number of distinct colors and features an exquisite threaded style. It also features durable slim arc design that allows for a more natural and firm grip, giving the best in terms of user experience. \nElsewhere for the Galaxy A8, it is set to be the thinnest smartphone from Samsung yet. With a measurement of 158 x 76.8 x 5.9 mm (6.22 x 3.02 x 0.23 in), weighing a mere 151 g (5.33 oz) and further complemented by the all-metal design; it is definitely a stunner. Heads will turn when you brandish it out in public. \nThe Galaxy A8 wins hands-down on the look and feel department, but what about the screen? \nThe G4 Dual is sporting a 5.5-inch Quad HD IPS LCD Quantum Display with Quad HD resolution at 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~534 ppi pixel density. This means that it will produce high-contrast and vibrant images that are rich and authentic in color, while staying true-to-life. It also benefits from In-cell Touch Display technology, while providing a smooth and super-responsive feel while at the same time - making the screen easily visible in daylight. All that is protected by the Gorilla Glass 3. \nA 5.7-inch Full HD Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen makes up the Galaxy A8 Duos with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~386 ppi pixel density. Then there’s going to be the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 which will add more protection to this phablet. \nEven though the Galaxy A8 Duos benefits from a bigger screen the G4 Dual has a much higher resolution. The difference is a lot and you will surely benefit from the much richer color and resolution. \nUnder the hood of G4 Dual is the latest Hexa-Core 1.8GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor which comprises of a Dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57 & Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 418 graphics and 3GB of RAM. \nElsewhere on the Galaxy A8, it is equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset paired with an octa-core with the combination of two, separate quad-core processors which is Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics and 2GB RAM to top it all off. \nBetween the two, it seems that the G4 Dual pulls away slightly with its better chipset, faster processor (albeit with two less cores), better graphics and an additional 1GB RAM. But in the real-world, I don’t think you will see much difference until you are into multi-tasking. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the G4 Dual features a 16MP primary camera with F1.8 lens. What it means is that, all your shots are sharper and is ideal for low light and portraits. This ultra-bright lens produces beautiful shots and wonderful, professional-looking photos that pop with clarity and detail. The G4 Dual state-of-the-art, infrared-sensitive color spectrum sensor analyzes and measures all of the visible light within a scene before a shot is snapped, ensuring that an image’s colors appear natural and vivid even in dim conditions. The manual mode feature is rich enough that allows you to turn every moment into a work of art by adjusting camera settings that tweak lightness and darkness, freeze movement faster and allow for better low-light shooting. Then we have the light trail effect for which you can set the camera to easily and artfully capture the blazing lights. Finally, you can snap quick and clear pictures with the G4 Dual’s laser detection auto-focus. And with Optical Image Stabilization 2.0, an improved optical image stabilizer that reduces camera shake, so your picture remains sharp. It will also be sporting an 8 Megapixel camera that is ideal for capturing that perfect selfie. This 8MP front shooter utilizes LG’s fun and convenient Gesture Shot and Gesture View features. \nAs for the Galaxy A8, it has Samsung’s top-of-the-line 16 Megapixel primary camera which iused in the Galaxy S6/S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 4. How good it is for the Galaxy A8 to have such honor. Plus, it is also sporting a 5 Megapixel secondary camera which is being heavily touted by Samsung to be a great selfie device. \nCamera-wise, the G4 Dual has better features in both the primary and secondary department. \nStorage-wise, the G4 Dual also has the advantage over the Galaxy A8 Duos. It has 32GB internal storage versus 16GB and even on the expansion side, it can accommodate 128GB versus 64GB. \nBattery-wise, both of them have almost the same power rating. The G4 Dual is benefiting from a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery whereas the Galaxy A8 has a non-removable Li-Ion 3050 mAh battery. The small difference is negligible at best, and both are more than capable to power up the device for at least a day in between charging. \nOn the operating system side of things, both are equal as both will be running on Android Lollipop; so no worries here. It is just that; it is a bit unclear whether either one of them will get the update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0. It will a good thing for both of them to be getting it, since both are treated as flagships by their respective manufacturers. \nNot forgetting, both have dual sim capability which is a very nice thing indeed. - Advertisement - \nSide-by-side, it seems that the LG G4 Dual is a slightly better choice. But there’s no denying the fact that the Samsung Galaxy A8 Duos is much sexier with a decent power and camera to boot. \nThe LG G4 Dual is currently available for ~$479 USD and you can choose from Grey, White, Gold, Leather Black, Leather Brown and Leather Red. \nThe Samsung Galaxy A8 is available for ~$499 USD and you can choose from Pearl White, Midnight Black and Champagne Gold.
