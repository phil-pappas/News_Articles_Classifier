Strensiq was also granted orphan drug designation.\nIn a study of 99 patients that spanned up to 6.5 years, patients who took Strensiq had improved survival, and improved rates of survival without the need of a ventilator.\nShares of Alexion, up 9% this month, were halted in afternoon trading.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 23, 2015 16:24 ET (20:24 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:46:16.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
