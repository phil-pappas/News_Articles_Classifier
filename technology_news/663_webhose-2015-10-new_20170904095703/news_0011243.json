Because the new draft guidance applies to all medical devices, it is much broader in scope than the guidance it will replace.\nIn general, the FDA’s new guidance recommends that researchers, industry professionals, and agency staff who evaluate animal research develop protocols and methods that promote good research practices. The agency’s detailed recommendations are largely consistent with current Good Laboratory Practice requirements, but they go on to provide additional instructions outlining the recommended content, format, and organization of test protocols and reports, as well as considerations for the development and completion of the study.\nWhen preparing a regulatory submission, the new guidance recommends including the number of animal studies conducted and providing the following information for each of the studies:\nRationale for animal model selected Similarity of the selected preclinical model to clinical (human) models The general study methodology What (if any) standard operating procedures were in place and followed during the study Proof the quality assurance unit was independent and impartial during the inspection and reporting of study results Additional information about study groups, study durations, and device design changes, as well as outcome summaries also should be submitted.\nManufacturers interested in the FDA’s input before conducting animal studies may request a pre-submission meeting for the agency to review the proposed study rationale and research design. The agency says it is also willing to discuss potential barriers to conducting animal studies and alternative approaches.\nThe FDA is accepting comments on the draft guidance at www.regulations.gov before work begins on the final version. To ensure comments are considered, they must be submitted before Jan. 12, 2016.\n- See more at: http://www.aami.org/newsviews/newsdetail.aspx?ItemNumber=2842#sthash.f8If3PI6.dpuf", "external_links": ["http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm220772.pdf", "http://www.regulations.gov/", "https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6InNsb3VnaGxpbkBhYW1pLm9yZyIsImJ1bGxldGluX2xpbmtfaWQiOiIxMDAiLCJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiMTI4NDExNTAiLCJsaW5rX2lkIjoiMzgwNTMwNjgiLCJ1cmkiOiJicDI6ZGlnZXN0IiwidXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5mZGEuZ292L3VjbS9ncm91cHMvZmRhZ292LXB1YmxpYy9AZmRhZ292LW1lZGRldi1nZW4vZG9jdW1lbnRzL2RvY3VtZW50L3VjbTQ2NjM1OC5wZGY_c291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAxNTEwMTQuNTAyMjA4NjEifQ.-7RCrVq-i29XWtcdHNTrFze8_4m8YhrQdxJAUseP_OU", "http://www.aami.org/newsviews/newsdetail.aspx?ItemNumber=2842#sthash.f8If3PI6.dpuf"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:44:40.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
