The Philadelphia-based company said the move would also improve the trading liquidity of its publicly traded stock. \nComcast plans to hold a special meeting of its shareholders to vote on the reclassification. Shareholders of record on Oct. 20 are entitled to vote at the special meeting. \nShares of Comcast shed 9 cents to $61.89 in light premarket trading. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
