Julee-Anne Bell, who is congenitally blind, can “see” more of the world than people with vision.\nBy clicking her tongue and listening to the echoes, she can effectively see through solid objects, identifying whether a wall has another wall behind it, or trees, or a fence.\n“I can hear layers of sound,” she told news.com.au. “The denseness of the wall, the sparseness of the trees behind. I can tell you the shape of a car, whether it’s still, if it’s high or low, long or short, or a four-wheel drive.\n“Everyone uses echolocation. When you walk into a room you can tell if it’s large or small by the sound, but this is an active form. As you activate your perceptional skills, you start to hear light and shade and build a picture of your environment, your brain becomes more attune.”\nJust five years ago, Ms Bell, who appears on tonight’s Insight : Sensational on SBS at 8.30pm, was crippled with anxiety over leaving the house alone. In 2010, she came across a documentary about Daniel Kish from the US, inventor of a sophisticated form of echolocation called FlashSonar.\nUsing palatal, or in some cases, dental clicks, users can listen to variation in sound and build a sonic image of what they’re looking at. Ms Bell, from Brisbane, invited Mr Kish to Australia for a month in 2012, spending $6000 on her own eight days of training and teaching the method to 25 children with impaired vision. She now runs an organisation called World Access For The Blind Australia , and has passed the technique on to around 150 people across the country.\nOther Stories Guy Pearce and wife Kate split Sydney Confidential 0 comments Moment kids see mum hit in crash Nsw ‘Thousands will die’ letter sent to cops News ‘Thousands will die’: Terror threats on Sydney sites National ‘Are they really going to give it to Hayne?’ More Sports 0 comments Authorities rule out MH370 theory News 0 comments Helen Cameron sees smells, tastes and sounds, which helps her memory and assists in her job in the coffee industry. “Once you start hearing, it becomes quite obvious and you wonder why you didn’t notice,” said the 42-year-old, who now travels independently with confidence. “This stuff’s always there, it’s not something technology has created, it’s something as simple as using another sense.\n“It’s about experiencing the world on my own terms. Before, my kids felt they might have to be more responsible for mum, this keeps the roles as they should be. I’m not dependent or a burden on them.”\nAnother Australian with heightened use of their senses is Helen Cameron, who also appears on Insight. She has an unusual form of synaesthesia where doesn’t just see words, letters and days of the week as colours, she sees smells, tastes and sound.\n“A high-pitched piano note would be red with pink, with defined edges, and yellow bits along the top to make it shiny,” she told news.com.au. “A lower note would be brownish with blurred, rough edges.”\nThe 29-year-old, who works with researchers at Macquarie University, says she sees her condition as something special. “The sounds and smells I like are beautiful,” she said. “They match my moods. If I’m feeling down I know the soundscape that will lift my mood. The singer Colbie Caillat’s voice has a nice soothing sound and it’s a strong pink with undefined edges, nice and smooth, like the sound.”\nIt’s a memory aid too. The recollections evoked by smells are far stronger for her than for other people because they are accompanied by a visual. “I have another reference,” she said. “Vinegar is a closed, rounded visual in purple, perhaps because of a chip packet.\n“I remember movie titles better, it helps with wine and coffee tasting, and I now work in the coffee industry. Taste is more easily identified if you think of an image.\n“It’s definitely another tool you can use to improve memory recall, assigning another asset or characteristic to something. If a sauvignon blanc tastes like melon, you can assign a colour and more easily reassign.”\nThere is a downside for Helen, however. She can be “a bit dyslexic” over some senses if asked to make a quick decision. “Left and right are the same colour, they’re both directions, so I just see green. I have to manually process which is which. It’s the difference between someone who just knows their timetables and someone who has to think about it first.”\nInsight: Sensational - McGurk effect 1:08 The McGurk effect shows how our eyes can influence what we hear.

It’s black, grey and green in a grungy ink, going into water and stirred around a bit.”\nProfessor Jason Mattingley from the University of Queensland is a cognitive neuroscientist who specialises in selective attention. He says our ability to determine which sense should be dominant in different situations enables conscious perception.\n“We filter out the distant and irrelevant sensations in the world,” he told news.com.au. “Attention is important for bringing together our senses. It a movie theatre, when actors are speaking, we have the subjective impression the sound is coming from their mouths, even though it’s coming from speakers on the side.”\nProf Mattingley is researching the limits of our perception to help people with attention disruption, such as ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), or those dealing with the aftermath of a stroke or brain injury. But he says that improving our ability to use our senses is difficult.\n“There aren’t really medications you can use, the only way is to train your attention,” he said. “In so-called brain training cognitive tasks, the goal is generalised improvement. All these apps and sites where you train on tasks, you get better at the task, but the benefit to your life is slim.”\nPractical attention tasks can help, he said, and you can improve other things, such as your ability to switch between tasks rapidly. “There will be an initial drop in performance, a ‘task switch cost’,” he added. “There’s no easy way to eliminate that, although you can limit the length of it.”\nRather than plugging away at pointless brain exercises, he suggests you spend your time doing something you find enjoyable and engaging that uses thinking and attention processes — like reading a book or solving a crossword. “Motivation is as much of a factor as anything else,” he added.\nSo rather than trying to exercise our thoughts, if we consciously focus our attention, we may be able to hone our senses. It’s a whole new way of using our brains.\nInsight ‘Sensational’ airs tonight at 8.30pm on SBS.
