Essentially, we print one gel inside of another gel, which allows us to accurately position the soft material as it’s being printed, layer-by-layer,” he said.\nOne of the major advances of this technique, termed FRESH, or “Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels,” is that the support gel can be easily melted away and removed by heating to body temperature, which does not damage the delicate biological molecules or living cells that were bioprinted.\nAs a next step, the group is working towards incorporating real heart cells into these 3-D printed tissue structures, providing a scaffold to help form contractile muscle.\nBioprinting is a growing field, but to date, most 3-D bioprinters have cost over USD 100,000 and require specialised expertise to operate, limiting wider-spread adoption, researchers said.\nFeinberg’s group, however, has been able to implement their technique on a range of consumer-level 3-D printers, which cost less than USD 1,000 by utilising open-source hardware and software.\nThe study was published in the journal Science Advances.\n 25, 2015 5:04 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:33:13.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
