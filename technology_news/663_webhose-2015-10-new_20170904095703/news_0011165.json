The rebranding reflects the company's renewed focus on integrated digital advertising solutions. \n\"We're fusing digital out-of-home and traditional outdoor advertising for a more capable and cost-effective solution,\" said Michelle Reis, the company's General Manager. \nCorner Media offers three types of advertising solutions to brands and their agencies: (1) full-motion ads on digital displays in upscale outdoor retail districts, transit centers, and shopping malls, (2) high-impact traditional outdoor advertising in select urban retail centers, for example Montgomery County's Bethesda Row and Boston's Assembly Row, and (3) location-based mobile advertising with advanced targeting capabilities. \nCorner Media's products draw from the scientific research of Dr. Michel Wedel, PepsiCo Professor of Consumer Science at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, who also chairs Corner Media's Scientific Advisory Board. His research found that consumers typically see, process and retain an ad's meaning (\"ad gist\") within the first few seconds of seeing it. If the consumer is able to attain a high-level understanding of the ad immediately (\"gist perception\"), the ad is much more likely to generate interest and, consequently, increase brand awareness. \n\"Professor Wedel's research shows that short, eye-catching ads are very effective,\" said Missy Cassell, Head of Sales & Marketing. \"Our digital displays show full-motion ads that seemingly jump off the screen, catching the consumer's attention. Our property takeovers do the same: the brand becomes the centerpiece of the physical brick and mortar space.\" \nThe digital displays and traditional media assets are strategically located in areas with heavy foot traffic, with a purposeful balance between high-frequency locations, like coffee shops and metro stations, and specialty locations, like gourmet markets and upscale retail. The variety of location types enables Corner Media's clients to target consumers based on a number of different criteria - profession, age, income and other behavioral or demographic attributes. \nFor more information, visit cornermedia.com, or contact rikki@verasolve.com (804-543-4774). \nAbout Corner Media Corner Media is a location-based digital media company that brings together traditional outdoor and digital media.
