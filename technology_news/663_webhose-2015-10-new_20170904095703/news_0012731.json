Wayne Taylor Stensholt If it wasn't for founding their fast-growing technology company in Australia, 20-somethings Josiah Humphrey and Mark McDonald may not have become as wealthy and successful as quickly as they have now.\nAt only 24 and 23 respectively, Humphrey and McDonald will debut on this year's BRW Young Rich list, published on Friday, with a combined wealth of $58 million.\nThe co-founders of app development and strategy company Appster have moved to San Francisco but own 100 per cent of the firm, a different path from what they believe their peers in the US have followed by taking on angel and venture capital funding during a company's early days.\n\"Appster doesn't have any outside investors and because we are growing out of cash flow, you can control your own destiny,\" McDonald says.\n\"A lot of our staff hold stock options so we're eventually going to have to have a liquidity event [such as a stockmarket float]. But the question in San Francisco is always 'who are you selling to'.\n\"Most entrepreneurs there say they're doing this, and then how do they get their series A funding, and if I get a really great idea how do I IPO. When we tell people we're a 250-person company that is fully bootstrapped, people say 'what?' \".\nBig plans The duo have big plans for the firm, which has developed apps for more than 200 companies and brands around the world, and has been profitable from its first month.\n Appster has offices in Melbourne, Guragon in India and San Francisco, with plans to one day operate in 42 countries. Revenue has already passed the $20 million mark and profit margins are strong despite a hiring spree that has seen it double the head count in the past 12 months.\nMcDonald is adamant the firm can easily hit its target of $100 million revenue by 2018. \"We genuinely believe that Appster is a billion-dollar company, not a 10, 20 or even 100 million company. So we're committed for the long term.\"\nAppster has grown quickly since it began slightly less than five years ago, when Humphrey and McDonald started in business at 19 and 18 by renting an office in one of Melbourne's more salubrious office blocks.\n\"This is not the advice to give to everyone but Mark and I set this goal to get an office in the Rialto towers,\" Humphrey remembers. \"We didn't know what we were going to do there, but it seemed like a cool goal.\"\nThe pair even negotiated to move to a bigger office on arrival, figuring larger floor space meant they had to work harder to make money to pay the rent. It worked, and the pair's then nascent digital marketing firm was profitable in its first month. A few months later they formed Appster, and have since expanded into India and the United States.\n\"People have this perception that you are young and arrogant, but when they meet us they find it is different,\" McDonald says. \"You set these more ambitious targets and you'd think that is so difficult. But I think it is actually advantageous. You get the ambitious people that want to work at a place like Appster.\"\nFocus on culture Humphrey said the firm's rigorous hiring practices – candidates typically go through 22 hours of interviews – have helped foster a collaborative and innovative culture that weeds out egos or selfish staff members, while promoting transparency and empowering employees.\n\"We have a report that goes out every week, which is like a weekly vent. Every single person gets it. An example question would be 'if you were the CEO for a day, what would you do' or 'what is the biggest single impediment to doing your job' or 'what is the most stupid thing we are doing'.\n\"We probably place more focus on culture than we should. From a hiring perspective people see they can be a part of a professional and innovative and hungry to grow place. People copy us but they can't copy our culture.\"\nHaving derived most of their revenue from building apps for start-up firms, McDonald said Appster's next phase of growth will be convincing established companies and brands to build new apps for product launches or new brand campaigns.\n\"Corporates or enterprises are only about 5-10 per cent of our revenue now, so we see a lot of opportunity there.\"\nThe pair also hold seminars for aspiring entrepreneurs and are backing a scheme in conjunction with the CSIRO that will roll out a trail in primary schools that teaches technology skills such as coding and app development.\n\"We have a very strong belief that Australia has a deficiency in technology and product development skills, and that has to change in the next 10 years,\" Humphrey says. \"If we could have a generation of Australians that are smart creatives who know more than just how to code, like how to prototype or build a company, whether or not they do that inside companies or start their own ventures … if we could have 5000 or 10,000 kids coming out of school doing that, Australia could be the next start-up nation.\"\nThe BRW Young Rich list will be published in The Australian Financial Review Magazine on Friday and online at brw.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/10oct/appsters_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:16:08.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
