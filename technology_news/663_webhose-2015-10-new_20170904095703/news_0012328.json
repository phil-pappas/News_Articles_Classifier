As a result, it promotes productivity and improves customer service. Easy to use and producible in different colors, designs and logos, as well as a version for headsets, the accessory is ideal for service reps, call centers, warranty reps, help lines, etc.\nThe original design was submitted to the Denver office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
