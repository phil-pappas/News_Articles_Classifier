So Apple Pay is useless with this bug, it's not just cosmetic,\" wrote one disgruntled user on Apple's discussion forum .\nAnother added: \"Apple's QC on usability issues is just getting dismal. I really hate to say it (because I got sick of people saying it years ago), but I believe Steve would have had heads rolling for crap like this by now. Really getting tired of this stuff.\"\nWhile Apple hasn't commented on the bug, according to Macrumors is believed to be aware of the issue and is working on an update to fix it.\nApple's iPhone 6s has a new feature called 3D touch that lets you apply pressure to the screen for more options\nTo avoid the issue completely requires setting your new iPhone 6s up as a brand new device. Unfortunately, you'll lose data from your older iPhone.\nThe existence of the bug doesn't appear to have hurt Apple's credibility too much though.\nIt was announced this morning that the company is the world's most valuable brand for the third year running and is worth an estimated £112 billion.\nVideo loading\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7232283", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "http://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/01/zoom-display-bug-iphone-6s/", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/968/4221396001_4508699911001_4506181330001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:17:03.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
