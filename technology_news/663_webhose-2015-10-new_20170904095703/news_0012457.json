Maxforce FC Select is an ideal solution for maintenance control of normal and bait-averse strains of cockroaches. With the active ingredient, fipronil, Maxforce FC Select kills cockroaches within eight hours by ingestion or contact, also known as the Domino Effect, which is proven to work effectively even when sanitation is poor and competing food sources are available. Temprid SC provides a flexible label that allows indoor and outdoor use. It combines the fast-acting, broad-spectrum control of beta-cyfluthrin with the systemic residual control of imidacloprid to provide premium performance and efficacy. Temprid SC is a leading perimeter pest control product that fights indoor pests like spiders, cockroaches and crickets, as well as outdoor and wood-infesting pests like ants, scorpions, ticks and drywood termites.
