The small second screen can stay on to display weather, time and date when the main display is turned off. It has room for frequently-used apps and can receive notifications while using the main screen to watch a video. \nThe V10 smartphone is LG's latest attempt to make headway in the premium mobile phone market. Its flagship G series phones were edged out by new phones from Samsung and Apple. \nThe company has lost its market share in the smartphone market in recent months, falling to the seventh place globally as Chinese vendors surpassed its shipments. Is second-quarter market share was 3.8 percent, down from 4.7 percent a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Technology Market Research. \nThe new phone's front camera is equipped with a standard 80-degree lens and a 120-degree wide-angle lens option. That means a larger group can fit into a selfie shot taken with the V10. \n\"The ability to take group selfies without a selfie-stick has never been easier,\" the company said in a statement. \nThe V10 phone will go on sale in South Korea later this month for 800,000 won ($678) without a contract from a carrier, followed by the U.S. launch next month. \nThink your friends should see this?
