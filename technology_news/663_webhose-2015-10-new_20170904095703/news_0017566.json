Smart drones are evolving the ability to interconnect to smart phones, but drones are smart even without smart phone guidance systems. Smart commercial drones connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other.Smart commercial drones have a computer inside. They are easy to fly, maneuverable remotely, contain sensor logic. Soon all smart drones will have computer driven collision avoidance technology making the flying more reliable. Remote operation occurs in the context of a workflow and sensors. Cameras are improving dramatically to permit management of video and picture taking that is realistic and detailed.Vendors continue to improve the capabilities of these drone aircraft. Their ability to support the commercial endeavors is increasing. Unmanned aircraft have fundamentally changed the accuracy of video photography from the air. Drones can provide more information at less cost than a human inspection team can. Drones provide video that is more exact than what can be gathered in any other manner. Drones provide more compelling video for entertainment than can be done at a reasonable cost.Photography drone smart sensors and software permit automated response to camera or sensor input.

Remote operation occurs in the context of a workflow and sensors. Cameras are improving dramatically to permit management of video and picture taking that is realistic and detailed. Drones achieve doing work as they are remotely controlled.Smart commercial drones connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. Smart commercial drone aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has reached a level of maturity that has put these systems at the forefront of aerospace manufacturing. Procurement around the world is adapting to drone availability. Use cases are evolving rapidly for video, specialized video, targeted video, and personal photography. The emergence of stable flight platforms that provide a stable photography image and collision avoidance systems makes market maturity a certainty. Use in the global war on terrorism has demonstrated unique usefulness for military intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and communications relay achieving 3 million hours of operation. Small commercial drones are being used to shoot video from the air, proving the viability of drone camera systems.The relatively low-cost of smart commercial drones make them work for civilian applications. Drone aircraft are sophisticated and flexible. They take off, fly and land autonomously managed by a remote controller. They enable engineers to push the envelope of normal flight. Reconnaissance drones can fly for days continuously. Remote, ground-based pilots can work in shifts. Designers work to simplify the aircraft's configuration, making systems that are adaptable to different payloads on different days. Drones can be redesigned and tested at reduced risk than with development of manned aircraft. Drones allow configurations that would be impossible or impractical for human occupation. Drones are becoming easier to control.Drone unmanned aircraft systems are achieving a level of relatively early maturity in this manner, having parallel markets. Fleets of unmanned aircraft systems have begun to evolve. The U.S. Army has achieved four million flight hours for its unmanned aircraft systems fleet. Unmanned aerial systems have good handling characteristics. Drone UAS units are designed to support taking remarkable video using stable platforms. Other military drones perform high-speed, long-endurance, covert, multi-mission intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and precisionstrike missions over land or sea.According to Susan Eustis, leader of the team that prepared the study, \"Quantities of fielded smart Photography drone systems of every size and description are set to increase. Every photo opportunity can be enhanced vis use of a smart drone. Drones will connect to smart phones. Drones can fly indoors. Smart commercial drones units feature a variety of camera attachments, sensors, and internal loads. Large 2,000 pound payloads are possible, campus security is set to emerge as a significant sector. Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor, and an all-weather synthetic aperture radar indicators are maximizing long loiter capabilities and increasing the usefulness of smart commercial drones.\"Smart commercial drones drone markets at $1.6 billion in 2014 are anticipated to reach $8.5 billion by 2021. This forecast number is arrived at by close examination of all the segment growth trajectories. Photography, real estate, campus security, filmmaking, and Videography are all being implemented in the context of drone photography. Each of these will grow at a different pace, depending on the use case effectiveness of the smart commercial photography drones. Commercial grade consumer video drones represent the largest revenue segment in 2015 and remain the biggest throughout the forecast period.
