Livingston anticipates that the watch -- which has a velcro strap and shows signs of wear -- will sell for more, with bidding starting at $50,000.\nEven the most seemingly mundane Space Age souvenirs -- especially lunar memorabilia, which Livingston calls the \"holy grail\" of collectables -- can go for high prices at auction. In 2009, a lunar surface star chart used aboard Apollo 11 sold for $218,000 at a Bonhams Space Sale , while RR Auction sold one of Buzz Aldrin's glove liners from the same mission for just over $60,000 last year.\nRR Auctions has already started accepting online bids, and will host a live auction on October 22.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-small-11.jpg", "http://www.bonhams.com/departments/SPA/#/ag1=past&MR1_main_index_key=sale&m1=1", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-large-169.jpg", "http://www.rrauction.com/past_auction_item.cfm?ID=3322237", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-medium-plus-169.jpg", "https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/omega.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019110013-apollo-15-moon-watch-auction-3-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.bulova.com/en-GB", "http://www.rrauction.com/", "http://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/professional/product/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:11:55.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
