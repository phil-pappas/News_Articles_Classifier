(NASDAQ:MLNX), today announced that the company has updated its third quarter 2015 financial guidance on the heels of its September 30, 2015, announcement that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire EZchip (NASDAQ: EZCH; TASE: EZCH) and the conclusion of its third quarter 2015. The company updated the guidance for its revenue range for the quarter from $165 million to $170 million to $169 million to $171 million. The company believes that it is tracking to mid-point or better of its previous guidance for non-GAAP gross margins.
