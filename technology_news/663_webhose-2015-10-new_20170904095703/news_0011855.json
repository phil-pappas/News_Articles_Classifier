Kennedy's manned moon landing timetable, as well as for initiating the Skylab and space shuttle programs, died Oct. 12 at his home in Irvine, Calif. He was 97. As head of NASA's Office of Manned Spaceflight, with the title of associate administrator, Dr. Mueller bore much of the burden of seeing to it that the space agency's Apollo program met the challenge Kennedy issued in a celebrated 1961 address: landing a man on the moon - and bringing him back - by the end of the 1960s.\n Ledger-Enquirer.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/nation-world/national/article39641430.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:50:53.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
