This prevents the phone from being dropped, which avoids damage. It also eliminates the need or temptation to search for the phone while driving, which can prevent accidents and save lives. Easy to use and compact, it's compatible with all cell phones.\nThe original design was submitted to the Dallas office of InventHelp.
