The feature, available only to a select group of advertisers, is now available to all MGID customers including those using the self-service platform, following a major upgrade. \nSelective Bidding is used by performance marketers to better control traffic sources by using bid multipliers for specific websites so that they can generate more traffic from better performing websites, without affecting the default bid on other websites. The feature enables highly customized traffic source management that lets advertisers intelligently manage the diversification and distribution of traffic between publishers within the campaign. As a result, advertisers can preserve reach and customize their bidding strategy to optimize costs. Prior to this feature’s introduction, only two bidding customization options were available in the industry with all other platforms: allowing traffic from a certain particular website, or not. \nFollowing its launch for MGID’s full-service clients, the technology proved its effectiveness on multiple enterprise campaigns and became an extremely popular tool. In response to recurring client requests, MGID now extends the functionality to self-serve accounts as well as through the MGID dashboard. \nExpanded access to the tool will further equip performance marketers with a feature unique in the industry and will empower advertisers with a level of control that is not found in any other auction-based ad network. \n“All MGID advertisers will now be able to get more traffic from sources they know generate the best performing traffic and make less efficient traffic cost-effective,” said Sergey Denisenko, CEO, MGID. “We give them the control they need in order to increase their revenues. Different websites work differently for every campaign and so bid customization enables advertisers to match publisher’s traffic with their specific needs. Limited legacy whitelisting and blacklisting options used in other networks are now completely obsolete.” \nSelective Bidding is now fully active for all MGID clients through their dashboard. MGID will demonstrate the feature in a webinar to present it in more detail and to train the advertisers on how to use it with maximum efficiency. The company’s native advertising experts work with advertisers to develop and implement ideal bidding strategies. A detailed description of the feature can by found on the MGID blog . \nAbout MGID \nMGID, established in 2008, was one of the first native advertising companies worldwide.
