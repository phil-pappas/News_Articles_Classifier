Income from continuing operations was$16 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. Adjusted earnings were $22 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, increasing 4 percent from the third quarter of 2014. -- Local currency sales of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) increased 83 percent globally, driven by strong demand for the company's new G1 model within the North American fire service market. Global SCBA backlog at the end of the quarter was $68 million, compared to $77 million at the end of the second quarter of 2015. -- Local currency sales of MSA core products increased 13 percent in the quarter, with strong performance in SCBA and fire helmets, offset by a lower level of fixed gas and flame detection (FGFD) shipments and continued weakness in the sale of portable gas detection and industrial head protection, both of which are more exposed to employment levels within the energy market. -- In response to challenging business conditions and weak outlooks in the energy market and key emerging geographies like Brazil and China, the company is executing a restructuring program to reduce operating costs. Restructuring investments are expected to total $4 to $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, resulting in approximately $10 million of cost savings in 2016. -- R&D investments in new products are generating strong returns, as products developed and launched over the last five years represented 44 percent of quarterly core product revenue, compared to 36 percent from a year ago. -- Earlier today, the company closed on its acquisition of U.K. based Latchways plc, a market leader in permanent engineered fall protection solutions. The transaction doubles MSA's market share in fall protection, which represents one of the largest and fastest growing segments of the global safety market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:23:36.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
