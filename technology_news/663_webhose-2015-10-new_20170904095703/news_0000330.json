Dr. Susan Weinkle , past president of ASDS, presented a paper titled 'Substantial Improvements in Subject-Assessed Satisfaction with Appearance and Psychological Impact from Combined Facial Aesthetic Treatment with OnabotulinumtoxinA, Dermal Fillers, and Bimatoprost: Primary Results from the \"HARMONY\" Study' at an open session on Saturday, October 17. \nLogo- http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150612/222796LOGO \nA majority of patients entering an aesthetic practice have aesthetic concerns covering more than one area of the face, yet the pan-facial approach to treatment has only recently become incorporated into clinical practice. The HARMONY study endeavored to assess the overall impact and psychological benefits of multimodal injectable and topical treatment for facial aesthetics. \nThe study included 100 subjects (96 female) treated with onabotulinumtoxinA for moderate to severe glabellar lines (n=95) and crow's feet lines (n=96); hyaluronic acid dermal fillers (n=100) for the correction of age-related mid-face volume deficit and/or moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds; and received bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% for eyelash hypotrichosis (n=100). A total of 93 subjects completed the four month study. \nPatients were administered the validated FACE-Q \"Satisfaction with Face Overall\" patient-reported outcome scale prior to treatment and at month four. This scale asked patients about their attitudes to their facial appearance. Additional FACE-Q modules assessed changes in Social Confidence, Psychological Well-Being as well as how old patients felt they looked both before and after treatment. \nStudy entry scores indicated that subjects were on average somewhat dissatisfied , or somewhat satisfied with aspects of their facial appearance based on the FACE-Q Satisfaction with Facial Appearance Overall scale. After receiving comprehensive pan-facial treatment, on average subjects reported being either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their facial appearance. \nSecondary FACE-Q endpoints of Age Appraisal, Social Confidence and Psychological Well-Being scores showed highly positive benefits of treatment. Additionally, subjects reported looking an average of 4.3 years younger at the month 4 time point. Common treatment site reactions to fillers included bruising, tenderness, swelling, and lumps. One treatment-related adverse event was reported with onabotulinumtoxinA (eyelid ptosis), and 5 were reported in 4 subjects with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% (1 subject discontinued due to the adverse event). All observed adverse events were reported and were consistent with those reported in previous clinical studies. No serious adverse events were reported. \nBOTOX ® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) Important Information Approved Uses \nBOTOX ® Cosmetic is a prescription medicine that is injected into muscles and used to temporarily improve the look of both moderate to severe crow's feet lines and frown lines between the eyebrows in adults. \nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION \nBOTOX ® Cosmetic may cause serious side effects that can be life threatening.
