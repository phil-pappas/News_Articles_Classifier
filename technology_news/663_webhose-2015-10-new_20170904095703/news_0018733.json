The extent of the share had not been disclosed.\n\"This investment provides the business with the ability to connect up to 100 000 homes by 2016 and therefore further entrench Vumatel as the leading FTTH (fibre to the home) player in the market,\" Vumatel CEO Niel Schoeman said.\n\"This investment will allow us to deliver world-class connectivity, choice and superior customer service to every community that requests it,\" said Mr Schoeman.\nKobus Viljoen of Investec said Vumatel was setting the bar for the local fibre industry.\n\"Their commitment to creating affordable high-speed open access fibrehoods through focus on customer service will have a fundamental impact on the telecommunications industry,\" Mr Viljoen said.\nVumatel’s announcement of the Investec deal comes amid Telkom launching a new spin-off wholesale broadband division dubbed Openserve.\nThe division is set to supply wholesale fibre broadband access as well as metro ethernet, IP (internet protocol) Connect and SAIX (South African Internet eXchange) services. Openserve will also be a reseller of DSL internet services.\nOpenserve MD Alphonzo Samuels told Fin24 on Tuesday that 37,000 homes in SA already had access to the Telkom division’s fibre network with the company planning to connect a further 400,000 homes by the end of 2016.\nFin24", "external_links": ["http://www.fin24.com/Tech/Companies/Investec-invests-in-local-fibre-player-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:17:45.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
