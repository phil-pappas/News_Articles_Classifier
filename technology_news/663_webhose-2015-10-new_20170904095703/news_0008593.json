(BMS), a premier provider of mobile wireless printing solutions and wholly-owned subsidiary of Brother International Corporation, will introduce its newly-launched PocketJet ® 7 mobile printer to nurses and other visiting home and hospice healthcare professionals at the NAHC 2015 Annual Meeting and Exposition. Sponsored by the National Association for Home Care & Hospice, the show will take place Oct. 28-30 at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee. \nIn Brother Booth #922, product experts will be on hand to demonstrate how this newest addition to the PocketJet series of compact full-page mobile printers is a breakthrough solution engineered to provide on-the-move home and hospice healthcare providers with new levels of freedom and flexibility to quickly print required documentation at every patient location they visit. Highly reliable, fast and easy to use, the new wireless mobile printers are ideal for printing patient care plans, description of services performed, care instructions, healthcare insurance claim forms, list of medications, and more. \nDavid Crist, President of Brother Mobile Solutions, states: “Our new product series represents a huge step forward in smart mobile technologies and is yet another ‘first-to-market’ innovation for Brother. With the emergence of the home healthcare team approach and growing emphasis on providing a full continuum of patient care beyond the hospital - home healthcare agencies view the mobile printer as increasingly vital. Home and hospice healthcare agencies, both public and private and regardless of size, will benefit from the PocketJet 7’s new features, versatility, and unprecedented ease of use.” \nRavi Panjwani, Vice President of Marketing and Product Management for Brother Mobile Solutions, adds: “By combining smart design with in-depth knowledge of today’s evolving mobile workforce, we have eliminated the last existing obstacles of mobile platform compatibility and connectivity. Now, virtually any mobile professional can print from any popular smartphone, tablet or PC and in just about any physical configuration that the work environment requires – mounted in a vehicle, transportable to a jobsite, carried in a briefcase or tote, or stowed in a backpack*. Plus, there are no ink cartridges, ribbons or toners to deal with. In short, with the PocketJet 7, users are now free to print, anytime and anywhere.” \nAvailable in a variety of models and configurations, the new PocketJet series maintains its place as the smallest, most compact, technologically advanced full-page mobile thermal printer on the market today. Major new advances in printing performance include printing speeds of up to 8 pages per minute, longer battery life, and broader wireless communication capabilities \nHow the PocketJet 7 Mobile Printer Helps Mobile Healthcare Professionals \nBrother Mobile Solutions’ PocketJet 7 series is a groundbreaking mobile printing solution which can help improve patient care and provide convenience to the home and hospice care mobile professionals charged with delivering care. Customer service is improved by onsite printing of patient medication instructions, medical services forms, insurance policies, claim forms, contract updates, and sales quotations. Productivity is improved by the caregiver’s ability to provide documentation right at the point of care, eliminating the need to mail forms to patients later on. \nRaul Palacios, Senior Product Manager for Brother Mobile Solutions, explains: “Clearly, home healthcare agencies can gain significant benefits when mobile clinicians are empowered to print patient care plans, medication lists, drug interaction forms, instructions and other key documents at the point of care.” \n“Onsite printing of critical patient documents is more valuable than ever before because it not only helps ensure compliance with the many regulations and mandates related to providing care in today’s environment, but also enables home health providers deliver quality care more efficiently and effectively. We’re looking forward to demonstrating state-of-the-art mobile printing at NAHC later this month,” he concludes. \nTo learn more about the new Brother PocketJet 7 series of full-page mobile printers, kits and accessories, please visit www.pocketjet7.com . \nAbout Brother Mobile Solutions \nBrother Mobile Solutions, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Brother International Corporation, provides innovative mobile printing and industrial labeling solutions to field workforces and mobile enterprises.
