Patriarchy rearing its head along with gender inequality, workers outsourcing and other internal conflicts to seize the 'fees must fall' campaign platform, seeking to be addressed.\nThe students' revolution was divided into ideological concourses, one lead by female students who felt that they lacked representation in the broad movement. The other concourse consisted of a majority of males and a few females.\nThe 'fees must fall' campaign brought up different voices of dissatisfaction within the management itself, and even contention amongst students. Notably, as the SRC president was addressing the masses, a few students expressed their disapproval of her leadership skills by leaving the venue.\nThe former SRC president who succeeded President Mcebo Dlamini after his expulsion, highlighted, \"fees increment is not an issue on its own here at Wits, it is the symptom of many issues at play, and outsourcing is one amongst many.\" In overlooking the importance of meeting with students, the management failed to prevent some of the damage that has been done. The Wits protestors (Students and Lecturers) were determined to ensure that the revolt remained a non-violent demonstration, only to be turned down by management.\nThe 'fees must fall' campaign has jumped university fences and skipped bureaucratic barricades across South African Universities. Like a dry wildveld awaiting to conflagrate; this students' movement just requires a spark of unity to seize Blade's office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:29:20.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
