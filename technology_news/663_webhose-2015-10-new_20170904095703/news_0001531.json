Through this, we will also be able to see possibility of e-Sports to be selected in further multi sports events.”\nThus eSports finds itself on the cusp of huge developments in the way in which eSports are run and the benefits that will accrue to every national member that is currently participating in the affairs of IeSF.\nIt is an exciting time to be a gamer as those who are currently gaming, if a member of an accredited national eSports federation, like Mind Sports South Africa, are at the very heart of the exciting developments that are going to burst upon the scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:58.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
