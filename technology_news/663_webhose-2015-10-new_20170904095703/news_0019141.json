FXCM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFXCM is the latest U.S. corporation to become a victim of a cybersecurity attack, adding to a list that includes Target Corp, Apple Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nAccusations against China have increased amid growing concerns about national security. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping signed a pact to fight cyber warfare.\nFXCM's shares were down 4.6 percent, recouping some losses after hitting a record low of US$6.51. The stock had fallen about 95 percent this year mainly due to losses stemming from the Swiss National Bank's removal of the cap on the Swiss franc in January.\n(Reporting By Sudarshan Varadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Savio D'Souza)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-02T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:18:24.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
