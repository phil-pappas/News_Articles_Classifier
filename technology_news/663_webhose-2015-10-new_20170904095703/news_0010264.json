For RFi Group and its clients, laboriously producing and poring over emails containing static, and potentially outdated, PDFs and Excel-based reports is a thing of the past.“Yellowfin has empowered RFi Group to provide the banking and finance industry with the best analytics platform on the planet,” said RFi Group Benchmarking Director, Charles Higby. “RFi Group conducts some of the largest and most comprehensive financial research in the world, surveying over 350,000 consumers annually. RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform, underpinned by Yellowfin’s BI software, provides a secure multi-tenant platform for our customers to access next generation benchmarking analytics on the device of their choice.” Clients of RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform are harnessing the solution to explore metrics related to three core areas, including industry trends, macro-economic trends and anonymous peer benchmarks that enable clients to compare performance against competitors across a range of KPIs.“RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform is a great example of moving up the chain of analytics from diagnostic to predictive analytics,” said Head of Retail Risk for ANZ, Jason Humphrey. RFi Group Benchmarking CTO, Reinis Grauds, said that by using Yellowfin’s BI solution to power RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform, organizations in the banking and finance industry could now explore, share and act on critical competitive insights faster and easier than ever before.“Yellowfin provides a device independent, functionally rich, easy to use, secure and flexible presentation layer through which RFi Group’s banking and finance clients can consume and act on the most up-to-date insights,” said Grauds. “The solution will improve the consistency, depth and timeliness of insights for our clients, allowing them to drill into interactive reports and fully explore their data while better retaining organizational knowledge. Our clients love the collaboration functionality.” To deliver RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform, Yellowfin has been deployed as a multi-tenant installation into a multiple server environment with discrete databases for each client. RFi Group has Yellowfin running on Microsoft SQL Server, as are its client databases. Security Servers are Linux-based for reverse proxy, LDAP and audited two-factor authentication. Before the release of its Beyond Analytics Platform, RFi Group would cleanse research data on a monthly basis, then use an in-house solution, leveraging Microsoft SQL Server BI edition and custom code to deliver reports to clients via email as static Excel and PDF files. As the amount of data and frequency of data RFi Group collected ballooned, this arduous process and outdated mode of information delivery became increasingly unacceptable.“From the perspective of RFi Group, delivering insights to our clients in this way was becoming excessively resource intensive, disparate and slow,” said Higby. “We also understood that searching through emails to retrieve static file-based reports made it difficult for clients to find desired information quickly or easily explore data to uncover new insights. RFi Group wanted to deliver a more gratifying, insightful and immediate experience where customers could interactively explore live data via intuitive reports, visualizations and dashboards. We wanted to dramatically improve our customer offering.” The RFi Group’s Beyond Analytics Platform comes with a series of out-of-the-box reports available to new customers, with clients able to work independently or in collaboration with RFi Group to develop additional customized BI content.
