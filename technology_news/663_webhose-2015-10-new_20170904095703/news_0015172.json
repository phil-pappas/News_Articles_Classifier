This kind of arrangement being highly irregular as it opens the work to ‘artificial increases’ and ‘manipulation of documents’ but let that be as it may.\nCouncil however now in a Special Adjustment to Budget meeting, in view of the additional revenue received, convened a meeting and at the meeting tabled projects, programs that would benefit from the refund money.\nCapital projects and operation costs being beneficiaries to the refund as tabled.\nIronically, to mention but one anomaly noticed, within the projects that is to benefit from the refund, is a training and refresher course for traffic warders - The cost of such course being R 60 000 per individual. At the time of employment 5 traffic warders who had the necessary qualifications were employed and are earning R 13 000 plus with an additional 10 traffic warders being employed that didn’t have the qualifications being paid in the region of R 3 000 per month.\nCouncil has now decided to – Send the 5 qualified traffic warders on a refresher course (R 60 000 each) and also to pay R 60 000 each to get the other 10 warders the required qualifications. That in total extrapolates to an expense of R 900 000 for refresher and training courses, whereas R 300 000 is being expended on people that already possesses the required qualifications.\nIt is therefore obvious to say that someone has decided to now ‘milk the cow while the udder is still full of milk’ and to send 5 traffic warders on refresher courses which are not in any way necessary.\nVarious other projects and programs listed as now to be executed with the refund received, but the urgency to expend the money, raises questions, as the ruling party, that may only have 8 months left to govern the council is more than adamant to expend the money as quickly as possible.\nIn this regard, the urgency that is prevailing seems questionable, and one can almost say that ‘ex gratia payments’ on projects to be done will be the order of the day.\nWe have come to know the ruling party and how they like to ‘milk’ while the opportunity is there, but this kind of modus operandi followed is not indicative of good, clean, transparent governance that it should be, but not having the majority to overrule the decision, the citizens of the area would ‘once again become the sacrificial lambs at the altar’ as those ‘knights around the table’ that have decided on the projects and work to the executed have already lined up contractors that would have to pay ‘for the work awarded to them’ in order to line the pockets of those unlawfully, irregularly in the time frame left for them to govern.\nThey are using the opportunity to make sure that they are well taken care of financially after they have been ousted come May 2016, when the Bolsheviks Party of South Africa will be the ones at the helm and holding the reigns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:08:01.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
