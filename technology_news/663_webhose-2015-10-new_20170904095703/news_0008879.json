GE will add analytics for a more comprehensive service with greater operational efficiency where GE already provides Flight Operational Quality Assurance (eFOQA) analytics and crew recovery solutions to tackle airline optimization challenges across the business.\n“GE’s Flight Efficiency collects data generated by the aircraft and applies proprietary techniques that use historic intelligence to help drive airline business strategies,” said Alan Caslavka, president of Avionics & Digital Systems for GE Aviation. “Aircraft performance analytics are used to reveal patterns, transforming data into actionable insights that improve operations.”\nIn addition to providing Flight Data Management and Flight Operational Quality Assurance services, GE Aviation’s Flight Analytics System will deliver their Fuel Management Solution, which will include the evaluation and analysis of flight and operational data to identify and prioritize fuel savings opportunities and enable a platform for fuel management analytics.\n“Optimizing the performance of a fleet the size of Southwest’s requires smart technology that delivers big data in a consumable way. The GE Aviation Flight Analytics System will allow Southwest to continuously improve the reliability and efficiency of our operation,” said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest Airlines Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nThese advancements in data and analytic technologies are examples of where GE is taking Predix, the cloud-based platform for creating innovative, Industrial Internet applications that turn real-time operational data into actionable insights.\n“A key component Southwest will receive is the flight efficiency analytics, enabling visibility of fuel savings and base line calculations to provide insight into true fuel usage across all stages of flight and clear identification of fuel saving opportunities. Only accurate data enables good decision making ability,” said Michael Thompson, general manager of Digital Solutions for GE Aviation. “We look forward to beginning the implementation with the Southwest team by the end of this year.”\nGE Aviation’s digital solutions are harnessing the power of the Industrial Internet and using software and analytics to make its machines smarter and more efficient. GE Aviation, an operating unit of GE, is a world-leading provider of jet, turboprop and turboshaft engines, avionics and systems for commercial, military, business and general aviation aircraft.
