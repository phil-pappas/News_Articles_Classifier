(Richard Vogel/AP photo) Stiff neck? Pounding head? Can't stop checking your smartphone? \nYou might have \"text neck.\" \n\"Nobody is immune because technology injuries are repetitive stress injuries,\" said Dean Fishman, a chiropractor in Florida who coined the term \"text neck.\" \n\"Using devices with poor posture over a long period of time will cause changes in the body and then symptoms. Most of the time, we are unaware of the damage that we are doing to our bodies,\" he said. \nIn other words, staying in touch via a handheld or desktop device all the time comes with a price. \nDaniel Chun, a San Jose chiropractor from New Hope Chiropractic, says that about 70 percent of his patients have tech-related injuries such as chronic back and neck problems caused by working many hours every day on computers, tablets and smartphones. \nAccording to a Gallup report released in July, 81 percent of smartphone users keep their devices with them every waking hour, and more than half check their phone at least a few times an hour. A Bank of America study showed that 71 percent of users sleep with their phones, and 23 percent -- this number doubling when skewed young -- have admitted to falling asleep with their phones in their hands. \nBut according to Gallup, 61 percent believe they don't check their phone as often as their peers. \n\"It's possible that Americans either mis-perceive what others are doing, or that they feel it is a socially undesirable behavior and therefore want to believe that they aren't doing it as much as others,\" the Gallup study said.

Users feel the need to stay continuously connected with their peers, and the fear that the they are missing something on social media compels them to constantly check their phone. \n\"FOMO hits right at the heart of the matter,\" Roberts said. \"Cell phones are their social scene, their access. The research tells us that the thought of going without your cell phone engenders great levels of stress and anxiety.\" \nRoberts did a study exploring how college students use their cell phones, finding that 60 percent of college students admit they may be addicted to their smartphones. Roberts will be further exploring cellphone addiction in his upcoming book called \"Too Much of a Good Thing: Are You Addicted To Your Smartphone?\" \nNow, some users are more conscious of how often they use their phone, admitting that they're \"wasting time\" on their phone -- or suffering physical consequences as result of heavy use. \n\"I'm getting sick of having it around,\" said James Noh, a junior in Northwood High School in Irvine. \"It kind of bogs you down. It makes you feel bad after you've been on it too long and you realize what you've done. Since everyone has a phone, you feel like you need it, too.\" \n\"Even if I do use it all the time, I probably do look down on people who constantly do it,\" said Alina Abidi, a senior from Monta Vista High School in Cupertino. \nYears ago, smartphones were met with glee, a promising look into the future of how technology can benefit our lives. But as the technology becomes common and downsides like \"text neck\" and social disapproval affect users, users could start to change their habits. \n\"I think we've turned the corner and people are starting to finally starting to slow down and say 'I'm going to reconsider the role that technology plays in my life,'\" Roberts said. Tips to avoid neck pain while using your smartphone Keep the phone close to eye level so that your ears are lined up with your shoulders, and your head isn't tilted forward. Stretch the neck, upper back, and shoulders. Dedicate a short window of time every few hours to checking emails, texts, and social media so that you're not constantly checking throughout the day. The Text Neck Institute, http://text-neck.com/ , has an Android app that will notify users when they are holding their phones at a damaging angle.
