We want phones that are bigger, yet thinner, offsetting strides made in strengthening glass. We also want phones to be sleek: A phone that's rugged enough to withstand drops won't match what we expect smartphones to look and feel like.\n\"The tradeoff is phones get a lot bigger and bulkier,\" said Rick Osterloh, president of phone maker Motorola. \"Without a really big innovation and technological breakthrough, it's going to be hard to (make a really tough phone) in a size people expect.\"\nThat's not to say phones aren't getting stronger.\nThe latest phones from the two leading phone makers — Apple's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge Plus — mix zinc into the aluminum frames for aerospace-grade strength.\nThe frames will absorb more of the shock that would have gone to the glass, not to mention help prevent the phones from bending in pockets.\nThe displays also use ion-strengthened glass. Samsung uses Corning's Gorilla Glass 4, which gets heated in a process that replaces sodium ions on the surface with potassium ions. Because potassium ions are larger, they press together to create a stronger surface — akin to a layer of armor to protect the interior.\nAdvertisement Apple turned to Corning for a custom glass that goes through two rounds of ion exchange for greater strength.\nEven some budget and mid-range phones, including Motorola's, are using strengthened glass, although made with older, weaker formulas.\nSquareTrade, which offers protection plans for consumer electronics, said that although phone screens used to crack after one or two drops, the latest iPhones and the Note 5 survived 10 drops each from 6 feet in tests last weekend, at least when dropped on their corners. SquareTrade also said the new iPhone screens are more durable than last year's models.\nChelsea Wickline places a phone atop a DropBot, a robot used to test the durability of a phone, at SquareTrade offices in San Francisco. But for all new phones, the screens broke right away when dropped face down on concrete. The stronger glass improves the odds, but the risk isn't zero.\nScott Forester, director of innovations for Gorilla Glass, said Corning has made strides in withstanding the types of surfaces most likely to puncture glass, including asphalt and concrete. But he said that's offset by glass getting thinner and screens bigger over the years.\n\"It's always this fine balance between practicality and design,\" Forester said.\nWe might simply have to get a case, insurance or both.\nCases offer no guarantees, but they help. When Ben Wilson's iPhone 5 fell out of a private plane he was co-piloting at 9,300 feet, the case shattered but the phone survived. It helped that the phone landed on a pasture in northern Texas rather than a stone sidewalk.\n\"It surprised me,\" Wilson said, talking on that still-functioning phone nearly two weeks later. \"I thought it would be in quite a few pieces.\"", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1004/20151004__20151005_BB12_BZ05BROKENPHONES~p2_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:42:44.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
