People are replete with empathy and compassion, like to solve problems and enjoy communicating through stories. And these profoundly human traits are the areas where artificial intelligence (AI) trails humans. Because they are our strengths they point to the future of the office and to our workplace relationships with robots and AI.\nIn the future, people will spend more time dealing with other people rather than investing their energy in spreadsheets, machinery and computer screens. Rote decision making, repetitive tasks and data management will be owned by our silicon-chip workmates.\nYou can already glimpse this labour allocation in action – there are accounting apps that extract the information from photographs of receipts and automatically compile end-of-month reports. Meanwhile, the accelerating capability of AI to understand spoken human language will cause immense disruption. “Will we ultimately be able to replace most telephone operators? Yes,” says Paul Murphy, chief executive of voice technology company Clarify.io . “In fact I’d say speech recognition and understanding has the potential to eliminate any job where the role of the human is that of intermediary.”\nMeanwhile, we will be employed to tell stories, empathise, see the big picture, solve complex problems and adapt fast to changing situations.\nRather than displacing humans, AI will augment human strengths. This will lead to the invention of new roles, which fall into three categories.\n• Thinking differently\nAI and robots excel at following pre-set rules. People will thrive when they learn to harness machines for data insights, which they can use for problem-solving and innovation. An architect, for example, will be able to work much faster than today because of the range of technologies available, such as augmented reality visualisation and virtual reality headsets. But providing a solution that fits within the constraints of space, planning restrictions, budget and aesthetic style would be nigh-on impossible to automate.\n• Thinking bigger\nComputers can’t see the context, connection and patterns that humans can, despite crunching vast amounts of data at speed. For example, an automated ad-buying program might be brilliant at buying online advertising space for the right audience at the right price, but it might fail to realise that the day after an air accident would be the wrong day to advertise certain products or certain taglines. The future will involve people who oversee machine decision-making.\n• Social interaction\nThe analytical powers of robots enable them to suggest decisions in healthcare, financial investment and other areas based on huge quantities of data. IBM’s Watson computer, for example, can monitor a vast array of data inputs to identify possible medical problems and propose courses of treatment. But the communication of advice and the contextualised understanding of the best course of action for a specific patient is best handled by humans. As with medicine, so with finance: the role of the specialist human will be to mediate between the wonders of automation and the needs and desires of the patient or customer.\nMy PA’s a machine: ‘Some customers have sent her chocolates to thank her’ It’s unlikely you’d notice that Amy Ingram doesn’t actually exist. Perhaps you might spot that her initials are AI. But she writes emails in a chatty, friendly style and is the most efficient diary organiser you ever came across.\nAmy and her male equivalent, Andrew, are the invention of X.ai , a company that is taking the disruption of the personal assistant to new levels. There was a time – before emails and mobile phones – that busy executives needed a PA who could monitor the landline telephone and schedule meetings into a diary. Technology has changed all that; most of us now handle scheduling ourselves.\nYet the inevitable email ping pong of coordinating times, dates and venues consumes vast chunks of people’s lives. According to Dennis Mortensen, founder and chief executive of X.ai: “87 million US knowledge workers schedule more than 10bn formal meetings a year. Most of these are companies outside the Fortune 500.”\nMortensen was focused on cutting down the time spent organising meetings so that it could instead be used for speaking with colleagues and tackling and solving problems. “Why wouldn’t you employ an assistant, if she only cost you $9 [£5.21] per month?” he says. “And why would you ever pay an expensive employee to do email ping pong to set up meetings?”\nWhich is where Amy comes in. “She” is in fact a set of technologies that are plugged into your calendar and email that understand and communicate in natural human language. Introduce Amy into an email exchange and she will communicate on your behalf – until you receive an email from her telling you the meeting has been arranged.\nDespite being aware that you are dealing with a sophisticated email bot that doesn’t have feelings, you cannot help saying please and thank you. Customers have even been known to send her chocolates to thank her for organising events.\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.", "external_links": ["http://clarify.io/", "https://x.ai/"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:36:44.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
