This year’s report takes a look back over the last five years to see how attitudes to investment, maintenance and quality have changed over time.\nRichard Hepworth, President of Trelleborg’s marine systems operation, says: “In previous years, the Barometer Report has examined the issues helping and hindering port performance over a 12 month period. This year however, we decided to find out just how far the industry has come over the last five years. \n“During this time, ports have had to batten down the hatches in the grips of the recession, and have largely made the most of the situation they were faced with. However, as this year’s report highlights, the mist is beginning to lift, with last year’s anticipated budget boost now materializing. So much so, the majority of port owners and operators have the opportunity to invest more strategically in smart technologies and supplier service in a bid to improve long-term product performance.\n“One cause for concern though, is that while levels of unscheduled downtime have decreased over time, unscheduled downtime caused by fender damage has increased significantly in the last 12 months. As such, port owners, operators, consultants and contractors need to ensure they are not replacing like-for-like out of habit – but investing in quality solutions that will perform well over a long design life.\n“As discussed within the latest Barometer Report, supplier expertise should guide procurement decisions, and technology should enable owners and operators to minimize maintenance requirements.”\nTo download the Barometer Report 5, click here \nReview Trelleborg Marine Systems in the PTI Supplier Directory", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:23:21.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
