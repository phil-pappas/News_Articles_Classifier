NACOR has been designated as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS). \nAQI was established by ASA in 2009 to facilitate practice-based quality management through education and quality data feedback. Today, the AQI carries out this mission by helping hospitals and practices answer important questions about the care they deliver by gathering, analyzing, and providing the data that providers need. Through education and quality data feedback, AQI establishes evidence-based rationales to improve the care of patients, speed the response to critical incidents and reduce anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. \n\"AQI is the primary resource for physician anesthesiologists looking to assess and improve patient care as health care shifts to a value-based care model,\" said ASA President J.P. Abenstein, M.S.E.E., MD. \"Currently, more than 33,000 professionals are actively submitting data into NACOR. As we continue to grow, the data infrastructure and reporting system provided through RegistryMetrix will help us to identify best practices and opportunities for quality improvement by ASA members nationwide.\" \nNACOR provides participating providers with custom continuous performance monitors; performance gap analysis and patient outlier identification; access to improvement interventions to close performance gaps including patient care management tools, targeted education, and links to anesthesia information technology vendors; and peer-to-peer benchmarks. \n\"The NACOR registry is one of the largest and most important sources of clinical quality content in the country and affects all aspects of surgical care,\" said Brett Furst, CEO of ArborMetrix. \"We are delighted to be selected to strategically partner with ASA and AQI to evolve NACOR to the next level of performance measurement and quality improvement.\" \nArborMetrix will provide NACOR with a state-of-the-art registry system based on its proprietary cloud-based software platform. RegistryMetrix's electronic data integration, analytics, and dashboard reporting system will be used to collect patient information and perform real-time risk and reliability adjusted outcomes reporting. It will also provide analytics and reporting modules to help accelerate the quality improvement initiatives of AQI and participating practices. \nTWEET THIS: .@ASALifeline to measure physician anesthesiologists' performance, quality with @ArborMetrix #ClinicalAnalytics. http://bit.ly/1C4iaUE \nAbout The American Society of Anesthesiologists Founded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA®) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology.
