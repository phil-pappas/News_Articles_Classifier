Iran will provisionally apply the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement, pending its ratification by the [parliament],\" the IAEA said in a statement.\nThe additional protocol is a voluntary agreement enabling the IAEA to gain greater access to Iran's nuclear facilities and research, to ensure that no atomic material is diverted to any covert weapons programme - an aim denied strenuously by Tehran.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:32:14.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
