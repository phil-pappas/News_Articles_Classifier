The decision by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar came following a proposal put forward recently by Air Chief Arup Raha. The Army and the Navy too have women officers, but in roles that are not designed for direct combat. The first women fighter pilots would be selected from the batch that is undergoing training at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal, Telangana. After successful completion of ab-initio training, they would be commissioned in the fighter stream in June 2016. They would then undergo one-year advanced training and by June 2017, the first of the women pilots could be entering the fighter cockpit. Air Force women officers have been flying helicopters and transport planes for two decades but fighter jets were considered dangerous for them as these ran the risk of being shot down over enemy territory in case of war. “The Ministry of Defence has approved the induction of women into the fighter stream of the IAF... Since their induction into the transport and helicopter streams, their performance has been praiseworthy and on a par with their male counterparts,” said ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar. The IAF Chief had first spoken about women entering combat role at the passing-out parade of the Army’s Officer Training Academy at Gaya in December last. He took up the matter again on October 8 while speaking at the Air Force Parade at Hindon base on the IAF’s 83rd anniversary. “We have women pilots flying transport aircraft and helicopters. We are now planning to induct them into the fighter stream to meet the aspirations of the young women of India,” the Air Chief had said. Last week, Parrikar had convened a meeting of the three service chiefs to discuss having women in combat roles to make the forces gender-neutral. The IAF has around 35 squadrons of fighter jets (with 18 planes each) and plans to increase the fleet to 42 over the next 10 years. Several other countries, including Pakistan, have already engaged women to fly fighter jets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:00:35.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
