The CMA CGM Bougainville, the French liner’s new 18,000 TEU flagship vessel, has become the first ship in the world to use TRAXENS technology. The technology transforms standard containers into smart, connected, objects and introduces the multimodal transportation system into the Big Data era.\nRead: What is big data, and how is it used in ports and terminals? \nThe TRAXENS equipped smart containers aboard the CMA CGM Bougainville will be able to communicate among themselves as well as to the ship’s communication infrastructure by using built-in relay antennas, allowing even the most deeply hidden container to be connected.\nAll the collected data will then be sent to CMA CGM Headquarters in Marseille via TRAXENS’ data centers.\nThe TRAXENS system collects real-time data throughout the container’s transport whether on land or at sea, adding considerable value to the shipping line and to its customers, insurers, and customs.\nA wide range of data from each container can be gathered and transmitted to the CMA CGM group including information on location, temperature, humidity level, vibrations, impacts, attempted burglary, customs clearance status and more.\nThe devices provide even greater added value in the refrigerated transport of perishable goods. They can remotely control and adjust the temperature of refrigerated containers and will allow resource optimization for routine inspections.\nWith more than 12 million containers transported by CMA CGM , it means that a huge amount of information will be collected and analysed with the objective of improving the service provided to the end customers.\nIn February 2015, as part of their constant quest for added value innovation, CMA CGM Group strengthened their investment in TRAXENS, a Marseille based start-up.\nWith this partnership, CMA CGM has positioned itself as a forerunner in the field of Big Data as applied to transport and provides clients with unique solutions for monitoring and collecting information in real time, anywhere in the world.\nCMA CGM and TRAXENS aim to promote this technology as an international standard in the world of shipping.\nThe CMA CGM Bougainville will be inaugurated next Tuesday by President of France François Hollande.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:22:19.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
