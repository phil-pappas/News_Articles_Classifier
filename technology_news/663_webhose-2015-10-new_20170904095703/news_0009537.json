A person who works with Krach told Reuters the memo was authentic. \nKrach became CEO four years ago and has been chairman for seven. Sources familiar with the company say Krach will continue to have a significant presence there. He will stay on as chairman for at least three more years. \nHe is also one of DocuSign's largest individual shareholders. \nKrach will remain CEO until a replacement is named. A search has begun, and the board is looking at both internal and external candidates. \nThe next logical step for the company is an IPO, according to the source who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. \nDocuSign, valued at $3 billion, aims to replace one of the final paper-and-pen aspects of business transactions: the signature. It is available in more than 40 languages and about 188 countries. \nDocuSign recently closed a Series F funding round that exceeded $300 million and now has well over $500 million in financing. \n(Editing by Ken Wills)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:19:08.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
