This will be an immediate roll-out for all commercial establishments. Having the right amount of bandwidth has become as critical a resource to local businesses as clean water or electricity. Exacerbating this demand for broadband services is both the continual deterioration of legacy information technology facilities and the reduced investment in network infrastructure by incumbent providers.\nDark fiber is optical fiber cabling thatâ€™s currently in place but not being used. Think of dark fiber as an extension cord. When attached to a power source, an extension cord is a transport mechanism for electricity. The same holds true for dark fiber. When connected to a business with communications electronics on either side, it becomes the medium that voice, data and Internet traffic is transmitted.\nTypically, a dark fiber ( http://opticalfiber.us.com/ ) network will be designed with dual paths of communication or in a ring configuration. In the event of a cut in the fiber or an equipment failure, an instantaneous switch back to another communication signal would occur for maximum redundancy\nThe inherent advantages of dark fiber offer higher-speed connections linking several business locations, and provide the capacity for virtually unlimited expansion to multiple lines on the same broadband connection.\nMany mid-size businesses will face major communications challenges over the coming years:\nLinking online resources and databases to share knowledge among disparate locations. Obtaining fast and reliable connectivity to keep server clusters synchronized and ensure effective data mirroring, backup and load balancing. Increasing disaster recovery capabilities, placing different hosts in different locations with all critical data mirrored at each site. Upgrading facilities such as data centers and server farms.\nAbout Solveforce\nWe are committed to you in every aspect of the customer relationship.
