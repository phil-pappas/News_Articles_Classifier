In August along with Google's reorganization into Alphabet Inc, the company said Mr Kordestani would become an adviser to Alphabet and Google and the chief business officer role would be eliminated.\nThe appointment, announced in a tweet, comes just a day after Twitter announced that it would slash up to 336 jobs, or 8 per cent of its global workforce, marking the first mass layoff in the company's nine-year history.\nThe restructuring plan comes after co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as Twitter's chief executive with a mandate to get the once fast-growing social media service back on track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:21:38.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
