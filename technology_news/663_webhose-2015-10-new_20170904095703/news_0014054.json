Applied Mobile, formerly Applied MobileProducer, will increase enterprise mobility for an entire agency or brokerage by providing greater access to critical insurance information within Applied Epic and Applied TAM while away from the office. Available immediately, users can now access a new native app via an iOS® or Android™ smartphone device in addition to the previously available tablet version, providing increased on-the-go access to insurance information via multiple device types to improve productivity and customer service. Applied Mobile enables insurance agency and brokerage staff to access and manage client, prospect, and overall business information anywhere, anytime via a mobile smartphone or tablet device.
