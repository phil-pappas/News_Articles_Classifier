ICMI and Five9 boiled down the survey findings into a comprehensive eBook – a guide to understanding today’s contact center industry and measuring the level of customer service being delivered by organizations. The guide will help contact center leaders: Understand current communication channels Identify the right key performance indicators Define the seven categories of metrics Align metrics to appropriate channels Evolve their metrics over time \n“This eBook serves as a detailed guide for contact center leaders working to elevate the level of service their organizations provide. Further, it provides insight into what the appropriate metrics can do to help,” says Justin Robbins, senior analyst for ICMI. “Making changes within an organization should stem from a larger understanding of current standings; improvements should be made based on proven measurements, and this guide helps professionals do just that.” \nSeven Key Measurement Categories for Contact Centers \nAt the core of this guide are the seven key categories of measures that should be in place within any contact center. This list includes what metrics must be implemented by each organization, despite operational differences. Each of these measures provides essential information key to the evolution and success of any growing contact center. Forecast accuracy – If you don’t have an accurate prediction of the workload coming your way, it’s almost impossible to deliver efficient, consistent service and achieve high levels of customer satisfaction. Schedule fit and adherence – If you have a good handle on the workload, you can build accurate schedules that ensure the right people are in the right places at the right times. Resource accessibility – If customer contacts don’t get to the right places at the right times, little else can happen. Quality and first contact resolution – Quality is the link between contact-by-contact activities and the organization’s most important high-level objectives. First-contact resolution is essentially an extension of quality – a tangible result for getting quality right. Employee satisfaction – Employee satisfaction clearly influences, even drives, customer satisfaction and is an essential measure in any environment. Customer satisfaction – Customer satisfaction is essential in all environments and has the greatest value as a relative measure and in conjunction with other objectives. Strategic value – What contributions does the contact center make to revenues, marketing initiatives, product innovations and other primary business objectives? \n“Many companies struggle with identifying and measuring performance within their contact center. Five9 partners with enterprises to help them identify the most critical measurements they need to increase the efficiency and performance that a modern contact center requires. The momentum for cloud contact center software is being driven by these needs,” said Mayur Anadkat, vice president product marketing for Five9. \nAside from deep diving into these seven essential measures, the eBook also details six critical mistakes made by organizations implementing or serving a new channel, as well as five recommendations to identify and prevent service delivery problems. This type of insight not only gives contact center leaders the tools to overcome common issues within the customer management industry, but also the knowledge to prevent such issues from reoccurring - resulting in a stronger and longer lasting foundation for organizations to grow from. \nAbout ICMI \nThe International Customer Management Institute (ICMI) is the leading global provider of comprehensive resources for customer management professionals -- from frontline agents to executives -- who wish to improve customer experiences and increase efficiencies at every level of the contact center.
