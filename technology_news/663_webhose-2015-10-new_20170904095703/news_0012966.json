Bartner (@SBartner) January 18, 2015 Yesterday we compiled a series of photographs from Eric Pickersgill: \nIn each portrait, electronic devices have been edited out so that people stare at their hands, or the empty space between their hands, often ignoring beautiful surroundings or opportunities for human connection. The results are a bit sad and eerie—and a reminder, perhaps, to put our phones away. \nThe entire “Removed” series is here . But a reader, referencing the above tweet, offers a contrarian take:\nThere were no glory days when family members, lovers, or friends paid attention to each other during every hour spent together. People read books and newspapers, knitted, listened to the radio, watched TV, darned socks, put together jigsaw puzzles. \nSo let’s just let go of this notion that cell phones are isolating people. More often than not, they are conversing with others on the other end of that cell phone conversation, people who in the past would have been out of their lives because it was too expensive to call long distance and letters took ages to get there.\nThe aforementioned tweet makes me thing of this photo from 1946:\n17 yr old Stanley Kubrick shot this in nyc.

While analysts had expected modest growth of 4 percent in the coming fiscal year, the big-box retailer forecast a decrease of 6 to 12 percent.\n\r \r One way to look at this is to say the reasons for Walmart’s decline are complex.

But with the economy in a long (if still slow) recovery, there’s an increasing desire among shoppers for more tailored experiences. Nothing seems more antithetical to the era of bespoke, small-batch goods than Walmart—though this artisanal cheese and fruit basket , at just $78.99, looks pretty good.

Bored, I picked it up to check the app that wirelessly grabs data from the fitness band I’d started wearing a month earlier.

The arrow near the left margin, he said, represented how governments worldwide could stimulate ingenuity to combat climate change by dramatically increasing spending on research and development. “The push is the R&D,” he said, before indicating the arrow on the right. “The pull is the carbon tax.” Between the arrows he sketched boxes to represent areas, such as deployment of new technology, where, he argued, private investors should foot the bill.

It’s a paltry sum compared to his rivals, and if Jindal can’t jumpstart his White House bid soon, he could be headed the way of Rick Perry and Scott Walker, who ended their campaigns when their coffers ran dry.\n\r \r Jindal’s haul—or lack thereof—was the most ominous signal that came from the quarterly FEC filing deadline on Thursday, which showed that the top two Democrats, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, each raised more money between June and September than any of the 15 Republicans still in the race. (Donald Trump, of course, has access to more money than any of them through his own personal wealth.) Clinton raised $28 million and Sanders raised $26 million.
