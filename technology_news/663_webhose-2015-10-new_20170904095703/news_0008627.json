This is likely due to their limited uses and scenarios for exploit. Account login credentials for accounts containing from $400 to $1,000 have been estimated to cost between $20 and $50, while login credentials for accounts containing from $5,000 to $8,000 range from $200 to $300. \nBank login credentials \nCybercriminals can purchase banking login credentials and services allowing them to stealthily transfer stolen funds across international borders. McAfee Labs found login credentials for a $2,200 balance account selling for $190. Bank login credentials coupled with the ability to stealthily transfer funds to U.S. banks ranged from $500 for a $6,000 account balance, to $1,200 for a $20,000 account balance. United Kingdom transfers ranged from $700 for a $10,000 account balance, to $900 for a $16,000 account balance. \nOnline premium content services \nThe report also assesses dark market prices for account login credentials to online content services such as online video streaming($0.55 to $1), premium cable channel streaming services ($7.50), premium comic book services ($0.55), and professional sports streaming ($15). These relatively low price points suggest that cybercriminals have ramped up automated theft operations to make their cybercrime business models profitable. \nLoyalty, community accounts \nSome online services, such as login credentials to hotel loyalty programs and online auction accounts, would appear to be low value targets, but researchers found that these credentials are also offered for sale on the dark market. Apparently, these allow buyers to conduct online purchases under the guise of their victims. McAfee Labs researchers found a major hotel brand loyalty account with 100,000 points for sale for $20, and an online auction community account with high reputation marks priced at $1,400. \nFor more information, please read the full report: The Hidden Data Economy . \nFor guidance on how consumers can better protect themselves from the consequences of data breaches and the fraud and theft that often follow, please visit: Consumer Blog . \nAbout McAfee Labs \nMcAfee Labs is the threat research division of Intel Security and one of the world’s leading sources for threat research, threat intelligence, and cybersecurity thought leadership.
