It also said it expected to add about 3.50 million subscribers worldwide. \nRevenue rose 23.3 percent to $1.74 billion. \nNet income fell to $29.4 million, or 7 cents per share, from $59.3 million, or 14 cents per share. \nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 8 cents per share on revenue of $1.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) The Netflix logo is shown in this illustration photograph in Encinitas, California October 14, 2014.
