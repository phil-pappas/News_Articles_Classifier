ORBCOMM acquires WAM to complete reefer asset tracking set The internet of things solutions provider ORBCOMM will use WAM's installed based of shipping lines and produce companies to add reefer container tracking to similar capabilities for other equipment types. By Eric Johnson | Wednesday, October 07, 2015 WAM Technologies, a provider of remote wireless management and control solutions for reefer containers, has been acquired by ORBCOMM Inc., the company said this week. Publicly-traded ORBCOMM is a global provider of machine-to-machine and \"internet of things\" solutions. WAM was previously an affiliate of New Jersey-based Mark-It Services, which provides asset management solutions to logistics companies. WAM’s product helps carriers and produce companies monitor the temperature and location of refrigerated containers. The acquisition of WAM is intended to strengthen ORBCOMM’s cold chain monitoring solutions, which include trailers, rail cars, gensets and now sea containers. With the addition of WAM’s installed base, ORBCOMM becomes the clear leader in monitoring cargo shipments, according to the company. “WAM is a natural addition to ORBCOMM’s offerings,” said ORBCOMM’s Chief Executive Officer Marc Eisenberg. “They are a leader in refrigerated sea container telematics supporting a strong base of customers. Their patented M2M technology and powerful software platform completes ORBCOMM’s cold chain offering, enabling us to now deliver best-in-class solutions for nearly all refrigerated asset types.” WAM has approximately 40 employees in North America, India and Australia. The WAM employees located in Hyderabad, India are expected to be co-located with ORBCOMM’s software development facility in India over the coming months. “We have had a long history of cooperation with ORBCOMM, providing refrigerated protective services, and their market leadership and expertise in refrigerated transportation makes them a great fit for WAM,” said Mark Heck, Mark-It Services CEO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:48:06.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
