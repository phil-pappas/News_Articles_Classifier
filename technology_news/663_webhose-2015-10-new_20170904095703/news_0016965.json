The changes are aimed at all versions of Outlook, but for now will only be used on the Web version.\nAn @Mention makes sense in Outlook, especially for nudging people who might have zoned out of a painfully long email thread. It’s a timesaver too: Mentioning someone with the symbol will automatically add the person to the “To” line of an email. It might also help solve those annoying cases when a person is mentioned in an email, but isn’t added to the To line.\nA thumbs-up to an email, meanwhile, is an easy show of support for a creative, funny or insightful message without adding yet another Reply All to the mix. If your email gets “liked,” you’ll get notified.\nGood ideas on the internet get vacuumed up and repurposed, and few others stand out as much as the “like,” the “@Mention” and the hashtag. For example, Facebook introduced hashtags to tie together trending topics —#WorldCup, for example — after they exploded on Twitter. The enterprise-messaging platform Slack lifted the Twitter convention of virtually tapping someone on the shoulder with a mention, @Fitzy style.\nBasically, if a feature gets adopted by the masses, it’s a good bet it will show up in newly created tools these days. A venerable workplace productivity tool like Outlook, though, is another matter. Internet hieroglyphs such as the @ symbol and thumbs-up icon may startle some long-time users.\nMicrosoft said the like feature will reach eligible Office 365 customers by the end of October. Mentions come a little later, including to Outlook.com users moving over to the new version of the service. Other platforms, such as Outlook for iOS and Android, get the new interactions in the first half of 2016. Microsoft has more details on how they work here.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:52:52.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
