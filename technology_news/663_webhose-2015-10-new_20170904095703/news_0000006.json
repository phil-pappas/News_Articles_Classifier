It is derived from the combination of two words of two languages, Greek and Latin. The first Greek word, autos, represents self while the second Latin word, motives, represents of motion. Together, they form a single word, automotive.The automotive industry started in the year 1890s with the United States leading the entire world in the manufacturing of automobiles. This was changed in the year of 1980 where Japan takes over the United States until the year of 1994. However, Japan once again overtook the United States in the year 2006 until in the year of 2009 where China claims the lead by manufacturing 13.8 million automobiles.China, Japan and the United States are currently holding on to the top three spots of the most vehicles producing countries around the whole world. With a global production of nearly 90 million automobiles in the year 2014, the automotive industry represents a very big market to venture into. Polytech recognizes this huge market potential of the automotive industry and provides a wide variety of accessories that caters to the automotive industry.One such accessory is the automotive keypad which can be found in the interior of any automobile.Polytech is able to customize any kind of automotive keypad that is of high quality and at an economical price. Besides the automotive keypad, Polytech also manufactures industrial keypads and consumable keypads. All these keypads enable Polytech to be the expert in producing keypads that can be used in any types of applications. Finding a good automotive keypad supplier is important as the interior of an automobile will determine the overall feel.Having a posh exterior but a lousy interior will destroy the brand consequently. Polytech is one good supplier that is able to provide high quality automotive keypad that will greatly enhance the interior of the automobile and makes it feel luxuries. An inferior automotive keypad will generally cause the consumer to feel that the entire automobile looks cheap and undesirable.As the keypad communicates the driver with the functions of the car, it is required to be 100 percent functional at all times such that it works as intended when each key on the keypad is pressed and the correct feature is activated. At the same time, the keypad needs to be ergonomic with a great design look that attracts the driver to use it with both ease and safety.There are some manufacturers who sacrifice quality in order to produce the cheapest automotive keypads that are possible to supply their customers. This is usually done with interior raw materials and poorly skilled workers that are much cheaper compared with what Polytech purchases and employs. The end result is a tarnished reputation of an inferior automotive interior feel.
