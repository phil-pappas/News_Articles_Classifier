Under the terms of the offer, the Lam would acquire KLA-Tencor in a transaction valued at approximately $10.6 billion . Pursuant to the deal, KLA-Tencor stockholders would be entitled to elect to receive the economic equivalent of $32.00 in cash and 0.5 of a share of Lam Research common stock, in all-cash, all-stock, or mixed consideration, representing total consideration of approximately $67.02 per share. According to Yahoo Finance, at least one analyst has set a target price for KLA-Tencor stock of $81.00 per share. Our investigation concerns whether the KLA-Tencor board of directors is fulfilling its fiduciary duties, maximizing the value of the Company, disclosing all material benefits and costs, and obtaining full and fair consideration for Company stockholders. If you own KLA-Tencor shares and wish to discuss this matter with us, or have any questions concerning your rights and interests with regard to this matter, please contact: Benjamin I Sachs-Michaels, Esq.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:39:20.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
