Local firefighters extinguished the flames.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the incident “irresponsible” and said the site would be repaired . A spokesman for the Israel Defense Force tweeted:\nOvernight #Palestinians set ablaze Joseph's Tomb, in a blatant violation of the basic value of freedom of worship. pic.twitter.com/qsOCRFg205\n— Peter Lerner (@LTCPeterLerner) October 16, 2015 The site is believed to be the resting place of the biblical Joseph. Jewish worshippers gathered to pray at the site every month, in visits coordinated with the Palestinian Authority. But Haaretz reports there were recent tensions over uncoordinated visits to the tomb. Heres more from the Israeli newspaper:\nJoseph’s Tomb was not included in the grave list of holy sites which was transferred to the Palestinians as a result of the second Oslo agreement signed in 1995. When the IDF pulled out of Nablus that same year as a result of the agreement, Od Yosef Hai, a yeshiva founded in the 1980s, it's name a Biblical reference, became a Jewish and Israeli enclave in the area. But in 2000, because of the outbreak of the second intifada, Israel completely withdrew from the grave, as it was too difficult to defend.\nThe attack on the site comes a day after Abbas spoke to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry about the recent violence, which in the past month has seen eight Israelis killed in attacks by Palestinians, and 31 Palestinians, including 14 attackers, killed by Israeli fire. The numbers come from The Associated Press .", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34547523", "http://t.co/qsOCRFg205", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/edca1ac1ccf045f3ab748d952f06bc4a/latest-palestinians-torch-site-revered-some-jews", "http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.680740", "https://twitter.com/LTCPeterLerner/status/654895499246489600", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Palestinians?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:23:26.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
