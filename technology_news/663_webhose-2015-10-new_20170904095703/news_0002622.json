(NYSE: BLOX), the network control company, today announced a free test drive of its industry-leading DDI solution that is available virtually anywhere, anytime, without requiring software downloads, installation, or configuration. \nThe test drive ( www.infoblox.com/test-drive ) is cloud based and comes with step-by-step instructions for exploring three common network-control use cases. Until now, evaluating Infoblox DDI required downloading virtual appliance software, then installing and configuring it to run on a user's system, or arranging a demonstration session with an Infoblox representative. \nInfoblox is the industry leader in DNS, DHCP, and IP address management -- the category known as DDI. Infoblox DDI is available in both physical and virtual appliances, and is compatible with more cloud and virtualization platforms than any other DDI vendor's offerings. Infoblox-supported platforms include VMware, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Cisco, OpenStack, HP, BMC, CA, and ElasticBox. \nTo take the test drive, users create a free account and then wait briefly while a virtual environment with an instance of Infoblox DDI is prepared in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. The system notifies users via email when the virtual environment is ready, and users can then explore the full Infoblox DDI product interface with unrestricted access to a wide range of features. The instructions allow users to easily move through three use cases: Setting up an Infoblox DNS and IP address management (IPAM) server Discovering and tracking virtual machines and networks with Infoblox vDiscovery Leveraging the Infoblox API Proxy feature to automate DNS and IP address provisioning \n\"Our new test drive has no cost, requires almost no effort, and takes almost no time to launch,\" said Arya Barirani, vice president of product marketing at Infoblox. \"In short, it's never been easier to see for yourself how Infoblox DDI can make networks more reliable, scalable, and secure.\" \nPricing and Availability \nThe Infoblox DDI test drive is free, and allows three hours of use per session. It is available now at www.infoblox.com/test-drive or https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/manage/ . \nAbout Infoblox Infoblox (NYSE: BLOX) delivers critical network services that protect Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, automate cloud deployments, and increase the reliability of enterprise and service provider networks around the world.
