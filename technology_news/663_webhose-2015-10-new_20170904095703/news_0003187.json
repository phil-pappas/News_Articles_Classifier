This process is assumed to have been rapid and, by the same token, not to have resulted in any major storages of this sediment as large deposits along the way.\nThe researchers, from Uppsala University (led by Thomas Stevens) and Lanzhou University (led by Junsheng Nie), China, analysed Yellow River sediment from source to sink and determined its mineral composition. They also determined the age of mineral grains of zircon, a very hard silicate mineral that is highly resistant to weathering.\nThe scientists found that the composition of sediment from the Yellow River underwent radical change after passing the Chinese Loess Plateau. Contrary to their expectations, however, the windborne loess was not the main source of the sediment. Instead, they found that the Loess Plateau acts as a sink for Yellow River material eroded from the uplifting Tibetan plateau.\nThis finding completely changes our understanding of the origin of the Chinese Loess Plateau. It also demonstrates large scale sediment storage on land, which explains the previously contradictory findings in this area.\nThe results suggest that a major change in the monsoon around 3.6 million years ago caused the onset of Yellow River drainage, accelerated erosion of the Tibetan plateau and drove loess deposition, Stevens wrote.\nWeathering of this eroded material also constitutes a further mechanism that may explain the reduced levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the beginning of the Ice Age. The researchers’ next step will be to compare terrestrial and marine records of erosion to gauge how far sediment storage on land has impacted the marine record.\nThe study is published in journal Nature Communications.\n 11, 2015 8:38 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:17:52.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
