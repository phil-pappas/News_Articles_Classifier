Users of the tool can compare a completely prefabricated data centre in which power, cooling and IT facilities are factory built, pre-tested and pre-configured off-site, compared to a traditional design and build approach. They can also examine the effects of a partially modular approach, using prefabricated modules for only one or some of the elements.\nThe key cost drivers to consider are cooling architecture, rack density, module placement and whether to build or lease the property. The tool uses pricing information from a variety of sources inside and outside Schneider Electric including third-party equipment suppliers and government labour statistics to provide rough comparisons of the costs of choosing a particular module or combination of modules.\nThe tool makes use of trending data to devise multipliers to estimate the effects of increasing rack density, capacity and redundancy. It calculates a summary of the capital expenditure incurred by a variety of options and demonstrates the percentage difference. Bar charts provide a graphical overview of the equipment, design/installation and space/building costs for each approach.\nThe Cooling Economizer Mode PUE Calculator allows planners to compare common cooling economiser architectures for a given geography, load and operating environment.\nUsers of the tool input the data centre’s specific location, IT capacity, IT load density, desired operating temperature and other power characteristics.\nThe tool calculates Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), energy cost, annual carbon emissions and the economiser mode hours for a variety of cooling architectures. These include chilled water architectures: using a chiller with a cooling tower and perimeter computer-room air handler (CRAH), or a containerised packaged chiller with dry cooler and row-based CRAH; glycol-cooled architectures; and a variety of air-cooled architectures.\nThe calculations are based on measured and estimated device-loss data. Losses are adjusted for IT inlet temperature and humidity in the location and weather date temperature is used to determine the number of economiser mode hours at each temperature.\nUsing the tool will help planners determine the optimal cooling economiser approach for their data centre.\nBoth the Prefabricated vs Traditional Data Center Cost Calculator and the Cooling Economizer Mode PUE Calculator tools are now available for free use online via the Schneider Electric corporate website.
