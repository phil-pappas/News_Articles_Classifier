After initially opting to conduct his own defence, he however applied to get legal representation.\nMaasdorp was arrested and appeared in court in September, after investigating officer Lieutenant Colonel Eddie Clark got a warrant for his arrest because of new information that came to light.\nAccording to a Sapa report from September 2000, a confession by one of Farmer’s killers, Glenville Faro, detailed how Maasdorp and Franklin Roberts raped and stabbed Farmer in a derelict house, where he (Faro) had had sex with her. She was stabbed 53 times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:24:55.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
