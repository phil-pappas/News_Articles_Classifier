(NASDAQ: FALC), a 15-year innovator of software-defined storage solutions, today announced that it will introduce an OpenStack Cinder Integration for its FreeStor® intelligent software-defined platform at OpenStack Summit, a four-day conference for developers, users, and administrators of OpenStack Cloud Software, in Tokyo October 27-30. \nOpenStack is a massively scalable, open source cloud operating system that is on the verge of becoming the industry standard for public and private clouds. FalconStor technology drives smart, reliable cloud data protection services to reduce costs and improve performance. With the combination of FreeStor and OpenStack, organizations can move data management operations to the cloud to deliver efficient replication, protection, disaster recovery and optimization across their infrastructure. \nCinder virtualizes pools of block storage devices while allowing end users to utilize this storage pool without the need for actually knowing where or on what type of device this storage resides. By providing an integration driver to Cinder, FreeStor's seamless unified data services, such as deduplication and compression, replication, application-aware snapshots and mirroring, can be converged and virtualized across all storage environments utilized within the OpenStack framework. \nFreeStor's horizontal architecture unlocks a new world of storage focused IT opportunities, allowing IT managers, MSPs and CSPs to maximize efficiencies and lower costs while taking advantage of cloud, hybrid cloud, flash storage and Software-Defined Storage. A groundbreaking Intelligent Abstraction® approach delivers seamless access and unified data services across entire storage infrastructures without having to invest in new technology, or rip and replace existing platforms. Always-on availability and continuity keep business running, while enabling them to move, synchronize and protect data seamlessly across virtual and physical storage platforms. \n\"Integrating the right software-defined storage platform as part of OpenStack is key to the ultimate success or failure of the implementation,\" said Gary Quinn, FalconStor President and CEO. \"Depending on an organization's workload or applications, poor storage integration can cause a severe bottleneck in OpenStack infrastructures. By implementing a high-performance, fully featured solution like FreeStor that properly utilizes the Cinder driver, organizations can access a plethora of data services integrated into OpenStack with the performance and reliability required of today's data-intense business environments.\" \nFalconStor's Cinder driver enables access to FreeStor's data services including support for application-aware snapshots, sync mirroring and replication will be submitted to OpenStack for ratification as part of the March Mitaka OpenStack release.
