Scientists have long debated that question, and now a study of doggie DNA from around the world is pointing to Central Asia.\nResearchers say man's best friend may have evolved somewhere near what is now Nepal and Mongolia.\nPrevious studies have suggested southern China, the Middle East, Siberia and Europe. Dogs, our first domesticated animal, arose from wolves at least 15,000 years ago.\nThe new work is based on dog DNA from 38 countries. It came not from house pets, but rather from dogs that wander freely in villages or fields.\nResults were reported in a paper released Monday by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n___\nOnline:\nJournal: http://www.pnas.org\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:23:23.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
