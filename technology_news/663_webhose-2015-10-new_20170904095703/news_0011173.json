Toyota is the latest company to jump on the driverless bandwagon. Stated by Bloomberg Business, on October 6 Toyota Motor Corporation unveiled its driverless concept car to reporters in the form of an adapted Lexus GS sedan. \nAs reported “Its ‘highway teammate’ concept car, a modified Lexus GS sedan, pulled off automated feats including entering public expressways, switching lanes and steering to the off ramp, all while picking spots to speed up or slow down based on the surrounding traffic.” \nToyota suppliers including Denso Corporation have teamed with Toyota to develop the Lexus GS driverless car. Toyota Motor Corporation has not detailed if their first driverless vehicle will be a Lexus or a Toyota. They have stated that they aim to have the first cars ready for highway going driverless driving ready for release sometime around 2020. \nUS Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx recently visited the Frankfurt Auto Show. Driverless car market quoted an interview statement Foxx made in German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . Reported on September 9 “He stated that he is very optimistic with respect to driverless cars and expects to see them in use everywhere in the world within 10 years. He wants to accelerate the process for the introduction of new technologies such as self-driving cars and avoid the current legislative delays of five or six years. Of, course safety must always be assured.” \nDriverless running cars are looking to be a reality for the not so distant future with companies such as Audi forecasting their driverless vehicles to be road ready as early as 2017. Motoring.com.au reports that Stefan Moser, the Head of Product and Technology Communications for Audi, has stated how the upcoming Audi A8, due to debut in 2017 will be totally fully self-sufficient as a complete driverless vehicle without depending on a human driver who’s attention can get diverted from the road. Moser stated “Audi wants to be first to market with a self-driving car.” He specifically remarked about how well Audi’s autonomous car technology already works and now it will be a waiting game until legislation can meet up to where the technology is in order to place vehicles on the road. \nDelphi test drove their driverless car in a successful almost 3,400 journey from San Francisco, California ending in New York City in April, 2015. The Audi known as Roadrunner is said to have performed “exceptionally well” during its nine day cross country drive. The Roadrunner was taken through many different road conditions during its journey including “mountains, heat, traffic jams, trucks, road construction and even tumbleweed.” \nTech companies are joining the car industry in the competition to be the first and best to be going driverless. Google has its own driverless scheme in motion with the Google Self-Driving Car Project. As explained on the website “We’ve taught our cars to navigate through many complicated scenarios on city streets” continuing “Our cars use their sensors and software to sense objects like pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles and more, and are designed to safely drive around them.” Justin Sullivan/ Getty Images \nThe driverless technology has somewhat begun to be used in vehicles now being sold with self parking abilities aided by driver assistance. There are questions about who is to be responsible in the case of driverless car accidents. In response to this question, and in an effort to speed up the process of getting tough regulations in the United States passed, makers are saying that they will take full responsibility. Volvo, Google and Mercedes are all ready to accept responsibility for accidents in vehicles that they sell that will be going driverless. \n[Featured image credit Spencer Platt/ Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:52:52.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
