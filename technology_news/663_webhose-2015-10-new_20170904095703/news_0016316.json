Expert speakers will cover a range of topics, including supply chain integration, trade promotion management, and big data and analytics. The results of the annual Tech Trends study will be presented by Stephen Smith, managing vice president at Gartner, who will focus on the initiatives that most often lead to growth.\n“Consumer brands are at a cross-road as consumers design their own path to purchase through social, mobile, and other online means that cause a rethinking of technology investments for brand differentiation.
