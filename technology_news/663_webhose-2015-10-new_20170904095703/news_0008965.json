Photo by: Patrick Whittemore An ink-jet printed hologram shows the potential of the new software’s 3-D effect. prev next comments Tweet A MassChallenge finalist is making the first commercial light field display engine — better display technology through software that creates a 3-D effect.\nDeveloped through research at the MIT Media Lab, Lumii’s software replaces low-resolution display optics to solve the problems that have prevented glasses-free 3-D from going mainstream.\nLumii-powered displays adapt to both viewers and content to create realistic, high-resolution depth images in the native format of the human brain.\n“Our goal is to deliver a completely natural-looking 3-D experience anywhere you would normally see a 2-D display, without requiring special glasses to do so,” said CEO Thomas Baran.\nBaran and co-founders Matthew Hirsch and Daniel Leithinger became interested in 3-D display because it provides a sense of depth to the viewer and is an emerging technology increasingly used in movies, video games, photography, education, defense and engineering simulation.\nBy 2018, 80 percent of smartphones sold will have a 3-D camera, according to an Allied Market Research report. And by 2020, the 3-D display market overall is expected to reach $112.9 billion, driven by the ability to create compelling visual experiences, AMR predicts.\nYet today’s displays only show an impoverished slice of reality, Hirsch said.\nIn addition to movies, video games and smartphones, Lumii’s software could be used in GPS devices to replace the flat images on computer monitors that some cars have.\n“It would be a much more realistic view of what you’re seeing and could enhance your reaction time,” Baran said.\nThe software also could be used in MRI scans to help doctors detect any abnormalities in a patient, he said.\nAnd in the coming months, Lumii expects to install small batches of 3-D print signage and interactive information kiosks in select stores.\n“Imagine going into a store and seeing a pair of shoes that you’d like to customize,” Baran said.\nUsing Lumii’s software, customers could see a 3-D version of the shoe in the color they’d like.\n“Ultimately,” he said, “our vision is to transform the way people interact with information, whether it’s a sign, a computer, a tablet or a smartphone.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=3-D+display%2C+no+glasses"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:37.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
