He offered a series of examples here Tuesday, capped by leading a brief meditation session.\nThe short closing ritual--exhorting his audience to clear their minds, be grateful and pay attention to their breathing--was part of an ethos of \"mindfulness\" that Mr. Benioff espoused in a session at The Wall Street Journal's WSJDLive conference. The conversation focused on his company's efforts in philanthropy, social activism and providing more than economic benefits to its employees.\nSalesforce, which Mr. Benioff predicted will soon be the world's fourth-largest software company, was founded in 1999. From the start, the company pledged to donate 1% of its equity, 1% of its profit and 1% of its employees' time to philanthropic causes.\nMr. Benioff also famously took a high-profile stand against an Indiana law that allowed business owners to discriminate in the name of religious freedom, which was considered antigay; the law was later amended.\nOne inspiration for some of the policies, Mr. Benioff said, was his prior stint at software giant Oracle Corp., where he fulfilled many career goals --but found something missing. \"I had an incredible feeling of unfulfillment,\" he said.\nAnother inspiration was Thich Nhat Hanh, a 90-year-old Vietnamese monk and Zen master whom Mr. Benioff said he helped to transport from France to San Francisco after a stroke. As a result, Mr. Benioff said, there are 30 monks living in his spare home.\nMindfulness and philanthropy were major themes at a recent Salesforce conference, and Mr. Benioff argued that there are business benefits to such practices.\nFor one thing, they make it easier to recruit millennial-age workers at a time when hiring can be difficult in tech-crazed San Francisco. \"When you talk to millennials, they want meaning in their work,\" he said.\nBut Mr. Benioff said he had been slow to recognize women's issues at Salesforce, including whether women were paid equally with men. He said the company has recently reviewed all employees' pay to improve parity.\nHe exhorted other tech companies to do the same. \"It's not that hard to do,\" he said.\nAmid his company's social goals, Mr. Benioff admitted he had to eliminate one social outlet--postings on Facebook Inc., deciding to stick mainly to Twitter Inc.\n\"I had too much going on,\" he said. \"I had to pare down.\"\nWrite to Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com\n 20, 2015 21:52 ET (01:52 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:09:03.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
