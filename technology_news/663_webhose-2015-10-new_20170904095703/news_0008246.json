The Paris-based company is about 98 percent owned by SoftBank Group in Japan. \nAldebaran sells one batch of 1,000 Pepper robots monthly, with an up-front price of $1,500 euros and then monthly subscription payments of about $200 euros for three years, according to Cubier. \nPepper was billed as a \"new species\" of robot capable of recognizing basic emotions such as happiness and sadness by looking at people's faces. \n\"Faces mean a lot to me; even more when they are smiling,\" a Pepper model said while describing its facial recognition capabilities during a demonstration. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (L) meets Softbank's humanoid robot 'Pepper', at the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo, on October 5, 2015 \n\"It is pretty clever because it keeps me from trying to interact with non-human things,. For example, those couches never talk back.\" \nAldebaran in September began gathering research that showed people tended either use the robots as day-to-day home companions or took creative approaches of building in their own software applications for small business purposes. \nPepper was at WSJDLive as part of a quest for partners in the hope of expanding to the US market, according to Cubier. Japanese telecom giant Softbank's humanoid robot Pepper gestures alongside Tottori Prefecture Governor Shinji Hirai as they promote watermelon produce at a shop in Tokyo, in July 2015 \n\"We see robots being more and more present in our daily life to help us; assist us; entertain us, live with us,\" she said. \nPepper's effort to spread to France and beyond comes with the challenge of adapting robots to different ways emotions are expressed in the world's diverse array of cultures and places. \nFor example, Pepper will shake hands with shoppers in Franceâ€”but not greet them with robotic pecks on cheeks, something Cubier promised to look into.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:50:08.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
