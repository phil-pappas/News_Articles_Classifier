During the month of October, for every SleepPhones® product purchased in the Sunset Pink color, AcousticSheep will donate a SleepPhones® Classic product to a breast cancer patient at the Cleveland Clinic.\nAcousticSheep CEO, Dr. Wei-Shin Lai, explains that, “We hope to donate a few hundred units to some of the Cleveland Clinic’s patients diagnosed with breast cancer.”\nDr. Lai continues that “SleepPhones really are great to ease the anxiety, stress and depression that sadly goes hand-in-hand with cancer. We recently received a testimony from a woman who had been diagnosed with brain cancer several years ago. Over the years since her diagnosis, she was so full of anxiety, stress, and not to mention the sickness from the very treatment of cancer itself, that she had an extremely difficult time sleeping. When she began using SleepPhones, she said it literally changed her life. She was finally able to rest again and it improved her quality of life so much that she was able to 'start living' again.”\nTo purchase a Sunset Pink SleepPhones® product, visit http://www.SleepPhones.com/SleepPhones-Pink\nAbout AcousticSheep LLC:\nAcousticSheep LLC, an Erie, Pennsylvania-based company, strives to create a world of happy, healthy and well-rested people with its comfortable headphones, allowing for easy sleep and enjoyable exercise.
