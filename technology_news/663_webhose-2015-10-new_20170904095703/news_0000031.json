Updates may not be found, download or installed properly, you may not find new updates even though you know some are available, or you may get error messages when using the service. \nWhatever it is, it may lead to a lengthy troubleshooting session to correct the issue on the machine it is experienced on. \nWhile a reboot may be sometimes all that is needed to fix the issue, it is sometimes more complicated than that. \nThe Reset Windows Update Agent program has been designed for these situations. It enables you to run fixes for specific update related components instead of doing something drastic at the beginning, like using System Restore or a backup to restore a previous state of the Windows operating system. \nNote : You need to run the program with elevated privileges. Right-click on it and select \"run as administrator\" to do so. Before you do, you may want to go through the script line by line by opening it in a text editor of choice to make sure it is only doing what it is supposed to be doing. \nThe program displays a list of fixes on start that you can run (after a disclaimer): Change invalid values in the Windows Registry. It will delete and add certain values in the Registry (which you see when you open the command file in a text editor).
