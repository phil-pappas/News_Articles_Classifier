The company received over $US14bn of orders for the debt set to price Wednesday, according to that person, in what investors said was a sign of strong demand. BHP had originally looked to sell around $US5bn in bonds, according to investors.\nOver the past six months, investors had sold off mining company bonds as worries over China's economic slowdown hit the prices of commodities from coal to copper. In September, concerns over the credit quality of Glencore sparked a huge selloff across the mining sector, which had binged on debt as it expanded during the commodities bull run.\nBut investors say BHP, the world's largest miner, stands out among its peers for its relatively strong credit ratings. BHP is currently rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by Standard & Poor's, making it one of the very top rated companies in this sector.\nThose ratings tempted investors to wager on a relatively rare new mining bond as they hunt for returns in a world in which base interest rates remain near zero in many countries. The sale also comes as many commodity prices climb to multimonth highs, causing a rally in the shares and bonds of some miners.\nThe low interest rate environment makes it an \"opportune moment\" to consider issuing these securities, the company said in a statement filed with Australian Securities Exchange in September. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing other near-term debt when it comes due, it said.\nThe demand for the offering meant BHP could lower the yield it had planned to offer. The final yield offered on BHP's 60-year euro-denominated bond, which can be retired after nine years, was set at 5.625 per cent, according to a deal notice released Wednesday. The bond had originally offered a yield of 5.875 per cent, according to an earlier notice. The US tranches will price later Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nRichard Klijnstra, a fund manager at Kempen Capital Management, said BHP had needed to offer a higher yield to investors given September's commodity sell-off and the sharp fall in Glencore's and other miners' bonds.\n\"They offer a good yield in this environment,\" Mr Klijnstra said.\nMr Klijnstra, who bought the euro-denominated bonds, said he is getting 0.5 percentage points more yield than he would normally expect to be offered for buying similar debt from BHP.\nThe use of hybrid bonds, which combine aspects of both debt and equity, could help to preserve BHP's ratings. Interest payments on the bonds can be deferred and the bonds are junior to all other forms of debt in the event of a default. The new bonds will be considered half debt, half equity by ratings firms, according to the deal notices.\nThese bonds are also seen by investors as being more risky than some other forms of corporate debt and saw a sell-off during September. Still, given the extra risk they pay higher yield. That is attractive for investors looking for income amid low interest rates.\nThe extra yield wasn't enough to attract Rabbani Wahhab, a senior portfolio manager at London & Capital. Mr Wahhab said the combination of September's decline in the price of hybrid securities and \"an onslaught on raw materials generally\" deterred him from buying the BHP deal.\n\"We're still staying away from the entire commodity area,\" Mr Wahhab said.\nSeptember's commodities selloff hit miners' bonds hard, as the average yield on debt issued by metals and mining companies hit a six-year high of 6.4 per cent in late September, according to Barclays. That was up from a recent low of 3.3 per cent in April. Yields rise as prices fall.\nThe more recent gains in commodity prices have pushed the average yield on mining companies' debt to 5.3 per cent, according to Barclays. Metals prices have gained on a mixture of factors, with copper gaining, for instance, on the belief that supply is falling. Miners are also looking to shore up their balance sheets and ratings, with Glencore announcing it will sell two mines.\nThis year, the mining sector is on course for its lowest level of bond issuance since 2011, according to Dealogic.\n\"It certainly is a difficult period for the mining sector because the companies are coming to terms with what we expect to be low [commodity] prices for at least another two years,\" Peter Archbold, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said.\nHowever, Mr Archbold said BHP is among a group of well-rated mining companies that should continue to be able to raise money in bond markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:01:00.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
