( TAEC )*, a committed leader that collaborates with technology companies to create breakthrough designs, has unveiled its newest CMOS image sensor for automotive cameras. The CSA02M00PB is the industry's first(1) 2-megapixel (MP) CMOS image sensor to be equipped with LED flicker (pulsed LED) mitigation circuit(2) to minimize image flicker caused by LED light sources. When recording LED traffic lights and signs with conventional CMOS image sensors, the output image often flickers, hindering sensing accuracy. Toshiba designed the CSA02M00PB to curtail this flickering and deliver clearer images for faster, more accurate image sensing. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/277062 \nThe new sensor integrates Toshiba's next-generation High Dynamic Range (HDR)(3) system and backside illumination (BSI) process, which together enable recording of high-precision images. The HDR system uses Toshiba's single-frame method to achieve clear images free of the degraded resolution and blown-out highlights typical of high contrast-light conditions. The BSI process, first(1) brought to 2MP automotive image sensors by Toshiba, makes it possible to shoot brighter pictures with higher image quality in low light conditions. \nAlso of key value is the sensor's ability to meet the requirements of Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL), a risk classification scheme defined by ISO 26262 (the Functional Safety for Road Vehicles standard intended to protect life), and support failure detection, report flagging and control of vehicles. It is also compliant with AEC-Q100(4 )(Grade 2) and is suited for both ADAS front-end sensing cameras and the latest viewing applications, such as e-Mirror(5) applications and camera monitor systems. \n\"With concerns for road safety continuing to escalate, ADAS technology is growing rapidly, and will be further spurred by future advances in driverless cars,\" said Andrew Burt, vice president of the Image Sensor Business Unit, System LSI Group at TAEC. \"Based on our internal estimates, Toshiba foresees three-fold growth in the automotive CMOS image sensor market by 2020. We look forward to collaborating with leaders in the automotive industry to continue developing CMOS image sensor business to fully meet the expanding requirements of this market.\" \nThe CSA02M00PB features 3-micrometer BSI pixel size and an optical size of 1/2.7 inch. Image output ranges from 45 to 60 frames per second (fps), depending on the HDR exposure condition. Housed in 9x9 mm PBGA package, the sensor features full-HD output resolution of 1928(H) x 1084(V) and dynamic range of 120dB (by Toshiba calculation) with HDR. The MIPI CSI-2 serial interface facilitates the sensor's integration into end products. \nAvailability \nSamples of the CSA02M00PB CMOS image sensor will begin shipping in March 2016. \nNote: For further insights on the image sensor market, please follow the TAEC blog \" Eye on Sensors .\" 1. Industry's first as 2MP CMOS image sensor with LED flicker mitigation circuit. (Per Toshiba survey as of October 1, 2015.) 2. A patented circuit designed to reduce the LED flicker defined in Europe's EN12966 (LED light driven at a frequency of f>90Hz). 3. Toshiba's third-generation HDR that delivers a wider dynamic range than its predecessor, eliminating or suppressing resolution degradation and false color by enabling multiple exposures in one line of the image frame. 4. AEC-Q100 refers to the stress test qualification for ICs established by the U.S.-based Automotive Electronics Council, which sets qualification standards for all electronics components supplied to the automotive industry. 5. Mirror function that uses electronic components such as image sensors instead of conventional mirrors. \n*About TAEC \nThrough proven commitment, lasting relationships and advanced, reliable electronic components, Toshiba enables its customers to create market-leading designs.
