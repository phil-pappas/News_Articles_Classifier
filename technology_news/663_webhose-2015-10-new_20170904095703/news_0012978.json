Bright House Networks' home phone customers will not be charged for any calls to land lines or cell phone numbers in Mexico. \nCustomers who are making calls to Mexico during the program timeframe will be issued a credit on their account for any direct dial calls made to Mexico , with no need to do anything else. Credits for all calls made during the program time period will appear on customer accounts in December. Calls to operators or directory assistance are not direct dial calls, so these will be charged at the usual rate. \nAbout Bright House Networks Bright House Networks is the sixth largest owner and operator of cable systems in the U.S. and the second largest in Florida , with technologically advanced systems located in five states including Florida , Alabama , Indiana , Michigan and California and two of the top 20 DMAs.
