Implant Sciences will have its QS-B220 Desktop Explosives and Drugs Trace Detector available for demonstrations in booth 23 and is a bronze sponsor for the event. \nThe AVSEC World Conference is an annual event organized by ACI, in partnership with ICAO and IATA. AVSEC World 2015, through interactive workshops, panels and expert presentations and with more than 600 delegates, representing the entire industry of security representatives, seeks to facilitate the exchange of ideas and operational experiences, the learning of practical new skills, and putting together the framework to create the future of aviation security. \n\"Implant Sciences' QS-B220 was truly a disruptive technology in the trace detection industry. With our next-generation non-rad design and patented inCal(TM) automatic internal calibration, we set out to bring new functionality and advancements to users in an industry which had not seen significant innovation in approximately 20 years,\" stated Dr. Bill McGann, Implant Sciences' CEO. \"We continue to innovate, pioneering the first-of-its-kind networking solution for our ETDs. We look to conferences such as AVSEC World to talk to customers and check the pulse of the industry so we can continue to develop cutting-edge solutions to meet customers' requirements.\" \n\"Implant Sciences prides itself on its responsiveness to customer needs. Our approach is to develop products that will solve customer pain points and give them the functionality to make their jobs easier while providing them with the highest level of security possible,\" added Dr. Darryl Jones, Implant Sciences' Executive Vice President. \"We are able to solicit a lot of this valuable Voice of the Customer (VOC) feedback at shows such as AVSEC World. We look forward to our attendance at events such as this and to working with our European partners as they expand the use of ETD to meet the EU aviation requirements.\" \n\"We are excited about showcasing Implant Sciences' QS-B220 at AVSEC this year,\" stated Bob Liscouski, President of Implant Sciences. \"Fiscal year 2015 represented a very good year for us based on our sales to ECAC countries. Sales for our first quarter ended September 30 are strong and on track with our earnings call last month and we believe that we are poised for a successful fiscal 2016.\" \nAbout the QS-B220 Desktop Explosives Trace Detector \nThe QS-B220 uses Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) to rapidly detect and identify trace amounts of a wide variety of military, commercial, and homemade explosives.
