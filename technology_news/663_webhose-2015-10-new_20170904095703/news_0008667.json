The method produces inhibitors specific to a particular protein. \n\"Cancer treatment is at the stage where the aim is to get more specific with treating different cancers so there are fewer side effects of chemotherapy,\" says Professor McColl. \n\"Scientists working in this area are searching for precise molecular targets to inhibit or at least control disease like cancer and multiple sclerosis without harm to other parts of the body. \n\"The next stage of this research will be to use molecular modelling to work out exactly where these molecules are binding to the receptors and how they are disrupting their function so they can be further modified for even greater specificity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:48:27.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
