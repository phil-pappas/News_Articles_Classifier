(AP) â€” Dr. Arnold Klein , dermatologist to the late Michael Jackson and other Hollywood celebrities, has died in Palm Springs, California.\nThe Riverside County sheriff-coroner's office says the 70-year-old Klein died Thursday evening at Eisenhower Medical Center .\nThe coroner's brief press release does not state the cause of death but does not list any investigation. Messages seeking comment were left at Klein's office.\nHis patients included Elizabeth Taylor , Dolly Parton , Carrie Fisher and others. His medical specialty was the use of injectable drugs such as Botox and Restylane to ease wrinkles and sagging skin.\nKlein treated Jackson for more than 25 years before the pop star's drug-related death in 2009. Federal drug agents investigating the singer's prescriptions ultimately cleared Klein. Another doctor, Conrad Murray , was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:37:18.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
