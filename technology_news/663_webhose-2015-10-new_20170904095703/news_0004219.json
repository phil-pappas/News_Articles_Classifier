That’s something that we’ve made clear in the past and was reiterated yesterday in the bilateral meeting,” White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz told mediapersons at his daily news conference on Friday. Officials said Pakistan only targeted terrorist groups that attacked the Pakistan state. Obama met Sharif at the Oval Office on Thursday about 90 minutes. “Obama underscored that the US is committed to a broad, sustainable, and enduring partnership with Pakistan that delivers progress for the Pakistani people and reinforces Pakistan’s democracy and civil society,” he said. “Specifically on terrorism President Obama and Prime Minister Sharif both noted that our two countries are threatened by terrorist groups, and that the Pakistani people have suffered greatly,” he added. “These leaders committed to continue bilateral counterterrorism cooperation. Obama highlighted the importance of Pakistan undertaking effective action against terrorists that seek to undermine peaceful dialogue and destabilise the region,” Schultz said. Sharif left for Pakistan yesterday after concluding his four-days of official trip to the US. The State Department described his visit as a successful. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:02:59.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
