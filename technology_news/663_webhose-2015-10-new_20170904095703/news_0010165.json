It's been just a week since Apple made the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus officially available in India, and the company has announced the launch date of the Apple Watch. \nThe company first unveiled the Watch smart timepiece back in March at an event held in San Francisco. Since then Apple fans have eagerly been waiting for the company to launch the wearable in India. Now, about 10 months later, the Cupertino giant has updated its website and put up the Watch and its launch date as November 6. \nApple Watch is the company's first smart wearable time piece which is loaded with software features that work in cohesion with other Apple devices for a connected user interface. The Watch is two sizes, including the 38mm and 42mm and comes in a variety of bands and combinations for the Watch. The price of the Watch starts from $349, going up to $10,000 for the Watch Edition, which is the most premium model. As for their India prices, nothing can be assured, however going by their US prices we expect the base model to be priced around Rs 25,000. A report earlier this year hinted the base variant's price to over Rs 30,000. \nWhile we await for the Apple Watch to get launched to know about its exact pricing and other details, keep checking this space for more information.
