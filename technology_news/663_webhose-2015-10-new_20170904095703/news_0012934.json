It uses the Optus 4G Plus network.\nAmaysim CEO Julian Ogrin cited research conducted by Galaxy showing only 39 per cent of Australians believe they’re currently on the perfect mobile phone plan for their needs.\n“These statistics highlight the need for mobile plans like Amaysim’s unlimited suite of ‘one decision’ mobile plans which cater to occasional, light, medium and heavy data users,” Mr Ogrin said.\n“The only decision you really need to think about is how much data you need.”\nComparable plans to Amaysim’s 1GB offering are Vaya’s ‘Unlimited 25’ plan, which offers 1.5GB of data a month and unlimited calls and texts, and Spintel’s ‘L Base’ plan which offers 1GB of data and unlimited calls and 200 texts for $27 per month.\nMr Ogrin said Amaysim was also adding 100 minutes of international calls to 32 selected countries to its unlimited 5GB and 7GB plans, while international SMS and MMS will be added to the telco’s 5GB and 7GB plans in coming months.\n“We’re just getting started on our drive to bring simplicity to prices, plans and mobile account management as we barrel down the path of becoming the no worries telco in Aussie pockets,” Mr Ogrin said.\n“Our aim is to bring simplicity and savings that encourage switching for people on a stretched budget as well as those with wallets to match their data appetites, so watch this space for more news.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:43:52.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
