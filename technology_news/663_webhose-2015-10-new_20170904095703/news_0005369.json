Scientists can't tell yet whether Kepler-452b has oceans and continents like Earth. Hide Caption 1 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth Kepler-452b is about 60% larger than Earth, left. It's about 1,400 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Hide Caption 2 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth A team of astronomers announced April 17, 2014, that they discovered the first Earth-size planet orbiting a star in the \"habitable zone\": the distance from a star where liquid water might pool on the surface. That doesn't mean this planet has life on it, says Thomas Barclay, a scientist at the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute at Ames and a co-author of a paper on the planet, called Kepler-186f. He says the planet can be thought of as an \"Earth-cousin rather than an Earth-twin. It has many properties that resemble Earth.\" The planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. It's about 500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The picture above is an artist's concept of what it might look like. Hide Caption 3 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth Scientists announced in June 2013 that three planets orbiting star Gliese 667C could be habitable. This is an artist's impression of the view from one of those planets, looking toward the parent star in the center. The other two stars in the system are visible to the right. Hide Caption 4 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This diagram shows the planets thought to orbit star Gliese 667C, where c, f and e appear to be capable of having liquid water. The relative sizes, but not relative separations, are shown to scale. Hide Caption 5 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This diagram lines up planets recently discovered by Kepler in terms of their sizes, compared with Earth. Kepler-22b was announced in December 2011; the three Super-Earths were announced April 18, 2013. All of them could potentially host life, but we do not know anything definitive about their compositions or atmosphere. Hide Caption 6 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This illustration depicts Kepler-62e, a planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun. It is about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Hide Caption 7 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This illustration depicts Kepler-62f, a planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, in the same system as Kepler-62e. Hide Caption 8 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This diagram compares the planets of our own inner solar system to Kepler-62, a five-planet system about 1,200 light-years from Earth. Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f are thought capable of hosting life. Hide Caption 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth The planet Kepler-69c is about 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Hide Caption 10 of 12 12 photos: Where life might live beyond Earth This diagram compares the planets of our own inner solar system to Kepler-69, which hosts a planet Kepler-69c that appears to be capable of hosting life, in addition to planet Kepler-69b.
