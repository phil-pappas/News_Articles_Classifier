We have seen bigger stands and more presence in the last few years. All the vendors are taking the region as an opportunity and it is important to catch the wave at an early stage. As far as Cisco is concern, we are trying to promote the message that it is time to provide a collaborative solution and be the leader in security solutions,” Hatto explains. \nHe highlights that all verticals are interested in security but in the Middle East, specifically, the financial and the energy sector are the main ones.
