Twitter \nLike me, are you on older device and looking in envy at the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus’ 3D Touch? Well, there’s a solution for you if your device is jailbroken. \nAn app called ‘Forcy’ is available in the Cydia store for free under the BigBoss repo. It offers users the ability to jump to quick actions for many apps via long pressing or swiping up on the app’s icon. After you do that, you get a menu very similar to when you get on the latest Apple devices. For example in Safari, there are options to: Open a new tab; Open a new private tab; Show your reading lists; and Show your bookmarks. \nThe only drawback with Forcy is that you don’t get the haptic feedback after holding down on an icon but otherwise it’s pretty much like the real thing. \nIf you want to jailbreak your device and give the app a try, the latest jailbreak that’s just been released is the Pangu jailbreak for iOS 9 – 9.0.2. For newbies to the jailbreaking scene, be aware of the issues of doing it such as the loss of your warranty and the security risks.
