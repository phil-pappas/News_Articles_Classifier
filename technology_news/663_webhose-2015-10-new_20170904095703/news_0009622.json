With the expansion of their service offerings to include Managed I.T. Services and Cloud Infrastructure, Bit-Wizards has seen an influx of new business from the local community. These local businesses want to take advantage of cloud technology and the cost benefits it affords them. With a new base of business right in their hometown, Vince Mayfield (CEO) and Louis Erickson (COO) have forged a partnership in the form of an annual sponsorship with the Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber. The Chamber is a powerful organization that has a hugely positive impact on the local business community. If there is an event or opportunity to get involved in the community, you can bet the Chamber has a hand in it.\nTed Corcoran, President of the Fort Walton Beach Chamber says, “It has been a real pleasure to watch Bit-Wizards grow over the last few years – and almost dizzying to see the awards that the company has brought back to their own home town of Fort Walton Beach. They’ve received great recognition from Inc. Magazine, (Five-Time Inc. 5000 Honoree); Governor Rick Scott (Governor’s Business Ambassador Awards); multiple Addys; and have been recognized on Florida Trend magazine’s “Best Companies to Work For” list since 2010. Wow! We are thrilled that they have decided to become an Annual Sponsor of the Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, and we look forward to spreading the word about how much Bit-Wizards brings to our business community.”\nBit-Wizards hopes to contribute to the positive impact the Chamber has already established by helping to educate local businesses and the community about the changes in technology and how it impacts them.
