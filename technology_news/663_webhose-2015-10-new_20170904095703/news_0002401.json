Speaking at a seminar at the Journalists' Syndicate, Sabry al-Alfy said his invention is the first of its kind and the cheapest in the world in the field of solar energy generation. He hopes his invention will secure numerous job opportunities and constitute a breakthrough in Egypt’s energy industry. Rabie Mady, an official from the military-run Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) who attended the seminar, lauded the invention, adding that Alfy’s project, initially a blueprint of a one-meter-wide lens against an acrylic pane, was studied by the AOI, which replaced the acrylic with aluminium.
