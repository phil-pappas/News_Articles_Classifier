One batch of around 500 Skippa recorders was shipped in late September, while around 1000 are yet to leave the warehouse despite customers paying for the devices upfront.\nPre-order customers still awaiting delivery instead received an email from the administrators on Wednesday afternoon. The email states that it is \"highly likely\" that IceTV will cease trading if a buyer for the company isn't found \"within the immediate future\". Customers left empty-handed were instructed to register as creditors, with a meeting scheduled for October 16.\nStrained relations with the Skippa's manufacturer left IceTV with no choice but to call in administrators, says IceTV co-founder and executive chairman Colin O'Brien.\nAdvertisement ​\"The company providing the Skippa box ceased trading at midnight on September 30. It tried to put a tentative distribution arrangement in place which was unacceptable and impossible for IceTV to abide by,\" O'Brien says.\n\"As the director I reached an impasse with our supplier where I had no choice but to put the company into administration. Everyone at IceTV is gutted, the staff have agreed to work for another week to try to find a solution.\"\nThe Skippa's manufacturer ceased its Australian operations last week and changed its negotiated payment terms with IceTV, says TPH Insolvency's Amanda Lott – appointed voluntary administrator for IceTV.\n\"There is an issue with the supplier where the supplier ceased its Australian operations last week and it has implemented payment terms on IceTV to which the company can not comply, and which were not originally negotiated,\" Lott says.\nOther sources indicate that unshipped Skippa units are not scheduled for delivery and remain in manufacturing partner UEC's Sydney warehouse. IceTV originally negotiated progress payments with the manufacturer, but after ongoing manufacturing delays the manufacturer is now demanding payment in full for the unshipped Skippa recorders to be released.\nThe IceTV Electronic Program Guide will continue to function for at least the next week, with administrators negotiating with hosting partner Amazon Web Services to keep the service online. Other arrangements may be put in place to save IceTV, instead of finding a buyer for the company.\nThe Skippa is the first hardware from IceTV, which was founded 10 years ago to provide a hand-curated Australian Electronic Program Guide. The EPG allows Personal Video Recorders to schedule television recordings, along with computers running Windows Media Centre, MythTV or Elgato TV. The IceTV guide aims to be more reliable than the haphazard data embedded in the broadcast signal.\nIn 2009 the company won a three-year legal battle with the Nine Network over the rights to the television broadcast schedule, although the timing of the case scuttled IceTV's plans for a $4 million public float on the stock exchange.\nSupported by a loyal customer base paying $99 per year for an EPG subscription, IceTV turned its fortunes around and gradually expanded the guide's features – allowing users to schedule recordings via a desktop browser or smartphone app. The guide is compatible with a range of PVRs from the likes of Topfield, Beyonwiz, Humax and Strong, although for several years IceTV has harboured dreams of building its own recorder.\nPlans for the Skippa recorder were announced in early April and IceTV began accepting pre-order payments at the end of the month at a discounted price of $399, which includes a lifetime IceTV subscription. Shipments were planned for July. A new pricing structure was unveiled in July, asking an extra $100 to cover the Skippa's automated ad-skipping features or else charging a $49 per year subscription.\nManufacturing delays and other issues saw delivery dates pushed back several times, with early review units finally available mid-August. Software updates for the Skippa – fixing bugs and adding new features – have continued to flow from IceTV, with the latest issued this week.\nFor now the company remains in the hands of administrators, with the IceTV guide continuing to function for customers with a Skippa or other IceTV-compatible recorder. The Skippa can not extract the television guide from the broadcast signal and is completely dependent on the IceTV guide, rendering it useless should the company fold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:51:39.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
