The Islamic republic has always denied seeking a bomb. \nThe IAEA faces a December 15 reporting deadline to resolve what it has termed \"ambiguities\" over Iran's past nuclear activities. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:07:30.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
