Supplied Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra's latest internet television service that will go up against the likes of Google and Apple will only be sold to the company's own broadband customers, in a move that is likely to limit the product's adoption.\nAustralia's biggest phone and internet provider on Thursday said that Telstra TV would start selling from October 27 onwards. It is essentially a rebadged version of the Roku 2 device and plugs into televisions to stream media apps like Netflix and Stan, which have become hugely popular this year.\nTelstra must find a way to deliver the popular services that customers desire without cannibalising profits from Foxtel, which it owns in a joint venture with News Corporation. The affect of rivals like Netflix contributed to the pay TV provider's profit sliding 8 per cent in 2014-15 .\nCustomers will be charged $109 upfront for the Telstra TV device – 12 per cent higher than the $US70 ($95) that Americans are charged for the unit. Any content streamed over the internet and through the device will count towards the download limit of Telstra customers with the exception of the BigPond Movies and Presto services.\nRoku Pay TV vice president Andrew Ferrone flew to Australia for the launch and told Fairfax Media that the future of television was internet streaming, rather than broadcast TV.\n\"We believe streaming is the future and we've seen the evidence of that through the incredible growth of our platform,\" he said. \"We streamed 3 billion hours [of content] through the Roku platform in 2014, up from 1.7 billion hours in 2013.\nSignificant streaming use \"The average Roku user streams about 60 hours per month, which is pretty significant.\"\n But Telstra media and marketing group managing director, Joe Pollard, said there would always be a place for broadcast services like Foxtel. She said the new service would appeal to customers wanting a simple platform to watch services like Netflix on top of their existing Foxtel subscription.\n\"I think they're really different propositions with vastly different cost bases,\" she said. \"We wanted to have a solution that allowed customers to have great video on a great network.\n\"[Presto, Stan and Netflix] all have their points of difference … but one of the great things about Telstra TV is we don't have to decide – we just create a great experience and the consumer decides.\"\nMs Pollard said the Roku partnership fed into Telstra's grander strategy because the telco giant believed video services would be at the centre of broadband demand in the future. It has also bought Ooyala, which is a popular video platform used by media outlets to insert and track ads.\nCredit Suisse analyst Fraser McLeish said based on the publicly available information on Telstra TV the product would be a competitor to the likes of Apple TV and Google's Chromecast but was unlikely to have a major affect on its bottom line.\n\"It's a nice add-on to add some content to the bundle but it's not that different from Chromecast or Apple TV so we don't see it as a game-changer,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/telstra-launches-roku-to-take-on-apple-and-google-20150727-giltvh.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:20:21.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
