Tablets (26 percent) will also be popular this year, followed by portable Bluetooth speakers (25 percent), smartphones (24 percent) and notebook/laptop computers (25 percent). \nMore than half of shoppers (58 percent) plan to purchase a tech accessory this season. Videogame accessories will see one of the largest increases in popularity with one in five shoppers (23 percent) likely to purchase - a seven percentage point increase from last year (16 percent). Three new accessories categories tracked this year include digital toys or videogame figurines (21 percent), selfie-sticks (nine percent), and action camera accessories (seven percent). \nMore and more consumers - 33 percent - will opt to purchase a new, emerging technology product this holiday season – the category’s highest total ever. The most popular 2015 holiday gifts among emerging tech will be smart home devices (15 percent), wearable fitness activity trackers (12 percent), smart watches (12 percent), action cameras (12 percent) and drones (seven percent). \n“Whether Americans want the latest upgrade of their favorite tech device or to try out the newest emerging tech on the market, it’s apparent that consumer enthusiasm for tech will be substantial this holiday shopping season,” says DuBravac. \nEarlier and Earlier Holiday Shopping \nCEA’s study says more consumers plan to shop later in the season, consistent with a belief that the best deals are at or after Black Friday. More consumers (71 percent, a 10 percentage point increase from 2014) plan to wait until November or December to start their holiday shopping, while 24 percent (down from 31 percent in 2014) indicate they anticipate shopping in October or earlier. Women (31 percent) are much more likely than men (17 percent) to start their holiday shopping in October or earlier. \nEvolving Holiday Retail Channels \nCEA’s study also found more than half (55 percent) of consumers are likely to shop for tech online this year. However, traditional retail channels remain essential sources of tech gift purchases, with 77 percent of consumers - on par with the past four years - likely to purchase from a brick-and-mortar location. Households with children are significantly more likely to shop online (69 percent) than households without children (56 percent). \nMobile not just for Millennials \nThe mobile channel continues to grow in importance each holiday season. More than two-thirds of consumers who plan to spend money on consumer tech, likely using a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, to help them shop. \nMobile is now starting to connect with audiences of all different ages. In 2014, 69 percent of 35-54-year-olds planned to use a mobile device to help with holiday purchases. This year, that number rose to 74 percent, approaching the 79 percent of millennials who plan to use a smartphone to shop. \n“Holiday shopping patterns are evolving significantly,” said Steve Koenig, senior director, market research, CEA. “More consumers outside of the traditional early adopter and millennial generation are using tech to buy tech. They’re relying heavily on online shopping and mobile devices in an effort to have a more informed and convenient holiday shopping experience.” \nCEA Holiday Research \nTo keep up to date with all of CEA’s holiday research throughout the season, visit CE.org/holiday .
