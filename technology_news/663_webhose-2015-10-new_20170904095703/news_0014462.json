Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Australia must do more to unlock the wealth accumulated by nation's most successful people who have found success in traditional industries by convincing them to become angel investors in cutting-edge start-up companies, says Assistant Innovation Minister Wyatt Roy.\nThe Turnbull government is scrutinising the tax regimes of some of the world's innovation hotspots, including Israel, UK, Singapore and NZ, as it builds towards its innovation policy statement due before Christmas.\nMr Roy will travel to Israel next month as part of the push to convert some of the wealth built from Australia's traditional strengths of mining and agriculture into innovation and technology.\n\"I think we have an enormous opportunity in this country when we have people who have already found success in our traditional areas of mining, of agriculture, of financial services to unlock some of that wealth,\" Mr Roy told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"To have that [wealth] investing in Australian innovation is a big part of how we can drive our entrepreneurial and innovative ecosystem in this country.\"\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Treasurer Scott Morrison and Innovation Minister Christopher Pyne are weighing up a plan by venture capital investor-turned-Liberal MP David Coleman to introduce capital gains tax breaks for investors in start-ups younger than two years and earning less than a $1 million a year.\nInnovation needs invigoration Australia's current tax break regime for venture capital investors in start-up companies has registered only 24 funds on its books after almost seven years of operation, prompting calls for the Turnbull government to make changes to bring about a mainstream innovation culture.\n According to AusIndustry, the Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership scheme, which was introduced in 2007, has only 24 venture capital funds registered for access to capital gains tax exemptions.\nCurrently, fund managers must raise at least $10 million and not more than $100 million in new venture capital for investing in Australian businesses to be able to register as an early-stage venture capital partnership. Generally, no investor may hold more than 30 per cent of the fund which means that in practice no investor who invests in an early-stage partnership can control it.\nThere is also lengthy red tape involved including an application to the board of Innovation Australia, which considers each proposal on a case-by-case basis.\nFocus on property, not start-ups David Coleman, a former chairman of PBL Media and in charge of the corporate giant's digital investments, said high-net worth individuals had more tax incentive to invest in multiple investment properties but no incentive to invest in a start-up.\n\"What I'm proposing is that we substantially broaden the capital gains tax exemption so that it applies to all investors in start-ups whether they are individuals, corporations or funds,\" Mr Coleman said.\n\"To receive the CGT benefit investors would not have to be a part of any particular investment vehicle â€“ they would just have to show that they had invested in a complying start-up.\"\nWhile venture capitalists, such as Mark Carnegie who has two funds taking part in the seven-year-old scheme, say start-up investors can already get tax-free capital gains under the existing arrangement, the number of funds registering with Department of Industry for the tax breaks are significantly below government expectations.\nRestrictive rules Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan, in his previous role as chair of the Board of Taxation, recommended a relaxation of some of the venture capital tax rules because they were too restrictive to attract domestic start-up investors.\nMr Roy said while the existing federal government scheme was good for sophisticated investors, it didn't mean the Turnbull government should ignore other options to encourage more private investors, ranging from \"mum and dad\" investors to corporations, to consider investing in innovation.\n\"I think what is there is a good thing, but that doesn't mean we can't do more, it doesn't mean we can't focus on different ends of the spectrum,\" Mr Roy said.\n\"I think generally what I think it very important is we are looking for global best practise and the reality is we are in a global race to put ourselves at the front of the innovation pack and that includes our tax arrangements.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:23:03.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
