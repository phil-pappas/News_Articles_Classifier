The SKECHERS concept shop will feature four video screens to present product information and lifestyle news, including celebrity endorsements of SKECHERS shoes. \nGrand opening celebrations, featuring giveaways and shoe experts from Meijer and SKECHERS, will be held at each of the new concept shops from noon to 3 p.m.: Sept. 26 at the Greenwood, Ind.
