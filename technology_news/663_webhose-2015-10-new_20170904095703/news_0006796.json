This year, only January and April did not surpass records going back to 1880.\nClimate scientists blame man-made global warming and El Nino.\nThis is has been the hottest first nine months of any year. NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden said it would take a highly unlikely cold stretch the rest of the year for 2015 not to pass 2014 as the hottest on record.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
