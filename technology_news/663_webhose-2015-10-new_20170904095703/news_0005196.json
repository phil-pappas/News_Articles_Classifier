Link Labs produces both public network equipment supporting the LoRaWAN standard being promoted by the LoRa Alliance, as well as the private network Symphony Link based products. Link Labs’ Symphony Link line features a low and high power end node module, repeaters to fill in coverage gaps, an 8-channel gateway (indoor and outdoor versions), a 24-channel public network base station. To help OEM customer assess Symphony Link they also make a development kit that includes a handheld network tester to allow for easy range testing for the application or network deployment. The Symphony Link platform includes a cloud-based server called Conductor for managing customer data and a growing library of APIs for end application development\nThe breadth of this product line allows developers to quickly bring long-range communications to their devices and network operators to cost effectively cover cities and regions with a range of gateways, base stations and repeater technologies. These devices are capable of licensed or unlicensed deployment from 137 -1020 MHz.\nThe company’s primary markets are building management, smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, industrial sensing and control, government and municipal applications, asset tracking, and the growing connectivity requirements of the Internet of Things. Link Labs’ hardware and software platforms were designed for these new networks. They allow wireless communication over longer range than traditional technologies like WiFi or ZigBee and enable batteries to last seven to 10 years in many applications.\n“We are excited to announce this distribution agreement with Arrow. They have the global reach and exceptional IoT marketing capabilities to make it easier for new customers around the world to learn about and get access to our products” said VP of Business Development and Marketing Bryan M. Eagle III.\n“Arrow Electronics is pleased to add Link Labs to our growing line card of edge-to-enterprise IoT offerings,” said Aiden Mitchell, vice president of semiconductor marketing at Arrow. “Link Labs’ complete line of FCC-certified transceiver modules, repeaters, gateways and base stations will enable our customers to integrate long-range communications into their devices.”\nAbout Link Labs\nLink Labs is a leading innovator in low-power, wide-area network technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT).
