The available power and voltage ranges typically cover large battery packs used for EV and HEV automotive applications. The 5VP Series of loads incorporates a suite of embedded battery discharge functions. Data on battery performance can be collected during these test discharge protocols.\nThese fully featured loads are targeted at the development and test of battery solutions for advanced electric drive trains. The new 5VP Series of loads incorporate many of the test capabilities found in modern electronic loads and expands upon this by offering a suite of built in battery discharge functions. These discharge functions can be customized by the development engineer as needed and executed without the need for computer programming. Data on battery performance can be collected during these test discharge protocols. If needed, Adaptive Power Systems DC power supplies can be added to a test setup to include battery charging as well.\nSporting an a logical front panel layout with large, large easy to read displays and full numeric keypad for entry, the Adaptive Power Systems 5VP Series loads offer intuitive front panel operation for both lab environments or production floor requirements. For automated production test system applications, control interfaces like USB or LAN are supported.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/9299_image_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:01:25.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
