Reuters/Pichi Chuang \nStruggling chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc said on Thursday it would form a joint venture with China's Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd (NFME) for assembly and testing operations. \nShares of the company, which reported its fifth straight quarterly fall in revenue as demand declines for its mainstay PC processors, rose slightly in after-market trading. \nNFME will purchase an 85 percent share of AMD's Penang, Malaysia and Suzhou, China facilities, and AMD will receive about $371 million as part of the deal. \nThere are no planned workforce reductions at the facilities, AMD said. \nAMD earlier this month said it would cut about 500 jobs, or 5 percent of its global workforce, to rein in costs. \nThe company posted a net loss of $197 million, or 25 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 26, compared with net income of $17 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. \nOn an adjusted basis, AMD posted a loss of 17 cents per share. \nRevenue fell 25.8 percent to $1.06 billion. \nAnalysts on average had expected a loss of 12 cents per share and revenue of $995.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nAMD's shares closed up 1 percent at $1.97 on the Nasdaq. \n(Reporting by Sai Sachin R and Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
