Designed to the highest industry standards of quality and performance, ITW Dynatec hot melt systems are simple to operate, highly customizable, and represent a \"best-total-value\" for packaging industry original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and brand owners.\nITW Dynatec's latest generation Dynamini hot melt ASU now features a four-hose configuration, allowing more operational capabilities, making it ideally suited for larger sized applications, as well as higher volume multi-point applications. Built for flexibility, the new Dynamini can be configured with Nickel or Platinum (PT100) temperature sensors, and is designed to integrate with other industry standard components. It features ITW Dynatec's patented \"Melt-on-Demand\" technology, which virtually eliminates charring and significantly reduces energy consumption. Designed for optimal performance, reliability and ease-of-operation, this latest variation on a proven performer offers outstanding value in a compact ASU.\n\"The demand for pre-packaged, ready-to-eat food products and beverages is growing in step with Japan's dense, and aging population,\" commented Scott Holzwarth, Global Business Unit Manager - Packaging for ITW Dynatec. \"Packaging suppliers who are well positioned to offer solutions and services that address these needs will find great opportunity. The features we recently added to our Dynamini unit, and other enhancements we're making throughout our hot melt portfolio, are all aimed at helping packaging OEMs meet growing demand.\"\nWith now more than a decade of servicing OEMs and brands based in, or having a presence in, the Japanese market, ITW Dynatec has established a regional reputation for high-performance hot melt solutions. The company maintains a Tokyo office, from which it provides regional services and technical support. Known for responsive service, technical knowledge, and a keen awareness of regional culture and language, the ITW Dynatec field service team readily deploys to facilities throughout Japan, providing hands-on, expert hot melt technical guidance and support.\nITW Dynatec hot melt solutions featured at Japan Pack 2015 include:\nDynamini Adhesive Supply Unit (ASU)\nThe Dynamini ASU, now available in a four-hose or two-hose configuration, is designed for optimal performance, reliability and simplified daily operation, and represents exceptional value in a small hot melt unit. It features ITW Dynatec's patented Melt-on-Demand hopper, which virtually eliminates adhesive degradation, and comes with a seven-year standard warranty. The Dynamini system provides accurate, proportionate temperature control for the hopper, hoses and applicators, and can be configured with Nickel or Platinum (PT100) temperature sensors. Sequential start-up delays may be programmed for turn-on of the hoses and heads. The temperature control can interlock the parent machine so that production automatically begins when adhesive has reached the programmed application temperature.\nMelt-on-Demand Technology\nITW Dynatec's patented Melt-on-Demand hopper works in conjunction with the Dynamini ASU. With Melt-on-Demand, not all adhesive in the hopper needs to be melted for the unit function. This allows the system to be operation-ready much faster than conventional equipment. Exclusive Dynamini technology virtually eliminates the problem of charring. Because the heat is applied to the bottom of the hopper, the glue at the bottom is used first and char build-up on the sidewalls of the hopper is also minimized. Equipment maintenance is further reduced because the hopper needs to be drained to purge char with less frequency.\nBF MicroBead Applicator\nOne of ITW Dynatec's top-performing and most widely used applicators, the BF MicroBead applicator is available with single-port or dual-port pivoting modules, providing flexibility for set-up and reduction in the number of applicators required. The compact design is both easy to install and maintain, while the rapid cycle speeds make it an ideal choice for high-speed applications. An air open/air close design provides highly precise and uniform adhesive patterns and bead placement.\nITW Dynatec's comprehensive range of hot melt equipment and accessories accommodate a broad range of packaging requirements for consumer package goods, including food and beverage, health and beauty, pharmaceutical, household, pet and industrial products. All of its melting and applicator units can be configured to work with other industry-standard hot melt controllers, feeders and hoses.\nABOUT ITW DYNATEC\nITW Dynatec, a division of Illinois Tool Works Inc.
