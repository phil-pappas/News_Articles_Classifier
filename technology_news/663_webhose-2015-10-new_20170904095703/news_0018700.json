Europe did not measure the hope it arouses and that it will long arouse in the face of distress,\" he says.\n\"Europe did not dispense enough help to countries who were welcoming in camps ever larger populations. So it's in an urgent fashion that it had to organise to be worthy of its asylum tradition,\" he adds.\nHollande says it will \"probably\" be 600 000 migrants and refugees who will arrive in Europe this year. But he also argues that \"it's in Turkey that refugees have to be welcomed as much as possible\", calling for closer co-operation with that country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T20:05:41.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
