Because it certainly feels more like a flagship instead. Unfortunately, that role has already been taken by Moto X Style , which we earlier had a look at. \nTo put things into perspective, Motorola has a different lineup for different categories. If you still remember, we have Moto E for the entry-level, Moto G for the mid-range, and we have Moto X for the high-end segment. It all boils down to specs and pricing. From that categorization, you can see where the Moto X Play will fall right? \nWith a body size of 148 x 75 x 10.9 mm (5.83 x 2.95 x 0.43 in) and weighing in at 169 g (5.96 oz), the Moto X Play is definitely not thin but falls under the lightweight category. What’s good is that you further customize the look and feel of the device with Moto Maker. Pick a soft-grip back and metal accents in your favorite colors or dress it up even more with a premium leather or real wood back. Want to engrave your own name at the back? Sure why not! \nSporting a 5.5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen, it displays 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~403 ppi pixel density that makes viewing a pleasure. Browsing the web, social media and watching the occasional video should be enjoyable. In terms of protection, you can call upon the Gorilla Glass 3 in your time of need. Want more? How about the ability to withstand water with its IP52 certification? Spills, splashes or rain, will no longer ruin your day. \nPerformance-wise, you can expect great things with its Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset paired with an Octa-core processor that is made up of Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 405 graphics and 2GB RAM. The only thing lacking is an additional 1GB RAM, but we will talk about it later on how Motorola will address this issue with the pure Android experience that it is having. - Advertisement - \nCamera-wise, the Moto X Play is sporting a very highly-rated 21MP-5MP camera setup. The 21 Megapixel primary camera has a whopping 5248 x 3936 pixels, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash and the standard geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama and auto-HDR. You will be able to capture fast-moving pics with its auto-focus and the pictures will look even more natural with the color-adjusting flash. \nBy taking lots of photos and videos, the next thing we should be talking about is its storage. This is where you got to choose to go for either for 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. The price difference isn’t that big though. If you need additional space, you can expand further with its microSD slot which can take in up to a maximum of 128GB. \nA very good plus point for the Moto X Play is its huge battery, even larger than the Moto X Style. It comes with a non-removable 3630 mAh battery that can easily power up the device for at least a day or two in between charging without any issues. There’s also the fast battery charging feature that is another plus point. \nThe best thing about the Moto X Play is that it brings you the best and purest Android experience, the way the developer meant it to behave. This means that you won’t be bogged down by unnecessary bloatware which normally the manufacturer will install for you. With Moto software, you can teach your device how to work best for you. And you will also fall in love with efficient simplicity of the latest Android Marshmallow 6.0 once it is available on the device. - Advertisement - \nWith Motorola Moto X Play, you can be assured of one of the finest close-to-flagship performance with pure Android experience riding on it. Large 5.5-inch screen, amazing 21 Megapixel primary camera, pretty cool hardware even though with just 2GB RAM and a huge battery makes for some serious combination that only a select few can offer. Now it is dilemma time for you on whether you should be getting the Moto X Play or the Moto X Style. To be frank, the price difference isn’t that great and the Moto X Style offers a whole lot more. For just $399, you can already get hold of the Moto X Style. \nThe Motorola Moto X Play is currently available for $309 for the 16GB variant and $359 for the 32GB variant. It is only available in Black and White. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:54:00.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
