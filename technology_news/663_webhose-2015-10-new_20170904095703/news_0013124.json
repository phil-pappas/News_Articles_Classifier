Under the SIA program, McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and Enterprise Security Manager customers can have data breach risk and other security metrics on a single platform. The Urgent Need for Risk Intelligence\nChief Information Security Officers (CISOs) urgently need to look beyond their “crown jewels” of known assets to find their total risk exposure. Over half of data breaches are due to employee error, and according to a recent iScan Data Breach Risk Brief, 87% of employee desktops and laptops have unprotected credit card data.\nWith iScan integration, McAfee customers gain visibility into the data breach risk on even enormous servers and the laptops of the most transient workers. iScan’s patented triple-threat detection uncovers unprotected data, such as credit card and social security numbers, vulnerabilities and access permissions. iScan answers:\n1. What sensitive data is at risk and where is it located?\n2. How will attackers get to the data?\n3. How much will it cost when breached?\nThe iScan integration with McAfee gives CISOs a single platform view of real-time data breach risk to:\nFinancially prioritize risk so security teams can remediate the costliest devices first Provide guidance to the Board in dollars, not in technical terms Engage non-IT business leaders by translating security into business outcomes\nCarl Banzhof, CEO, iScan Online, explained, “Even the most advanced perimeter protections do not guarantee a breach will not happen. CISOs need to address the underlying issues of unprotected data and vulnerabilities. The SIA partnership enables McAfee ePO and Enterprise Security Manager customers to gain visibility into device risk at a level not previously possible. CISOs can then prioritize remediation and engage the business on security initiatives.”\n“We are pleased to add iScan Online to the Intel Security Innovation Alliance,” said D.J. Long, Sr. Director, Head of the Security Innovation Alliance at Intel Security. “Our customers face growing challenges to secure their networks and maintain compliance, and are looking to integrate data breach risk intelligence with Intel Security solutions.”\niScan will be demonstrating data breach risk intelligence at Focus15.
