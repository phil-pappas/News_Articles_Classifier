Answer: They were both seriously disrupted by burst water mains, within 24 hours of each other. The Dulwich Hill disaster came first at about noon on Monday 28 September. The Caulfield catastrophe was more spectacular but local residents were at least spared having their homes inundated. Fortunately neither resulted in any casualties. At about 2:00 am on Tuesday 29 September a century-old water main burst under what The Age newspaper described as “busy Glen Eira Road, Caulfield”. Glen Eira Road, probably wasn’t busy at that hour, which was just as well, because the resulting sink-hole swallowed three of its lanes and delayed traffic well into Tuesday evening. To explain such a large hole from a mere burst pipe The Age turned to Mark Quigley, from the University of Melbourne's School of Earth Sciences. He explained that when a water main bursts it releases high-pressure water from the pipe that ‘mobilises’ soil and sand. \"So when you have what is referred to as a stiff cap, which could be a road or stronger stiffer soils, above where the water main has broken, the movement of sediment below basically creates voids which destabilises the cap,\" he told The Age. \"So basically you lose support for your road or your cap. So what you often see then is a circular-shaped collapse of the cap into the void space where the sediment has been washed away by the water main.\" Nobody drove into the hole and there were no reports of any water damage. That’s hadn’t been the case in Dulwich Hill in Sydney’s Inner West the day before. When the pipe burst in Old Canterbury Road — the main road through the suburb —it inundated a dozen homes and forced the evacuation of almost a dozen more. The ABC web site carried pictures of residents standing by their gates gazing out on what looked for all the world like a river. There were lounge rooms full of water and dogs paddling in parlours. “In some backyards the water rose to waist deep, with appliances and furniture floating around,” 9News reported. Many of Australia’s water mains are decades old and such incidents are not uncommon. According to The Age, the main that burst in Caulfield was a hundred years old.
