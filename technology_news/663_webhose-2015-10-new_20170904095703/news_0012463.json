Demonstrations have also been held in other cities around the world including Paris and Sao Paolo.\nLast month the mayor of Rio de Janeiro said he would ban the app in the city.\nThe court's decision is however separate from a consultation which London's transport authority launched last month, proposing tougher rules which could hit the San Francisco-based app, whose investors include Goldman Sachs and Google.\nUnder those plans, firms would have to provide a booking confirmation at least five minutes before a journey starts and allow cabs to be booked up to seven days in advance.\nThey could not show vehicles for immediate hire via an app and must specify the fare prior to the booking being accepted as well as a range of other proposed changes.\n(Reporting By Costas Pitas; editing by Stephen Addison)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-17T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:07:01.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
