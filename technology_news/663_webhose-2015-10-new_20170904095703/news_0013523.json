The cost of implementing this scheme would be completely disproportionate to any benefit it delivers,” Ross Wheeler, the owner of Albury Local internet, told The Australian.\n“In over 20 years we have never had that sort of request for information on our customers from a law enforcement agency. So the cost for implementing this stuff, for what will be a minuscule possibility, is completely disproportionate.”\nAlbury Local internet has been in operation for more than 20 years, servicing the southern NSW town’s internet needs.\nBut Mr Wheeler said if the scheme went ahead without proper government assistance, his business would be irrevocably damaged.\nAlbury Local internet submitted its so-called Data Retention Implementation Plan to the Attorney-General’s office in May. The telco asked for a number of exemptions — including one that would excuse it from the costly process of encrypting all of its data — but so far its requests have been rejected by the Attorney General’s department.\nInstalling the IT systems and complying with the scheme would cost Albury Local internet more than $100,000 to implement and at least $10,000 a year in operating costs.\nMr Wheeler said the costliest components of the scheme were the requirements to encrypt data and store it for two years. The company currently holds on to customer data for just 10 days.\n“I can stretch it a little bit but not to two damn years,” Mr Wheeler said. “This hugely increases the compliance costs. And if I had to reach into my pocket, I’m out, game over, end of story.”\nAnother owner of a small, Sydney-based ISP — who asked to remain anonymous — said it too would go out of business unless the Attorney-General granted exemptions to the scheme.\n“We are profitable, but if we were to implement this without funding then it would basically send us bust,” they said. “We have stopped signing contracts with new providers and have moved to outsourcing so we don’t have to comply with all these onerous conditions. The AGD think they are being helpful, but they aren’t doing enough. They need to change it so it can work with smaller telcos.”\nThe government has pledged $131 million to subsidise the cost of the data retention scheme for telcos. While the allocation of the $131m kitty has not been finalised, the Attorney-General’s department plans to prioritise funding to smaller ISPs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:40:53.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
