Ranges are available from 0-15 to 0-1500 psi gauge or absolute.\nThe ATM.mini offers accuracies of <0.05% FS including linearity, hysteresis, repeatability, zero and span setting, and long term stability of <0.1% FS/year. Modular construction provides flexibility in the selection of both process and electrical connectors to suit different applications. This new transmitter is designed for use in a wide range of development, prototype and production testing applications.", "external_links": ["http://cms.ukintpress.com/UserFiles/Automotive%20Testing/9093_image_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:01:39.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
