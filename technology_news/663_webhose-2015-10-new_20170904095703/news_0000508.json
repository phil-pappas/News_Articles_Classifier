TrafficCarma is the first consumer application from TrafficCast, the leading provider of digital traffic information and technology, delivering real-time traffic data into the dashboard of 8 of the top 10 car companies.\n“Local commuters don’t need directions; they want to know which of their routes is best right now,” explained Al McGowan, CEO of TrafficCast. “Highway or surface streets, bridge or tunnel, local or express; we’re taking the guess work out of the decision points along their commute.”\nAnnounced at the 2015 NAB/RAB Radio Show in Atlanta, TrafficCarma distribution partnerships are being offered to radio, television and news portals on a market-exclusive basis. A free consumer app, TrafficCarma provides personalization features for commuters and new digital revenue streams for distribution partners.\nFor commuters, crowd-sourced content is combined with road speed data, public agency reports, camera imaging and other metrics. Users receive information relevant to their commute, destination and other personal routes. The design of TrafficCarma minimizes driver distraction. Commuter contributions, in combination with the media partners, will build a TrafficCarma community.\nFor broadcasters, TrafficCarma upgrades the time-honored “traffic tipster” to the mobile environment, integrated with the optional TrafficCaster interface for on-air use. Radio can add TrafficCarma voice clips to reports, Television can overlay contributed video onto on-air graphics similar to the way their newscasts employ viewer-generated weather shots. Media partners also receive tools to enhance social media connections to their audience.\nThe TrafficCarma application is customized for each media partner. The product can be used in concert with existing broadcast traffic services, or as a stand-alone product. Mobile ad inventory can be sold, and revenue shared, between the distribution partners and TrafficCast.\nTrafficCarma will launch on a market-by-market basis, beginning October 15.\nAbout TrafficCast: TrafficCast provides travel time forecasting, road speed data and other traffic-related information, with technology, applications and content based on advanced digital traffic data.
