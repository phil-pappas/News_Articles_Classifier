Pandora, the Internet radio service, took a step toward détente with the major record labels on Thursday when it announced, in conjunction with its third-quarter financial results, that it had reached a $90 million settlement over royalties for older songs.\nThe settlement, which follows a similar deal in June for $210 million between the labels and Sirius XM, resolves one aspect of a dispute over an obscure legal point: Federal copyright protection applies only to recordings made after 1972, with a patchwork of state laws applying to earlier recordings.\nLast year, the three major labels — Sony , Universal and Warner — with Abkco, an independent that controls rights to many early Rolling Stones recordings, sued Pandora over its nonpayment of recording royalties for older songs, citing New York state law.\n“Major settlements with Sirius XM and now Pandora means that an iconic generation of artists and the labels that supported them will be paid for the use of their creative works,” Cary Sherman, the chief of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for the labels, said in a statement with Pandora.\nBrian P. McAndrews, Pandora’s chief, added, “We pursued this settlement in order to move the conversation forward and continue to foster a better, collaborative relationship with the labels.”\nDespite these agreements, Pandora and Sirius XM still face class-action suits filed by members of the 1960s band the Turtles, known for “Happy Together.” And a further announcement Thursday by Pandora suggested that it might still have problems with music publishers, the side of the business that deals with songwriting copyrights.\nPandora said that it was abandoning an effort to secure lower songwriting royalties retroactively to 2013, when it bought a small radio station in South Dakota. The company contended — but music industry groups disputed — that owning a radio station entitled it to the slightly lower rates that terrestrial radio broadcasters pay.\nPandora said it was taking a $23.9 million charge in its third-quarter results, representing the difference between the rates it had wished to pay and its deals with the licensing agencies Ascap and BMI. Yet Pandora also said that it might still apply for the radio broadcasters’ license to cover future periods, a move that may antagonize music publishers.\nFor its third quarter, Pandora reported $311.6 million in revenue, up 30 percent from a year ago. Its label settlement and write-down of royalties contributed to a net loss of $85.9 million, compared with a loss of just over $2 million last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:52:20.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
