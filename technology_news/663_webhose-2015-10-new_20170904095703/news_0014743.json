Bloomberg Share on twitter by John McDuling It's no secret that Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey greatly admires Steve Jobs, the visionary former CEO of Apple.\nSo it should equally be no surprise that Dorsey's first big act at Twitter since being formally appointed CEO of the social network is straight out of the Steve Jobs playbook.\nOvernight, in a memo that promised ( but failed ) to be light on jargon, Dorsey announced that Twitter is shedding around 300 jobs, or 8 per cent of its workforce . The idea, he said, is to create a \"smaller and nimbler team\", that is more focused on a few areas that will resonate with users.\nSound vaguely familiar? In 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to Apple, that company laid off 3,000 employees and dramatically shrank its bloated product line up, which at the time included things like the much derided Newton MessagePad.\nOf course, it's not unusual for a new CEO to clear the decks and cut jobs upon arriving at a company. But the parallels between Dorsey and Jobs are starting to look quite eerie. Some would say that's intentional. Dorsey has been accused of dressing and talking like his hero.\nLike Jobs, Dorsey was unceremoniously ousted from the company he helped found. Like Jobs, now that the company is struggling, he's been brought back try and revive its fortunes. And like Jobs, he will be doing that while serving as the CEO of another company (in his case, Square, which is eyeing an IPO later this year; in Jobs case, Pixar).\nTwitter's share price has fallen by more than 30 per cent since its IPO in late 2013. Twitter's main, eponymous service remains beloved by journalists and celebrities, but has never really cracked the mainstream. It only has around 300 million active users, which is dwarfed by Facebook's 1.5 billion strong user base.\nApple was also a mess when Jobs returned to the fold. His return proved to be triumphant, an absolute masterstroke that ultimately paved the way for Apple to release the iPod and then the iPhone and ultimately, become the biggest company in history.\n Not every return of a prodigal founder/CEO works out for the best. Take Jerry Yang at Yahoo.\nBut Twitter shareholders will be desperately hoping that Dorsey can emulate Steve Jobs, and not just on a superficial level.\nFollow John McDuling on Facebook\nï»¿", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459015008360/twtr-ex991_6.htm", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-09/square-said-to-seek-fourth-quarter-ipo-as-twitter-decision-looms", "http://www.macworld.com/article/2009941/steve-jobss-seven-key-decisions.html", "http://qz.com/522824/jack-dorseys-jargon-free-firing-memo-edited-to-remove-the-jargon/", "http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/does-jack-dorsey-want-to-be-just-like-steve-jobs/", "http://www.wired.com/2013/08/remembering-the-apple-newtons-prophetic-failure-and-lasting-ideals/", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "https://www.facebook.com/jmcduling?ref=aymt_homepage_panel"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:25:43.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
