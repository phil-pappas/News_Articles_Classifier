This round of funding will provide enough runway for that kind of time frame.”\nMr Andreasen said his service, which offers both free customistable legal templates and a network of over 600 lawyers who provide fixed fee Quote: s, has seen revenue up 800 per cent in 12 months and users up 400 per cent.\nBrook Adcock of Adcock Group said. “LawPath has grown significantly over the past two years, becoming a key thought leader in the industry. By building a scaleable platform to solve the inherent costs associated with legal services, LawPath is now well placed to become the clear market leader.”\nLawPath, which is based in Sydney and has grown to a team of eight, has raised $2.4 million to date. Mr Andreasen said he would announce a major partnership with a global brand in coming weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:39:49.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
