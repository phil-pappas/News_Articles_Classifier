Other than 1 per cent increase in stamp duty on property transactions, the Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (NMRCL) is also seeking to levy a 10 per cent surcharge on property tax charged by Nagpur Municipal Corporation. It also wants to charge 10 per cent tax on premium of balcony, passage or stairs. Proposals in this regard will be sent to the urban development ministry.\nThe present cost of the metro rail project is Rs 8,680 crore of which 50 per cent — Rs 4,340 crore will be loan from German and French government agencies. German agency KfW has already cleared Rs 3,500 crore loan in principle. These loans have to re-paid over a period of 20 years. The money generated through these taxes will be used to pay the loan and meet the operational cost of the metro.\nAs per the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the property tax surcharge will generate over Rs 3,500 crore over 27 years. The tax is to be levied from 2016-17 and will continue up to 2042-43. A NMRCL official said that the surcharge has to be levied on the annual letting value (ALV). Other taxes like lighting tax, fire service tax and sewerage tax, etc. are also some percentage of ALV. \"This tax has to levied on all properties and land holdings within Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits and not only in the 500 metre metro corridor area,\" he said.\nIn calculating the revenue from surcharge, DMRC had made an assumption that ALV increases by 35 per cent after every five years. NMC had told DMRC officials that reassessment of property tax was done every five years. The collection in 2016-17 is assumed to be Rs 13 crore. In reaching the revenue figure of Rs 1,422 crore from 10 per cent tax on premium on balcony, passage or stairs, DMRC has considered an annual increase of 10 per cent in the premium. In 2016-17, DMRC expects a revenue collection of Rs 5 crore from this.\nThe consultant has estimated that NMRCL would earn Rs 10,316 crore through 1 per cent surcharge on property transaction in the city. Here too it is assumed that the annual increase in property transaction value at the rate of 10 per cent. DMRC expects a revenue of Rs 85 crore in 2016-17 from this surcharge. Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) had collected Rs 32 crore in 2013-14 from 0.5 per cent surcharge on stamp duty.\nThe total collection in 27 years from these three taxes is expected to be around Rs 15,240 crore. Other than this, NMRCL will also earn from 40 per cent premium on extra floor to space index (FSI) allowed by urban development department (UDD), 500 metre on both sides of metro rail corridor. All these calculations have been made assuming that a large number of people will take advantage of extra FSI granted by government and start living along the metro corridor.\nPrice of metro\nNMRCL wants to levy a surcharge on property tax collected by NMC\nThe surcharge will be 10 per cent of annual letting value (ALV) of the property or land holding\nALV is calculated by assuming that the property was given on rent.
