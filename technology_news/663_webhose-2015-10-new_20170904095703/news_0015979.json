The Motley Fool article was published in response to an Anchorite article stating that Intel would not be able to generate profit with its Internet of Things Group, because it focused too much on $1 chips. Ashraf Eassa, Motley Fool contributor, disagreed. \nIn the September 18 article entitled \" Intel's Internet of Things Strategy Isn't Just About $1 Chips ,\" Eassa ( @TMFAeassa ) argues that the Intel plan goes far deeper than the cheap chips alone. In fact, a closer look at Intel's served, addressable Internet of Things market indicates an opportunity worth $8.7 billion, according to Eassa. Eassa used that argument to indicate Intel has an excellent revenue opportunity in the Internet of Things. \nIn addition, the silicon Intel is using for its Internet of Things customers is similar to that which it sells to the PC and data center customers. This helps cut the costs of business, increasing margin leverage, because Intel does not have to invent something new for a new set of customers. \n\"It's important,\" says Jason Hope , \"to realize that the Internet of Things is not going to replace Intel's PC market. It's going to add to it, providing a new area of income, not a complexly redefined area of income. In light of this, the Motley Fool opinion is a strong one.\" \nIntel's Internet of Things strategy also has hardware and software platforms it intends to offer its customers, providing greater value and income potential to the company. By offering full platforms, Intel's customers will be less tempted to switch to competitors. \nAbout Jason Hope \nFrom his home in Arizona, futurist Jason Hope watches the unfolding world of technology with great interest.
