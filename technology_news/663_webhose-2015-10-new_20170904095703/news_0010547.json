Picture: AP /Markus Schreiber\nCaroline Zielinski News Corp Australia Network THE first search of Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun’s famous tomb has revealed hidden doors which could be the burial chambers of his heretic mother, Queen Nefertiti.\nThe tomb was searched for the first time yesterday by a team of experts and dignitaries, led by British archeologist Dr Nicholas Reeves, whose academic paper titled The Burial of Nefertiti , published in late July, quickly grabbed international attention for its claim that Queen Nefertiti was buried in a secret compartment of her son’s tomb.\nSoon after the paper’s release, Egypt’s minister of antiquities, Mamdouh Eldamaty, invited the University of Arizona academic to prove his idea that the remains of the famous heretic Queen Nefertiti are hidden behind a wall in Tutankhamun’s burial chamber.\nMystery ... The golden sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun in his burial chamber. British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, who believes the legendary Queen Nefertiti may be buried in a secret room adjoining Tutankhamun's tomb arrived in Egypt, tested his theory on Monday.
