Its launch in Seattle is part of the company's plan for continued growth across the nation and a perfect fit for the dog-loving metropolis. \nWith Wag!, insured, bonded and loving dog walkers can be summoned with as little as 30-minutes notice or scheduled regularly and walks can be tracked on users' phones by GPS in real-time. A \"pup report\" is delivered through the app at the end of each walk including a picture/video of the pet, map of the walk, and pee/poop report. Currently the cost is $20 for a 30-minute walk, with an additional $5 per dog in the same household. Walkers are available from 7:00am until 11:00pm. Users may also schedule an optional \"meet and greet\" with their walker ahead of time. \n\"Essentially, we have placed a trusted and insured dog walker in your pocket, and for the first time your dog has its own app on your phone,\" said Josh Viner, co-founder of Wag!. \nWag! was created based on Viner's hesitations to own a pet given his busy schedule as a tech entrepreneur in LA. Viner founded Wag! with the mission to make it easier to own a dog. Viner then connected with Jason Meltzer of Surfdog LA and asked him to join the Wag! team based on his vast experience in the industry as one of Los Angeles' best loved dog walking businesses. \nWag! is also using its platform to encourage pet adoption. It has partnered with select shelters in Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco to donate walks to new pet parents. Most recently, Wag! has partnered with Homeward Pet Adoption for a month-long collaboration. \nAbout Wag! Founded in January 2015, Wag! is an on-demand app-based mobile service that allows dog owners to hire background checked, insured and bonded dog walkers for 30-minute walks. The app notifies owners when their dog is picked up and allows them to follow the walk through Wag!'s GPS \"Puppy Tracker\". When the walk is completed the owner receives a \"Pup Report\" indicating distance travelled and time, along with a \"pee & poo\" record, a photo/video and any notes the walker may need to communicate. For every mile a dog walks with Wag!, 10 cents is donated to the Best Friends Foundation. Wag! also partners with shelters in Los Angeles, San Francisco and NYC. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/on-demand-dog-walking-app-wag-launches-in-seattle-300158503.html \nSOURCE Wag!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:33:38.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
