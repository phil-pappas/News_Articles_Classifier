So if you weren't able to catch this handset during the initial run or if you took time trying to decide if it's the right smartphone for you, now is your time to grab it via the TechPinas Recommended Alcatel Flash 2 Lazada Offer ! On the outside, Flash2 sports a 5-inch HD IPS panel with Miravision Display Technology that automatically enhances picture display quality by giving you freedom to select the desired viewing options. This brilliant screen serves as a face for the phone's rather attractive body, which is - frankly - reminiscent of Sony Ericsson Xperia handsets of old. At its heart, Alcatel OneTouch Flash 2 runs its near-vanilla Android 5.1 Lollipop operating system with a 64-Bit Octa Core 1.3 GHz ARM Cortex A53 and Mali-T720 GPU based MediaTek MT6753 chipset that's complemented by 2GB of RAM and 16GB of ROM that you can beef up using the microSD card expansion slot. This combo is already good for a handset donning such SRP. But if there's anything about this phone that Alcatel is particularly proud of, it would definitely be its imaging capabilities. Heck, Flash 2 even has a dedicated camera hardware button on the side that immediately tells the user that it's made to snap shots. At the back, the handset's 13 MegaPixel gSight camera module features an ISOCELL sensor by Samsung, Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF), f/2.0 aperture for enhanced low-light performance, Dual RealTone LED flash, and an 80° Wide angle 5P Lens with blue glass optical filter. It also supports 4x Digital zoom and only takes 0.3 seconds to focus on a subject. According to Alcatel, the combination of these specs represents leading edge camera technology that can be used to capture the user's view of the world in crisp and brilliant images. Crafted for users who love to take selfies, Flash2 is equipped with a 5 MegaPixel autofocus front-facing Profile Cam with Soft LED flash allowing the user to take self-portraits even in low to zero lighting conditions. Furthermore, the shooter has a larger ¼” OV5648 Sensor, 1.4μ㎡ pixel size, f/2.2 aperture, 84° wide angle, and Beauty Mode which all work together to give you attractive selfies that are instantly ready for sharing on Facebook or Instagram. Here's the complete retail package that you'll get for Php 6,190. Joining the unit in the box are the travel charger, standard earphones, microUSB to USB cable, Quick Start Guide, free faux leather window case, and free screen protector. This is the Volcanic Grey version. I'm not sure if you can see it in the photo but the back cover has a 'sandstone' finish, which doesn't only feel great to the touch but also adds friction when you hold the phone so it won't easily slip your grasp. The back plate is removable, giving you access to the dual microSIM slots and the microSD card memory expansion slot. The 3,000 mAh battery is non-removable, though. The combination of Alcatel Flash 2's internal specifications as well as software optimizations give the phone an Antutu Benchmark Score in the range of 35,000 to 37,000, reflecting the fact that it can 3D games smoothly and deliver a stutter-free overall mobile experience. I got 36,452 when I ran the test on the phone this morning. At Php 6,190, I think Alcatel Flash 2 is already a steal. I find its design quite elegant -- and it's actually a capable cameraphone. Lovin' the dedicated button for snapping shots. I would advise you, however, to download YouCamPerfect to capture even better looking selfies. Off hand, I recommend this smartphone. Just go ahead and get it!
