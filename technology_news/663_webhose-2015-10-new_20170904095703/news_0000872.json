Based on an analysis of approximately 30,000 emails primarily in the retail sector, 59% of conversions were from mobile devices, down 3% from Q1. This was driven entirely by a reduction in smartphone conversions, which fell from 25% in Q1 to 22% in Q2.\nMovable Ink’s quarterly UK Consumer Device Preference Report provides deep insights into how U.K. consumers access and engage with emails across smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.\nWhile mobile devices combined (smartphones and tablets) still outweigh desktop in terms of conversions by 18%, the three percent swing indicates that brands still must work to provide seamless commerce experiences in order to maximise conversions. This holds especially true for smartphones, where consumers like to browse, but then often turn to a tablet or desktop to complete a transaction.\n“There are some interesting insights and takeaways from this quarter’s report, especially around opportunities for marketers to improve smartphone shopping experiences,” said Matthew Potter, Vice President of U.K. and EMEA for Movable Ink. “While many brands provide responsive emails and websites, the ones that focus on making it easier for consumers to convert on smartphones will have an edge in an increasingly competitive retail marketplace.”\nKey findings in the U.K. include:\nMobile opens are steadying. Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) accounted for 69% of all email opens, down from 71% in Q1 based on analysis of 47 million emails. Despite decreasing, the U.K. still leads the U.S. by one percent for mobile email opens. Mobile conversions slow in the UK. An analysis of approximately 30,000 emails showed that approximately 59% of email conversions were from mobile devices, down 3% from Q1 - driven by a decline in smartphone conversions. Tablet users spend less time in the inbox. Tablet users have the shortest attention span when it comes to reading their emails, spending less than 3 seconds on 43% of the emails they open. London leads in clicks while Scotland leads conversions. London and the South East accounted for the highest share of email clicks across the U.K. in Q2, while Scotland had the highest share of conversions. Android users remain engaged. The number of Android tablet users engaging with their emails for longer than 15 seconds increased to 55% in Q2 from 48% in Q1. Smartphones dominate the mornings. Smartphones continue to be the device of choice for email opens in the morning, while desktop opens peak during work hours and tablet use dominates in the evening.\nThe full report is available as a free download here .\nAbout the Q2 2015 Movable Ink UK Consumer Device Preference Report\nThe UK Consumer Device Preference Report is based on data collected through Movable Ink’s contextual experience platform between April 1, 2015 – June 30, 2015.
