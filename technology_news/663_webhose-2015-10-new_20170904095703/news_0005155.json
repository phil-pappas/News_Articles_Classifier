She also helps the government in its negotiations with the country's international creditors, who are now in Athens, having started a fresh round of consultation with government officials on Wednesday.\nLast week, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras demanded Mrs Savvaidou's resignation, after she was charged with a breach of duty by a prosecutor for attempting to defer tax collections from the country's TV stations by a year, in violation of a law.\nBut Mrs Savvaidou, who was appointed in mid-2014 by the previous conservative government, denied any wrongdoing and has refused to quit.\nMrs Savvaidou is also under fire for a decision to review a fine of â‚¬78 million ($US88.5 million) imposed on an IT firm.\nIn a long written statement published Tuesday, Mrs Savvaidou stressed that she wouldn't resign at a time that her \"honesty, dignity and proper completion of my duties are being put in doubt due to the implication of my name in a judicial process.\"\nShe added that her resignation could be regarded as admitting her involvement in a scandal or lead to \"the transformation of the independent General Secretariat for Public Revenue into a frightened tax administration that cannot carry out its duties.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:58:46.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
