PRIME MINISTER offers Canadians an exclusive, up-close, post-election campaign glimpse at the country's Prime Minister-Designate in his first one-on-one interview since being elected earlier this week. From how and why he won the election, to what Canadians can expect in the days, months, and years to come, LaFlamme guides a candid conversation with the country's next Prime Minister. \nIn the second story of the evening, W5 reporter Tom Kennedy delivers EMOTIONAL RESCUE , an investigation into Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in adolescents a particularly debilitating and often dangerous psychiatric condition which has gained recognition only in recent decades.Characterized by mood swings with little or no apparent reason, BPD can be deadly as those afflicted may take their own lives.
