CrowdStrike, which employs former FBI and National Security Agency cyberexperts, did not identify the corporate victims, citing client confidentiality. And the company says it detected and thwarted the attacks before any corporate secrets were stolen. \nA senior Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss the matter publicly, said officials are aware of the report but would not comment on its conclusions. The official did not dispute them, however. \nThe U.S. will continue to directly raise concerns regarding cybersecurity with the Chinese, monitor the country’s cyberactivities closely and press China to abide by all of its commitments, the official added. \nThe U.S.-China agreement forged last month does not prohibit cyberspying for national-security purposes, but it bans economic espionage designed to steal trade secrets for the benefit of competitors. That is something the U.S. says it doesn’t do, but Western intelligence agencies have documented such attacks by China on a massive scale for years.
