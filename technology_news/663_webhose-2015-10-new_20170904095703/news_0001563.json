It is available to businesses with more than 50 users for US$15 per user per month. Smaller businesses and individuals can use the tool for free.\nSymphony said last month it was working with News Corp's Dow Jones to offer news in its service and with McGraw Hill Financial Inc to integrate data and analytics from its S&P Capital IQ product.\nGoogle became Alphabet Inc earlier this month.\n(Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-13T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:21:56.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
