The killer then went back inside and shot himself in a classroom where many of his victims lay dead and wounded, a prosecutor told a news conference.\nIt was authorities' most detailed account yet of the gunman's death. Previously, they had said only that the 26-year-old attacker killed himself after a shootout.\nThe detectives arrived within minutes of the first reports of gunfire at Umpqua Community College.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:05:43.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
