Exhibiting there will be Wolfspeed at booth 431 offering information about their RF Foundry — the world’s largest dedicated, commercial wide bandgap production device facility to promote their advanced, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) manufacturing readiness level (MRL8+) and Category 1A Trusted Foundry services. Additionally, the company will provide information about several new Wolfspeed RF components, including a miniature, plastic-packaged 50V/60W broadband GaN HEMT for military communications applications and one of the highest power Ku-Band MMICs currently available on the market. \n\n\n\nDelivering big power and big efficiency in a small, 4.5mm by 6.5mm surface mount plastic package, Wolfspeed’s new, inherently wideband CGHV27060MP delivers 70% efficiency, 75W power, and 17dB large signal gain over frequency bands spanning UHF to 2.7GHz. Booth visitors can see the new miniature, high power, high efficiency device mounted in an active 2.5–2.7GHz application circuit, and can speak with Ryan Fury, Wolfspeed’s RF Foundry program manager, and Sarah Miller, a marketing representative for Wolfspeed’s RF Components, for additional details regarding device performance and the many benefits it can provide in milcom applications. Visitors can also discuss and view static examples of Wolfspeed’s 40V/30W two-stage, 50Ω Ku-Band GaN MMIC high power amplifier (HPA), the CMPA1D1E025F , which covers the 13.5–14.75GHz commercial satcom band, delivers satcom measured performance of 20dB linear gain at 42dBm average output power, and enables higher power, more efficient Ku-Band solutions than incumant TWT or GaAs solutions. Further, all visitors who scan their badges at the booth will be entered into one of two random drawings, to be held on Monday and Tuesday, October 26 and 27, for a chance to win one of two Apple watches. \n\n“Communications play a crucial role in military readiness and operations, so it’s critical that these systems are developed, from inception to completion, with the most effective, efficient, and reliable components available,” said Ryan Fury, foundry program manager, Wolfspeed. “Wolfspeed not only delivers industry-leading GaN-on-SiC RF technology especially designed to enable next-generation communications systems, but also provides world-class design assistance, proven fabrication processes, testing, and support to help customers realize their specifications, and has a proven track record of doing with faster cycle times, higher first-pass design successes, and greater reliability than our competitors.” \n\nFor more information about Wolfspeed’s presence at MILCOM 2015, please visit Wolfspeed’s MILCOM landing page , which features downloadable brochures, new product information, datasheets, videos, and white papers.
