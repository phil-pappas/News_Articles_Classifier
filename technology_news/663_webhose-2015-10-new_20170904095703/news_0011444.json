The second edition of this challenge encourages IoT enthusiasts and developers to build innovative solutions for the Internet of Things using open standards and open source technology. The previous edition of the Challenge resulted in innovative solutions implementing a connected car monitoring system, home automation, greenhouse automation, and others. Once again, participants will be supported with hardware development kits, technical support, and prizes for the winners. The Challenge is sponsored by bitreactive, Eurotech, IS2T, Red Hat, and Zolertia.\nThe Eclipse IoT Working Group is a community of twenty IoT open source projects and over thirty participating companies. The goal of Eclipse IoT is to provide a set of open source IoT technology that is used by the IoT industry to build open, commercial and enterprise IoT solutions.\nThe Open IoT Challenge encourages participants to build IoT solutions using any or all of the following technologies:\nIoT open standards, such as MQTT, CoAP, Lightweight M2M, DNS-SEC, OneM2M Eclipse IoT projects, such as Eclipse Kura, Leshan, SmartHome, Mosquitto, Paho, and others listed at iot.eclipse.org\nOther open source projects Commercial hardware and services that interact with open-source software and open standards for IoT\nParticipants are required to submit a proposal for their solution before November 23. A panel of judges will select a shortlist of participants that will receive hardware development kits. All participants will then have until the end of February to build their IoT solutions. The winners will be announced the beginning of March.\nAdditional information about the Challenge is available at http://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge .
