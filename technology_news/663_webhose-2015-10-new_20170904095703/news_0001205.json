At those campuses, 65 percent of students began using the tools within a week of availability and more than 80,000 students who weren't included in the early agreement began using the tool as well. \n\"Students and alumni access Portfolium via the exclusive network for their CSU campus,\" according to a news release. \"Through this network, they create a digital portfolio of their academic and professional accomplishments including projects, presentations and papers. The interface highlights talents and achievements that aren't easily captured in a traditional resume, and their work is showcased in a collaborative environment that connects them directly to companies, recruiters, internships and jobs.\" \n\"The CSU is excited about its partnership with Portfolium, which represents another tool to help our students be successful while attending the university, as well as help them find jobs after they graduate,\" said Loren Blanchard, executive vice chancellor for academic and student affairs, in a prepared statement. \"We also see this as another way to increase the opportunities for networking among our alumni.\" About the Author \nJoshua Bolkan is the multimedia editor for Campus Technology and THE Journal.
