As an industry we need to continue to perform and provide evidence that it’s an attractive place to put capital.\n“You want investors who ­believe in the vision, benefits, and the economic returns of our start-ups and you’ve got to provide them with evidence that the ­returns are there.”\nMr Dyson’s comments come after newly appointed Assistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy told an innovation forum last week that some of the wealth locked into Australia’s superannuation system should be diverted into innovation.\nWith Australian technology heavyweight Atlassian’s purported decision to list on Wall Street rather than on the ASX dividing opinion in Australia, Mr Dyson said that while the US held a natural appeal for mature businesses the ASX could be an attractive destination.\nAccording to Mr Dyson, the ASX is an appropriate home for large local tech firms as long as they’re of the right size and scale.\n“In terms of large companies like Atlassian, Seek, Carsales, I think it really is a viable option and I would think that the exit multiples you can get on the ASX for a large critical mass business would be comparable to what you could get anywhere in the world.”\n“In terms of sub-scale businesses however, I’m a bit unsure.”\n“You need to list a company at the right stage because listing is not the end of the journey it’s the start of a new journey and some companies do list too early in their development, which can make finding success more challenging. It’s different horses for different courses, really.”\nMr Dyson added that the continued success of globally focused start-ups like Atlassian should help propel the local technology industry, given that until now the sector has been poor in talking about its successes.\n“What’s great about companies like Atlassian and Nitro is that when these companies eventually achieve their exits it gives us more things to talk about,” he said.\n“To me this is about the ­evidence. That’s what investors want to see.”\nHe is optimistic that Australian superannuation funds will look to start supporting innovation and that they are quite likely to get an appropriate return on those ­investments. “Look I work in ­venture capital, I have to be optimistic,” Mr Dyson said.\n“At Starfish we live and breathe the innovation economy and we see the best and brightest coming out of Australian universities, not aspiring to work for Macquarie or BHP but aspiring to work for Facebook, Google, or more ­importantly, start their own companies.\n“That’s something that has only happened over the last five years, when Canberra was looking in the opposite direction, but these people want to make their own ­career and that’s very exciting.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/05/1227558/041033-4018cb6a-6b2e-11e5-9bb9-94d25a90b8df.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/john-dyson-evidence-needed-before-super-spent-on-start-ups/story-e6frgakx-1227558041095"], "published": "2015-10-06T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:57:12.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
