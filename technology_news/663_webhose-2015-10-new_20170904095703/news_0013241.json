The current global outcry over CO2 emission largely stems from fears that it will cause irreparable damage to the atmosphere, protecting the earth from harmful ultra violet rays, by raising the temperature. \"Any tree that grows faster is a clear indicator of its ability to sequester carbon faster. Eucalyptus is a fast growing tree with ability to sequester rapidly. But its disadvantages far outweigh its sequestering capabilities. Hence, scientists are engaged in searching for a better option,\" says AS Devakumar, professor at University of Agricultural Sciences in the Department of Forestry and Environment, GKVK, who has done extensive work on carbon sequestration in the Western Ghats.\nIn a joint study, scientists KR Swamy, H Shivanna, P Surendra, AG Koppad and KS Channabasappa carried out experiments on six species of trees to understand their carbon absorption pattern. The experiment was carried out in 2009-10 at the agriculture research station Hanumanamatti in Renebennur Taluk of the Haveri district. The district falls under Northern Transition Zone-8 of Karnataka.\nWith a mean annual minimum and maximum temperature respectively of 14 degree centigrade and 21.5 degree centigrade and total annual rainfall of 420 mm, scientists set up a shelterbelt area in Haveri. The six species of trees were planted in red, sandy and loam type soil of the shelterbelt. The six tree species selected for plantation were: Acacia auriculiformis, Azadirachta Indica, Tectona Grandis, Casuarina equisetifolia, Dalbergia sissoo, Pongamia Pinnata.\nAt the end of the experiment, the findings of which were published in 'My Forest' journal, the highest soil organic carbon was found in top (0-15 cm) and bottom (15-30 cm) soil layer (1.34% and 0.99%) in Tectona grandis and Acacia auriculiformis (1.25% and 0.83%). The lowest was noticed in top layer of control (0.56% and 0.35%).\nThe study also showed that carbon sequestration potential in soils is likely to be strongly affected by root production and soil microbial activity proportional to inputs of soil organic carbon at the top layers. As the depth increases, the organic carbon decreased due to low decomposition of organic matter, according to the scientists involved in the experiment.\nDevakumar, however, says while sequestration can help in absorption of carbon in atmosphere, use of bio-fuel is another way of dealing with the problem of climate change due to excessive carbon emission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:56:34.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
