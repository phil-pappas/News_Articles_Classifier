Still, by midday, Walmart had lost $20 billion in market value as its shares fell to their lowest level in several years.\nWalmart previously said that it expected net sales to grow 1 to 2 percent for the current fiscal year, through January.\nDoug McMillon , Walmart’s chief executive, said the company needed to invest to return to growth.\n“We can deliver stronger financial performance in the short term simply by running our core business better, but that won’t be enough,” McMillon said.\n“Retail history is very clear. Those that are unwilling or unable to change go away,” he said. “That’s why we’re taking decisive steps now to change and grow our business.”\nHe acknowledged that competition with e-commerce juggernauts, as well as discounters, remains tough. But in a shot at Amazon, he defended the advantages of Walmart’s large physical store over purely online merchants, asking whether it was easier for a brick-and-mortar store to build up e-commerce or for an e-commerce player to build out stores.\n“We like our chances,” McMillon said.\nWalmart is spending $1.2 billion this year to increase pay for its hourly-wage employees to $9 an hour, and $1.5 billion next year to raise wages to $10 an hour. It will also invest $2 billion in its e-commerce arm over the next two years, opening online grocery operations in 20 markets.\nMcMillon also said he was willing to close stores that were underperforming, as well as sell assets, prompting speculation over a potential sale of businesses, like Sam’s Club, whose performance has lagged.\nCharles Holley , Walmart’s departing chief financial officer, said earnings per share would fall next year by as much as 12 percent before they would recover. The company’s executive vice president, Brett Biggs , is set to succeed Holley at the end of the year.\nHolley asserted that the company expected sales to grow in a range of $45 billion to $60 billion over the next three years, the equivalent of the annual sales of many of the country’s biggest corporations. Walmart’s net sales for its 2014 fiscal year were $482 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:18:14.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
