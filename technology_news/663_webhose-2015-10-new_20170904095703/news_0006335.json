More than 10,000 hospital users track in excess of 25,000 pharmacy kits with Kit Check. Since its first site at the University of Maryland Medical Center, Kit Check users have tracked over seven million medications. Growth in the user base continues to accelerate with hospital customers doubling again in just one year. \n\"Directors of hospital pharmacy face numerous challenges. I am happy that Kit Check has successfully eliminated the problems of manual pharmacy kit restocking for more than 200 hospitals. Tim and I founded Kit Check as a friend to the pharmacist. We saw too many manual processes that introduced risk of human error and added to the labor crunch faced by hospital pharmacies. At the same time, many healthcare technology vendors still treat pharmacy as an afterthought. We focus our sole attention on applying new cloud and RFID technologies to solving tangible problems in the pharmacy. I am proud to say that focus is making a difference and users are responding,\" said Kit Check Co-founder and CEO Kevin MacDonald. \nKit Check Vice President of Sales Doug Zurawski, PharmD., commented, \"Hospital pharmacy kit restocking has been known for years as 'the worst job in the pharmacy.' Data shows that with Kit Check, this is no longer true. In addition to hard-dollar savings in overtime and inventory, Kit Check users repeatedly report improved staff satisfaction. As a former Director of Pharmacy, I recognize how rare it is to reduce cost and errors while simultaneously increasing staff morale. I also recognize how little data access I had to do my job. Kit Check's new reporting features provide a level of medication data visibility and analysis that has previously been unavailable for pharmacy kits and anesthesia medications. It is a pleasure to bring this solution to my former colleagues because I know it works and Kit Check does whatever it takes to make users successful.\" \nAbout Hospital Pharmacy Kits Pharmacy kits are used throughout hospitals for critical care procedures including operating room anesthesia, crash carts, pediatric emergency, labor and delivery and others.
