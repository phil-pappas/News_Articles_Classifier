Contributors from the industry, as well as the legal, financial services, and enterprise IT communities, share their insights and advice to effectively mitigate risk. \n“Directors are frequently at a loss as to the process for navigating an attack,” explains Jim Jaeger, Chief Cyber Services Strategist at Fidelis Cybersecurity. “Fidelis’ security consultants have decades of front-line experience assisting C-level executives and response teams to deal with high profile incidents. The first 48 hours are critical to investigate and contain the breach, analyze threat and forensic data, and obtain the intelligence needed to best remediate the threat.” \nImportant topics covered in the Fidelis chapters address the recent blurring lines of attacks and why traditional remediation methods can increase the risk of retaliation and may make incident response efforts ineffective. A shift to new approaches and deeper understanding of the threat lifecycle is underway. The Fidelis chapters provide a deeper understanding of the threat lifecycle and highlight new approaches for preparing for and responding to attacks. Topics covered in these chapters include: Planning, preparing for, and testing enterprise-wide incident response capabilities Detecting, analyzing and understanding threat vectors Adopting an outcome-based approach to forensic remediation Building a capable forensics and incident response team Leveraging lessons learned in containment and eradication of major breaches \n\"Cybersecurity is a strategic risk issue for business and it requires ongoing board oversight; however, cybersecurity is a new area that leaves many corporate boards uncertain as to how to proceed,” said David Lashway, co-chair of Baker & McKenzie's Global Cybersecurity Practice. \"Lack of knowledge and insufficient counsel is affecting the ability of directors to provide adequate oversight of the security organizations and cybersecurity risks within businesses. This guide provides proven strategies and tactics that will help directors meet their obligations and assist their businesses.\" \nThe Fidelis chapters are available as a free download at www.fidelissecurity.com/NYSEbook . The book is available in Kindle, iBooks, and PDF formats at www.securityroundtable.org . \nMedia is invited to attend panel discussions with leading security advisors today in New York City and in Washington, DC on Wednesday October 14, 2015.
