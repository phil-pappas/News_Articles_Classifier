So did his age. After all, few 15-year-olds get to address the UN in New York, let alone speak with eloquence and passion on climate change. The speech, delivered in June, went round the world. It was viewed hundreds of thousands of times on YouTube, and secured him press coverage in everything from Rolling Stone to the Guardian .\nFor Xiuhtezcatl (pronounced, roughly, shooTEZcat), however, addressing the UN was business as usual, or close to it. For most of his young life he has been working in climate activism, mainly with his group, Earth Guardians , which uses music and speech to engage young people around the world, and has more than 400 regional groups globally.\nRelated: Everything you wanted to ask about the Guardian's climate change campaign\n“It’s true, you don’t get many 15-year-olds addressing the UN,” he told me by phone from his home in Boulder, Colorado. “But I’ve been public speaking since I was six, so I don’t really get nervous any more. Compared to the other things I do, the UN was very sterile. Everyone was in a suit and tie, playing on their phones. Nobody gave a damn. I’m used to performing at music festivals with my group, where the crowd is much more engaged.”\nHis love for the environment stems from his childhood. The name Xiuhtezcatl is from the Nahuatl language and he was raised in the Mexican Mashika tradition.\n“My name was given to me by elders of our community when I was six, based on the alignment of the stars,” he explains. “Indigenous peoples see themselves as caretakers of the planet. The main thing I remember about my childhood is being outside, in the forest with my Dad, searching for frogs and snakes. It made me feel like I was such a big part of this world. But I learned about human lifestyles, how our greed and ways of living are destroying our planet for the profit of this generation. It freaks me out.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Ruffalo is a good friend of Earth Guardians.

But it has also brought him into contact with celebrity environmentalists. Mark Ruffalo is a good friend of Earth Guardians, and Leonardo DiCaprio is a supporter. Between his speaking engagements, meetings and concert engagements, does Roske-Martinez never wish he was a more normal teenager?\n“I know that balance is important. If I burn out I won’t be able to do anything for my cause. But I do get to hang out – last night I went to a Tyler, The Creator and A$AP Rocky concert. I know that I need to make sure I’m having fun, getting in trouble and not doing my homework sometimes, like other 15-year-olds.”\nPerhaps it helps that he doesn’t want to be doing this for ever. “It’s not that I’m not passionate,” he says. “But kids shouldn’t have to be on the frontline of climate change. It’s the job of our leaders to take action for us. I want to be able to work as a musician, as well as an activist.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aerial View Of An Oil Well Drilling Platform On A Man-Made Island, Arctic Alaska Photograph: Scott Dickerson/Corbis\nStill, for now he has plenty to worry about on the climate front. At the Paris climate change conference in November, he will be involved in a number of events. The UN climate change summits have a long history of raising false hopes about government action , and Roske-Martinez says it’s important to see them as part of a process, rather than an end goal. “Real change must come from people, rather than the government.”\nNevertheless, he is disappointed in Obama’s presidency, particularly over the decision to allow drilling in the Arctic, and is in the process of suing the government for its stance on fossil fuels. But we shouldn’t expect to see Roske-Martinez himself in the White House any time soon. “I’ll never be a politician,” he says. “It would drain my soul of everything that is pure. People tell me I should run for president, and I think ‘no I shouldn’t’. It’s important to stay close to your vision, and stay humble. I’ll never cut my hair.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Xiuhtezcatl%20Roske-Martinez%3A%20%E2%80%98Our%20greed%20is%20destroying%20the%20planet%E2%80%99&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/7/1444224840255/daddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=cc50696027ea98420f29cac125e53977", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43%2F0_0_5705_3423%2F5705.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Xiuhtezcatl+Roske-Martinez%3A+%E2%80%98Our+greed+is+destroying+the+planet%E2%80%99&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2015%2Foct%2F09%2Fxiuhtezcatl-roske-martinez-earth-guardians&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43%2F0_0_5705_3423%2F5705.jpg", "http://www.earthguardians.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F7%2F1444224840255%2Fdaddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43/0_0_5705_3423/master/5705.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0485f43eaaca4e0ebbdf97dcdbae5354", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Xiuhtezcatl+Roske-Martinez%3A+%E2%80%98Our+greed+is+destroying+the+planet%E2%80%99&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2015%2Foct%2F09%2Fxiuhtezcatl-roske-martinez-earth-guardians&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F7%2F1444224840255%2Fdaddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43/0_0_5705_3423/master/5705.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=dbd8ca16e4292b7ed0ac9f7b7dc50e63", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/7/1444224840255/daddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ed71c4be6335ce476be9f8882b67bd7c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/7/1444224840255/daddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2f654ee2f152936496a393ba9635424b", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Xiuhtezcatl%20Roske-Martinez%3A%20%E2%80%98Our%20greed%20is%20destroying%20the%20planet%E2%80%99&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d3yp%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43/0_0_5705_3423/master/5705.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=89bc78fad39f2cc69b6aa1f7ebb92095", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b00f8159548bf6e3a1f3c651bf2110e2c6bf43/0_0_5705_3423/master/5705.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2baff81e0054936634f76fef7656961b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/7/1444224840255/daddc46f-d818-4d69-a281-0f738ccc16bc-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0dae1f556b587d528655edfd5f0994a2"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:10:50.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
