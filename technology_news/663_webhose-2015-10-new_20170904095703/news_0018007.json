All times local. \n3:35 p.m. \nA Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice linked to a new discovery of allegedly pornographic and racially offensive emails says he'll cooperate with an ethics investigation. \nJustice Michael Eakin issued the four-sentence statement through the courts Friday. It came after Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane told state ethics agencies that Eakin may have violated conduct rules because of emails that were sent to him. \nShe describes some of the email's contents as racially offensive or misogynistic. \nKane's office says it discovered the emails on the office's computer servers because they'd been sent or received by her office's employees. \nPrevious disclosures by Kane in the scandal have resulted in a wave of resignations or firings. \nA lawyer retained last year by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review thousands of emails between justices and the state attorney general's office from 2008 through 2012 reported finding no new improprieties. \n__ \n11:45 a.m. \nPennsylvania's attorney general is telling state ethics agencies that a state Supreme Court justice may have violated judicial conduct rules, citing emails he received that she's recovered from her office's computer servers. \nAttorney General Kathleen Kane on Friday released one of several similar letters she sent this week about Justice Michael Eakin to the Court of Judicial Discipline, the State Ethics Commission, the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court and the state Supreme Court. \nThe letter to the Court of Judicial Discipline's president judge says Kane uncovered the emails after fielding a Sept. 11 inquiry from the Philadelphia Daily News about emails from a Yahoo.com account tied to Eakin. \nKane's letter says lawyers must inform appropriate authorities if a judge's action raises questions about his or her fitness for office. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:04:09.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
