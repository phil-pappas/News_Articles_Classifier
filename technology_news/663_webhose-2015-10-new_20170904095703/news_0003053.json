Read below to find out more about their expanded product lines.\nThe food industry is one that's constantly growing, especially in the Philippines where eating is one of the national pastimes. While it can be difficult to make a name for yourself in such an industry, Best Buy makes it easier to take that first step into it.\nFounded in 1998, the company has since dedicated itself to providing high-quality food service equipment and supplies in restaurant industry, as well as the hotel industry. The company has since become a leading importer of such supplies while also offering custom-built stainless steel fixtures for both home and commercial use.\n“With us, you are not just a client – we assist in planning, designing and furnishing your projects from start to finish,” the company states on its website. This alone already makes it easier for one to start earning money through their culinary hobbies.\nCooking Tools and Equipment Available\nBest Buy has since expanded the line of products they offer, so that whether you're thinking of offering drinks, snacks, or quick meals, you'll find the equipment you need.\n1. Washing equipment. In order for a restaurant to fulfil minimum requirements when it comes to cleanliness and hygiene, you'll need hand-washing and dishwashing stations. Best Buy offers 1-tub and 2-tub sink models, the latter coming with bottom shelving to save kitchen space. They also have a dishwashing machine that can easily fit in the kitchen.\n2. Refrigerators. Again in line with cleanliness and hygiene standards, restaurants need at least one, to help them store food. Best Buy has in-kitchen chillers to help keep food fresh as possible. It also has glass-fronted refrigerators for establishments that offer self-service drink options.\n3. Grills, ranges, and other cooking equipment. Regardless of size, you'll need at least one of each unless you're offering only cold menu items like salads and drinks. Best Buy has as many as 6 options for griller options, depending on size and quantity of food to be grilled. Each model has safety features built in, so one doesn't have to worry about gas spillage and the like.\nThey also have open-top ranges and gas ovens, so that you can definitely assure your diners of freshly-cooked food, each and every time.\n4. Miscellaneous items. Different kinds of restaurants will need different equipment, but you can be sure Best Buy carries it. Clients will find siopao steamers, pizza cutters (to make it easier to slice pizzas evenly), and even half-moon baking pans and rotating cake stands. Food warmers, water heaters, and sterilizer cabinets are also available.\nWith this many choices, it's no wonder that Best Buy has practically become “the largest supplier of food service equipment for hotels and restaurants.” In the past 17 years, they have also managed to uphold the company's image of quality, affordable prices, and timely delivery.\nAs it is, the company has two branches – one in Davao, and another in Cebu – to make it easier to deliver on their promise to clients.\nSo if you're looking for a kitchen equipment supplier Philippines , look up Best Buy at bestbuyfoodservice.com.
