Many companies have focused their IoT strategy on how the technology can cut costs and improve efficiency. However, IoT can also serve as a foundation for greater differentiation and innovation,” said Jackie Scott, global program director of Rutgers Business School Executive Education. \n“Companies that embrace new technology will be better positioned to unlock fresh revenue streams, provide better customer experiences and create modern operating models that will drive efficiency and create real value,” Scott added. \nParticipants will gain a better understanding of new technology and how to lead innovation in the organizational structure (e.g., talent, globalization, mergers & acquisitions, financial drivers, Centers of Excellence), technology (e.g., IoT, Machine to Machine technology, Robotics, Omni-Channel Enhanced Customer Experiences, digital manufacturing) and processes (e.g., predictive analysis, advanced analytics, cloud computing, risk mitigation, procurement, fulfillment, lean and green principles). \nThe complete program curriculum is available here . \n“This program masterfully identifies how digital disruption is permeating the basic functions of supply chain management. This certificate is a ‘must have’ for supply chain teams aspiring to provide a differentiated customer experience,” said Ron Guido, independent consultant and recently retired vice president, global brand protection and supply chain integrity for Johnson & Johnson. \n“This isn't your father’s supply chain,” Guido added. “The program astutely recognizes the changing landscape of demand capture and fulfillment, and delivers an impactful set of modules to guide supply chain professionals into the new frontier of digitized commerce.” \n“The ‘old’ focus of discussion and research in supply chains was the optimal establishment of these supply chains. Companies, entire sectors, ‘lived and died’ by their supply chains,” said Professor Farrokh Langdana, Ph.D, the Director of Rutgers EMBA and Professor of Finance and Economics. \n“The more recent focus on discussion and research in supply chains focuses on the exogenous shocks that buffet supply chains and can generate cycles of disruptions over multiple continents. These shocks can range from natural disasters, to political coups driven by economic disaster, to exchange rate collapses from broken exchange-rate pegs. The Rutgers Mini-MBA in Supply Chain Management will equip attendees to master both these aspects of supply chains, to not just survive but to thrive in this hyper-connected global economy,” Langdana added. \nThe Mini-MBA program, Supply Chain in a Digitized Network, is designed for experienced and emerging supply chain leaders proactively seeking to understand the massive shift and impact digital innovations and technology will have on the supply chain industry. \n“We are very pleased to have the opportunity to partner with some of the absolutely best external subject matter experts and thought leaders in the world of next-gen supply chain strategy as well as leveraging the expertise of our award-winning Rutgers Supply Chain Management Department, Supply Chain Disruption Research Laboratory and Center for Supply Chain Management,” Scott said. \nTaught by seasoned experts who have hands-on experience with complex supply chain issues, the program includes case studies, interactive sessions, and class exercises, accompanied by valuable networking opportunities with faculty and fellow participants. \nRegistration for the Supply Chain Certificate Program is open now, but space is limited.
