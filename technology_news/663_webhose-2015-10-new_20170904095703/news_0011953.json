Sales rose 3 percent to 59.2 billion kronor, driven mostly by growth in India, southeast Asia and Oceania, offsetting declining sales in northern Europe and northeast and central Asia.\nThe Stockholm-based company said there was \"a slowdown of the 4G (network) deployments in mainland China,\" with sales slumping 10 percent year-on-year in the Northeast Asian division that includes China. Brazil and Russia also saw a substantial sales decline.\nEricsson said it would accelerate its expansion into \"the fast-growing\" sector of TV and media technology to make up for the slowing growth in the wireless equipment market.\nThe company's shares were down 6.3 percent at 82.75 kronor in afternoon trading in Stockholm.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the dollar equivalent of 3.1 billion kronor is $365 million, not $36.5 million.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
