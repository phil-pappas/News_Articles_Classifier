By Joan Lowy ASSOCIATED PRESS • Wednesday October 7, 2015 6:25 AM \nWASHINGTON — Many Americans buying new vehicles are baffled by a torrent of new safety technology. \nSome features automatically turn a vehicle back into its lane if it begins to drift, or hit the brakes if sensors detect that it’s about to rear-end someone else. There are lane-change and blind-spot monitors, drowsiness alerts and vehicles that can park themselves. \nTechnologies such as adaptive cruise control, tire-pressure indicators and rearview cameras that once were limited to high-end models have become more common. \nThe features hold tremendous potential to reduce deaths and injuries by eliminating collisions or mitigating their severity, safety advocates say. \nBut there’s one problem: Education on how to use them doesn’t come standard. Bewildered drivers sometimes just turn them off, defeating the safety potential. \n“If people don’t understand how that works or what the car is doing, it may startle them or make them uncomfortable,” said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council. “We want to make sure we’re explaining things to people so that the technology that can make them safer is actually taken advantage of.” \nThe council and the University of Iowa, along with the U.S. Department of Transportation, are kicking off an education campaign today to inform drivers about how the safety features work. The effort includes a website, MyCarDoesWhat \n.org, that provides video demonstrations. \nIn a survey by the university, a majority of drivers expressed uncertainty about the way many of the safety technologies work. About 40 percent reported that their vehicles had behaved in unexpected ways. The least-understood technology was adaptive cruise control, which can slow or speed up a vehicle in order to maintain a constant following distance. That technology has been available in some models for at least a decade. \nThe features vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, from model to model and from one options package to another. \nA study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety of early adopters of safety technology found that some drivers thought collision-warning systems would brake to stop their vehicles for them. Actually, the systems only alert drivers to an impending collision. It’s still up to the driver to hit the brakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:43:36.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
