It’s easier to navigate and has cleaner lines imagery and text.” \nBut the re-branding team did more than just update the look, the department did months of research on what makes a site appealing, and analyzed where webpage visitors landed and lingered, as well as what competitors were doing online. \n“More importantly, we wanted to be mobile device-friendly,” said Franks. “We serve people who are on the go, connected 24/7 and want content delivered to their fingertips, and this includes being mobile-device friendly.” \nImagery is dominant on the pages. There is more interaction and even some animation. Social media is imbedded. There are more original content, blogs and franchisee profiles explaining the benefits of a 7‑Eleven franchise and showcasing the company’s technology and operations support. \nThe site is divided into three easily digested segments: the basic contract, the applicant’s experience and financial information. \nSomething that no other franchise company offers is “Franchising 101,” a description of what franchising is all about. It’s more of an education rather than a sales tool and includes a glossary of terms to help the novice understand, for example, what a “franchise disclosure document” is. \nFranks said shortly after the new website was launched in late summer, the team saw the number of applications rise. \n“We believe our new approach is paying off,” added Franks. “Visitors are staying longer on the pages and the bounce rate (exiting the site) has gone down.” \n7‑Eleven, Inc. continues to grow and expects to have a net of approximately 200 stores added to its U.S. store count this year. \nAbout 7‑Eleven, Inc. 7‑Eleven, Inc. is the premier name and largest chain in the convenience retailing industry.
