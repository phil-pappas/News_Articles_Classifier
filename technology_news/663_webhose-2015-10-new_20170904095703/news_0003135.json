A new study makes an ambitious attempt to define the new role of the contact centre and set out what businesses can do to optimise the performance of their contact centres. Call Center IQ’s The Evolution of Contact Center Performance report makes the point that, partly as a result of its positive impact on financials and partly due to the recognition of customer centricity as a paramount business objective, the contact centre is becoming regarded in a more favourable light within many organisations, and to command a more prominent and valued role. However, it says: “This evolution has not relaxed scrutiny over contact center performance. If anything, it has added more layers — and thus more challenges — to the performance management process.” This creates more challenges for contact centre managers. “As businesses and customers begin to demand multi-faceted value from the contact centre, new considerations enter the equation. The contact centre — and the processes, strategies, agents and technologies of which it consists — must satisfy a multitude of objectives and appease a multitude of stakeholders.” The report aims to analyse the contact centre within this more rigorous context. It begins by using survey data to reveal how today’s contact centres are constructed and where they sit within the business and then proceeds to try and identify the key objectives of contact centres and how businesses assess their success in achieving those objectives. Armed with this analysis it aims to uncover the most valuable elements of contact centre operations, customer interactions, agent performance and technological solutions, and to look at how well contemporary contact centres are delivering those elements. An expert panel of contributors provides advice on what contact centres should do to create optimal value for customers and for their businesses. The results of 16 survey questions are presented in detail and analysed and the findings summarised in a set of overarching recommendations, each accompanied by comments from the expert panel. In summary those conclusions are:- customer centricity is not efficiency blindness;- think in terms of the customer;- understand identity;- improve agents’ competency – and their environment;- embrace change and the systems that drive it. If one paragraph can sum up the entire 39 page report and the conclusions from the survey, it is this. “Considering the important role that the contact centre plays within the business … more work is needed. The success of that work hinges on the business’ ability to embrace change. If it cannot sincerely acknowledge the need to revamp all facets of its contact centre, it will hinder its ability to achieve improvement. Contact centre success is not always about quick, painless initiatives. It can involve expansive changes that adhere to a long-term vision.” \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
