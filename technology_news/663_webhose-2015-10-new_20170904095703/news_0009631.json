MSFT, +0.23% Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s total compensation in 2015 fell to $18.3 million, a 78% drop largely tied to a drop in his stock compensation.\nMeanwhile, his base salary for the year ended June 30 jumped 31% to $1.2 million and his cash bonus rose 20% to $4.3 million, according to a securities filing.\nNadella’s compensation last year was boosted by a $59.2 million restricted stock grant that he is eligible to receive in 2019. That $59.2 million figure — which had boosted his total compensation to $84.3 million, making the 48-year-old one of the highest paid tech executives — assumes Microsoft’s stock-price gains and dividend payouts top those of 60% of the companies in the S&P 500 in each of three overlapping five-year stretches ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nChief Financial Officer Amy E. Hood’s total compensation, meanwhile, fell 16% to $8.8 million and Chief Operating Officer B. Kevin Turner’s dropped 46% to $12.2 million. The lower compensation, like Nadella’s, was largely because of lower stock awards.\nMargaret L. Johnson, who joined the company in September 2014 as executive vice president for business development, was paid $14.5 million, including a one-time hiring cash bonus of $2.5 million.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-nadellas-pay-falls-on-stock-compensation-1445292395"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:25:30.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
