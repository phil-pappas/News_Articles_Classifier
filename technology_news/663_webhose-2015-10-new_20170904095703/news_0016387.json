(AP) - Federal officials say workers have stolen radioactive materials from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico multiple times this year.\nThe Albuquerque Journal reported Friday ( http://bit.ly/1i0vLG2 ) that the items were taken from an area that stores contaminated materials before they're shipped elsewhere. A federal court filing says there have been 76 thefts by Los Alamos personnel in 2015.\nAn affidavit says lab officials contacted federal investigators on Sept. 30 to say a subcontractor's employee had stolen items.\nThe day before, police responded to a call about a man throwing materials into bushes near the lab. Officers found several radioactive items, including a band saw that tested 500 times above the allowable limit for contamination.\nA Los Alamos spokesman referred questions to the FBI, which didn't respond to a request for comment.\n___\nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1i0vLG2"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:44:00.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
