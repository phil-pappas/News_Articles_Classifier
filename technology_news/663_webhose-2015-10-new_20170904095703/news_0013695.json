The four-week average for benefit applications fell by 2,000 to 263,250, the lowest level since December 1973.\nThere are indications that the economy has slowed in recent weeks. A strong dollar has hurt U.S. export sales and industrial output has weakened as businesses cut back on orders in an effort to trim excess supplies. But so far, this weakness has not spurred a rise in layoffs.\nBenefit applications are a proxy for job layoffs. Economists like to focus on the four-week average because it is less volatile than the weekly number.\nIn signs of a slowdown, employers added just 142,000 jobs in September and the government sharply lowered its estimate of gains in July and August. Monthly job growth has averaged a mediocre 167,000 in the July-September quarter, down from 231,000 in the April-June period.\n“Despite the solid trend in claims, we have seen some slowing in improvements in other labor market indicators, namely nonfarm payrolls,” Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, wrote in a research note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:27:26.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
