Should I end the friendship?\nVery Upset\nShe’s not behaving as a friend, so you have good reason to lessen contact with her.\nYou don’t have to pronounce the friendship’s end. Use this time of feeling less social to be unable to see her on your own, and withdraw from couples’ get-togethers too.\nMeanwhile, there’s divided views on this situation between you and your husband. So, during this sensitive time, try to avoid a major argument about his responses to her.\nWhen you feel stronger, you two need to talk — without accusations from you and without defensiveness from him.\nTell him that you’ve felt hurt by her belittling of you and her closer relationship with him.\nSay that you’re willing to talk this out together with a counsellor, so you both benefit from neutral guidance.\nAlso, say that you wouldn’t expect him to accept you flirting with another man and revealing his private information. And you can’t accept the reverse.\nBe clear that if nothing changes, you’ll feel it’s necessary to cut ties with that woman.\nI’ve been getting a lot of unwanted attention from a co-worker. I’m married and he recently got married.\nSince I started work there two years ago, he’s been constantly trying to get my attention.\nHe’d walk by my desk several times and constantly stare at me. Then he started following me.\nHe’d pretend to run into me in the elevator or make sure I see him passing by.\nI changed my routine and avoided him.\nRecently, he started approaching me and making small talk. I’m not responsive to his jokes or silly remarks, but he seems happy just to get a reaction from me.\nI don’t know if I can call this harassment as he seems harmless and hasn’t said or done anything inappropriate. I have no evidence that he’s been following me. What I can do to make this stop?\nAnnoyed and Uncomfortable\nKeep a record with dates and times of his “appearances” in your path, by your desk, etc.\nIt will soon reveal if there’s a pattern of unusual numbers of occurrences, especially if he doesn’t need to pass by your desk.\nMeanwhile, say simply and firmly that you don’t enjoy small talk, especially with someone who’s not a personal friend. Note that you said this.\nIf his seeming pursuit continues, you can take your record to the human resources department (or a manager or the boss) and discuss your feeling of being “harassed.”\nTip of the day\nWhen there’s repeated arguments over hurtful behaviour, wait till you’re feeling strong before starting a serious talk.\nRead Ellie Monday to Saturday.
