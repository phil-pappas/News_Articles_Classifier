The assessment was conducted by TÜV SÜD, an independent and renowned functional safety accredited appraiser, which assessed the Freescale products up to the most stringent automotive safety integrity classification. \nThe MC33907 and MC33908 SBCs work seamlessly with 32-bit MCUs to provide scalable power supply solutions for a broad range of applications requiring high levels of automotive safety integrity such as ADAS, suspension, transmission, engine management, torque control, and battery management systems. The devices support the creation of robust, system-level functional safety systems, while helping reduce overall energy consumption via the integration of high efficiency DC/DC switching regulator technology. \n“This assessment underscores Freescale’s commitment to helping automotive customers meet rigorous functional safety requirements, even as they face growing pressure to meet aggressive cost, size and time targets,” said James Bates, general manager and senior vice president of Freescale’s Analog and Sensors Group. “Leveraging Freescale SBCs helps OEMs speed time to market by reducing complexities associated with meeting the ASIL D metrics.” \nThe MC33907 and MC33908 SBCs are part of the Freescale SafeAssure program , which is designed to help system manufacturers more easily achieve system compliance with a wide range of functional safety standards. The program highlights Freescale solutions – hardware and software – that are optimally designed to support functional safety implementations and come with a rich set of enablement collateral. The SafeAssure hardware development process is certified as compliant with the ISO 26262 standard for developing functionally safe systems up to ASIL D. \n“We have issued a technical report of functional safety to Freescale that qualifies the MC33907 and MC33908 analog ICs for design capability and use in the most stringent automotive safety applications,” said Andreas Bärwald, vice president, Global Strategy and Operations Automotive for TÜV SÜD Auto Service GmbH. “This is a proven industry confirmation that gives automotive manufacturers the confidence to cost-effectively and successfully achieve the safety level required of their applications.” \nAbout Freescale Semiconductor \nFreescale Semiconductor (NYSE:FSL) enables secure, embedded processing solutions for the Internet of Tomorrow.
