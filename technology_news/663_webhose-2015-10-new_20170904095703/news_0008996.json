It’s another indicator of how Bill Clinton/Tony Blair-style liberalism is veering sharply to the left across the English-speaking world. Along with the surge of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary in the United States and the nomination of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in the United Kingdom, must now be reckoned Canada’s election of a Liberal government under Justin Trudeau.\nOf all the neoliberal parties during the Clinton-Blair 1990s, the Liberal Party of Canada qualified as the neo-liberaliest. Under the double-headed leadership of Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Finance Minister Paul Martin, the Liberal government elected in 1993 cut federal spending to the lowest levels since the early 1950s. It steeply cut the top rate of corporate taxes, and hiked contributions to the federal pension plan. It reneged on a promise to repeal a consumption tax on goods and services introduced by its Conservative predecessor. Canada attained a balanced budget in 1998 and recovered its triple-A bond rating in 2002.", "external_links": ["https://books.google.lv/books?id=K6nPva2piB4C&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=canada+lowest+level+since+1951+spending&source=bl&ots=i_-gzQer4a&sig=B09LZOX2bwU_WOGyBi2EaNyFU2k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBGoVChMIgMP0upvRyAIVCuljCh1Pfwzh#v=onepage&q=canada%20lowest%20level%20since%201951%20spending&f=false", "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/25/world/canada-presents-balanced-budget-the-first-in-almost-30-years.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:38:44.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
