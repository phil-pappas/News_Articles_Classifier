But, one frustration I have seen with users is in the area of the formatting data and in particular how to make the cell formatting 'stick'. \nThe issue of the formatting not remaining or 'sticking' appears to arise if a user hits refresh to refresh their data in the table, or remove, and then add data back into the calculations area. The formatting appears to 'disappear' from the table. \nThere is a way to prevent this happening. So let's look at an example. \nBelow is a really small sample of my data extract which documents the data fields of 'Calls Taken' and also 'Calls Dropped' for a period of time in February 2015. \nDate - Calls Taken - Calls Dropped - Total Calls \n01/07/2015 - 10 - 5 - 15 \nFirst create a standard Pivot Table. \nSelect the data set you want to use for your pivot table The first thing to do is put your cursor somewhere in your data list Select the Insert Tab Select Pivot Table option Select a table or range option Select to put your Pivot Table on a New Worksheet or on the current one, for this tutorial select the first option Click OK The Options and Design Tab will appear under the Pivot Table Tool Select the check boxes next to the fields you want to use to add them to the Pivot Table In this example add Total Calls \nWe now need to add a calculated field.. My calculated field is the number of calls dropped as a percentage of the total number of calls taken that day. A pretty standard calculation. \nTo create a calculated field \nSelect any cell in the Pivot Table. Under Pivot Table select Tools then hit Formulas Select calculated field Insert calculated field dialog box will appear Type a name for your calculated field in the Name Box Type your calculation In this case the calculation is =(Calls Dropped/Total Calls) Name the Calculated Field as % Of Total Calls Dropped \nNext go ahead and highlight the cells directly in the data area where the calculation is, and changed the formatting to %. \nThis changes my calculated field to a %, but if I then remove the value fields then decide to add in the Sum of Calls Dropped field. See what happens. The formatting sticks to the cells rather than the data values. \nYour number formatting now only relates to that value field. By setting a number format on the field itself, the number format will be applied consistently no matter how much the table changes. \nThis is really straight forward in Excel. \nClick on the Value Field in the Field List Box- in this example it is Value Field Setting", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:56:15.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
