Beyond a password, the second factor is a PIN, a location, or even a \"biometric,\" an FBI alert states.\nTFA can include text messages sent to a user's phone with a verification code, which can be required as a supplement to a password, or biometric information like a fingerprint.\nThe measure is recommended especially for business, the FBI noted on Monday. \"Many large businesses have already recognized the benefits of deploying TFA to their workforce and in doing so have dramatically reduced the risk of credential theft and the subsequent loss of sensitive or proprietary data. Smaller and medium-sized businesses are encouraged to do the same.\"\nMore from the Washington Examiner State Dep't won't apologize for airstrike against hospital Spokesman says more information is needed before to government would \"respond accordingly.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/06/15 4:34 PM Criminals \"obtain passwords more often than you think\" by simply guessing them, beating security questions, or using technical devices like keyloggers or through social engineering scams, the FBI said.\nThe measure has been commonly available for several years, but many still aren't using it. A number of cybersecurity breaches over the past year can be traced back to a failure to secure user credentials using such a process, including those of the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Defense and the State Department.\nAs a result, authorities have continued to plead with people, sometimes incessantly, to take the necessary precautions.\nIn August, the FBI issued a warning that email fraud was on the rise. It recounted that business fraud accounted for $1.2 billion in losses worldwide between October 2013 and August 2015, while fraud against individuals in the U.S. accounted for $700,000 in the second quarter of 2015.\nMost email fraud is based on a hacker's ability to access a victim's email account. Thus in most cases, a secondary verification process would have been sufficient to keep perpetrators out.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Republican utility regulator steps down Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner Philip Moeller will leave at the end of the month.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/06/15 4:08 PM However, because it takes extra time to enter more than one set of credentials, plenty of Internet users are certain to disregard the advice. For that reason, the FBI's alerts are likely to continue, even if they go unheeded.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:29:39.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
