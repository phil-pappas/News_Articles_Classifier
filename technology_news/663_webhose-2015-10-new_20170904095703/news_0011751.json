They can accept either all-cash, all-stock, or a mixed consideration. KLA-Tencor stockholders are expected to own 32% of the combined company on a pro forma basis.\n\"Lam Research and KLA-Tencor's shared commitment to collaboration and building strong customer trust, along with our respective track records of innovation, product leadership, and operational excellence, position us as a combined company to deliver the higher levels of technology differentiation and speed to solutions that are critical to our customers' long-term success,\" said Mr. Anstice.\n\"I strongly believe that this transaction represents a great outcome for all of KLA-Tencor's key stakeholders,\" said Rick Wallace, president and chief executive of KLA-Tencor.\n\"Given the complementary nature of the two companies' product offerings and technologies as well as the lack of product overlap, the combination will create an industry leader with greater opportunities for our respective employees for professional development and growth,\" he added.\nSteve Newberry, Lam Research's chairman, will continue in that role and two board members from KLA-Tencor will join the combined company board effective upon closing.\nLAM said it would fund the cash part of the deal, and repay KLA-Tencor's outstanding term loan, from cash of $1.9 billion and $3.9 billion in debt financing.\nThe deal, which is subject to the approval of both sets of shareholders and regulators, is expected to close mid-2016.\nGoldman Sachs is acting as exclusive financial adviser to Lam Research and Jones Day is providing legal counsel. Qatalyst Partners is acting as financial adviser to KLA-Tencor, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is providing legal counsel.\nSeparately, the two California-headquartered companies have reported quarterly earnings. Lam Research net income for the third quarter ended Sept. 27 has more than doubled to $288.68 million, from $141.08 million a year earlier on revenue of $1.6 billion and $1.15 billion respectively. Mr. Anstice said the company is on track to deliver over 20% revenue growth for the third consecutive year in calendar 2015.\nFor the first quarter ended Sept. 30 KLA-Tencor reported net income of $112 million, compared with $79 million a year earlier, on unchanged revenue of $643 million.\nWrite to Ian Walker at ian.walker@wsj.com\n 05:45 ET (09:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:04:56.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
