There are plenty of sound drowning apps you can use to simulate bustling coffee shops or twittering birds, but I found Noizio a welcome addition because you can layer different sounds at different volumes.\nAlso some of them are happily absurd. I worked solidly through a rainy afternoon listening to a strange combination of clucking chickens and blue whales.\nYou may work on several different projects in a day, so it's helpful to set a Noizio timer to prompt you to get up and have a break. And I found having different sounds for different tasks helpful.\nForrest App helps you avoid procrastination While you're happily powering through tasks listening to the crackle of a campfire, you may also be bursting open tab after tab on your browser. Hi everyone, my name is Jessica and I'm a tabaholic.\nToo many tabs Until I added Tab Wrangler to my Chrome browser, I had an awkward habit of emailing myself tabs I needed open because I would be at the stage where I would have nearly 60 windows scattered across my desktop. And half of them would be Google searches such as \"synonym for disruption\".\nAnd even though I could barely read their labels, I wouldn't delete them for fear of erasing the one critical source I'd need at some point.\nTab Wrangler doesn't delete your open tabs, but it does close the inactive ones and put them in a history list for you, positioned just above your now breathable browser.\nYou can set the clearing intervals and lock certain tabs you return to often, like your calendar, email or Netaporter. You can restore them all whenever you like, but you might give your computer a heart attack.\nKilling trees What gave me a heart attack was how miserably I failed at using quirky app Forest .\nIt's designed to help you overcome smartphone addiction and procrastination by planting an adorable tree, which grows over a period of thirty minutes, although you can adjust this.\nIf you leave the app or open any of your blocked sites (in my case Facebook, Hot Copper and Net-a-Porter) your adorable tree shrivels up and dies. It's crushing.\nBut if you survive your set time without deviating from your task, the tree is successfully planted and you can begin growing a small forest. If you give up, the dead stump is planted instead, reminding you of your crippling inability to stay on track.\nThere's an interesting new feature in Forest, whereby you can swap the coins you earn each time a tree reaches maturity for the actual planting of a tree in India or Zambia.", "external_links": ["http://www.forestapp.cc/", "https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/noizio/id928871589?mt=12", "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-wrangler/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh?hl=en"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:19:09.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
