Mobile wallets have been used as a means of savings and payments,” said Chomel. \nThe sender does not need to be a Standard Bank account holder however with EcoCash in Zimbabwe, the receiver of the transaction has to be a registered EcoCash customer otherwise their transaction would be rejected. \nArno Von Helden, Head of Trade and Forex Product, Standard Bank Business & Commercial Banking expressed excitement at the new mobile walletwhich is available in Africa in only two other countries, Kenya Mpesa and Tanzania Mpesa. \nViveka Govender, Senior Operations Manager for Mobile and Self Service Channels at MoneyGram, said Econet had approximately 4 million active wallet holders in Zimbabwe and this service offers our customers more choices in how their receiver collects remittance. There are between 1,5 million and 2 million Zimbabweans living in South Africa. These regularly send money back home. \nGovender stated the product offering will be extended to Standard Bank 167 branches across South Africa. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=9071   23   Finance , Finance & Banking   Technology  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:22:03.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
