Whenever they ask me something in an interview, I can't figure it out what exactly they are asking me. When I respond I give the wrong answer, (or the answer they are not looking for).\nI've also struggled with maintaining relationships. I've come to discover that many women or relationships are about \"figuring it out\". All my past ex-girlfriends would give me the look, I can see something is wrong but I simple can't figure it out, and if I ask what's wrong, it's like I'm making them more angry because I simple can't it figure out. And when I talk direct and straight forward, I would simple be accused of being shallow and not being romantic.\nThis on the other hand has had an affect on my self confidence and how I expressed myself, I tended to be very self cautious if I'm talking to a person for the first time. I always ask myself If I've said the right thing or the wrong thing, which in turn exacerbates the problem.\nIronically enough I'm in the process of completing my BA Communication Science degree, which will require me to do a lot of encoding and decoding of messages in future. Doing this course however has opened mine eyes and has improved my writing and communication skills. I'm beginning to think that with time, I will improve 10 folds of my communication from where I am now. It has also made me realize that I'm not really an idiot, as I was told many times and made to believe growing up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:02:18.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
