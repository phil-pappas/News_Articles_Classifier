The award honors an organization that has shown a significant commitment to helping LINGOs deliver affordable, high-quality learning solutions to people and organizations working to improve lives in developing and vulnerable communities. Chris Pirie, LINGOs Board Chair and Microsoft’s General Manager of Field Readiness and Learning, presented the award to NetDimensions CEO Jay Shaw in a ceremony Wednesday night at the Global Learning Forum.\nNetDimensions supports the LINGOs community with an innovative Learning Management System based on NetDimensions Learning . The technology, which NetDimensions provides to LINGOs at greatly reduced cost, gives LINGOs’ 80+ member non-profits and their collective 200,000 employees access to learning when and where they work—in over 140 countries.\nThe NetDimensions Learning Management System has allowed LINGOs to deliver a wide range of learning opportunities to its members, said Chris Proulx, LINGOs CEO. “In our first year of partnering with NetDimensions, we’ve just cherry-picked the set of features we knew would provide immediate benefit for the diversity of organizations that we serve. Yet at the same time, there’s a potential for us to really go deeper with the platform in the future. NetDimensions has been incredibly generous with their technology as well as their expertise to help build a common platform for over 80 organizations.”\nFor its part, NetDimensions’ partnership with LINGOs is one aspect of the company’s commitment to corporate social responsibility. “We want to have the opportunity to grow as a company, to give value to our shareholders, to serve more clients. In turn, we also need to provide opportunities to organizations that are making the world a better place,” said Michelle Sullivan, NetDimensions’ North American Marketing Director.\nFor NetDimensions CEO Jay Shaw, this means sharing learning opportunities through LINGOs: “NetDimensions is fully committed to building our relationship with LINGOs and helping to provide a learning technology that has an impact on the world.”\nThe effects of NetDimensions’ generosity are far-reaching. “Their corporate experience is at a global level – across multiple countries and languages, serving corporations with tens of thousands of employees,” Proulx said. “By partnering with NetDimensions we have a solution that can scale out to the 200,000 employees that our members represent and still have the scale to expand and grow.”\nAbout LINGOs\nLINGOs is a non-profit member organization with 80+ international development and social sector organizations, representing over 200,000 employees and thousands of local partner organizations globally. With a mission of improving capacity building methods and outcomes wherever its members work, LINGOs partners with over 20 private sector companies to provide pro-bono and subsidized technology, tools, content and other services for learning and development.
