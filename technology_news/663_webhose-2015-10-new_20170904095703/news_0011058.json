It is a subdued anxiety against what most South Africans view as a manifestation of an unwelcomed encroachment by China.\nNot long ago the department of basic education announced that, as of next year, South African children will learn Mandarin in public schools.\nThis announcement was preceded by news of the ANC dispatching delegations to China to learn from the Communist Party of China.\nIt even alleged that China has committed to bankrolling the construction of a political school for the ANC in South Africa.\nAll this suggests that the Chinese are not imposing themselves on us; they are being invited to take over the country by the ruling party.\nWe must therefore seek to understand what has gone wrong in the mind of the ANC, that the party voluntarily invites foreigners not only to indoctrinate our children, but indirectly to run our country.\nTwo things seem terribly wrong with the ANC today. Firstly, the party is experiencing a serious confidence crisis and, secondly, it has grossly misread developments in the international arena.\nIt is not easy for undiscerning observers to detect the ANC’s confidence crisis because the party projects a dead lion’s beard to the West, while crawling to China with its tail between its legs.\nThis syndrome I typical of people battling with the mental effects of colonialism.\nOn the one hand, they are bent on proving to the world that they are courageous enough to tell their former colonizers to go to hell, while at the same time they are unsure if they can stand without the support of another big brother.\nIn other words, the ANC is uncertain if South Africa can withstand the consequences of castigating the West without the protection of a neocolonizer – China.\nThis was the logic of small, timid states during the Cold War. They insulted the East if they believed that they enjoyed the full protection of the West, and vice versa.\nThus the ANC is trapped in a Cold Ward mentally that is irrelevant to a new world, an arena where international relations have become too complex for anachronistic leaders with a simple mind.\nThabo Mbeki did appreciate how a country like South Africa can use her strategic position to advance and African agenda that is not underwritten by a big country outside of the African continent.\nHe did not say “I am an African” because of China, the United States of America, Russia or India. He accommodated in his sophisticated conception of an African only those European who settled permanently among us.\nSuch Euro-Africans should not be viewed as a gate through which we Africans enter contemporary Europe; they are as African as Afro-Americans are American.\nThe springbok is a symbol of our national rugby team not out of an ill-intention to cover the white body with a skin of an African animal; white South Africans are truly African.\nThe ANC of today has conjured up the illusion that black people are under siege by white Europeans, and therefore that we must sell our independence to the Chinese for protection.\nThis is fuelled by a corrupt element in the party, a clique that has convinced itself that corruption scandals in the media are planted by whites who wish to delegitimize a black government.\nThe idea is that, since transparency is not their culture, the Chinese will be better partners. In other words, the Chinese will let us become what we have always been – corrupt Africans.\nBlack people who are conscious must reject the ANC’s pilgrimage to China, not because the Chinese are necessarily bad people, but because we do not need them to be fully African.\nThere is room to collaborate with China on strategic issues, but let them keep their language to themselves. We Africans have our own language to develop.\nEssentially the ANC is selling our identity to the Chinese, while they don’t sell theirs to us.\nThis brings us to the ANC’s misreading of the international trends. The party might benefit from reading Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China by Ezra Vogel.\nThis book and many others make it clear that those who believe that China is making economic progress because of some Chinese secret, are simply ignorant.\nThe Country’s progress began the day it looked West. Troubled by centuries of economic backwardness, its leaders began to read Adam Smith, who taught them capitalism.\nSince Deng set out to implement his turnabout strategy, China has been sending students to the best American Universities to learn, then come back and implement Western ideas.\nSince the ANC is unaware of this, it has been visiting the wrong place for lessons – China. If indeed the party wants to learn, the best place to visit is America where the Chinese went for their lessons.\nEven if the ANC chooses to go to America, it must sell only Luthuli House, not our country to foreigners.\nWe are and can be fully African without a foreign big brother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:03:01.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
