The most advanced Skyport ever, it gives Elinchrom users the ability to control and visualize power settings across all their lights directly from the Skyport transmitter plus the ability to shoot at speeds up to 1/8000s in Hi-Sync mode.\nVisual Feedback Interface\nThe Large LCD display of the Skyport HS features two-way control via a new Visual Feedback Interface that lets viewers see the exact power of every light in their setup right on the transmitter. Users control each light’s power level and modeling lamp setting directly from the Skyport transmitter, which instantly shows the updated power settings. This provides unsurpassed levels of “two-way communication and control” for every light in the setup right from the camera.\nHi-Sync Technology\nHi-Sync opens up the world of flash photography to explore even further. Elinchrom Hi-Sync technology goes beyond the X-Sync of any camera. Photographers can simply switch to Hi-Sync mode and access sync speeds up to 1/8000s to freeze motion, overpower the sun, darken backgrounds or use a wider aperture. The new ODS (Overdrive Sync) enables users to fine tune the Skyport plus HS transmitter’s trigger signal to optimize exposure at high shutter speeds while gaining up to 2 more f-stops of light.\n“The Skyport HS offers convenience and reliability that hasn't been available with any transmitter before now. It also incorporates so many new advanced features and options that it opens up a whole new world in flash photography. I haven't been this excited about a new product announcement in a long time!”\nMichael Clark, Adventure Photographer\nImproved Reliability\nThe Skyport HS has 20 frequency channels that can be used for either Normal or Speed mode. The transmitter attaches easily and securely to the hotshoe with its one-touch quick-lock mechanism, and is powered by 2x AA batteries. It also features an integrated AF Illuminator for faster focusing and a mini-USB socket for firmware updates. Users can instantly distinguish what sync mode they are in as the backlit display glows green for normal sync mode, and red for speed sync mode. They can also enjoy a range of up to 656ft (200m) outdoors, and up to 196ft (60m) indoors.\nFuture-proof\nThe new Skyport HS continues the Elinchrom commitment to quality; providing photographers with tools to enhance their shooting experience while also showing how Elinchrom is looking firmly ahead to the future. The Skyport HS represents a seamless extension of the EL-Skyport family since it is also compatible with the three previous generations of flash units (including the EL- Skyport Transceiver RX module for Style RX, Digital RX, and Ranger RX systems, and the integrated EL-Skyport modules for the BRX, D-Lite RX, ELC Pro HD, and ELB series.) The Skyport HS adds synchronization capability and “two-way control” functionality to all Elinchrom lights with EL-Skyport capability.\nThe Skyport HS is the first in a long list of exciting engineering collaborations with design partner, Phottix and allows Skyport to boast the best quality, reliability and range ever available.\nFeatures\nLarge LCD with unique, real-time display of remote flash power settings Easy access buttons and Digital Dial for fast setup and control 20 Channels, 4 Groups for Normal and Speed Sync Modes Hi-Sync, up to 1/8000sec with Canon and Nikon cameras Extended working range up to 656ft (200m) AF Illuminator and sure-lock mounting foot USB port for future-proof upgrades\nThe EL-Skyport Transmitter Plus HS is currently available for Canon and Nikon (with Sony to follow).\nEL19366 - EL-Skyport Transmitter Plus HS for Canon\nEL19367 - EL-Skyport Transmitter Plus HS for Nikon\nStreet Price: $249.95 USD / €249 EUR / £199 GBP\nFor more information globally, contact elinchrom(at)elinchrom(dot)ch\nIn the U.S., contact Will Holowka at willh(at)macgroupus(dot)com\nAbout Elinchrom\nElinchrom has been at the forefront of photographic lighting technology since the earliest days of studio flash manufacture.
