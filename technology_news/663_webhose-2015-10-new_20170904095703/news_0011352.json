Amazon has since signalled it is putting on hold smartphone development and has dismissed engineers who worked on the device.\nBut it hasn’t scaled back its hardware ambitions entirely. In September, Amazon released a new slate of tablets computers, including a $US50 version, and an upgraded Fire TV set-top box. It is developing a high-end computer for the kitchen known internally as Kabinet, people familiar with the matter have told The Wall Street Journal.\nFor the September quarter, Amazon said sales rose 23 per cent to $US25.36 billion, up from $US20.58 billion last year. Analysts were expecting $US24.9 billion. Excluding currency impacts, sales increased 30 per cent.\nOperating expenses, meanwhile, climbed 18 per cent to $US24.95 billion.\nIts Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, which rents out computing power to other companies, reported sales of $US2.09 billion, up from $US1.17 billion, and an operating profit of $US521 million. Amazon has said AWS, as it is known, could one day surpass the core retail business in size.\nThe quarter included the one-day Prime Day sale Amazon touted as having more discounts than Black Friday. But it was ultimately a promotion to tempt holdouts to join Amazon’s popular $US99-per-year Prime unlimited shipping program. The company covets Prime members because they reportedly spend at least twice as much on the site as non-Prime members.\nIn addition to Prime Day, Amazon has been larding up the Prime program by adding new cities with free same-day shipping, as well as others where they can receive goods within an hour or two.\nOn Thursday, Amazon announced San Francisco and San Antonio Prime customers would be eligible for the speedier delivery program.\nFor the current quarter, the company said it expects a record holiday season and guided for sales of $US33.5 billion to $US36.75 billion, versus the $US35.16 billion expected by analysts.\nAmazon shares have been on a tear this year, rising more than 80 per cent.\nBy market capitalisation, Amazon exceeded rival Wal-Mart Stores during the quarter, even though it has less than a quarter of the revenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:28:49.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
