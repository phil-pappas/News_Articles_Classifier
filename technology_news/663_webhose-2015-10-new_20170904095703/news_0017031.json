Worldwide, users are sending about 1.2 million messages a month on 3nder while logging around 4 million swipes.\nThat falls sorely short of the 1 billion swipes per day seen on Tinder, the hook-up app whose viral growth is boosting billionaire Barry Diller’s IAC/Interactive.\nThree’s the magic number ... Nearly a third of the accounts created on 3nder are couples, and most are millennials. Picture: Supplied Still, 3nder’s smallish subscriber base is a motivated one that’s willing to pay its monthly fee of nearly $US13. Revenue is up 500 per cent this year, and “it’s all organic, we haven’t done any marketing or advertising,” Mr Trifonov told The Post .\n Nearly a third of the accounts created on 3nder are couples, and most are millennials, according to Mr Trifonov.\nIndeed, old-school swingers have baulked at 3nder’s Facebook login requirement, which is intended to verify identities.\nYup. It&apos;s coming soon. #antrioid pic.twitter.com/0KDYfnvrBA\n— 3nderapp (@3nderapp) October 9, 2015 Despite 3nder’s privacy guarantees, “People were saying, ‘I can’t log in with Facebook — I’m gonna lose my job,’ ” according to Trifonov. “But people between 18 and 34 are not so affected by imaginary moral values.”\nThe soft-spoken, 25-year-old techie admits his own tastes run vanilla. He got the idea when his longtime girlfriend confessed an attraction to a woman.\nThis story was first published by the New York Post\n Angel investors bank on threesomes", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e2dfaa692d2aa18587b68bf626715b3a", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/antrioid?src=hash", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/59ef0a3ae6fecc1cc5531f6c3230f99f", "https://twitter.com/3nderapp/status/652510077325340672", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/angel-investors-sink-700000-into-3nder-the-tinder-for-threesomes/story-e6frfrnr-1227580682060?sv=b8de32e3b49a30619083beec54e31b2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d013b61afa3dd07df6c3fffecc4c4f85", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c72bc460f0cb926fdddb1241a7e85f4a", "http://t.co/0KDYfnvrBA", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d00cbd0cd81a9bf4c7f4da66c8911277", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/108b6f4d3f813299d2cc5df27f92b6b9?width=650", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/23/tinder-for-threesomes-gets-500000-investment/", "http://nypost.com/", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/77dfd1e8a93bbb19c1bf6c765c006342", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:37:24.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
