Anyone with the Samsung Gear phone and the NextVR app downloaded from the Oculus store will be able to participate. This will be the first-ever live news event that can be enjoyed with a virtual headset. This gives every American the opportunity for a front row seat at the CNN debate, even when the seating is all sold out. \nThis opportunity will allow users to see the entire debate from the perspective of an audience member seated in the front row. The viewer will also have the capacity to stay zoomed in on one particular candidate, see what’s going on off-screen, and feel what it’s really like to be a member of the audience in the Las Vegas stadium. \nAccording to a CNN press release: \nThe live stream follows CNN and NextVR’s first virtual reality experience at the CNN Ronald Reagan Debate, where it quietly filmed the highest rated event in CNN history in virtual reality to make it available to users on demand. This experience is now available to users who have a Samsung GearVR virtual reality headset by visiting the NextVR portal in the Oculus Store. Once downloaded, the debate can be seen from the perspective of an audience member at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \nCNN also states that their goal is to ensure that every viewer has the opportunity to get new perspectives on each of the presidential candidates as they view this historical experience through a virtual lens. \nBut this event won’t only be good publicity for CNN. It will also significantly benefit NextVR and their movements to create an even better virtual reality experience. \n“Obviously it’s great for our company because the exposure will be at the first-ever live-to-the-world event in VR,” says Brad Allen, Executive Chairman of NextVR. “Doing it with CNN is phenomenal. They’re the best in the business.” \nThis event will be historic, but we won’t know how good the experience will be until the big moment. VR is still in the very early stages of development, and it hasn’t always been a good experience. \nHowever, NextVR brings something new to the realm of virtual reality. It’s currently the only VR company that can transmit live, high-definition, 3D virtual reality content over the Internet. The debate will be filmed in 6K resolution rather than the standard 4K, making the experience one of the most life-like in VR tech today. \nBecause NextVR is a leader in the industry, CNN thought that they would be a good partnership. While NextVR is fairly advanced as of now, it’s important to note that it’s still in the early stages of development, and it will likely take some time before the picture and quality will be perfect. \n“It’s still version 1.0,” Allen continues, “it’s not going to be perfect just because there are restrictions at this point in the hardware with the Samsung phones the screens on the phones. The resolution. But it’s only going to get better from here.” \nIn the past, NextVR has done live streaming for things such as sports events, and it has been a pretty positive experience for the viewer. According to one viewer: \nThe screen resolution was crisp, and the action was easy to follow — when it was happening close to one of the five cameras that NextVR had set up around the stadium pitch. However, the fisheye lens made players seem farther away than they actually were when the action drifted. Still, I was able to watch a match from angles I have never seen before. \nThis is the reaction to a fast-paced sports game, but the experience will likely be better for the still debate. When asked about whether or not NextVR has been able to correct any of the issues reported during sporting events, Allen reported. \nOur software is not what the issue is. It’s still in the hardware, sometimes on the camera, sometimes on the mobile devices. But that’s all being improved on. So I would say what you’re looking at now is the worst it’s ever going to be. And already it’s very compelling. It’s going to improve dramatically and very quickly as the hardware catches up to it. \nAllen also reminds us that the developments in VR aren’t that much different than the development of television. When it started, it was on a tiny, black and white screen, but after years of development it’s advanced to color, extremely high resolution, and even in 3D. \nThis kind of technology will hugely influence the tech market. “There’s not a brand in the industry that’s not looking at VR right now,” Allen stated. “It’s like a rocket ship. It’s really amazing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:33:50.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
