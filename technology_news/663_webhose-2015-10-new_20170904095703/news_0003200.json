The awards are part of the NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research program, which supports investigators pursuing bold research projects. \nDonia will search for untapped drug sources in the uncultivated bacteria that live in the human body. Using bacterial gene clusters that are similar to existing pharmaceutical gene clusters, Donia plans to clone and characterize bacterial molecules that behave like drugs and are already conditioned to the human body. \nSeyedsayamdost will study the potential of soil-dwelling bacteria to be the source of future antibiotics, especially as bacterial pathogens have become increasingly resistant to current antibiotics. Soil-dwelling bacteria, which do not infect humans, could lead to effective antibiotics not possible with current and traditional discovery methods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:36:50.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
