You are not allowed to shoot us,\" the group told the three journalists.\nOne of the students approached the Jacaranda FM journalist and struck her with a bottle, before telling her in Sotho, \"Stop filming me you piece of shit. I will fucking kick you in the pussy\".\n'Leave the media alone'\nThe student was then restrained by his peers.\nA News24 journalist was also approached and told she could not take pictures, \"not of Soshanguve\", before going to another student in a Democratic Alliance T-shirt and demanding to see his phone.\nThe other News24 journalist was also threatened and he was told in Sotho, \"Don't fucking take pictures of me\". Other students told the journalists to ignore the threats, claiming the students who made it were drunk. They then instructed their peers \"to leave the media alone\".\nOne of the Shoshanguve students was seen carrying a tyre, for what purpose it was not known, while two others told the three journalists that those that had threatened them were drunk and instructed their two colleagues to leave media alone.\nThey then went into the crowd, sprinkling water as they ran.\nThis was taking place as students at the front of fence stopping them from reaching the Union Buildings began tearing the fence up from the bottom.\nThousands of students had gathered at the Union Buildings on Friday from Pretoria and Johannesburg to protest against high university fees.", "external_links": ["http://whoswho.co.za/jacob-zuma-927", "http://www.Whoswho.co.za/hover.php?uid=927"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:14:37.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
