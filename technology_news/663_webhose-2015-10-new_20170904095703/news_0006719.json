The EU investigation determined that the subsidiary artificially lowered its profits by paying a “very substantial royalty” to another Starbucks subsidiary in Britain for “coffee-roasting know-how.”\nThe EU says the Dutch subsidiary is the only Starbucks unit to pay a royalty for that know-how, which means that a big chunk of its taxable profits are moved to the United Kingdom, where Starbucks hasn’t paid much corporate tax.\nAutomobiles\nToyota recalls\n6.5 million cars\nToyota is recalling 6.5 million vehicles worldwide to fix faulty power window switches that can potentially catch fire, the automaker said Wednesday. It is the fourth recall involving that component since 2009.\nIt’s one of the largest single recalls initiated by the company and brings the number of vehicles affected to 14 million. Toyota said the switches could be replaced in about an hour.\nIn Japan, where about 10 percent of the affected vehicles were sold, two minor fires had been linked to the problem.\nEarnings\nEBay tops\nestimates\nEBay’s third-quarter profit and sales topped analysts’ estimates as more people used the San Jose online marketplace, putting the company on solid ground after its split from PayPal.\nProfit was 43 cents per share on revenue of $2.10 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations. Analysts had forecast earnings of 41 cents per share on $2.09 billion in revenue.\nSales were $2.15 billion in the same period a year earlier, excluding PayPal Holdings Inc.\nAmEx profit\ndrops 16%\nAmerican Express reported a 16 percent drop in profit from a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimates, as the credit card company was hurt by higher expenses and remains under pressure from the strong dollar. The company also cut its full-year forecast.\nAmEx said Wednesday that it had net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.23 billion, down from $1.466 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company earned $1.24 per share compared with $1.40 per share a year earlier.\nShipping\nUPS settles\nfor $1.2 million\nNew York state and some of its local governments will receive $1.2 million from UPS Inc. as part of a multistate settlement following allegations that the shipping company overcharged government customers in 14 states, including California.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the agreement Wednesday. The overall $4 million settlement covers 13 other states and the cities of Washington, New York and Chicago.\nChronicle News Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:12:45.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
