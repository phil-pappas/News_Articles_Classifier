First announced at IFA 2015 in September to much fanfare, the Polaroid Snap delivers the instant simplicity and spontaneity that is synonymous with the brand with a pocket-sized form factor and affordable price point. Ideal for the photography lover on any gift list, the Polaroid Snap combines digital imaging with a Zero Ink® Printing platform to enable users to easily print and share physical photos at the push of a button, while saving their image for easy uploading to a computer and any social media platform. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151026/NY38055 \n\"When we first announced the Polaroid Snap instant digital camera in September, we were overwhelmed by the excitement around the return of classic instant photography, with a modern twist,\" said Scott W. Hardy, President and CEO of Polaroid. \"The Polaroid Snap makes the idea of easily and instantly sharing your memories, a concept that has been part of the Polaroid brand DNA for over 75 years, relevant in the digital age, introducing an entirely new generation to the magic of instant photography. We're excited to bring the camera to market in time for families to capture and share their favorite holiday moments in a whole new way.\" \nSimple, Instantly Striking Design The Polaroid Snap camera's minimalist design features an updated look that incorporates design elements of legacy Polaroid instant cameras, such as the iconic Polaroid Color Spectrum . This is thanks to the efforts and insights of the renowned design firm Ammunition, the studio that was also behind the Polaroid Zip instant photoprinter and Polaroid Cube and Polaroid Cube+ lifestyle action cameras. With the Polaroid Snap, Ammunition created a sense of continuity between classic Polaroid cameras and current Polaroid products such as the Polaroid Zip and Polaroid Cube . Led by industrial designer Robert Brunner, Ammunition is the design studio behind award-winning consumer brands including Adobe, Beats by Dre, Square, Lyft, and Williams-Sonoma. \nUnique Features to Share the Fun The Polaroid Snap is a 10MP digital instant camera with an integrated printer using ZINK® Zero Ink Printing Technology, enabling users to instantly print full color, 2x3\" prints automatically when an image is captured. With its quick print abilities, consumers can shoot new images even while the Polaroid Snap is printing. Additionally, the camera features a Micro SD card slot that holds up to 32GB to save and easily transfer and upload images to a computer, cloud service or social media platform. With a clean and minimalist design, the Polaroid Snap offers a truly unique feature set including different capture modes--color, black and white and vintage Polaroid photo inspired . The camera also features a photo booth mode, which takes four quick pictures in a few seconds, and the option of printing with or without the Polaroid Classic Border Logo format. These features enable users to easily add their own enhancements to the print before they even take their photo. Users can also take the perfect instant selfie thanks to the camera's self-timer feature. \nZINK Zero Ink® Printing The Polaroid Snap instant digital camera uses the revolutionary ink-free Zero Ink® Printing technology developed by ZINK. The ZINK-enabled Printer uses heat to activate and colorize cyan, yellow and magenta dye crystals embedded in the paper. The result is full-color, high quality, long-lasting and smudge-proof images without ink cartridges, ribbons or toner. \nThe 2X3\" photo prints in just under a minute so consumers can instantly share the photo with their friends and family. Additionally, because ZINK Paper® is adhesive backed the photo can be used as a sticker as well. \nOffered by C&A Marketing, an authorized Polaroid licensee, the Polaroid Snap instant digital camera is currently available in black, white, red and blue for $99.99 at www.polaroidsnapcamera.com .
