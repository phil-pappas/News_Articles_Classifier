In March 2015 , Chi-Med announced that the first POC study of fruquintinib in patients with mCRC clearly met its primary endpoint of progression free survival (\"PFS\") by demonstrating superiority compared with placebo. Fruquintinib was well tolerated in this study, showing no major unexpected safety issues and a safety profile consistent with that of its class.\nThe POC study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase II clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib plus best supportive care against placebo plus best supportive care in mCRC patients who had failed at least 2 prior lines of chemotherapy, including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Patients were randomised at a 2:1 ratio to receive either 5 mg of fruquintinib orally once per day on a three-weeks-on, one-week-off schedule or placebo. Treatment was given in 28-day cycles until disease progressed or non-tolerable toxicity occurred. Tumour assessments were conducted using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial was PFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response rate, disease control rate and overall survival. Safety endpoints included adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram measurements. Data was analysed up to 11 February 2015 , approximately six months after the last patient had been enrolled.\n71 patients were enrolled in the trial, of which 47 were enrolled into the fruquintinib arm and 24 into the placebo arm. Patient baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment arms. The median fruquintinib exposure was 84 days whereas the median was 21 days in the placebo arm. Median PFS was 4.73 months in the fruquintinib arm compared with 0.99 month in the placebo arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (p 27 September 2015 at the European Cancer Congress and will then be made available at http://chi-med.com/eng/irinfo/presentations.htm :\nTitle: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase II clinical trial of fruquintinib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.\nAuthors: Jin Li , et al.\nAbstract: #2111\nSession: Gastrointestinal Malignancies - Colorectal Cancer\nDate & Time: Sunday 27 September 2015 , 09:15 AM-11:15 AM\nThe European Cancer Congress, organised by the European Society for Medical Oncology and the European Cancer Organisation this year, is the largest European multidisciplinary oncology platform for presenting data to a global audience.\nAbout fruquintinib\nFruquintinib is designed to selectively inhibit VEGF receptors, namely VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. Angiogenesis is an important mechanism in tumour pathogenesis, and inhibition of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis has been important in the treatment of a variety of cancers.\nIn October 2013 , HMP entered into a licensing, co-development and commercialisation agreement with Eli Lilly for fruquintinib.\nFirst POC Phase II Study in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer - In April 2014 , HMP initiated the first POC Phase II study of fruquintinib in 71 patients, which was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase II clinical trial targeted at patients with mCRC. The detailed results of this study were described above in this announcement.\nSecond POC Phase II Study in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer - In June 2014 , HMP initiated the second POC Phase II study of fruquintinib in 91 patients, which was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase II clinical trial targeted at patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Chi-Med reported the top line results of this study on 2 September 2015 , which showed that fruquintinib had clearly met the primary endpoint of PFS with no unexpected safety issues.\nPhase III Study in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer - In December 2014 , HMP initiated FRESCO, a Phase III registration study in patients with mCRC, who have failed at least two prior systemic cancer therapies, including flouropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. HMP plans to enrol more than 400 patients in about 25 centres across China for this study, with top-line results expected in 2016.\nPhase Ib Study in Combination with Paclitaxel - In early 2015, HMP initiated a Phase Ib dose-finding study of fruquintinib, in combination with paclitaxel, in second line gastric cancer patients.\nDetailed results of these clinical trials were presented or will be presented at the annual meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology and can be found at http://chi-med.com/eng/irinfo/presentations.htm .\nAbout Chi-Med\nChi-Med is a China -based globally-focused healthcare group which researches, develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceuticals and health-related consumer products.
