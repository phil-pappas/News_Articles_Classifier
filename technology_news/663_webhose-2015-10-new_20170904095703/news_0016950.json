Together with these new customers we brainstormed about our communicating process and how to improve that, this resulted in the 3 steps IMMP;\nIn short we described this 3-step IMMP:\nFirst step is the designed part analyse and quotation, we will analyse the parts on wall thickness, tapers, in one word on feasible for the molding technology, but also the quantities of request, egg how many parts have to be produced per month or year. In this way we can determine the best tool steel and number of cavities or of we need to make family molds. (in order to safe mold costs) Of course we will present this in a nice presentation during a (skype) meeting.\nThe second step is mold design ad review: In this phase we will draw the model drawing with 3d cad software and present and discuss the parting lines sprue point and ejector lines.\nThe third step is the mold building process and the first test, here we will give weekly updates of the molding making process, so our customers can see the progress.\nThis new process is a game changer for Chinese injection molding makers and their services and it dissolves the current customerâ€™s dissatisfaction with their old suppliers.\nFor more information contact CEO Roger van der Linden\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
