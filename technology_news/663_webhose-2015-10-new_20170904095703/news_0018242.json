October 8, 2015 WASHINGTON — EPA’s Pesticides website has a new look, feel, and address. Many of EPA's stakeholders have noticed the agency's gradual move to new versions of its content as part of the larger EPA effort to build a more user-friendly website. EPA reports that with the new pesticides website, information should now be easier than ever to access, regardless of the type of electronic device they use, including tablets and smartphones. With the transition to the new site completed, web page addresses will be different. This may cause links and bookmarks to break and EPA is working to fix any broken links on our website. The majority of the old pesticide pages will redirect to the new web areas, but EPA encourages users to update theirbookmarks. EPA's new “Page Not Found” notification will help users find what they are looking for by providing suggested search terms, links to our A-Z index, and other helpful links. If users have trouble locating information, try using the search feature available on every EPA web page and in the archive (archive.epa.gov).
