The newspaper says the Hawaii circuit court granted a partial motion for summary judgment, according to a joint statement issued late Friday by state Attorney General Douglas Chin and state Board of Land and Natural Resources Chairwoman Suzanne Case . The state land board approved the emergency rule after a heated July 10 public meeting. The rule prohibited being within a mile of the Mauna Kea access road between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., unless in a moving vehicle. The rule also prohibited, at any time, sleeping bags, camping stoves, tens and propane burners on the mountain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:58:55.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
