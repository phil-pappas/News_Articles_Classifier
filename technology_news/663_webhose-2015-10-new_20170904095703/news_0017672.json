Unplug the phone from computer before you boot it into recovery mode. \nStep 3: Boot the phone into recovery mode using the Quick Boot app from play store, which requires root. Alternatively, you can manually boot into recovery mode as follows: Turn off the phone and wait for 5 to 10 seconds until it shuts down completely. Press and hold Volume Down and Power buttons together and release them once the bootloader screen appears. Hit Volume Down button twice and then tap the Power button to boot into recovery mode. \nIn recovery mode, you can access TWRP recovery. Otherwise, if you only have access to 3e stock recovery then you need to install TWRP recovery first. \nStep 4: Take a backup of your device via TWRP recovery. Hit Backup , and then choose all the partitions for back up. Perform a clean swipe from the bottom of the screen to start creating a backup for emergency purpose. \nStep 5: Now perform a Wipe data / Factory Reset . Go to TWRP's main menu > select Wipe, and then do a Swipe from the bottom to confirm the action. \nStep 6: Just Unmount System and go back to TWRP's mount menu, where you need to uncheck the System option, so that it's not mounted when we flash the ROM. \nStep 7: Return to TWRP's home screen and tap on Install button. Then locate the ROM zip file which you downloaded earlier and tap on it. Then do the Swipe as you did before, to begin flashing the update. \nStep 8: Hit the Home button to return to the recovery home screen. Now, repeat step 7 to install the Gapps as well on your LG Optimus G. \nStep 9: Wait until Gapps is installed and then tap on Reboot system button to restart the device. \nYour Optimus G is now running the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow update via AOSP ROM. \n[ Source: XDA ] More about Android Marshmallow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:09:40.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
