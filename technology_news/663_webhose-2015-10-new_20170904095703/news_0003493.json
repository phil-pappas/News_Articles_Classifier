(NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today announced that the Russian Ministry of Health has approved the Marketing Authorization license (MA) for three-times-a-week COPAXONE ® (glatiramer acetate injection) 40 mg/mL, a new dose of COPAXONE ® , for the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This formulation of COPAXONE ® will allow for a less frequent dosing regimen for patients with RRMS in Russia. \n\"For more than 20 years, Teva has been committed to safe and tolerable treatments options for patients with multiple sclerosis. The availability of three-times-a-week COPAXONE ® 40 mg/mL is a significant advancement for the multiple sclerosis patient community in Russia,\" said Rob Koremans, MD, President and CEO of Global Specialty Medicines at Teva. \"The new three-times-a-week COPAXONE ® 40 mg/mL is the same therapy that patients and physicians know and trust with almost 60 percent fewer injections per year compared to the current daily COPAXONE ® 20 mg/mL formulation. In the U.S., for example, more than 70 percent of patients currently receiving glatiramer acetate treatment are receiving the COPAXONE ® 40 mg/mL formulation.\" \nThe Russian Ministry of Health approval was based primarily on data from the Phase III Glatiramer Acetate Low-Frequency Administration (GALA) study. In the GALA study, which included more than 1,400 patients, the 40 mg/ml dosage of COPAXONE ® administered subcutaneously three times per week significantly reduced relapse rates at 12 months and demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in patients with RRMS. \nDaily COPAXONE ® 20 mg, approved in Russia in 2010, continues to be available in Russia. \nAbout COPAXONE ® \nCOPAXONE ® (glatiramer acetate injection) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The most common side effects of COPAXONE ® are redness, pain, swelling, itching, or a lump at the site of injection, flushing, rash, shortness of breath, and chest pain. See additional important information at: www.CopaxonePrescribingInformation.com . For hardcopy releases, please see enclosed full prescribing information. The COPAXONE ® brand is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide, including the United States, Russia, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Israel, and all European countries. \nImportant Safety Information about COPAXONE ® \nPatients allergic to glatiramer acetate or mannitol should not take COPAXONE ® . Some patients report a short-term reaction right after injecting COPAXONE ® . This reaction can involve flushing (feeling of warmth and/or redness), chest tightness or pain with heart palpitations, anxiety, and trouble breathing. These symptoms generally appear within minutes of an injection, last about 15 minutes, and go away by themselves without further problems. During the postmarketing period, there have been reports of patients with similar symptoms who received emergency medical care. If symptoms become severe, patients should call the emergency phone number in their area. Patients should call their doctor right away if they develop hives, skin rash with irritation, dizziness, sweating, chest pain, trouble breathing, or severe pai at the injection site. If any of the above occurs, patients should not give themselves any more injections until their doctor tells them to begin again. Chest pain may occur either as part of the immediate post injection reaction or on its own. This pain should only last a few minutes. Patients may experience more than one such episode, usually beginning at least one month after starting treatment. Patients should tell their doctor if they experience chest pain that lasts for a long time or feels very intense. A permanent indentation under the skin (lipoatrophy or, rarely, necrosis) at the injection site may occur, due to local destruction of fat tissue. Patients should follow proper injection technique and inform their doctor of any skin changes. The most common side effects of COPAXONE ® are redness, pain, swelling, itching, or a lump at the site of injection, flushing, rash, shortness of breath, and chest pain. These are not all of the possible side effects of COPAXONE ® . For a complete list, patients should ask their doctor or pharmacist. Patients should tell their doctor about any side effects they have while taking COPAXONE ® . Patients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
