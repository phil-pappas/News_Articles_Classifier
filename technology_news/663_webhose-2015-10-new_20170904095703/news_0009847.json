The donation comes in the form of a grant supplied for academics as part of The Lefkofsky Scholar Initiative, funded by the Lefkofsky Family Foundation . It aims to provide brand new and unique opportunities to students whose research into curing cancer is considered particularly distinctive or unconventional. \nLiz and Eric Lefkofsky are proud to be a part of these accelerating medical developments. Successful studies from the initiative that demonstrate outstanding progress in the elimination of cancer will lead to wider and more nationally-funded research in the future. Grants will be awarded through the Liz and Eric Lefkofsky Innovation Awards to six students, who will then be recognized as Liz and Eric Lefkofsky Scholars. The first round of awards was given out this year, and the researchers have until next year to report on progress made over the next six months. In April, The Lefkofsky Committee will increase the duration of the research projects if they can show to have exceptional promise in the future. The students will each receive $75,000 over a two- to three-year period to allow maximum time and energy into thought-provoking and innovative research that is needed to further eliminate the disease. This year, one particular focus was on the development of an inexpensive blood test to help recognize the early stages of pancreatic cancer, where the intention is for it to be made available in routine clinical care. \nLiz and Eric Lefkofsky are both trustees and members of several committees that contribute to health, education, arts and human rights, including The Art Institute of Chicago, Lurie Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Urban Education Institute and World Business Chicago. Since its establishment in 2006, the Lefkofsky Family Foundation has helped hundreds of different organizations around the world. In 2013, Liz and Eric Lefkofsky became members of The Giving Pledge, promising to donate at least half of their wealth over their lifetimes for these causes. \nAbout Lefkofsky Family Foundation \nThe Lefkofsky Family Foundation is a private charitable foundation that was established in 2006 by Liz and Eric Lefkofsky.
