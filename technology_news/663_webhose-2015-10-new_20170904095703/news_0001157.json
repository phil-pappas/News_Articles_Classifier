Despite fears that the demand for tablets is over, US consumers shopping for a high-tech present this year are more likely to plump for Apple's latest slate than any other device. \nThe second most popular tech gift is destined to be a set of Bose QuietComfort 25 Noise Cancelling Headphones, while the top three is rounded out by the MacBook. \nHowever, it's not just Apple products that are getting consumers excited, the sixth most popular gift is the Microsoft Surface, and Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2 tablet is in ninth place, just ahead of the Dyson V6 vacuum cleaner in 10th place. \nTelevisions are also going to be in demand this holiday season with two models also featuring in the top 10; Samsung's 48-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD TV in fourth and Sharp's 43-inch smart HDTV with Roku in fifth. \nBest Buy polled 2000 Americans aged between 18 and 65 to compile its holiday wishlist and discovered that regardless of the device, technology products are going to be in huge demand as the year draws to a close. \nFor example, Millennials rate consumer electronics as their preferred type of gift favoring gadgets over clothes or jewelry. \nBut men of all ages are planning on giving and are hoping to receive a high-tech gift. When asked why, 22% of men said that tech gifts were more personal. Meanwhile women who are planning on making a tech purchase are more likely to do so for non-gifting reasons such as a personal investment or to replace an existing family device. \nHowever, 85% of respondents also admitted that they're likely to take advantage of holiday season deals, sales and discounts in order to buy themselves a new tech device. And as with the wishlist, the iPad comes top (19%), followed by a Sharp 43-inch Smart HDTV with Roku (chosen by 16% planning on treating themselves) and a set of Bose QuietComfort 25 Noise Cancelling Headphones (15%). \nThe top 10 tech gifts, according to Best Buy:1. iPad2.
