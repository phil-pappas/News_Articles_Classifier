Louise Kennerley by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Remember Reckon Ltd?\nBack before New Zealand's Xero was a noisy but fast growing upstart and when $2 billion sounded like a lot of money to pay for MYOB, Reckon was the accounting software sector's great hope for small cap fund managers.\nThe theory was always that Reckon, which provides desktop and cloud-based business management software under the Reckon Accounts brand, would be acquired by its then-$US20 billion United States backer Intuit.\nThat all fell apart when Reckon stopped distributing Intuit's Quicken/QuickBooks products in February 2014 and eventually bought back the US giant's 11.5 per cent equity stake later that year.\nSince then, Reckon has faced life on its own. Its shares have traded at and around the $2 mark and more attention has been directed at its noisy - and sometimes quarrelsome - rivals Xero and MYOB, which are now both worth more than $2 billion.\nBrokers have flicked the stock into the \"hold\" basket and small cap fundies have started digging elsewhere.\nHowever, Street Talk understands Reckon's hasn't gone unnoticed by at least one potential suitor. The company - headed by straight-shooting chief executive Clive Rabie - has a steady recurring revenue stream and is working on the rollout of an online model, Reckon One.\nSources said Reckon had been approached by a private equity or trade player in recent times and the company had turned to Macquarie Capital for some advice and defensive support.\n Perpetual Investments would loom as a key voice in any deal. The fund is a long-time supporter of the stock and retains a 15 per cent stake. Other major backers include UK-based Highclere International Investors, which also holds stakes in Australia's Webjet and Orotongroup, along with UniSuper and Rabie, who owns almost 10 per cent.\nNone of these investors would be expected to part with their stock for much less than $2.50 a share, which would value Reckon at almost $300 million.\nInterestingly, Reckon had independent expert Grant Thornton value the business 16-months ago when it selectively bought back Intuit's stake. Grant Thornton valued the company at $2.05 to $2.15 a share, which represented about 6.5-times one-year forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:14:42.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
