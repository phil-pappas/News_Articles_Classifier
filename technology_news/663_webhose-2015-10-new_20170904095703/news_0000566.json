They appear black because they absorb all the colours of sunlight and reflect none while they appear white because they don’t absorb any of the wavelengths of the visible spectrum and scatter all. Did you know that a material made from carbon nanotubes holds the world record for blackness? This material when layered approximately to a thickness of one mm absorbs 99.8 percent of light! But recently it has come to the notice that a nano-material made of gold and consisting of miniscule hammer-like shapes has succeeded in achieving nearly as much blackness. And what’s more… it was also discovered that with a small addition it can even reflect any colour that one wants to. Inspired by beetles, whose beautiful thin shells reflect all wavelengths of light and thus make them appear whiter than any artificial material, Andrea Fratalocchi at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia; thought of discovering the phenomena that was just reverse of this beetle effect. In this quest, he designed a theoretical system involving a tiny concave shell attached to an infinitely long tube designed to guide waves. If it was practically possible to build such structure light when entered the shell and travelled along the tube would never be seen again. Fratalocchi then approximated this design with gold nanorods and using plasmonics (materials that bend light along different paths). At a thickness of a hundredth of a millimetre, he found that the material absorbed 98.43 percent of light. This is a very high level of absorption and implies that this material could be painted onto other surfaces to turn light into heat.
