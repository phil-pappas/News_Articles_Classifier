Ninety eight percent of respondents said CX was a strategic priority, with committed senior executives leading their efforts, but almost 70 percent said their firm’s CX strategy was not aligned with overall company strategy. Specifically, 50 percent of respondents said improving the customer experience was their top strategic priority in 2015. A further 48 percent said it was a strategic priority, but not the number one priority. This emphasis was not new: 54 percent of respondents said improving customer experience had been a strategic priority for at least three years. However, the survey revealed that organisations have a poor record of achieving this strategic priority. In particular, they they do little to understand their customers. “All successful CX transformations start with understanding your customer,” Forrester said. “Yet only 10 percent of respondents reported that their firms systemically apply practices that create a consistent, shared understanding of who their customers are, what they want and need, and how they perceive their interactions with the organisation.” “With customer understanding largely limited to segmentation data, Australian firms lack the most important ingredient in delivering quality CX,” Forrester concluded. “Until they know what they currently don’t know, their CX efforts will have limited impact on the business.” And Forrester was fairly damning of organisations’ efforts to really understand customers. “The majority of respondents collect operational data and data on how customers perceive their interactions with the firm, but only 21 percent attempt to create models to determine which drivers of CX quality matter most to their customers and how those drivers change across key customer groups and customer journeys.” Forrester sees much of the problem being due to lack of a customer-focussed culture in most organisations. “Only 54 percent of respondents indicated that their firms systemically communicate the importance of CX to employees and only 22 percent systemically train their employees to build and maintain the skills they need to deliver on the firm’s CX promise. On top of that, relatively few firms systematically screen employment candidates for specific CX-related values (20 percent) and skills (17 percent) as part of the hiring and selection process or connect formal reward structures to performance on CX metrics.” Seems some major organisations need some major cultural change. \nPremier Technologies \nPremier Contact Point provides a hosted contact solution that meets the needs of the modern contact centre.
