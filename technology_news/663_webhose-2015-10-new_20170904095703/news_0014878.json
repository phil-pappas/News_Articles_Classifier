A majority of respondents (44.9 per cent) expect to retire in the U.S. much greater than the number of participants who intend to return to their home country (18 per cent). Respondents 55 years and older were most likely to say they don't have plans to retire but rather \"plan to work until I drop.\"\n\nThe online survey of 510 people was fielded August 14-16, 2015. To qualify, participants needed to have come to America for employment opportunities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:05:14.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
