This is the first BPCIA suit to reach the courts after completion of the BPCIA’s pre-suit information exchange, the so-called patent dance. On October 5, 2015, Apotex filed its Answer with Counterclaims . Despite agreeing on which patents should be the subject of immediate patent infringement litigation under the BPCIA, Apotex now alleges that Amgen’s suit on one of those patents is sham litigation in violation of the Sherman Act: Despite the conclusive and irrefutable proof provided to [Amgen as part of the information exchange] that the method of producing Apotexs Pegfilgrastim Product covered by Apotex’s BLA does not and cannot infringe Amgen’s ‘138 patent, [Amgen] nonetheless filed this lawsuit which included an objectively baseless claim alleging infringement of the ‘138 patent . . . for the purpose of significantly delaying Apotex’s entry into relevant markets. \nApotex also raisesseveral patent- and BPCIA-specific declaratory judgment counterclaims. As to the ‘138 patent, Apotex seeks declarations of noninfringement and invalidity as well as a declaration of unenforceability due to patent misuse. As to the BPCIA, Apotex seeks declarations that a notice of commercial marketing under 42 U.S.C. § 262( l )(8)(A) is not mandatory ( i.e. , that non-compliance is subject only to the consequences of 42 U.S.C. § 262( l )(9)(B)), and that no injunctive relief is available for failure to comply with the notice of commercial marketing provision. \nPatterson Belknap Webb Tyler LLP | Attorney Advertising Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: * (Updated: Oct : \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through Information Collection and Use by JD Supra \nreceive e-mail updates and newsletters by selecting the \"opt-out of future email\" option in the email they receive from JD Supra or in their JD Supra account management screen.
