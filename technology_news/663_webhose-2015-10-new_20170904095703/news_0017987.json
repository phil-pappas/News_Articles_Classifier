He has also worked as a Senior Manager in Ernst & Young’s Financial Accounting Advisory Services (FAAS) practice in New York and Washington DC, where he managed large, complex accounting and financial reporting engagements, which included projects related to the implementation of the pending new revenue recognition and lease accounting guidance. Additionally, he has advised clients on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), International Financial Reporting Systems (IFRS) and U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting matters concerning cross-border and other transactions while working for Ernst & Young’s Capital Markets group in London. Adam has also worked at the SEC in the Division of Corporation Finance.\nThe new revenue standard will create a single revenue recognition model for IFRS and U.S. GAAP that will be applied across many industries and capital markets. It will replace all existing U.S. GAAP revenue literature with implementation requiring significant effort and having wide-ranging impacts throughout an organization, including accounting, IT, financial planning, tax, legal, and sales, to name a few.\n***\nAbout CrossCountry Consulting CrossCountry Consulting is an independent advisory firm providing performance improvement, finance and accounting, risk and technology consulting services.
