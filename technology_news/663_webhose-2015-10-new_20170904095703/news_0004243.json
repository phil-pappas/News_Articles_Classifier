After giving back 6.8 million shares, Dorsey will still own 15 million Twitter shares.\nDorsey's remaining stake will be worth about $460 million, based on Twitter's current market value.\nTwitter's stock gained 5 percent to $30.63 in Friday's afternoon trading.\nThe shares have declined by 40 percent in the past six months amid concerns about Twitter's inability to make money.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
