Some details of the purported emails have surfaced in the Philadelphia Daily News. \n\"Members of the Supreme Court are disturbed by the content of the emails, as reported by the media,\" the state Supreme Court said in the statement. \nA lawyer the courts hired last year to look into revelations of email swapping between prosecutors and justices did not have some of the Eakin emails that were in a batch Kane's office provided last month to the Supreme Court and to the Pennsylvania agency that investigates judicial misconduct, the high court said. \nA number of the emails \"were not made available\" by Kane's office last year, the courts said. \nIn the previous review last year, the court-appointed lawyer, Robert L. Byer, reported seeing nothing inappropriate and the Judicial Conduct Board dropped its complaint against Eakin. \nThe Judicial Conduct Board says it is investigating Eakin's emails again, while the courts have hired the Pittsburgh-based law firm Del Sole Cavanaugh Stroyd for a second review. \nEakin, 66, a Republican and a former Cumberland County prosecutor, has said he would cooperate with the board's investigation. He did not respond to a request for comment Monday at his suburban Harrisburg office. \nIn recent days, the Philadelphia Daily News has reported that it obtained copies of what appeared to be some of Eakin's emails. It described them as pornographic, or as mocking gays, women, blacks or Mexicans. Several were exchanged between Eakin and a top state prosecutor, it reported. \nThe newspaper did not say how it had obtained the emails. \nOn Monday, a Kane spokesman said the Judicial Conduct Board might not have seen every email exchange in last year's review because the attorney general's office had not transferred all of Eakin's emails from its servers into an \"electronic vault\" before board investigators ended their review. However, spokesman Chuck Ardo said, the attorney general's office believes Byer did see all the emails. \nKane's office has said her office submitted Eakin's emails to the courts and the Judicial Conduct Board late last month, suggesting that the emails raised questions about Eakin's fitness for office. \nIt said it did so after reviewing the emails in response to a Sept. 11 request from the Philadelphia Daily News for emails from Eakin's Yahoo account. \nThe board's 2014 investigation of Eakin began after the Daily News reported last October that he had received two pornographic emails and one racially offensive email at his Yahoo email address in 2010. One of Eakin's colleagues, Justice Seamus McCaffery, retired shortly after that after The Morning Call of Allentown revealed his role in the email exchanges with state prosecutors and agents. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:34:09.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
