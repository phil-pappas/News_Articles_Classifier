It’s a big thing not to talk to your wife about.”\n Speculation swirled that West made the shocking announcement during his VMAs acceptance speech on a whim, but Kardashian was unable to clarify whether the decision was spontaneous.\n“I don’t know if that was planned and I just didn’t know about it or if he came up with that idea right then and there,” the expectant mum explained. “[But] I think it would be so much fun to be in the White House.”\nWest asserts his announcement was not a joke, telling Vanity Fair earlier this month: “I didn’t approach that because I thought it would be fun … No, the exact opposite … I’m like, ‘Wow, I’ve got five years before I go and run for office and I’ve got a lot of research to do … a lot of growing up to do.’”\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post .\n Kanye didn’t tell Kim about presidential run", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/kanye-west-didnt-talk-to-kim-kardashian-about-presidential-run-before-announcing-it/story-fn907478-1227551646777?sv=35d4b4b371d5e424136489ea532a00e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/53a797ae560a5bddc3e0442cf43cf57f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d138d438c3b7dfb32d133df0ae27db13", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/00f6e5811323f1f1ceb0a3d1da65f9b8", "http://pagesix.com/2015/09/30/kim-kardashian-had-no-clue-kanye-west-would-announce-presidential-run/?_ga=1.159796281.508204345.1381948382", "http://pagesix.com/2015/08/30/kanye-west-delivers-most-epic-awards-show-acceptance-speech-ever/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/38fd45c0db546bdb46ced3808f13425b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a061396fcc23b8fe7c23afcea6278329", "http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2015/09/kanye-west-yeezy-season-2-interview", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rlgs90YCVOc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f0e9a7991b42fab85ac20025cc64c16e", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlgs90YCVOc", "http://pagesix.com/tag/kim-kardashian/", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-01T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:32:04.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
