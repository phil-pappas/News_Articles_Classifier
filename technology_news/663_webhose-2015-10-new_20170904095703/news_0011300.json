Upgrading to EMV-ready point of sale terminals is the best way for small business owners to protect themselves and their customers from fraud. As ETA testified before the Small Business Committee at its first EMV hearing, we are working in partnership with our merchant customers to deploy chip card readers and upgrade point of sale systems. \nCyber-breaches hit a record high in 2014 with reported incidents jumping 28% over the previous year. The payments industry is deploying a multi-layered defense that includes EMV to answer the threat. We’re also deploying tokenization, which replaces account information with single-use tokens that cannot be intercepted, and end-to-end encryption technology, so retailers can secure all points of entry into systems that store’s financial information. Together with next generation biometrics, these new tools will help wipe out fraud.” \nFor media inquires, contact Meghan Cieslak, 202-677-7406, mcieslak@electran.org or Cortney Piper at 865-789-2669 , cortney@piper-communications.com \nAbout ETA The Electronic Transactions Association (ETA) is the global trade association representing more than 550 payments and technology companies.
