Credit: Derek Onley \nFlinders University researchers have contributed to the discovery of a new species of shorebird with the discovery of fossils in Central Otago, New Zealand. \nThe extinct bird dates from a time when New Zealand was covered in subtropical forests and crocodiles roamed parts of the South Island, and is a \"missing link\" in evolutionary terms. \nIn a paper published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology , New Zealand and Australian-based scientists have confirmed that the 19 to 16 million-year-old shorebird fossils belong to a group which had been thought to only comprise the Australian Plains-wanderer, one of Australia's most endangered birds , and the South American seedsnipes. \nThe new species , Hakawai melvillei, has been named after New Zealand ornithologist David Melville to honour his efforts in the conservation of migratory shorebirds. \nLead author Dr Venesa De Pietri, formerly of Flinders and now a Canterbury Museum researcher, says that the team were excited to discover that the fossil shorebird was not a typical wader, but more like an ancestral Plains-wanderer, with some seedsnipe-like features. The Plains-wanderer and seedsnipes are unusual shorebirds as they have adapted well to living on the land. \n\"We're happy to have found a fossil bird that provides a key morphological link between the two groups. The discovery of Hakawai melvillei has confirmed our thinking that the ancestors of the Plains-wanderer and seedsnipes were wading birds, like most other shorebirds,\" she says. \n\"It has also confirmed previous research I've undertaken, with colleagues, that the Plains-wanderer and seedsnipes evolved their terrestrial habits independently.\" \nThe discovery sheds light on evolutionary processes at work when South America, Antarctica, Australia, and New Zealand were part of the southern supercontinent of Gondwana. Hakawai melvillei, the Australian Plains-wanderer and the South American seedsnipe are all thought to have originated in East Gondwana. \nThe Hakawai melvillei probably became endemic to (only occurring in) New Zealand when it drifted apart from the rest of Gondwana. \nFlinders University's Dr Trevor Worthy, who led the study, said the discovery adds to an emerging story of New Zealand's important role in the evolution of birds in the Southern Hemisphere. \n\"Unfortunately, like crocodiles, turtles, and some tropical birds, which once inhabited New Zealand, the lineage represented by Hakawai melvillei is long gone,\" Dr Worthy said. \n\"We're not sure what happened, but climatic and geographic changes during that time may have been partly responsible for its demise.\" New Zealand's kiwi probably started out an Aussie, study finds December 17, 2013 \nIn a finding likely to be a bitter blow for many New Zealanders, researchers have found the country's iconic kiwi bird probably descended from an ancestor that flew in from Australia. Ancient DNA ends Aussie claim to kiwi origins May 22, 2014 \nAustralia can no longer lay claim to the origins of the iconic New Zealand kiwi following University of Adelaide research published in the journal Science today showing the kiwi's closest relative is not the emu as was previously ... Australia's laughing kookaburra among birds in decline: study July 15, 2015 \nPopulations of some of Australia's iconic birds—including the laughing kookaburra, magpie and willie wagtail—are in decline in parts of the country, according to a report released Wednesday, with habitat loss, feral cats ... Fossil pollen grains found in Antarctica push back evolutionary history of daisy family August 12, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers with affiliations to research facilities in Argentina, the U.K. and New Zealand, has confirmed that fossilized pollen grains found in Antarctica are members of the flowering plant family ... Marksmen kill endangered species in New Zealand bird cull August 21, 2015 \nA bird cull on a New Zealand island has been abruptly halted after marksmen killed four rare takahe, an endangered species with only 300 known to exist, officials said Friday.

Biodiversity stabilizes ecosystems during climate extremes October 14, 2015 \nCan biodiversity help protect ecosystems from extreme conditions? That question is much on the minds of scientists and policy makers as a changing climate brings more wildly swinging conditions at the same time human activities ... Deadly bacteria stiff-arm the immune system October 14, 2015 \nThe most severe Group A Streptococcus (strep) infections are often the work of one particularly nefarious strain known as M1T1, named in part for the type of tentacle-like M protein projecting from the bacterium's surface. ... Divorce in birds is affected by their social group October 14, 2015 \nWhether a pair of birds will divorce or stay together after they first breed is influenced by the social environment in which the relationship is formed, according to a new study by researchers from Oxford University. Mutational 'hot spot' leads to adaptation in high-altitude birds October 14, 2015 \nNew research led by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of New Mexico has pinpointed changes in a single, mutation-prone gene site that ultimately allow wrens to breathe easy in the rarefied air of the Andes. Four biological kingdoms influence disease transmission in monarch butterflies October 13, 2015 \nExperiments with monarch butterfly caterpillars and the milkweed plants on which they feed have shown for the first time that interactions across four biological kingdoms can influence disease transmission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:38:59.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
