Work is expected to begin by the end of 2015, according to the Journal of Commerce. \nThe decision for the project came after the Russian government drew up projections of a 15% increase in volumes for the Baltic region per year until 2018. \nThe port is intended to be a regional feeder hub and may reach a depth of 19.2 metres. A draft this deep will enable it to surpass its rivals in Gdansk, Klaipeda, Poland and Lithuania. \nThe total cost of the project is expected to be around US$950 million, of which around $750-800 million is anticipated to come from private investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:51:58.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
