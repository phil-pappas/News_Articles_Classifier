Moki will also preview a prototype of a new turnkey solution for point-of-decision kiosks to potential brand and retail partners during Luxury Interactive, Oct. 13-15 at the Time & Life Building in New York City. On Wednesday, October 14 at 9:20 a.m., Ty Allen, Moki co-founder, will offer a presentation entitled “Bring the Power of eCommerce Into Brick-And-Mortar Retail with Customer Facing Devices.” Later that day, at 12:10 p.m., Eric Johnson, Moki co-founder, will host a roundtable with the same title. Luxury Interactive attendees can learn how customer facing digital devices can turn stores into a powerful digital channel for brands and retailers, and gain perspectives from across the industry on the topic. With unique insight into current and upcoming initiatives of companies looking to deliver digital and interactive experiences on in-store devices, Johnson will discuss the trends and successes of businesses who are delivering an eCommerce-like experience in their physical store locations.\n“It is entirely possible for brands and retailers to use in-store devices to deliver the same type of rich, personalized experiences that consumers have come to expect from shopping on the web,” said Tom Karren, Moki’s CEO and co-founder. “Events such as Luxury Interactive enable us to get up close and personal with marketers from some of the world’s most reputable brands to demonstrate how Moki can help them create, manage and get the most out of these devices. These intimate events also help us better understand the challenges brands face as they compete for the attention of today’s mobile consumers.”\nThroughout the show, the Moki leadership team will demonstrate current and soon-to-launch products such as their highly configurable kiosk prototype designed to bridge the online and in-store divide for retailers, enabling potential partners to emerge from Luxury Interactive with concrete options and a clear vision for deploying kiosks of the future in their own locations. Demonstrations will include Moki’s flagship product, Moki Total Control, which offers complete remote management of customer facing devices, helping clients deploy, lock down, manage, update and measure usage of in-store devices and Moki’s recently announced advanced customer engagement analytics platform, Moki Insights, which enables real-time analysis and dynamic adjustment of in-store marketing campaigns through unsurpassed views into device usage.\nAbout Moki\nPowering Digital Experiences on Customer Facing Devices, Moki’s cloud-based software provides digital solutions for Customer Facing Devices.
