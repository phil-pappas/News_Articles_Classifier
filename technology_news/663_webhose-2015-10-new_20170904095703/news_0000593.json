CISA helps our member companiesâ€™ defend against cyberattacks by providing limited legal liability protection for voluntarily sharing information about cyber threats. CISA is a crucial part of the process to reduce fraudulent cyber attacks. CISA creates an early warning system for companies of all sizes in all sectors as fraud schemes begin to develop. \nTwo amendments, however, would weaken CISA and the majority of our members urge you to oppose them. Leahy Amendment 2587- would severely weaken or eliminate the ability of businesses to appeal to any FOIA protections when sharing cyber threat information. Making public the name of a company that shared cyber threat information would have a chilling effect on the whole program. Franken Amendment 2612- narrows and muddles the definition of cyber threat information, resulting in extended litigation over definitions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:54:42.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
