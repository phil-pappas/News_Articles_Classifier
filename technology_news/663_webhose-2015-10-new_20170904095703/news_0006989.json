Escamilla then calmly walked up to James and pumped three more shots into the back of his head before running and exchanging shots with other officers, witnesses said. A wounded Escamilla was arrested as he tried to hijack a truck.\nThe US Supreme Court last week refused to review the 33-year-old's case, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday decided against a reprieve and recommending clemency and no new appeals were in the courts Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:12:30.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
