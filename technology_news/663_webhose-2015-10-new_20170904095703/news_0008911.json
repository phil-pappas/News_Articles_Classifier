This compares with a net loss of $0.8 million, or a net loss of ($0.02) per share in Q3 FY14, and net income of $0.5 million, or net income of $0.02 per diluted share in Q2 FY15. \nCash and cash equivalents as of September 27, 2015 were $35.0 million, which includes approximately $16.5 million raised through a public offering of common stock in August 2015, up from $18.4 million in Q2 FY15. \nThird Quarter Fiscal 2015 Non-GAAP Results 1 \nGross margin for Q3 FY15 was a record 66 percent, and compares with 61 percent in Q3 FY14 and 66 percent in Q2 FY15. \nNet income for Q3 FY15 was a record $2.3 million, or net income of $0.06 per diluted share, representing the highest non-GAAP quarterly net income in the Company’s history. This compares with net income of $0.7 million, or net income of $0.02 per diluted share in Q3 FY14, and net income of $2.1 million, or net income of $0.06 per diluted share in Q2 FY15. \nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for Q3 FY15 was a record $3.0 million, and represents the highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA in the Company’s history. This compares with Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million in Q3 FY14, and Adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 million in Q2 FY15. \n“We produced another quarter of record financial results, further demonstrating that our business strategy to expand into high-growth markets, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, accompanied by tight cost controls, is generating exceptional performance,” said Dr. Avi Katz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GigOptix, Inc. “Our all-time record results and enhanced profitability this quarter were driven by significant growth in our High-Speed Communications business. We continue to be the dominant supplier of RF devices for current 40Gbps and future 100Gbps active optical cables and transceivers for the fast growing data center market. While delivering an exceptional financial quarter, we have also enhanced our customer base for datacom and telecom-metro 100Gbps links, completed a successful oversubscribed underwritten follow-on public common stock offering of about $16.5 million in net proceeds, which was done in a very tough market environment, and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, successfully completed the strategic acquisition of the Korean company Terasquare to establish GigOptix-Terasquare-Korea (GTK) Co., Ltd in Seoul, Korea. With the addition of Terasquare, we are now strongly positioned to further increase our cloud-based links market-share by having a complete and superior IC portfolio of industry leading 100Gbps datacom solutions for Ethernet, Fiber Channel, and InfiniBand data center connectivity. We believe the transaction will result in a meaningful increase of the High Speed Communications revenue in fiscal 2016 and beyond. \n“Earlier this month we announced another milestone in the development of our Industrial ASIC product line with a substantial $6.1 million contract with one of the world’s largest suppliers of advanced aerospace for commercial and defense products. Revenue from this agreement will begin in the fourth quarter and be spread over the next two years. When combined with the $7.9 million order we announced in May of this year from another major supplier in the same industry, we have the foundation in place to deliver continued strong financial performance in 2016,” said Dr. Katz. \nFinancial Outlook \n“We expect Q4 FY15 revenue of approximately $10.7 million, which would be another record quarter in the Company’s history. For fiscal 2015, we will generate record annual revenue of $40 million, representing an increase of approximately 21 percent over fiscal 2014, and greater annual profitability,” said Dr. Katz. “Based on the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 revenue guidance, fiscal 2015 will result in the highest revenue and most profitable year in the Company’s history.” \nFinancial Results Webcast / Conference Call \nGigOptix will host a conference call and webcast with investors today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results and business outlook.
