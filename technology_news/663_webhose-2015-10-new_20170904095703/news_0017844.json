UbiQD, which is marketing the technology for use in things like luminous paints for signage, got its start after participating in a High Desert Discovery Day in Los Alamos.\nHigh Desert Discovery wants New Mexico’s garage innovators to venture from their nests for some mentoring, advice and maybe technical assistance and funding to help move promising inventions to market.\nHigh Desert, or HD3, is teaming with the New Mexico Manufacturing Partnership and Qynergy — a privately run incubator and accelerator for early stage technology — to host a “Discovery Day for the Garage Inventor” on Nov. 4-5 in Albuquerque. About a dozen inventors with the most-promising innovations will be chosen to present at the event, where they’ll receive feedback from seasoned entrepreneurs, investors and business professionals.\nThose interested have until Friday to apply for the event, which will take place at Central New Mexico Community College’s Workforce Training Center.\n“Some of the greatest companies in the world got their start inside a garage,” said HD3 founder and CEO Michelle Miller. “Throughout New Mexico, there is an abundant and rich base of invention and creativity. We want all innovators, from those inside our national labs and universities to those inventors working inside their metaphorical ‘garages’ to apply to Garage Discovery Day.”\nHD3, which launched in 2011, is a startup accelerator that looks for new companies or people with great ideas throughout the state to connect with talented entrepreneurs, mentoring and funding to accelerate their growth. It organizes “discovery days” to allow select innovators to present their products and ideas to a network of professionals.\nAbout a dozen applicants are generally chosen to present, and the most-promising ones are often selected to continue working directly with HD3 as “portfolio” companies. The organization then helps connect those startups with technical assistance, business mentoring and potential funding opportunities.\nHD3 now has 22 “portfolio companies” around the state, such as Ubiquitous Quantum Dots, or UbiQD LLC. That company licensed technology from Los Alamos National Laboratory to inexpensively create nontoxic “quantum dots,” which absorb light and emit it back out in specific colors. UbiQD has raised about $600,000 in private equity to make and market its product for things like luminous paints for signage, or for use in plastics to make them glow.\nFor Garage Day, HD3 will accept applications for almost any type of invention. It will select presenters based on market potential.\n“We’ve received applications from inventors of medical devices, agricultural tools and consumer products,” Miller said. “It’s across the board.”\nThe Discovery Day audience will include New Mexico’s best and brightest, said Qynergy President Wish Krishnamoorthy.\n“To know if your technology really holds water, the best way is to ask experts who have been there and done that,” Krishnamoorthy said. “Discovery Day includes people who have done it all, from concept to successful company.”\nFor more information, visit www.hddd.org.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/200902-640x480.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:01:57.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
