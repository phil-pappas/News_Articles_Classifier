Similar updates will be rolling out to the Xbox One, web browsers and Android mobile devices in the coming months.\nUpdate #2: College sports channel Campus Insiders is slated to join the Sports Extra package of Sling TV. Campus Insiders features live games from the Mountain West Conference, Patriot League, West Coast Conference and CIAA schools.\nOriginal review below... \nImagine everything you liked about cable. You probably enjoyed surfing the channels, watching the shows people were talking about when they aired instead of months after. And, if you were lucky enough to own boxes of a certain caliber, pausing and rewinding said TV shows in real time. \nNow, imagine everything you hated: the costly bill at the end of the month, the bulky, expensive equipment that marred the side of your house and entertainment center. Not to mention the service contract that never seemed to end.\nBut what if you could get everything you loved about TV without any of those gripes? \nThat, in a nutshell, is Sling TV.\nIt's live TV streaming whenever and wherever. No contracts, no equipment and no costly statement. \nSling TV? Is it the same thing as a Slingbox? While there are some concepts borrowed from Slingbox, Sling TV is in a different league when it comes to cutting the cord. \nSling TV is a US-only service offered from DISH that allows you to watch the channels you'd typically find on basic cable for $20 a month without a contract, subscription to DISH or any pesky cable equipment on your roof or in your living room. \nWhat devices can I use to watch it? Create an account on DISH's website and use that info to login to the app on iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire TV Stick , Google's Nexus Player, Xbox One and Roku TV. The service will also work on select LG and Samsung smart TVs, and on Macs and PCs via a website portal. The service is expected to come to Google Chromecast later this year.\n\nThe system is more eloquent than apps like TWC TV or Xfinity, and while the latter is almost universally available, trying to remember whose name and email you use to login can ruin a session before it even starts.\nWhat channels are included? So far, channels on the basic, $20-per-month plan include ESPN, ESPN2, TNT, TBS, HGTV, DIY Network, Food Network, Travel Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, ABC Family, Disney Channel, AMC, IFC and, most recently, A&E, History, H2, Lifetime, Bloomberg and most recently, Polaris+.\nThe biggest change to this roster is HBO. Starting April 12 for the premiere of the new season of Game of Thrones, Sling TV will offer live HBO for $15 a month to current \"Best of Live TV\" subscribers. Also new is the addition of DishWorld multi-lingual content to Sling TV.\nIn addition to the base subscription, seven add-on packages are available for $5 apiece each month:\nKids Extra, with Disney Jr, Disney XD, Boomerang, Duck TV, and Baby TV. Sports Extra, which includes the SEC Network, ESPNEWS, ESPNU, Universal Sports, Univision Deportes, beIN Sports, ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Bases Loaded, ESPN Goal Line and Campus Insiders. Lifestyle extra, with Cooking Channel, DIY, truTV, WE tv, FYI, and LMN. Hollywood Extra, which includes live and video-on-demand content from EPIX, EPIX2, EPIX3, EPIX Drive-In, Sundance TV and Turner Classic Movies (TCM) World News Extra, with HLN, News 18 India, Euronews, NDTV 24x7, France24 and RT. Deportes Extra includes Azteca, beIN Español, beIN HD (English), Univison, Univision Deportes and UniMás. Películas & Novelas Extra includes Azteca Corazon, Cinelatino, De Película, De Película Clasico, Pasiones, Univision tlnovelas, Univision and UniMás. Functionality Now, remember when you asked about Slingbox? Well, it's true, Sling TV and Slingbox share a few similarities beyond the first syllable. \nSling TV allows you to pause, rewind and fast-forward live TV on some channels (note the word \"some\" there), and the ability to watch shows a few days after they've aired.\n\nAlso similar to Slingbox, Sling TV lets you watch its service on most mobile devices anywhere in the world. That is, as long as you can establish and maintain a bitrate of about 1.5 Mbps for high-quality streams, 0.8Mbps for medium resolution, and 0.5 Mbps for low-quality.\nSling TV on Roku TechRadar was given two platforms to test Sling TV. One was Roku (specifically on a Roku 3 ) and the other was iOS, which we'll get to in a minute.\nBy and large, the experience on Roku was everything I've come to love about a cable box: simple functionality, clean layout and crisp picture. Installing the app was as easy as going to Roku channel store, finding the Sling TV app and pushing it to my Roku 3. \nComing from the home screen, Sling TV's interface loads up In a matter of seconds. The time it takes to get from home screen to live TV is astonishing - it's leagues faster than the time it takes my DirecTV cable box to boot up. \nOnce loaded, the stream was crisp and clear. (This obviously is a YMMV situation, as my home setup isn't identical - or even necessarily in the same ballpark - as everyone else.) A quick test of my network showed I was pulling around 26Mbps over Wi-Fi, which worked fairly well at high-quality 1080p 99% of the time. \n\nThe only stark contrast to traditional cable, at this point at least, is the amount of content available on Sling TV. \nComparatively, the 40-or-so channels offered on Sling TV are just a drop in the bucket compared to the over-800 I have available on DirecTV. And because you aren't able to record a show like you can on TiVo, you're limited to watching whatever's on or whatever's been on in the past few days. \nSling TV on iOS Sling TV on iOS is a vastly different experience. Not only are you trading down to a smaller screen size, but you're also losing connection stability and clean interface of the set-top app.\nUsing an iPhone 5S for testing, I took Sling TV with me for a gauntlet of daily errands. As you might expect, over LTE the stream was nearly flawless. Dropping down to 3G, however, presented real problems as seconds slipped away to buffering screens. \n\nProblematically, when you return home, continuing what you were watching on your phone isn't as simple as starting up your Roku. You'll need to go into the menu, find the show you were watching and rewind it manually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:18:28.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
