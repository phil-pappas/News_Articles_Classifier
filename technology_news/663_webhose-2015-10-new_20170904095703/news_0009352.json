The Evolution of Medicine is a movement to create a medical system capable of dealing with the modern epidemics of chronic disease. This groundbreaking event will showcase the same film at multiple locations across the country with each location independently organized by local groups of physicians passionate about seeing more rapid improvements in American medicine.The feature film selected for the inaugural festival is Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare (2012) which focuses on three key stories that are congruent with the regular programming of the Evolution of Medicine - positioning functional and integrative medicine as the future of primary care showcasing empowering solutions for chronic conditions and catalyzing corporate wellness.''There are so many reasons we are excited to share this film with new audiences'' said CEO James Maskell. ''First and foremost it does an excellent job of highlighting the massive political social and fiduciary issues at the center of this debate. Films can convey emotion and change minds in ways other media cannot and encouraging the development of healthy communities is a big part of our work. Furthermore the film covers the three areas where we feel our network of providers and stakeholders can make maximum impact; the health of local people communities and businesses.''Over the last two years Evolution of Medicine''s flagship show the Functional Forum has become the largest integrative medicine event for health professionals being watched by more than 10000 doctors each month in over 50 countries. In 2015 the Forum has galvanized over 200 communities of physicians around the world to meet for their show monthly and learn amongst a group of their peers.The event is powered by Tugg a technology company that makes it easy to put on a local screening of movies that have had their run at the box office. ''The potential of technology to rapidly increase efficiency of medicine is unlimited and Tugg is a good example of that in another sector. This would not be possible without Tugg'' said Maskell of their partnership.The Evolution of Medicine Film Festival is the third major initiative instigated this year hot on the heels of the first affordable alternative to health insurance Liberty Direct that was launched at last month''s ''Evolution of Medicine Summit'' which was attended virtually by more than 65000 people.To purchase tickets for a screening in your area or to host your own screening please visit www.goevomed.com/film.Evolution of Medicine empowers health professionals and the patients they serve to partner to create a medical system capable of dealing with today''s modern epidemics.
