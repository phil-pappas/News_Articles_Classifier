Those with multiple impairments had the lowest levels of access, while visually impaired people and those with learning disabilities were most likely to have internet access. \nDisabled people are less likely to have a mobile phone, 85% versus 89%; more likely to maintain a landline, 77% versus 72%; and more likely to have a free-to-air TV service, 60% versus 50%, as opposed to pay-TV, 48% versus 55%. \nIt is important to note, however, that although the headline statistics showed that the majority of disabled consumers do have access to some form of communications services, not all who did were making use of them. \nA fifth of disabled consumers said their condition prevented the use of at least some type of device or service, with notable differences found among consumers with different disability types – for example, visually impaired people may own a television set, but will tend to use it differently; while hearing-impaired consumers are less likely to use telecoms services even though they often owned phones. \nThe telecoms regulator is obliged under the terms of the 2003 Communications Act to have regard to the needs of persons with disabilities. \nIt therefore conducts frequent work alongside the British Population Survey to glean better information on the experiences and needs of disabled consumers that can then be used to inform policy work. \nIn September 2015, a report from the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted a missed opportunity to use mobile technology to help disabled consumers get out and about , particularly when it came to using public transport services. \n“Better access to modern technology could transform disabled people’s lives, by supporting them to live more independently, and to access services on equal terms,” commented Scope policy head Elliot Dunster.
