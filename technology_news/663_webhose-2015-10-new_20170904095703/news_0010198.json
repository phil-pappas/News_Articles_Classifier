Designed for environmental scientists, geologists, engineers, GIS professionals, and researchers, Voxler offers sixteen unique 3D graphics display modules that users can employ to visualize almost any type of 3D data. Users can easily render 2D and 3D data, and add volume renderings, isosurfaces, borehole models, vector data, and imagery to create professional and visually striking 3D models.\nThe most popular new feature in Voxler 4 is the addition of 3D DXF import and export support. Users can import 3D DXF to enhance their Voxler 4 models or export 3D model data, including boreholes and well traces, to 3D DXF for import into other modeling, CAD, and GIS applications.\nAnother exciting new feature is the addition of vector draping over 3D surfaces. Voxler 4 now supports the import of GIS data and map layers in any supported vector format. These files can then be draped over Voxler’s 3D surfaces for an enhanced visual display.\nSome additional, highly-requested features are the addition of LiDAR LAS file support, hot editing data in the new worksheet window, the ability to convert the coordinates and projections for point data between hundreds of real-world coordinate and projection systems, the ability to classify 3D point cloud data from scatter plots into user-defined class sizes, and the ability to render scatter plot points by laser scanned RGB values.\n“The addition of 3D DXF support and vector data importing takes Voxler from great visualization software to an exciting remedial design tool.\" – Steve Boynton, President, Subsurface Environmental Solutions, LLC\n“I am using Voxler as a central tool for both explorative 3D data analysis and visual communication of geosciences simulation/modeling results. I am impressed by the versatility, stability and speed of Voxler. Last, but not least, I have to emphasize the excellent support by the Golden Software team.” – Robert Marschallinger, President, Geoinformatik\n“If you shop for a portable, resource-efficient 3D visualization system, Voxler is definitely the best value on the market. It allows even an inexperienced user to build 3D models of fair complexity (next to effortlessly) while costing 10 times less than other comparable/competitive software systems.” – Igor Yashayaev, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\nVoxler 4 operates in a Microsoft® Windows environment with Windows XP SP2, Vista, 7, 8 (excluding RT), and Windows 10. Voxler 4 is now available for a retail price of $479, with quantity discounts available. Upgrades from any previous version of Voxler are available for only $159. The full user’s guide can be purchased for just $25. Voxler 4 includes free maintenance updates and free technical support.\nVisit www.GoldenSoftware.com to download a free Voxler 4 demo and place an order.\nAbout Golden Software:\nFounded in 1983, Golden Software is a leading developer of affordable scientific graphics software.
