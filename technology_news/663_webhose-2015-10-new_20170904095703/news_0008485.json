The company made the announcement at the 35th Gitex Technology Week the latest edition of one of the world’s most influential technology events taking place until October 22 2015 at the Dubai World Trade Center. The new SaaS option makes Carbon Black is the first and only ETDR solution with continuous endpoint recording live response and attack recovery capabilities that can be deployed on premises or accessed in a cloud-hosted SaaS model. These key features enable customers to choose the deployment model that best suits their business preferences. Carbon Black provides the industry’s best endpoint visibility by continuously recording all process activity network connections and executed binaries on each endpoint and storing the information in a centralized ‘big data’ server. This architecture makes it possible for Carbon Black to deliver near zero performance impact on an endpoint—unlike most ETDR solutions that process and store data on user machines. \nThe Carbon Black cloud deployment option offers organizations a SaaS alternative for the back-end big data server. Now companies that prefer a SaaS solution rather than deploying their own server infrastructure can install the front-end sensors on their Windows Mac and Linux machines and access Carbon Black’s server as a SaaS cloud service hosted by Bit9 Carbon Black. This cloud deployment configuration makes it possible for businesses—especially those for whom capital infrastructure management and IT security resourcing are a constant challenge—to improve their security posture with Carbon Black with the convenience of a SaaS deployment model. \nDavid Flower Managing director EMEA for Bit9 Carbon Black said: “The endpoint threat detection and response market in the GCC region is growing at an unprecedented pace as is the demand for the services of incident response (IR) firms. Companies and IR firms dealing with a recent breach require an ETDR solution that can be deployed in hours. With Carbon Black already used as a critical solution by dozens of IR firms this new cloud deployment option will enable our customers and partners to leverage Carbon Black faster than ever.” \nValue-added resellers (VAR) also play an influential role in the IT security ecosystem. By deploying Carbon Black in the cloud as a hosted service Bit9 Carbon Black VARs can provide their customers with the industry’s most complete ETDR solution as a rapid maintenance-free SaaS offering. Benefits of Carbon Black’s cloud deployment option include capital cost savings zero overhead or maintenance fast and easy deployments and seamless product updates. \nThe announcement of the Carbon Black cloud deployment option comes as the company aggressively expands its cloud-based threat intelligence capabilities. The company also recently broadened and strengthened its development expertise for cloud-based solutions by acquiring an experienced team of cloud software engineers from a Boston-based company. The team has worked together for several years enabling them to make an immediate impact. \n\n\nAbout Dubai PR Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:29:11.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
