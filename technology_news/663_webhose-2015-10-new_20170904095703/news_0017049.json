From the scriptures we can learn and see that Paul was not one of those men who will sit around and wait for things to happen, he would go out and make things happen.\nThen Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.Acts 9:1-2\nIn other words, Paul was a go getter. He'd see that something needs to be done and he would go and do it. That's why he took it to himself to go to the high priest to get permission to go out and find everyone who was of the Way (Christianity) and throw them into prison or kill them if they resist. The above verses clearly state that he went (voluntarily) and asked the letters from the high priest. Obviously those are characteristics of a zealous or self-driven person, aren't they? To support this, In his letter to the Philippians, Quote: : \"I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.\" Philippians 3:\nLook at his first statement he said \"I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church.\" In other words, he did what he did with passion. Which means, Paul thought and dreamt day and night about catching, killing and putting into prison all those who were proclaiming that they were of the Way / Jesus’s followers.\n He didn't do all of that merely for the sake of killing and putting people behind bars. But he did all of that in the name of Religion, he thought he was obeying the law. Lets read his second statement to understand what I'm saying better.\"And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.\"\nThere you have it! he had zeal for God's work, although his zeal was misdirected. In his mind he thought he was doing God a service by persecuting the Christians, only to find out later on his way to Damascus that he was actually doing God a disservice.\nThen he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.”Acts 9:4-5\nHowever, God in His unending mercy, forgave him for that and redirected him.\nSo he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?” Then the Lord said to him, “Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”Acts 9:6\nAfter that encounter, Paul went out and preached the gospel of Jesus Christ and wrote more letters, which form part of the New Testament bible more than any other apostle, who walked and ate with Jesus, during His three years ministry on earth.\nTalking about passion; Paul didn't wait until he was long in the ministry, before preaching the gospel. After Aeneas came and prayed for his eyes to be opened, Paul went straight to the synagogue and started preaching, even those who knew him before got confused what has gotten to him.\nThen all who heard were amazed, and said, “Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?”Acts 9:20-21\nPaul was so passionate about spreading the message of Christ that he wrote letters and preached while his was behind bars\n\"And because I preach this Good News, I am suffering and have been chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained\" ? ? Philippians 1:7\n“ am in chains now, still preaching this message as God's ambassador. So pray that I will keep on speaking boldly for him, as I should.\"Ephesians 6:20", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:06:51.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
