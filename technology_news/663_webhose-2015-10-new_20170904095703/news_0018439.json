The Model can be downloaded and commented on at https://actiac.org/groups/project-fitara . \n\"This is not merely an exercise in FITARA compliance. Our goal is to improve how we manage IT and deliver on our mission,\" said Darren Ash, the government project lead on ACT-IAC's FITARA Implementation Project. \"Through ACT-IAC's collaborative efforts, we brought together some of the leading minds in government IT, from both the public and private sectors.\" \nDeveloped in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the \"IT Management Maturity Model\"explicitly links to OMB's Common Baseline requirements and aims to improve agencies' ability to manage IT and, therefore, improve how they accomplish their missions and serve the public. It identifies five critical functions of IT management: Governance, Acquisition, Budget, Program Management, and Organization and Workforce . Additionally, it offers three levels of accomplishment for each function. As a result, mnagers can assess their current situation and identify what needs to be done to accomplish a well-managed IT department. \n\"Engagement across agency leadership is essential to success. The ACT-IAC working group includes more than 50 people from various backgrounds from public and private sectors, across the C-suite, as well as IT, finance, human resources and acquisition professionals,\" said Richard Spires, the industry project lead on ACT-IAC's FITARA Implementation Project and CEO of Resilient Network Systems. \"Now, we're asking other stakeholders from government and industry to comment on Version 1 of the 'IT Management Maturity Model'.\" \nThe overall initiative gathers best-practices and proven solutions so that managers do not have to solve problems from scratch. Phases II and III will expand the maturity model by providing proven tools and techniques for quick implementation, as well as evaluation criteria to help OMB and other agencies measure the impact of FITARA over time. \nAbout ACT-IAC - Advancing Government Through Education, Collaboration and Action \nACT-IAC is the premier public-private partnership in the government IT community and an example of how government and industry work together.
