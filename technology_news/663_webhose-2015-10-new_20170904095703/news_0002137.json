Dental radiology equipment was the second-largest segment in 2011 in the global dental equipment market by product type. \nBrowse Press Release of Dental Equipment Market: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/dental-devices-market.htm \nInterestingly, while dental lasers represented the smallest segment within the global dental equipment market by product type in 2011, this segment is growing very rapidly.

The findings of TMR's study show that the share of North America in the global dental equipment market was the highest. Trailing North America was Europe with a market share of over 35% as of 2011.
