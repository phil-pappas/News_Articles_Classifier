Data is becoming more mainstream and in the public gaze. \nData is the lifeblood of the digital economy, it can give insight, inform decisions and deepen relationships. It can be bought, sold, shared and even stolen, all things that suggest that data has value. Yet when we conducted our research very few organisations can attribute a value and, more concerning, many do not yet have the capabilities we would expect to manage, protect and extract that value. \nSo why is it so hard? One challenge is that data is so all pervasive that it is taken for granted or is seen as a by- product. Often it is only when disaster strikes that this assumption is broken. Organisationally, data is all too often seen as a technology backwater â€“ the domain of data architects within IT functions. Our survey supports these jaundiced views as we often encountered organisations where data was not on the agenda of the board. If anything is to change it needs their leadership to drive it. \nDespite this rather negative context, the opportunities for competitive advantage through data are very real. The better organisations have made the value of data tangible and are exploiting it and protecting it in equal measure. What makes these organisations distinctive? The survey demonstrates that this comes from a platform of strong senior leadership, investment in data governance and best use of analytics both in terms of technology and people. \nThe survey also points to some emerging geographic differences. Is the rest of the world lagging behind the US or are we going to see a wave of improvement that is starting there? As a data professional, I am hopeful that we are moving in the right direction. The emergence of the Chief Data Officer (CDO) role and the number of organisations I observe making steps to invest in data management to reflect the value of data is encouraging. However, there is a long way to go. \nGovernance infrastructure is not enough. There needs to be an holistic approach where everyone in the organisation knows and takes responsibility and where systems and processes are designed to embed good practice. If governance sits outside normal business activity it is unlikely to be effective. This sound platform has given the leading organisations in our survey more opportunity to exploit data through analytics as trustworthy data leads to confident decision making. \nSo, my ask of you it so read the survey findings and consider two questions: \nHas my organisation truly considered the value of data? \nAre we managing this asset in way that reflects that value? \nDOWNLOAD THE PDF ABOVE TO READ THE FULL WHITE PAPER.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:11:22.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
