The global market for video surveillance systems is forecast to grow at over 12% owing to the increasing requirement for surveillance in many public places as well as residential areas throughout the world. \nThe demand of video intercom devices in residential and commercial buildings is increasing over the years, which positively drives the market for the same. Though the residential applications are expected to increase, commercial applications will be rapidly expanding with improving economies that lead to more investments from the private sector and thus exhibit the fastest growth during the forecast period. Government applications are likely to show slow growth due to the austerity acts being imposed for cost cutting, especially in regions such as Europe. \nThe launch of low-priced Chinese audio intercom devices is propelling the manufacturers throughout the world to promote more video intercom solutions in order to cope up with the fierce competition, thus contributing to the market growth. \nKey Topics Covered: \n1.
