But is it really going to be that huge? - Advertisement - \nThe specs were leaked by one of their retailers last week, hence the public knowledge of the One A9. The Taiwanese company who have been in the red in the past couple of years saw another disappointing year in 2015, and sorely need something to turn the ship around. But can the One A9 shoulder the burden? Let’s check out the smartphone in further details. \nFor starters, the leak didn’t mention anything about its size and weight. But we can expect it to have at least a metal body since it will be priced in the upper range. In this regard, we can safely say that HTC are good in making beautiful devices. \nScreen-wise, we are about to see the One A9 equipped with a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~441 ppi pixel density. That is the least that a so-called flagship should be having, well other than having a Quad HD resolution. For the time being, we are not even sure whether it will have some protection in the form of Gorilla Glass. \nThe One A9 is expected to be powered by the Qualcomm MSM8952 Snapdragon 617 chipset, Octa-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 405 graphics and 3GB RAM. This is one powerhouse that can easily run all the apps and games that are out there in the market. - Advertisement - \nIn terms of camera, it should be getting a 13 Megapixel primary camera 4128 x 3096 pixels, optical image stabilization, autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, and HDR. As for the secondary camera, you would be getting a 4 Megapixel secondary camera instead. This is something average for a so-called flagship. \nWith an expected release date in November 2015, by that time the One A9 should be equipped with the latest Android Marshmallow 6.0 right out of the box to further complement it. At least you don’t have to play the waiting game with the manufacturer and go straight to the latest version. \nAs for its storage, the smartphone will have 32GB of internal storage plus a microSD slot that can further expand it up to a maximum of 128GB. \nBattery-wise, it is reported that the One A9 would only be equipped with a rather low non-removable Li-Ion 2150 mAh battery. This could present a problem to the device as heavy user might just struggle to have it last for a full day. - Advertisement - \nPerhaps it is best if we could wait for its launch rather than to speculate on what a retailer leaked about the HTC One A9. At least we will be getting a much solid information, and then we can decide whether it should be a worthy challenger to the mighty iPhone. But as far as things are going, don’t think that it would be able to mount seriously a challenge. But until then… \nThe HTC One A9 is expected to be available in November 2015 with an estimated price tag of ~$679 USD. It will be available in various colors, namely Acid Gold, Opal Silver, Deep Garnet, Carbon Gray, Rose Gold and Cast Iron.
