And I thought, ‘Oh, it’s Johnny’s kangaroo.’” \nHe said he called Schirripa and told him to come get his one-metre-tall buddy. \n“Johnny came up and picked up the kangaroo in his arms,” the neighbour said. \nApparently, the Australian import bounded to freedom when someone left the gate of a backyard enclosure unlatched. It bounced around for 10 to 15 minutes before being captured, police said. \nCops did not charge or ticket Schirripa, who claimed the kangaroo lives with his brother upstate legally and was only visiting. It is illegal to keep such an animal in New York City. Kangaroo on the loose in NYC \nHe had a similar tail of woe in 2012, when a zebra and a miniature pony escaped his urban jungle and trotted through traffic before being lassoed. \nSchirripa told authorities at the time that he had a permit for a petting zoo starring Razzi the Zebra. But the city Health Department told The New York Post no such license had been issued. \nHe also claimed he shipped the pony and zebra away to Phillipsburg, New Jersey. \n“When [the Health Department] first got here, they questioned me about the whereabouts of the zebra,” Schirripa said at the time. “And I told them, ‘I don’t have to tell you anything about the zebra. It’s just not here.’” \nInstead, the Health Department slapped him with violations for housing three roosters and three peacocks. Buster the Kangaroo Staten Island.

A woman at the home refused to speak to a reporter. \nAs for the latest outlaw animal, a neighbour said that he found Buster in his back yard two weeks ago. \n“It’s a bit normal around here. It’s happened before,” he said. \nSchirripa told cops Buster would be sent back upstate immediately. But no cars with a skippy in it were seen leaving the house on Saturday. \nThe New York Post did spot a cockatoo and two guard dogs, and heard chickens and roosters on the sprawling property. (Roosters are also illegal to keep in the city.) \n“Johnny’s always got something,” another neighbour said. “He walks around with a snake around his neck.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:34:57.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
