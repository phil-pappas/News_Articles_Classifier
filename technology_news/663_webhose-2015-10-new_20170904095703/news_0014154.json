This new robotic device is a replica of the movie’s new robotic sidekick. If you’re familiar with Sphero, you’ll notice its similarities to the company’s robotic ball, but with the tiny head of BB-8 on top.\nThe good: Paired with an app running on your Apple or Android device, this little guy responds to voice commands (iOS only) and can roll around and balance by itself. It charges with a simple included base that doubles as a cute stand. Sit back and laugh as the BB-8 explores your home, runs into an object and identifies it as an enemy. The BB-8 is tons of fun, and likely to fly off shelves this holiday season.\nThe bad: It can’t detect elevation and the price is a bit much.\nThe bottom line: Move over R2-D2. The force is strong with this new robot.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0107H5FJ6", "https://twitter.com/share?text=This+is+the+droid+you%E2%80%99re+looking+for%2C+%E2%80%98Star+Wars%E2%80%99+fans", "http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=wwwbostonhera-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0107H5FJ6"], "published": "2015-10-12T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:38.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
