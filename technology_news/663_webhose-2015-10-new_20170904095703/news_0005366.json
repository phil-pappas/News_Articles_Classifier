(NASDAQ: DEPO ) (\"Depomed\" or the \"Company\") today issued the following statement: \nWe note that Horizon Pharma has recently made what we believe are confusing and misleading communications in connection with its unsolicited offer to acquire Depomed, including statements related to the value of their offer, the special meeting process and the actions of the Depomed Board. We remind shareholders that the Depomed Board has set October 29 and November 13, 2015 as the record dates to determine the shareholders that are entitled to call two special meetings of shareholders that have been proposed by Horizon. If Horizon delivers the requisite proxies following those dates, Depomed will take the appropriate steps to honor shareholders' request and hold the proposed meetings in accordance with California law and Depomed's bylaws. \nWe believe that Horizon is proposing to replace the Depomed Board of Directors because it rejected Horizon's offer of .95 shares of Horizon for each share of Depomed. What Horizon fails to disclose is that its offer now has a current value of only about $17 a share. We think the facts speak for themselves. The Depomed Board and management team continue to focus on implementing the Company's business plan and creating value for all shareholders. \nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Leerink Partners LLC are serving as financial advisors to Depomed and Baker Botts L.L.P. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP are serving as legal counsel. \nAbout Depomed \nDepomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes products for pain and neurology related disorders.
