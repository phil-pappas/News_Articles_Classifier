IDC reported that Mac shipments shrank 3.4 per cent year-over-year, while Gartner reported 1.5 per cent growth.\nApple shipped 5.6 million units, according to Gartner; IDC counted 5.3 million units.\nEither way, that’s the slowest growth rate for Apple computers since the third quarter of 2013.\nApple nonetheless outperformed the overall PC market, which saw shipments plummet 11 per cent to 71 million for the quarter, according to IDC. Moreover, given the worse performance of other PC makers, its market share rose to 7.6% in 2015 from 6.9% last year, according to Gartner.\nThis is the first time Apple’s growth rate has shrunk since 2013, by IDC’s reckoning. Gartner said the quarter marked Apple’s slowest growth since the third quarter of that year.\nMac sales may have slowed due to a strong U.S. dollar, which made the computers more expensive outside the U.S., said Jay Chou, an IDC analyst.\nApple was hurt by weak markets in Japan and Europe, said Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst.\nApple will report its Mac sales figures when it posts its quarterly financial results on Oct. 27.\nThe Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=IT", "http://www.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=AAPL", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HU653_MacBoo_G_20150409110523.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:41:34.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
