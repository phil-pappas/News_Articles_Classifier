It represents the most sophisticated method available for permanently deleting information in such a way that makes it impossible to recover. The software eliminates all traces of an individual’s presence on their device, including online history, conversations, emails and social activities.\nMany people mistakenly believe they have nothing to hide, but as whistleblower Edward Snowden so elegantly said, “Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”\nEven when information is deleted from a device, it’s still retained within the internal framework whether it’s a computer, tablet or phone. Device users can’t access that deleted information, but those with the appropriate skills or specific spying programs can recover every action performed on a device since the day it was purchased.\nWith a single click, AntiTrail permanently removes the history of images and videos viewed, messaging chats, and searches performed. The history of sent emails, visited websites, and participation on social media sites are also eliminated, along with page and hibernation files. Typical cleaning programs automate the process of deletion, but they don’t remove the information beyond retrieval – AntiTrail does.\nThere are many files contained on devices that users can’t view and those files pose a potential threat, especially to businesses. AntiTrail ferrets out unallocated clusters, shadow copies, and similar content to provide companies with enhanced safety and privacy.\nAntiTrail is the only software of its kind that permanently deletes the trail that individuals leave when they’re online. It marks a groundbreaking innovation for protecting personal information and usage data on computers, tablets and phones. Individuals can soon experience the future of device privacy and try the software for free when they provide feedback.\nFor more information, call +372 55 971 659 or visit AntiTrail online.\nAbout the Company:\nIn an age where we rely more and more on the Web for our private activities, being sure that we’re able to actually keep those activities private is more important than ever.
