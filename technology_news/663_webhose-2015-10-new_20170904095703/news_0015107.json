S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds.Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov.Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this ROSES NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov, in addition to being registered with NSPIRES.Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.All principal investigators and other participants (e.g., co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES regardless of submission system.Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information.Details of the solicited programs are given in the Appendices of this ROSES NRA.Names, due dates, and links for the individual calls are given in Tables 2 and 3 of this ROSES NRA.Interested proposers should monitor http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ or subscribe to the electronic notification system there for additional new programs or amendments to this ROSES NRA through February 2016, at which time release of a subsequent ROSES NRA is planned.A web archive (and RSS feed) for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to this ROSES NRA will be available at:http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2015/.Frequently asked questions about ROSES-2015 will be on the web at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/.Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in the Appendices of this ROSES NRA and at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list/.Questions concerning general ROSES NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov.
