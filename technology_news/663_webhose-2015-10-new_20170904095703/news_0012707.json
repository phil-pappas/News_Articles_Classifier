The new e-commerce site, founded by Diapers.com veteran Marc Lore, is among the most well-funded startups in history, and its real-time pricing model is unlike any other retailer's.\nA little more than a month after Jet began selling to the masses, software provider ChannelAdvisor, used by many retailers that sell on e-commerce marketplaces such as Jet, said that the newcomer has quickly gained traction.\nDuring its first month in operation, Jet surpassed marketplaces such as Sears, Best Buy, Newegg and Rakuten in \"gross merchandise value,\" meaning total value of products sold, according to ChannelAdvisor.\nChannelAdvisor also found that Jet is having early success in building customer loyalty: Since its debut, Jet has had a 23 percent repeat buyer rate, better than the 17 percent for eBay and 11 percent for Amazon.com during the same time period. (Amazon's CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\"Their momentum out the gate is strong,\" said David Spitz, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor.\nChannelAdvisor's data offers only a limited view of the market and Jet's results so far. It studied the transactions that have taken place through its software since Jet's launch. That includes merchandise sold through third-party marketplaces, so, in the case of Sears and Best Buy, it does not include items purchased on those sites that are fulfilled directly by Sears or Best Buy.\nJet, which is privately held, hasn't disclosed detailed sales figures since its launch. Liza Landsman, chief customer officer, said in a statement: \"We are extremely encouraged by the size of our repeat purchase baskets we are driving with our retail partners which average over 7 items per basket. It is demonstrating clearly that consumers are really seeing the value in shopping smarter with jet.com.\"\nThe ChannelAdvisor data helps further illuminate Jet's entry into the retail fray. There were early signs that Jet may have gotten off on the wrong foot with some established retailers, an inauspicious development for a company that hopes to get big-name brands to sell on its marketplace. Many were irked by the Jet Anywhere program, which gives customers rewards they can use on Jet when they shop at, say, Anthropologie or Nike. Dozens asked that they be removed from the list of brands that earn a Jet Anywhere rewards.\nCrucial to Jet's future is whether it is able to keep growing the roster of merchants that sell on its marketplace. Without a huge network of sellers, the site will never have the wide selection of its rival Amazon.\nHere, too, ChannelAdvisor's findings are encouraging news for Jet: Merchants are selling twice as much on Jet than on Sears or Newegg. That kind of result could encourage more merchants to work with Jet, Spitz said.\nThere is no evidence that Jet is stealing business from Amazon or eBay. For example, customers who purchased from Jet as well as either Amazon or eBay did not slow their purchase rate at the more established sites once Jet came on the scene.\nBut that may not be bad news. Lore has long insisted that poaching customers from sites such as Amazon was never essential to Jet's business model. Only 7 percent of retail sales occur online, leaving plenty of opportunity for Jet to build its business simply by converting some brick-and-mortar shoppers into online enthusiasts.\n\"This seems to be early evidence that there is a segment of customers that hasn't been well addressed by the existing marketplaces,\" Spitz said.\nIt remains to be seen whether Jet can work out its early kinks and attract a bigger audience, but Spitz is optimistic about the upstart's future.\n\"If you look at how rapidly they have become one of our top marketplaces,\" Spitz said, \"to me it indicates that they're driving a lot of consumer awareness and that the differentiation that they've been able to create around pricing has clearly struck a chord.\"\n Jeff Bezos", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f719ab/turbine/ct-jet-etailer-customers-bsi-20150914"], "published": "2015-09-12T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:25:05.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
