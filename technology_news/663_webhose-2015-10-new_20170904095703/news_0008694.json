This algorithm is about hacked spam or malware infected sites. Earlier Google had sent out 100’s of thousands of emails to webmasters whose sites had been compromised by attacks. Starting November 2015 Google search results will not display hacked sites until they are cleaned up and approved by Google.\nHacked spam or injected spam content is a big threat to quality search results said the spokesperson of Google and added that \"We are aggressively targeting hacked spam in order to protect users and webmasters. The algorithmic changes will eventually impact roughly 5% of queries.\" This update is expected to improve the quality of search results considerably and website owners who do not keep their security updates up to date are likely to be hit hard.\nThe hackers employ various strategies to attack vulnerable sites and mostly they come in the form of malware, Trojans, vulnerable plugins, SQl injection etc. It is important that the software is updated regularly to the latest version and change passwords at least once in six months.\nGoogle Search team experts also announced in their official blog that “Website owners that don’t implement standard best practices for security can leave their websites vulnerable to being easily hacked. This can include government sites, universities, small business, company websites, restaurants, hobby organizations, conferences, etc. Spammers and cyber-criminals purposely seek out those sites and inject pages with malicious content in an attempt to gain rank and traffic in search engines”\nIt is mandatory for every website owner to check and protect their website from hackers. You can either do the security check and fix issues by yourself using Google’s webmaster help or can hire expert penalty recovery service providers who can help you clean up and protect your site.\nAbout SubmitINme :\nSubmitinme is a 12 year old Google Authorized agency and a proud member of NASCCOM.
