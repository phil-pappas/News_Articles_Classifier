In order to get one for yourself, you would have to head to the brand’s website, and register yourself before you click on the buy button. You will then be given an invitation to buy the device. However, the painful truth is that your invitation will be in a queue behind some million numbers and by the time you get there, it would be weeks or even a month or two. Well, that’s the invite system from OnePlus which needs to be adhered, unlike rest of the brands which have their handsets sold on open sales around different shopping portals and physical stores.\nIn order to make things a little exciting, OnePlus has announced an open sale for the OnePlus 2 on 12 th October 2015. However, the sale will be a little disappointing for many since we all have a bad taste of how Xiaomi executed their flash sales for their Mi handsets. But this sale will be open and based on a first-come-first-served basis. You won’t need any invitation to buy the handsets, but will have to be patient enough to attend the sales.\nThe sale starts on October 12, 2015 and will be held only for one hour between 12pm and 1pm. There could be a heavy rush and a possible of server crashes, so be mentally prepared for the online stampede.\nTo make things slightly better from our side, we have a running contest open to all. You simply have to answer 5 simple questions and follow some rules and win an invite for a OnePlus 2 on the same day. Head to the article, follow the rules, answer the five simple questions about the OnePlus 2 and send them to us. We shall announce 20 winners on October 12, 2015 around noon time. Each of these lucky winners will be entitled to an invite (sent from OnePlus on the registered email addresses), using which you can buy the OnePlus 2 smartphone immediately (within 48 hours) (24 hours for non-Indian residents) of receiving the invite code.\nClick on the link below and head to the contest and get lucky. Don’t forget to share the contest on your social network.\nContest: OnePlus 2 invites giveaway!\n technology latest Mobiles and tabs OnePlus Also Read X-Men style shoes lets you walk on the ceiling NETGEAR rolls out new Tri-Band WiFi router India to get its own GPS satellites, will be at par with US GPS Beware!
