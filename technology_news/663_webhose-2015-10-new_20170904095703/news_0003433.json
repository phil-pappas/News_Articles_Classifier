From the filing for a force field to protect planes from blasts mid-air in 2012 to a laser-powered fusion engine earlier this year, these are all patents for potential uses of technology that may or may not become a commercial reality, according to a report in Forbes.\nBut earlier this week, Boeing announced they had created the world’s lightest metal in 2011 with scientists from HRL Laboratories, a lab that works on making real-world technology solutions with member companies like Boeing and General Motors.\nThe new metal, called Microlattice, is 100 times lighter than styrofoam and 99.9 percent air. Yes air. It’s made of interconnected hollow metal tubes made of nickel about 100 nanometers thick, that’s 1,000 times thinner than a human hair.\nAccording to Sophie Yang, a research scientist who helped create microlattice, the new metal is a 3D open cellular polymer structure and is the same concept as the structure of our bones. Our bones are an open cellular structure — rigid and strong on the outside but mostly hollow on the inside and therefore, not easily crushed.\nBecause of its strength and unprecedented lightness, the new metal lays the groundwork for creating new structural components in planes that can reduce weight and make planes more fuel efficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:43:55.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
