Miller, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote about the dangers of a federal proposal to build a National Data Center. The proposal was dropped amid public outcry, but a version of the same idea came to fruition decades later with the creation of the National Security Agency’s Utah Data Center .\nThis November’s cover story, “ If You’re Not Paranoid, You’re Crazy ,” by Walter Kirn, is also concerned about the U.S. government looking into our lives at ever-increasing levels. Miller’s warnings from 48 years ago, excerpted below, seem eerily prescient:\nA Data Center poses a grave threat to individual freedom and privacy. With its insatiable appetite for information, its inability to forget anything that has been put into it, a central computer might become the heart of a government surveillance system that would lay bare our finances, our associations, or our mental and physical health to government inquisitors or even to casual observers. Computer technology is moving so rapidly that a sharp line between statistical and intelligence systems is bound to be obliterated. Even the most innocuous of centers could provide the “foot in the door” for the development of an individualized computer-based federal snooping system. ...\nThe very existence of a National Data Center may encourage certain federal officials to engage in questionable surveillance tactics. For example, optical scanners—devices with the capacity to read a variety of type fonts or handwriting at fantastic rates of speed—could be used to monitor our mail. By linking scanners with a computer system, the information drawn in by the scanner would be converted into machine-readable form and transferred into the subject’s file in the National Data Center.\nThen, with sophisticated programming, the dossiers of all of the surveillance subject’s correspondents could be produced at the touch of a button, and an appropriate entry—perhaps “associates with known criminals”—could be added to all of them. As a result, someone who simply exchanges Christmas cards with a person whose mail is being monitored might find himself under surveillance or might be turned down when he applies for a job with the government or requests a government grant or applies for some other governmental benefit. An untested, impersonal, and erroneous computer entry such as “associates with known criminals” has marked him, and he is helpless to rectify the situation. Indeed, it is likely that he would not even be aware that the entry existed. \nThese tactics, as well as the possibility of coupling wiretapping and computer processing, undoubtedly will be extremely attractive to overzealous law-enforcement officers. Similarly, the ability to transfer into the National Data Center quantities of information maintained in nonfederal files—credit ratings, educational information from schools and universities, local and state tax information, and medical records—will enable governmental snoopers to obtain data that they have no authority to secure on their own.\nMore Notes From The Atlantic Felix Salmon Isn't Buying What Al Gore Is Selling Oct 14, 2015 When Black Leaders Were For More Incarceration Oct 14, 2015 Orbital View: A River Runs Through Tanzania Oct 14, 2015 Quoted Oct 14, 2015 Bill Gates's First Job Oct 14, 2015 Notes Home Most Popular On The Atlantic Kevin Morefield The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy Ross Andersen Astronomers have spotted a strange mess of objects whirling around a distant star.

I called to my wife and asked her where she’d put them. She was washing her face in the bathroom, running the faucet, and must not have heard me—she didn’t answer. I found the bag of nuts without her help and stirred a handful into my bowl. My phone was charging on the counter. Bored, I picked it up to check the app that wirelessly grabs data from the fitness band I’d started wearing a month earlier. I saw that I’d slept for almost eight hours the night before but had gotten a mere two hours of “deep sleep.” I saw that I’d reached exactly 30 percent of my day’s goal of 13,000 steps. And then I noticed a message in a small window reserved for miscellaneous health tips. “Walnuts,” it read. It told me to eat more walnuts.\n\r \r Continue Reading Maison Bonfils / Library of Congress / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic Raiders of the Lost Web Adrienne LaFrance If a Pulitzer-finalist 34-part series of investigative journalism can vanish from the web, anything can. \nThe web, as it appears at any one moment, is a phantasmagoria.

She was sharp and quick on her feet, well-prepared, aggressive when she needed to be, and flashed humor that didn’t sound like it was pre-tested by a staff of consultants. Just about all the pundits—including a few from The Atlantic —said so.\n\r \r But don’t be surprised if it’s Bernie Sanders who benefits just as much as Clinton from his performance at the Democratic debate—and possibly even more. For an insurgent like the Vermont senator, these initial contests are the first real chance to introduce himself to the country, and judging from the Democratic debate record of 15.3 million people who tuned in to CNN, there was a lot of interest in seeing Sanders take on Clinton. (It’s probably still a safe assumption that viewers weren’t all eager for a first look at Lincoln Chafee, Jim Webb, or even Martin O’Malley.) Sanders has been drawing enormous crowds on the campaign trail, but the multiplier of a prime-time television audience is incomparable. And viewers got to see a lot of Sanders: While Republican debaters have had to fight for a few minutes of airtime as they shared a stage with 10 other contenders, Sanders spoke for nearly a half hour on Tuesday , just a few minutes less than Clinton.\n\r \r Continue Reading Christopher Griffith The Planet-Saving, Capitalism-Subverting, Surprisingly Lucrative Investment Secrets of Al Gore James Fallows The former vice president has led his firm to financial success.

He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.\n\r \r Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Who Won the Democratic Debate?

Yet even though the debate kicked off with a melodramatic voiceover promising that “This night in Vegas could change the odds ... yet again,” the debate didn’t obviously shake up the race. Hillary Clinton delivered a typically strong performance, much as expected; Bernie Sanders played to type, railing against corporations and inequality.
