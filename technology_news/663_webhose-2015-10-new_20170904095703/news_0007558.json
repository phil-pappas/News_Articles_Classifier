With 40 being the new 20 and 60 being the new 40, post-retirement period these days brings more freedom and opportunity to be the owner of one’s own time, once again. In majority of the cases as children grow up and go away to build their own lives in the bigger outer world, the old couple entitled to the new status of senior citizens gets to rethink and redefine the course of life ahead. After having invested so much of their energy, emotions and thoughts in their children all these years, it is not easy to think anything fresh, different or beyond the kids so it is commonly seen that the old generally keep pining for the company and time of their children and grandchildren. In many cases tech generation grandparents have also taken to use e-mails, FaceTime and WhatsApp so that they can constantly check the pictures of their brood or keep interacting with them regularly. In order to bring some activity to their daily routine, women post 60 are often seen enjoying their daytime hours in one kitty party or the other. Whether it is just the fun times or religious gatherings, the time from after breakfast to before lunch is nicely taken care of. The men usually use early mornings and evenings for getting together in parks and discussing politics endlessly. There is absolutely no harm in socialising in this manner and in fact, these are some of the ways for the elderly people to remain active and connected with the society after they bid adieu to their work life. But can’t there be more to this period? The immense experience and wisdom which these elders usually have, aren’t we, as a society, simply missing out on it? The retirement period is usually perceived as a time for them to rest and they should not have to work. While no one is questioning their relaxed pace of life but can’t we ask for just couple of their hours a day because where they can make a difference none other can. It is understandable that this sounds a little daunting and intimidating, more so at this age but where there is a will there is bound to be a way. A bit of community service or social work can make a big difference in the community they are living in. A group of elderly people can get together and adopt a particular public place, for instance a park in the vicinity. With parks usually becoming a haven for either anti-social elements or romantic ones, a group of seasoned individuals can bring in the much-needed orderliness to reclaim the parks for everybody. All of us see, comment and criticise the plight of religious places and the surrounding areas, especially during festival time. For example, on the day of culmination of Navratras, mounds of food are being offered to little girls. People caught in the religious frenzy keep dumping more and more food to a few girls sitting outside the temples. The elderly of the vicinity can bring about a system in place and can use the same food to feed a greater number of hunger-stricken poor people. Yet another great way to utilise their time fruitfully is to gather children of house helps or children living in slum area around in groups and teach them. Virender Mehta, a retired bank manager, is doing just that. He teaches slum children at a special training centre run by an NGO Pahal. After he retired as a chief manager from State Bank of Patiala, Mehta has been taking evening classes in maths and English of children of migrant labourers at the Bhagat Singh Colony in Jalandhar. Indian women have always been very good with handiwork — be it stitching, tailoring, knitting, crocheting or cooking for that matter. Women can get together to conduct some vocational training for the underprivileged or needy. And all these activities can be organised by a group so that no one feels bogged down by the weight of commitment. Bangalore-based K. Narayan, a 65- year-old retired BSNL officer, teaches mathematics to the children of laundry men of his locality. Sukhbir Singh in Patiala has 'adopted' the park of his locality. He ensures that seasonal plants are planted at the right time, swings, benches and dustbins are in place and are used responsibly by all. Mumbai-based S. Sharma is a retired school teacher and does excellent crochet work. She teaches her young housemaid who has big dreams for her future and wants to run her own business of crochet home décor items. While the old should not do these things at the cost of their health, this interaction can be beneficial for them too, as these pursuits will make them more involved and connected with the people around them. The time spent for some philanthropic activity will give them satisfaction of having the time well spent. Geriatricians also say, “When elderly feel wanted and have a purpose in their lives, they live healthier, happier and longer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:56:48.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
