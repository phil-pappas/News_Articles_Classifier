Venkatesan | October 11, 2015, 07.58 am Representational Image New Delhi: A five-judge Constitution Bench headed by the Chief Justice of India H.L. Dattu will begin hearing on October 14 on a batch of applications from the Centre and others seeking to enlarge the use of Aadhaar card to avail a host of services on voluntary basis.\nThe CJI had told the Attorney General on Thursday that he will take a decision on the composition of the bench and the listing of the applications by Friday.\nAccordingly he has constituted the bench which will also include Justices M.Y. Eqbal, C. Nagappan, Arun Mishra and Amitav Roy.\nThe apex court by an interim order on August 11 had restricted the use of Aadhaar card for distribution of foodgrains under PDS, supply of kerosene oil and LPG only.\nThe three-judge bench referred to a larger bench the question whether right to privacy was a fundamental right â€” an issue rooted in the conflicting judgments of the apex court.\nAn eight-judge Bench in its 1954 judgment and later in 1964 by a bench of six judges had held that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right.\n attorney general H L Dattu Adhaar card Supreme Court nation Also Read Scribe's death: Centre for 'very fair inquiry'; Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal attend funeral Passengers safe as bus falls from bridge Bengaluru: Uber driver accused of abusing woman passenger Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, KCR meet a hush hush affair", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/nation-current-affairs/article/aadhaar-card-hearing-october-14", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Should%2520I%2520get%2520an%2520Aadhaar%2520or%2520not_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Should%2520I%2520get%2520an%2520Aadhaar%2520or%2520not_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:39:47.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
