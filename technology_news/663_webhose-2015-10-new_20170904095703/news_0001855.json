Share on twitter by Ben Potter Australia's regulated and uncompetitive markets are failing to breed a culture of digital competitiveness, especially in banking and telecommunications, a new report by PricewaterhouseCoopers says.\nJohn Riccio, PwC's digital services partner, nominated the big banks and telcos as prime examples of large corporations enjoying a lack of competition in the small local market and being spared the imperative of reinventing their core regulated businesses for the digital era.\n\"Where there are high barriers to entry . . . and regulations that prevent global players establishing an offer in the market, there is less of a \"burning platform\" in financial services,\" Mr Riccio told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"When you look at the value pools, most of the innovation and experimentation is in pools of value that are less regulated,\" he said. These include the payments system, which is less regulated than high street banking and has more competition.\nTelcos and the heavy-handed response of the established taxi industry and some jurisdictions to the rise of Uber were also examples of industries and authorities lacking digital readiness, Mr Riccio said.\n\"You can do one of two things: you can increase the level of regulation of new services being offered in the market to shut it down, or you can embrace it and reinvent the landscape of the taxi industry and determine how to coexist and adapt.\"\nThe PwC survey of multinational corporations found that Australian corporations' digital readiness score of 75 lagged the average of 77.2 and was a long way behind the front rank of multinationals (81).\nMr Riccio attributed the lagging digital readiness to a lack of the really fierce competition that global businesses expect in Australia's small and regulated markets, and a lack of the disruption that forces them to reinvent their entire businesses for the digital era.\n Behind global leaders Australian firms were consistently behind global leaders in having the chief executive champion digital transformation, giving executives responsible for digital transformation a role in overall business strategy, sharing information on digital strategy across the organisation and measuring outcomes of digital investments.\nThe most startling finding was that only 29 per cent of Australian respondents see digital strategy as embracing all investments made to integrate technology across the business, compared with 41 per cent globally.\nAs a result Australian firms are more likely to see digital as a technology issue, funnel most of their digital budgets into information technology and blame technology for failed strategies. They were less likely to see it as a spur to disruption and whole business reinvention.\nReaping the full benefits of digital technology requires \"fundamental business transformation\", Mr Riccio said.\n\"It's not just technology. It's how do you transform your business model and your products and services to exploit digital technology?\n\"Unless companies are looking at investments in digital and investments in innovation to drive better experiences for the customer . . . they are doing it for the wrong reason.\"\nMr Riccio said Australian retail was an example of a business that had once lagged behind global competitors but had been forced to get up to speed by offshore online retail competition during the high-dollar years and was now reaping benefits.\n\"A truly 'digital' business is one that focuses on wider issues of disruption, engagement, digitisation and trust,\" he said.\n\"Technology should be viewed as a means of enabling this. Real transformation is about business change and leadership buy-in, attributes that emerged from the survey's most successful companies.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:23:01.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
