Threads by SendGrid empowers marketers with the ability to send a hyper-relevant message to a user at the right time â€“ strengthening customer engagement, retention, loyalty and driving revenue. Existing marketing tools are often focused on either sending the same campaign to large swaths of customers, or emphasize a narrow set of automation use cases. Threads by SendGrid greatly expands the possibilities available for marketers by providing an easy to use, extremely flexible and powerful way to build workflows and trigger specific customer actions.\nThreads by SendGrid collects data about different kinds of actions that users take within a website or application including signups, webpage views, feature usage or mobile app activity. This data is then available to trigger personalized engagement via email to drive the user to take an action such as upgrade their account, make a purchase or complete the on-boarding process. Available today for email engagement, Threads by SendGrid will also support integration with other service providers and engagement mechanisms such as push notifications in the future.\n\"We're excited to expand our email platform for our customers and evolve as a leader in delivering transactional email to now offer triggered and behavioral email, with more email marketing products to come in the near future,\" said Sameer Dholakia , CEO of SendGrid. \"Threads by SendGrid is an important step towards delivering on our vision of becoming a cross-channel communication platform, which includes the ability to support customer engagement via SMS, push and in-app notifications.\"\nThreads by SendGrid is built on top of SendGrid's proven, cloud-based email platform which delivers 20 billion emails per month and provides industry-leading delivery and support infrastructure. SendGrid offers strong inbox delivery rates, best-in-class scalability, and the largest support and account management services team in the industry.\n\"This product makes sending, customizing, and A/B testing triggered emails a breeze compared to building a similar product in-house,\" said Anna Sergeeva , growth hacker, Instructables. \"The Threads team is also incredibly responsive and always willing to offer individual help whenever we have questions.\"\nAbout SendGrid\nSendGrid is the leading email delivery platform for email that matters.
