Boomerang takes a burst of photos and stitches them together into a high-quality mini video that plays forward and back. The design is as simple as it gets: press a button and the app does the rest. No login required. The backstage booth is formed of a semi-circle of LED screens playing fast moving images, which will generate live action Booms. The videos will be shared on talent’s own Instagram accounts throughout the event and on MTV EMAs Instagram account. \nMore Partners \nMTV and Snapchat are also partnering to bring fans closer to the action of the EMAs. Snapchat will be covering the event through a MTV EMA Live Story and have custom MTV EMA geofilters available to Snapchatters attending the show. Additionally, MTV will feature exclusive EMA content from the red carpet, main show and backstage on its international Snapchat Discover channel. Additionally, the network will feature live content on Vine, Facebook and Twitter throughout the night, and will live-stream backstage moments via Periscope. \nOn the night of the 2015 MTV EMAs, the network will unveil MTV Canvas. Created with To.Be , Canvas is an online tool that gives the audience freedom to create and play with the brand and pop culture, making their own visual art with music, backdrops and more. The pre-loaded content will be refreshed on an ongoing basis, starting with MTV EMA-themed assets.
