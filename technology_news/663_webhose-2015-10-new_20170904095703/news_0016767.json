Forsberg says Tu Youyou's discovery has \"markedly reduced the death toll during the last decade\" from malaria, while discoveries by William Campbell and Satoshi Omura have contributed to dramatically reducing the number of individuals affected each year from \"the stigmatizing and disabling symptoms\" of river blindness and elphentiasis. Forssberg says the discoveries represent a paradigm shift in medicine that also has a positive effect on society as a whole. He says: \"By allowing children to go to school and adults to go to work the treatment helps them to avoid poverty and contributes to an economic boost in society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:47:56.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
