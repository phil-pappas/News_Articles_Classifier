He watched the propeller separate from the nose of the plane and disappear over his cockpit.\nHe was about 2500 feet, or 760m above the ground, sent a mayday message, and landed safely on a deserted beach at Keurboomstrand, east of Plettenberg Bay.\nIn the Civil Aviation Authority's report on the incident the cause was determined as \"catastrophic engine failure\". The engine seized and the propeller was sheared off its bolts.\nThis was just one of 120 accidents the CAA investigated in the financial year between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2015. A total of 26 people were killed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:03:48.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
