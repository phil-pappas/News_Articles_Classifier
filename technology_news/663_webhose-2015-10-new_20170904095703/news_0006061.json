EMC had been under growing pressure from activist investors, who had prodded the company to better exploit the value of VMware Inc., which accounts for roughly half EMC's market value but 35% of its revenue.\nIn the latest quarter, VMware's revenue rose 10% but EMC took a $48 million loss from its 80% stake in the company, which Dell is also acquiring. The loss widened from $40 million a year earlier.\nVMware, which provides virtualization software that allows servers and other technology equipment to run more efficiently, on Tuesday night reported disappointing bookings and issued light revenue guidance for the year.\nShares in VMware fell 16% in early trading.\n\"VMware's stock will be at center stage,\" as softer bookings and a disappointing outlook weigh on shares \"and remains a lingering concern of EMC shareholders, given the structure of the deal,\" according to analysts at FBR & Co. A big chunk of Dell's bid for EMC is tied to VMware's stock.\n\"While business at EMC seems stable, which is a positive, the same cannot be said for VMware,\" FBR analysts said.\nMeanwhile, in EMC's core information infrastructure business, revenue fell 3% but rose 2% when currency fluctuations are stripped out. A jump in storage revenue helped counter softer storage sales. In the company's Pivotal unit, a data analytics and cloud-computing business, revenue increased a currency-adjusted 18%.\nIn all, EMC reported a profit of $480 million, or 25 cents a share, down from $587 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Excluding certain items and aided by a lower share count, per-share slipped a penny to 43 cents.\nRevenue edged 0.8% higher to $6.08 billion. Analysts expected 44 cents in earnings per share on $6.17 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\nOverhead expenses increased 7.8% to $2.15 billion and EMC booked a $68 million expense stemming from restructuring and acquisition-related charges, up from $39 million a year earlier.\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@wsj.com\n 21, 2015 10:31 ET (14:31 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:07:46.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
