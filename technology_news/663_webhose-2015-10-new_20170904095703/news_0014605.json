This can be especially problematic in work environments where the second screen is used to display information but requires little to no interactivity. \nThe free program Dual Display Mouse Manager provides a solution for these situations. Basically, it enables you to pick one out of two methods to make the crossing of screens less fluent. \nThe first method, enabled by default and on launch, blocks the mouse from leaving a monitor connected to the system for 150 milliseconds. This gives you enough reaction time to stop the mouse cursor from leaving the display it is on. \nYou may change the delay in the program preferences, useful if you want to increase or decrease that time period. \nThe second option prevents the crossing of borders completely unless the Ctrl-key is pressed at the same time. \nShould you get stuck at any time, use Ctrl-Alt-D to resolve the situation. The third and final shortcut the application makes available is Ctrl-~ which allows you to jump between regions directly. \nDual Display Mouse Manager is set to detect screens automatically and does a good job at that usually. You may however switch from the program's automatic control mode to manual mode instead if you notice that things are not working as they should be. \nIf you do, you may add left, right, top and bottom dimensions for the screens in the interface manually. A handy preview option is provided to test these settings before you apply them. \nClosing Words \nDual Display Mouse Manager is a handy program for users who work on multi-monitor systems. While it may not be beneficial to all users, it may be worth a try for users who switch between screens accidentally and want to prevent that from happening. \nThe program does an excellent job and the only thing missing is an option to define custom keyboard shortcuts. \nPlease note that it requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or higher. \nNow You : Do you work on multi-monitor systems?
