How have those requirements evolved? \nA: Our primary requirement was a scalable work order system. In Corrigo, we realized that we can now have work order management and CMMS in the same system. Corrigo Enterprise will integrate seamlessly with the rest of our technology stack, enabling us to continue to eliminate manual touchpoints. \nWe also liked the ability to pull in our current vendor base, and also access an already-vetted base of additional vendors. We know that, as we grow, we will continue to add new vendor relationships. The Work Order Network is a validation point that we will leverage as we grow and seek new vendors and service providers to grow with us. \nThis may sound surprising, for a technology decision. But, at the end of the day, we actually signed up for the people. Corrigo has the right people, and they are aligned with helping us achieve our objectives. They have the can-do attitude of a busines partner, not the typical mentality of many software vendors. \nQ: What will this partnership mean for Pristine and their clients? \nA: FM is a pretty low tech space today. We redefine that for our clients. \nPristine brings the innate knowledge of FM and building management. We are investing in technology to streamline how we deliver our services. Our core competency from a tech perspective is understanding what systems are capable of doing, and making sure our clients receive the appropriate data to understand their buildings. Pristine is one of the few companies in our space making a strategic investment in IT to deliver that insight back to the client. \nThis partnership is also an example of our investments in best-of-breed technologies to grow the business even more. Our current stack is already quite solid. As we scale, our processes and the data we provide to our clients will need to evolve. Corrigo Enterprise is a proven system that will adapt to our requirements as we grow, and enable us to anticipate our clients' needs before they ask. \nQ: You have a great IT team on staff. Why did you choose to work with Corrigo instead of building your own proprietary platform? \nA: Can we build our own system? Yes. We have that capability. But a better use of our time is to partner with the right platform solution, and focus on configuring the platform to reflect our business requirements as they evolve. With Corrigo, we own every aspect we need to own, and we will continue to stay ahead of the requirements of our customers. \nPristine Environments \nPristine Environments manages, maintains and optimizes the performance of mission critical facilities for corporate real estate owners in nearly 100 million square feet of specialized buildings throughout North America.
