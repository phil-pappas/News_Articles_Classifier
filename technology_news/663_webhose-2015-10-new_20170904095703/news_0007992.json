The new business will operate under the Virtustream brand and is expected to have hundreds of millions of dollars in recurring revenue next year.\nResults from the business will be consolidated into VMware's financial statements starting in the first quarter of 2016.\nMeanwhile, VMware said revenue grew 10% to $1.67 billion in the third quarter, in line with the guidance the company gave when it reported preliminary third-quarter results earlier this month.\nVMware's profit grew to $256 million, or 60 cents a share, from $194 million, or 45 cents a year earlier.\nExcluding certain items, per-share earnings rose to $1.02 a share from 87 cents a share a year earlier.\nAnalysts had forecast earnings of $1 a share on revenue of $1.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\nDell is expected to open $1 billion in new opportunities for VMware to sell its virtualization software, which makes computers more efficient by allowing them to run more than one operating system simultaneously.\nHowever, VMware can't appear to favor Dell in ways that would hurt its customers that buy servers from Hewlett-Packard Inc. or Lenovo Group Ltd.--Dell's arch rivalsâ€”or that could hurt it in the virtualization market, where VMware competes with Microsoft Corp., Red Hat Inc. and a variety of alternatives.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 20, 2015 17:35 ET (21:35 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:38.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
