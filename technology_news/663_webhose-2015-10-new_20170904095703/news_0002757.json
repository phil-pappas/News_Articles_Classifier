Drones can be used for play, fun, photography and videos too. However, there are known facts that a drone is also used for terrorism and also to invade on privacy. Highly secure government organizations, military zones and airports are some of the highly restricted areas where drones are not allowed.\nBut how do you restrict these zoned that can be a cause of concern? You cannot identify a drone by its looks. It could be a friendly toy or can be a serious threat. There is no way you can know the intention of the person flying the drone into your area.\nThis has been a great cause of concern and anti-drone weapons are being developed. These weapons are used to shoot down drones in a safer way without any collateral damage. The weapon is a simple radio wave emitting gun, which shoots microwave signals to the drone from a far distance and disturbs the electronics on it. The drone slowly falls to the ground and gets disabled immediately.\nThe Battelle DroneDefender uses radio control frequency disruption technologies to safely stop drones in the air, before they can pose a threat to military or civilian safety. DroneDefender is an inexpensive, easy-to-use, lightweight, point-and-shoot system with a demonstrated range of 400 meters. DroneDefender provides instant threat mitigation, quickly disrupting the drone so that no remote action, including detonation can occur in sensitive areas. This minimizes drone damage and the risk to public safety. This innovative device has a cold start time of <0.1 seconds and an operating time of five hours continuous. It weighs less than 10 pounds, depending on how it is configured. Check the video below to see how it operates and how effective it really is.\n gadgets drones Also Read Fly Snap: An ideal first phone Gapgate is not a flaw, actually a feature by Samsung Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus images spill online Milky Way may be 50 per cent larger than previously believed", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BattleDefender%20%281%29.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151017/technology-science-and-trends/article/heres-effective-weapon-shoot-down-drones-safely", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/BattleDefender%20%281%29.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BattleDefender%20%282%29.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:51:30.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
