Kids Helpline - 1800 55 1800; Lifeline - 13 11 14.\nPT1M8S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Mysterious death of 13-year-old YouTube star Caleb David Kyre is living a parent's worst nightmare. Seven months ago his son Daniel left home to pursue his dreams in the big city. The madcap YouTube videos he made with a couple of his mates as \" Cyndago \" were so popular that Mark Fischbach aka Markiplier , one of YouTube's biggest stars with nearly 10 million subscribers, signed them up. Success for the talented young musician and filmmaker seemed assured.\nA growing string of YouTube hits most recently included \"We Dye our Hair!\" showing a visit to the hairdressers and the companion music video \"Blond Boyz\".\nCyndago members (from left) Matt Watson, Ryan Magee and Daniel Kyre.

I never heard back. An hour later I heard from an LA ambulance asking me if I am the father of Daniel Kyre.\"\nAdvertisement Daniel had been found in critical condition in his room after a suicide attempt in the house he shared with Fischbach and his Cyndago buddies from South Carolina, Ryan Magee and Matt Watson. He had suffered irreversible brain damage from an undisclosed cause, and he was taken off life support two days later.\nIt might be just another LA story except that Daniel's suicide has played out in the minds of millions of teenagers worldwide via YouTube. They are processing the loss of someone they felt close to, and their parents may not have a clue.\nMark Fuschbach (left), aka Markiplier, with Daniel Kyre. Photo: YouTube\n\"To minimise or trivialise this is a big mistake,\" says Michael Carr-Gregg, child and adolescent child psychologist and managing director of the Australian-based Young and Well Co-operative Research Centre.\n\"A lot of parents don't understand that there are now in the lives of many young people 'cewebrities', literally cult heroes who are not part of the mainstream media.\"\n\"This guy without a doubt is a peer icon. Even though they don't know him personally, the death [can] assume the same level of significance and is as important as when John Lennon died [for older people].\"\nThe death of YouTuber Daniel Kyre is being widely mourned on social media. Photo: Pinterest\nDr Carr-Gregg said it could be a \"teachable moment\" for parents with teenagers. \"It is a wonderful opportunity to talk about the irreversibility and finality of death.\"\nThe first inkling for many of the tragedy to come was a tweet from Markiplier:\nSomething very serious has happened. I won't be able to make videos for quite a while.\n— Markiplier (@markiplier) September 17, 2015\nThen from one of the Cyndago boys a couple of days later:\nIt was a beautiful journey that I'll never forget. I'll always miss you. You'll always be my brother. Thank you Daniel. I love you.\n— Ryan Magee (@elirymagee) September 20, 2015\nCyndago posted on Facebook \"some very important and tragic news regarding Cyndago and our future\". Daniel was dead and Cyndago was finished. They had no plans to release any further videos, podcasts or songs. They urged anyone with suicidal thoughts or depression to get help.\n\"We're truly sorry that a story that brought so many people happiness had to have such a sad ending.\" They have since promised a final upload \"addressing the current situation\".\nThe final Cyndago upload(s) will be posted on October 10th, 2015. Thank you for being patient and thank you for supporting our dreams.\n— Cyndago (@Cyndago) October 4, 2015 Markiplier, 26, posted a tearful eight-minute piece to camera telling fans there were a \"lot of raw feelings right now\" and \"a lot of unanswered questions\".\n\"I just want everyone to know that we are handling it, we are trying to move forward as best we can. Just send a lot of love to the other guys, they really need it right now.\"\nThat video has been viewed 5.77 million times. He then \"went dark\" on YouTube before resurfacing this week with a 13-minute vlog which has clocked 1.86 million views.\nI am finally back! And there's a lot of things to talk about: https://t.co/eTbtP8dPBN\n— Markiplier (@markiplier) October 5, 2015 He said he was cleaning the house and getting a dog and a cat and waiting for Matt and Ryan to return from South Carolina. He would be seeing a therapist and his output would be only one video a day for a while, but: \"I finally feel I am in a good enough place to start coming back.\"\n\"I loved every single thing that I learned from Daniel and I never want that to be tainted and I never want to be afraid of that.\"\nIn older generations, such public, detailed airing of grief may appear unseemly but Dr Carr-Gregg welcomes it. \"The great thing about the online environment is it literally puts into practice what Shakespeare said about giving sorrow words. It is encouraging kids to write down their thoughts and feelings.\"\nChildren's eSafety Commissioner Alastair MacGibbon said young people experienced on-line relationships as \"very intense and intimate\" and just as significant as their offline relationships.\n\"We need to respect that,\" he said. \"I can't overemphasise the importance of parents having active conversations with their kids, of actually knowing that they don't just watch funny cat videos but are impacted by a whole lot of other activities online.\"\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak whispers\nthe o'er fraught heart, and bids it break.\n- William Shakespeare, King John Act III\nKids Helpline - 1800 55 1800; Lifeline - 13 11 14", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Cyndago/status/650804401414737920", "https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/651102116434436096", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_YxT-KID8kRbqZo7MyscQ", "https://www.facebook.com/Cyndago?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/elirymagee/status/645489446222188544", "https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/644340125195857920", "https://www.youtube.com/user/Cyndago", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_cxoZLPyR0", "https://t.co/eTbtP8dPBN"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:50:40.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
