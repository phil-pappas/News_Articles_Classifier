Currently, we are conducting a survey with the commuters to have their feedback on the product and to find out what prices and designs would be ideal.” \nThe survey will provide the RTA with information that will enable it to devise a business model, and also come up with designs and prices for the watches. \n“We are looking at various designs, particularly targeting the youth. We also [looking at] trendy colours for men and women. The prices will depend on the design and feature of the products, but we will keep it in the affordable range,” Al Awadhi added. \nCredit card details can also be loaded onto the device, which will do everything that a regular Nol card does. \n“People will be able to use the NFC-enabled watches to pay for metro, bus and taxi fares as well as using [them] to for shopping through the embedded credit card. The watches will have Nol top ups through top-up machines, ticket counters or though mobile apps,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:14:49.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
