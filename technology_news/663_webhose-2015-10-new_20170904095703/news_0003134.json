There is not a lack of capital here, nor is there a poor track record of investor returns.\nMost ventures that are world-class, coherent and have a great team can raise money, both domestically and overseas. Companies like Bigcommerce, Atlassian, Google Maps and Campaign Monitor are proving the point.\nAn effective ecosystem is not one where everyone who wants to be a successful entrepreneur can do so. An effective entrepreneurial ecosystem involves limited barriers for great entrepreneurs to get on with building great companies.\nThe good thing about raising domestically at the moment is that many venture funds are not fully deployed, and there is less competition for money from global rivals than in places such as California.\nTrimantium Capital founder and Henley Club president Phillip Kingston. Ben Pedrochi The lack of venture capital is an easy excuse for avoiding the hard truth that at this point in time, our ecosystem does not offer a comparative advantage in software based technology, compared with other nations.\nBut the real problems are not insurmountable. We just need to re-think government intervention in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and fast.\nRethink government intervention and make superannuation fund investment cheaper Governments should not be providing capital for startup incubators and office space. It's not the government's role or expertise to pick winners in any form.\n The Federal Labor Party's announcement on HECS-style loans for entrepreneurial university graduates is no doubt well-intentioned, and a relatively small burden on the Budget, but it distracts government from the role it should be playing and introduces an artificial mechanism to prop up startups that will eventually be unsuccessful.\nIn the long term, government should be focused on strengthening and expanding STEM education in schools and universities.\nIn the short term, we would welcome useful government intervention such as a 1 per cent management fee subsidy for superannuation funds who invest in venture capital. This would unlock the large amounts of capital tied up in superannuation funds, stimulating the innovation ecosystem, creating jobs and economic growth.\nSuch a subsidy would bridge the \"fee gap\" that exists between venture capital management and less time-intensive asset management within superannuation, dramatically reducing the real barriers to scaling venture capital and creating $100 of venture capital for every $1 of taxpayer's money spent.\nIncentivise high priests of tech to move here with tax exemptions Despite no doubt being unpopular, the Australian Federal Government would have the highest return on investment by giving a life-long capital gains tax exemption to the top 20 tech investors in the world to move to Australia, domicile their companies here and keep the balance of their staff and IP in the country.\nCouple this with coherent immigration policy, and the ecosystem will develop at unprecedented speed and quality with no net cost to the taxpayer.\nThe Australian venture capital industry is often criticised for having inexperienced fund managers. We can lift the intellectual capital behind decision making and venture support by attracting experienced venture capital fund managers to Australia.\nOne just has to look at the \"PayPal Mafia\" made up of most of the pillars of the San Francisco-Silicon Valley tech ecosystem and see almost none of whom were born in the USA: Elon Musk in South Africa, Max Levchin in Ukraine and Peter Thiel in Germany. Yet they have created a disproportionate amount of value for American investors and consumers.\nWe also just need more hard working people with tech skills in the economy, a lot of them and quickly.\nOpt-out super and minimise punitive taxes and forced costs on emerging companies The plethora of forced costs before a company's maturity such as payroll tax and superannuation make it a very expensive place to do business. The tax impact of payroll tax on the state is limited but debilitating for an emerging company.\nAllowing employees of startups to opt-out of compulsory superannuation guarantee payments for up to 12 months would alleviate the wage burden by 9.5 per cent per year.\nThe Coalition Government theoretically improved the Employee Share Scheme rules, reversing the changes from 2009 but still included debilitating limitations such as a maximum share ownership level eligible for tax deferral of only 10 per cent.\nUnsophisticated legislative frameworks and overly complex employee share scheme laws make it very challenging to do business here.\nBy the time you understand whether or not you have triggered a phantom capital gains tax event, the business opportunity has evaporated. Real ESS reform should be an immediate national priority to stimulate a systemic improvement in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nInform government and industry body decision making with accurate data Much of the serious investing in Australia does not happen through formal venture capital structures and so it evades the statistics.\nWhile some investors do have exposure in structures like Square Peg Capital and Blackbird Ventures, the vast majority of significant early-stage investing happens directly from individuals, family offices, corporates or conglomerate structures.\nAs a result, the data that is used as the basis of discussion, media reporting, asset allocation within superannuation funds and policy decision making is incomplete. This is not easy to solve, as these investors are usually very private but the limitations of the data need to be understood.\nPhillip Kingston is the founder of venture capital and investment firm Trimantium Capital, and a serial technology entrepreneur and investor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:17:23.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
