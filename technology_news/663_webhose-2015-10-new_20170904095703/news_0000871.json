Bruce's presentation, \"Why Marketing Has Become More Important Than Sales,\" will be held Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2:30 p.m . Add to your conference schedule . \nAbout the Session: Why Marketing Has Become More Important Than Sales \nSuccessfully attracting today's highly informed consumer to the dealership has become a formidable business challenge for automobile retailers. \nBefore the Internet, the only way to see a car and get a price was to visit the dealership. Now, web-based and mobile technologies put all of that information about a vehicle and about a dealership at consumers' fingertips. \nConsumers increasingly are using the information they gather online to determine which car to buy and which dealership to visit. When these consumers finally walk into a dealership, they often know what car they want to buy and how much they want to pay for it. \nTo help dealers' take advantage of this trend, Bruce's session will focus on digital marketing strategies dealers can use to better identify, engage, and persuade consumers to choose the dealership and make a vehicle purchase. \nHe also will help dealers learn how to more effectively identify their market for vehicle sales, connect with consumers in that market, and promote the dealership. \nAbout the Speaker \nNaked Lime Vice President Larry Bruce is a 30-year veteran of retail automotive and digital marketing.
