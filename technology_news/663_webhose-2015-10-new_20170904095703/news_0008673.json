The rebranding reinforces Mopro's market position as the pioneer and leader of Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) websites that are beautiful, high-quality and affordable — further threatening Do-It-Yourself (DIY) website services as the company primes itself for a new wave of growth. \"Business owners are busy running their businesses — they don't have time to deal with DIY site builders, unreliable freelancers, or expensive digital agencies that build sites that quickly become out of date as technology evolves,\" said founder and CEO Cary Levine . \n\"That's why we handle everything for them. Our artificial intelligence engine completely analyzes their digital presence and builds their new site in under 24 hours. That's unprecedented. People have been rallying to put technology to work for them like this without knowing it's possible — it's happening now. We complement that with seven-day-a-week support and a product suite that's always evolving, so as technology changes, so will their site.\"\nWith its new tagline, Mopro confidently declares the end of DIY websites for time-pressed business owners. \"When they first preview their new site, which we build for them at no cost, I think the reaction we get most is just total relief. Like this confusing jumble of technology gets lifted from their shoulders,\" said Levine.\nThe new Mopro.com shows a simplified logo and further exemplifies that Mopro does so much more than build dream websites. Mopro provides its customers with one digital ecosystem that has everything they need to simply manage their online presence. Key Mopro products/services include: a branded iPhone app, mobile optimization, infographic analytics, a loyalty and rewards system, custom HD video and photography, plus tools for social publishing, reputation management and competition tracking.\nTo learn more about Mopro, please visit Mopro.com or call (844) 207-9038.\nAbout Mopro\nBased in Orange County, Calif. , Mopro makes the same high-quality digital products and services previously only available to the biggest brands affordable for businesses of any size.
