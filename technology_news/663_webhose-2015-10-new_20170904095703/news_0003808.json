The company wants to get more than a billion devices running on Windows 10 in the coming years and one way of making sure that this is going to happen is through the free upgrade offer to Windows 10. \nThat's probably one of the main reasons why the company decided to push updates to previous versions of Windows via Windows Update that let users download and install Windows 10 with minimal effort. \nWhile some users have problems getting these offers displayed on their system, others made the decision to block the offer from being installed on their computer. \nThis can be done manually by blocking certain Windows updates that power the offer or automatically by running software like I Don't Want Windows 10 . \nWhile hiding those updates should do the trick, it seems that this is not enough to block these updates permanently on Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs as users have reported that they have reappeared after blocking them. \nIn addition to that, some users have reported that at least one of the updates is marked as important which means that it will be installed automatically if automatic updates are enabled. \nHere is the list of updates that got re-released recently by Microsoft: Update installs Get Windows 10 app in Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 SP1 ( KB3035583 ) - This update powers the Get Windows 10 notification on Windows 7 and 8.1 systems. Compatibility update for upgrading Windows 7 ( KB2952664 ) - The patch enables daily telemetry runs on Windows PCs. Compatibility update for Windows 7 RTM ( KB2977759 ) - This update performs diagnostics on the Windows systems that participate in the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program. Windows Update Client for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2: October 2015 ( KB3083710 ) - It is unclear what this update does as the description does not reveal the update's purpose. Compatibility update for Windows 8.1 and Windows 8 ( KB2976978 ) - This update performs diagnostics on the Windows systems that participate in the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program. Windows Update Client for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2: October 2015 ( KB3083711 ) - Similar to 3083710 but for Windows 8.1 and Server 2012. \nIf you don't want to upgrade to Windows 10, you may want to evaluate updates released for your current operating system carefully to avoid installing updates that prepare it for the upgrade to Windows 10 (via Infoworld ). \nNow You : What are you doing to block these updates from being installed? Summary Windows 10 patches make a return on Windows 7 and 8 Author Martin Brinkmann Description Microsoft re-released several patches that advertise Windows 10 or prepare previous Windows versions for the upgrade to Windows 10.

I can't accept that the OS has become malware and/or spyware. anon October 9, 2015 at 2:09 pm # \nAnd it hasn't. Getting rid of old OS users is completely understandable. Reply tecn0tarded October 9, 2015 at 2:32 pm # \nI've moved all my computers to Linux Mint and formatted my windows 7 and 10 images. Everything works and the security is phenomenal. I will be donating to the Linux Mint team. Reply insanelyapple October 9, 2015 at 2:18 pm # \nAnd again I do wonder, why they are so eager to push everyone to W10? And I won't believe that this is done for good of customer/client/user - not after knowing how \"telemetry\" and their privacy policy is stripping down every single person from privacy, not after pushing that shit it to Windows 7. \nSo, a subscription model of OS despite of current statements? Or maybe they discovered that \"telemetry\" data in long term can be profitable much more than selling licenses? \nAnd as for updates, I'm trying to read descriptions of these and keep my Windows 7 clean - sadly, we can't be never sure what they smuggling inside these. I am a tinfoil hat? Perhaps, but being ignorant and servile is worse alternative. Reply Tom Hawack October 9, 2015 at 2:50 pm # \n\"Or maybe they discovered that \"telemetry\" data in long term can be profitable much more than selling licenses?\" I've been wondering about this possibility as well. Inquisition of privacy is a jackpot. Reply clas October 9, 2015 at 2:35 pm # \nmartin, the top thing i am doing about windows sneaky updates is to heavily rely on your blog and the critical information you keep us informed of.. i have updates disabled and am very selective about any that i install. (win7). thanks for being a front line of defense for our privacy. Reply Nilsenth October 9, 2015 at 2:39 pm # \nJust want to say thanks for the heads up on this, and thanks for a great techno blog. Tom Hawack October 9, 2015 at 2:47 pm # \nThere they go again. No Windows automatic updates of course and lengthy investigation of proposed updates before installing them or not. I'd add when reading this news : more than ever. More than ever as well am I blocked to the very idea of installing Windows 10. Meanwhile the little remaining of sympathy I still had for Microsoft nevertheless is melting when I tend to believe that Microsoft doesn't give the slightest damn about users. Microsoft can go to hell. Mike J. October 9, 2015 at 3:00 pm # \nI disabled Windows Update in Services. Anything relating to remote is disabled. Ann October 9, 2015 at 3:18 pm # \nreading you site and NOT blocking (KB2952664) - The patch enables daily telemetry runs on Windows PCs. So MS knows I won't upgrade. Reply DVD Rambo October 9, 2015 at 3:29 pm # \nI disabled Automatic Updates and will manually check in the future. It seems that someone or some group at Microsoft is trying to win a bet or get a bonus for reaching Windows 10 installs milestones. We're just pawns now. Reply wybo October 9, 2015 at 3:55 pm # \nIndeed I can also report that on Tuesday there was an \"important\" update which I have hidden in the past. They really want to push KB 3035583. \nI certainly will never upgrade to Win 10 way to many privacy issues. On top of that free is never really free. Nebulus October 9, 2015 at 4:03 pm # \n\"What are you doing to block these updates from being installed?\" I don't use Windows Updates, and I apply only the security patches (using WSUSOffline to get them) - and that happens only after informing myself about what kind of things can go wrong when applying them. \nAn no, I didn't have any security incidents because of this. :)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:09:48.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
