A testament to SAS' focus on customer needs, the company also ranked number one for purchase momentum. \nTemkin Group surveyed IT decision makers from more than 800 large North American firms whose annual revenues exceed $250 million. The questions probed participants' experiences as clients of different tech vendors, with results generating Net Promoter Scores® (NPS®). Effective for measuring loyalty, the NPS calculates the likelihood that customers will recommend a company to friends and colleagues. \nAt nearly double the 2015 industry average of 31.8, SAS' NPS is 57. \nSAS also earned the highest ranking for purchase momentum, based on how respondents expected their 2015 spending to change from last year. Analysis predicts that IT decision makers are more likely to purchase from SAS than other vendors included in the survey. \n\"Our reputation is only as good as our customers' last experience,\" said Wilson Raj, global director of customer intelligence at SAS. \"The data validates what we've always known: SAS leads the industry in customer loyalty and satisfaction. Who better should be advising customers on developing their own customer experience programs?\" \nSAS demonstrates its commitment to customers by investing 23 percent of its revenue into research and development.
