ANYANG, SOUTH KOREA, October 14,   IoT smart device company Knowck (CEO Kim Jung-ho, www.knowck.com ) launched its new smart signage set-top box \"CloudCast\" in the domestic market. \"CloudCast\", also known as Castbox, is a new conceptual smart signage set-top box in which users can control displays. Smart signage is an advertising platform that combines media and existing digital signage that plays videos and shows pictures. Knowck's \"CloudCast\" is a console/platform that can control signage remotely and simulate contents. The great advantage of \"CloudCast\" is that anyone can use it, as it is small and can be easily installed. One simply has to connect \"CloudCast\" to an HDMI port of a display and the Internet. After that, users' devices are automatically recognized when they log into their accounts on Cloud Console ( www.cloud-cast.com ). This device is distinguishable from other Android set-top boxes in the domestic market. It is thin and lightweight, still possessing high performance quad-core chipsets and many connection terminals. Also, it provides an intuitive UX from users' points of view. Anyone can easily control the platform, as it is like installing and using a smartphone app. The performance of its quad-core CPU and GPU is the best in the field. \"CloudCast\" not only loads apps but also implements motion, exact timing, image quality, and frames. In particular, it can handle high-quality contents, smoothly playing high-resolution videos and 3D graphics. The most notable feature is that users, with no extra charge, can still use most of the functions of existing digital signage. Once the product is purchased, they can use the set-top box's basic applications without paying additional money. Users are able to download various free apps or purchase needed apps from app stores, including media broadcasting, digital boards, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, real-time weather, digital menu boards, and design clocks. Knowck CEO Kim Jung-ho said: \"We are providing third-party services by opening developers' websites and distributing SDK to overcome limitations of application-only usage, which are designed for smart signage.\" # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:15:21.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
