We’re now seeing an inflection point in the market where brand advertising dollars increasingly having a mobile focus as well,” said Daniel Meehan, CEO of PadSquad. “As brand advertising budgets cascade into mobile, this will force the industry to innovate around topics such as creativity and unique mobile ad placements, along with data such as viewability and engagement specific to mobile devices. These are the areas in which PadSquad has been investing for three years.” \nPadSquad has released a suite of proprietary mobile ad units that can only be found across its exclusive publisher platform. This has fueled PadSquad’s ability to outperform mobile industry benchmarks with remarkable viewability (+63%) and engagement (+52%) rates that enable advertisers to achieve campaign-specific goals. \nThe growth in mobile brand advertising revenue isn’t the only component of PadSquad’s market traction. Digital publishers are increasingly struggling with the mobile gap phenomenon as audiences that use mobile devices to consume content is exploding while mobile monetization is lagging behind. Using its mobile software that is integrated into publishers’ Content Management Systems, PadSquad detects mobile visits to their clients’ content and adapts the styling, formatting, user experience and ad placements in real-time to optimize for mobile. The footprint of publishers who use PadSquad’s software to manage their mobile business has grown a whopping 1,000 percent in the last 12 months. \n“Unfortunately for digital publishers, the tremendous growth in mobile traffic has far outpaced the market’s ability to monetize mobile inventory at the moment. This can result in significantly lower revenue yields for publishers across their large mobile audiences,” Meehan describes. “I think that’s what is fueling our software growth. Publishers want a solution that delivers an intelligent user experience for mobile, maximizes mobile revenue, and illustrates the results all in one place.” \nPadSquad expects to further expand its publisher footprint significantly with soon-to-be released version of Simpli; it’s publisher management platform that debuted in April 2015.

Successful introduction and adoption of over a dozen new proprietary and first-to-market mobile advertising products during the first half of 2015.
