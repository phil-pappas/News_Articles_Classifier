That technology crossover tripped up United Airlines after its merger with Continental. \nWith the results American joined Delta United and Southwest in reporting higher profits in the latest quarter as lower fuel prices trumped flat or falling revenue. \nAmerican's shares rose 1.81 or 3.9 percent to 47.80 in premarket trading about an hour before Friday's opening bell. They ended Thursday down 14 percent so far this year. \nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. said that excluding special items related to its merger and other things such as technology help adjusted profit was 1.9 billion the highest in any quarter in American's history. At 2.77 per share the results matched the expectation of 15 analysts surveyed by FactSet and beat the 2.72 per share forecast of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. \nRevenue however fell 4 percent on evidence of lower average airfares. The 10.71 billion total was slightly less than the FactSet and Zacks forecasts of 10.72 billion. \nAmerican doesn't disclose average fares but yield or the amount that passengers pay for each mile they fly fell 9.2 percent. \nAirlines have taken advantage of cheaper fuel to increase flights this year but they have had to cut prices to fill more seats. \nAmerican announced a 2 billion addition to its program of buying back its own stock over the next 15 months a move that usually pleases shareholders by making existing shares more valuable. That raises the amount authorized this year for buybacks to 6 billion. \nThe company also declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:53:46.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
