Any time a project schedule is updated, the revised schedule is automatically updated within Jonas Premier as well. This eases the burden of sharing schedules via email, which reduces the issues of viewing an outdated schedule and making decisions with inaccurate information. Parham Mousavi, Director of Operations with Jonas Premier, is excited about the benefits this integration will provide, “With this integration between Jonas Premier and MS Project, existing Premier clients will not only be able to save time by having project schedules updated automatically, but they will also experience greater accessibility with all schedule information stored within the Jonas Premier system. All project schedules will be accurate and available in real-time, providing our clients with the confidence to make better decisions moving forward.”\nThe integration between Jonas Premier and Microsoft Project makes sharing project schedules easy, as everyone with access to the Premier system can view Gantt Charts, critical paths, schedules, and more, all in real-time. By automating this process, there is no requirement to import or export documents, which can be time consuming and cumbersome. Through a simple push of the button, project schedule information is made available to any Premier user, at any time and from anywhere through the integrated Jonas Premier cloud server.\nPhase 2 of this integration, set to be released during Q1 of 2016, will further enhance this integration by providing Premier users with the ability to push estimated and actual costs to Microsoft Project, automatically creating the cash flow report in the process. As the project progresses, this integration will be able to automatically populate costs as well. This can be done instantaneously with a simple push of the button, saving a lot of time in the process.\nAbout Jonas Premier\nJonas Premier is a fully integrated, cloud-based construction accounting software solution ideal for General Contracting businesses.
