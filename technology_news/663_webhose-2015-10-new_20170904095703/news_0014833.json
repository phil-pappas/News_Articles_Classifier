The changes won't happen immediately, and Iran must further constrain its nuclear program before relief from sanctions will occur. \nSenior administration officials insist that no sanctions relief will occur until the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency has verified Iran's compliance with the terms of the agreement. They say Iran's work will almost certainly take more than the two months Iran has projected. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
