Honda is doing this with the cooperation of the Marshall Islands government. \nThe initiative will involve the (1) Fit electric vehicle from Honda and the (2) Honda Power Charger. The latter is a solar-powered AC charging station, said Popular Science . \nThe news release stated \"Honda and Marshall Islands government will use Fit EV and Honda Power Charger and verify the possibility of widespread use of electric mobility products and installing of infrastructure for EV charging in Marshall Islands.\" \nWith support from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, said Popular Science , Honda and the Marshall Islands government will carry out testing using the charging stations and a small fleet of Fit cars . \nMarshall Islands is susceptible to the effect of rising sea levels, and Honda said it was critical to address the issue of global warming through the reduction of the amount of CO2 emissions. \nThe tests will be useful in that the initial results will determine whether more widespread installation of charging infrastructure throughout the Marshall Islands would be worthwhile. \nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is a nation comprised of 1,156 islands and islets near the equator in the Pacific Ocean. Stephen Edelstein in Popular Science reminded readers that the islands were the site of bloody fighting during World War II, nuclear testing during the Cold War, [The World Factbook says there was US nuclear testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and 1962. The islands of Bikini and Enewetak are former US nuclear test sites; Kwajalein atoll, famous as a World War II battleground] and are now particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \nAlso, according to Popular Science , \"Honda notes that the Marshall Islands must import the majority of its energy supplies. Increased use of renewable energy is meant to help the country achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency, and to reduce the energy costs associated with transportation .\" \nFumihko Ike, chairman, representative director of Honda Motor Co., said in the news release that \"We are very honored that the Government of the Marshall Islands has chosen our EV and the battery charging system.\" \nIn the bigger picture, The Marshall Islands is cutting diesel use dramatically, said The Christian Science Monitor earlier this month, with a number of small-scale wind power, solar power and energy efficiency moves. \nMegan Rowling, Thomson Reuters Foundation, in The Christian Science Monitor discussed the Marshall Islands' renewable energy measures for the future. \n\"They include small-scale wind-power, expanding coconut oil production for use in electricity and transport fuel, introducing electric vehicles and solar-charged lagoon transport, and improving energy efficiency with prepaid meters and heat recovery .\" \nMore information: Press release: world.honda.com/news/2015/4151019eng.html 0 shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:27:30.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
