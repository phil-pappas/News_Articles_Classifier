Within the community, members are invited to foster and support an open, innovative, and inspiring discourse in supply chain management and mobile technology best practices and thought leadership. \nBarcoding's #SupplyChainGeek Network is claimed to be ideal for supply chain professionals – and anyone fascinated with the supply chain – across all industries looking to share their expertise and learn from fellow \"Geeks.\" Members have access to exclusive discussion boards, webinars, weekly digest emails, networking and publishing opportunities. Topics of discussion include supply chain optimization, data capture technology and RFID, consumables, logistics, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile devices and more. In addition, the website will feature all presentations from Barcoding's recent Executive Forum 5, as well as content from each subsequent, annual event. \nJody Costa, marketing director, Barcoding, Inc., said, \"Barcoding recognized that the best practices making supply chains more efficient, accurate, and connected are consistent across all industries. While there are numerous organizations and online resources dedicated to industry-specific thought leadership, we saw the need for a digital community where all supply chain leaders can come together to share ideas – no matter if they work in manufacturing, healthcare, warehousing, transportation, or anything in between. The Network is also a way to bring Barcoding's customers and partner community closer together in the spirit of innovation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:32:27.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
