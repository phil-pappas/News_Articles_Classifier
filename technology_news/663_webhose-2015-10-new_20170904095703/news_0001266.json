(CSL.AU), Australia's biggest pharmaceutical company by market value, said it would buy back up to a billion Australian dollars (US$730 million) worth of its own shares.\nThe size of the buyback exceeds the A$950 million deal the Melbourne-based blood products and vaccine maker said it was considering at its annual result in August.\nCSL's annual net profit rose 5.5% last financial year on higher sales of its immunity-boosting serums. The company has been expanding globally through acquisitions, as well as consistently launching new products that have driven sales.\nCSL's core business is the manufacture of products derived from blood plasma, where it is one of three major players in the global market beside Baxter and Grifols of Spain. It has centers in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Australia producing the medicines, which treat rare and often fatal conditions, many of which involve problems with the immune system.\nCSL also makes and distributes vaccines, including for seasonal flu, and receives royalties from Merck & Co. for the rights to distribute a human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, which it helped to develop. Human papillomavirus can cause cervical cancer. In October last year, CSL agreed to buy Novartis's influenza-vaccine business for US$275 million.\nAt the company's annual meeting on Thursday, Chairman John Shine told shareholders the company is \"trading consistently with our expectations\" and on track to meet previous guidance for this financial year including net profit growth of about 5% in constant currency terms.\n\"While the markets in which we operate remain highly competitive, our broad portfolio of innovative products, ongoing product development and growing geographic reach continue to ensure our business remains well positioned,\" Mr. Shine said.\nThe buyback will be completed over the next 12 months.\n-Write to Rebecca Thurlow at rebecca.thurlow@wsj.com\n 14, 2015 20:22 ET (00:22 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:03:12.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
