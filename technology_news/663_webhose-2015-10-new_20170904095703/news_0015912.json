Consumers now expect to swipe and click their way to the products and services they want with unprecedented speed, using the devices that are most convenient wherever they happen to be. \nJust look at the grocery vertical. Delivery is quickly disrupting the way consumers are filling their fridges and pantries. The On-Demand Economy conducted a survey of 250 Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s customers purchasing groceries online, and found that the overwhelming factor in choosing to shop online was the convenience of deliveries, followed by a dislike of carrying groceries, being away from the vicinity of the store, a dislike of waiting in line, followed by other factors. \nThe Uberfication of the service industry affects everything from ground transportation to household tasks, dry cleaning, dog walking, doctor’s house calls and dozens of others. \nBut what does this mean for businesses trying to stay current with consumers who don’t associate phones with making phone calls as much as they do with transactions. This is entirely changing the relationship between customers and entrepreneurs. \nPayment strategies must ensure flawless execution. Marketing strategies must be honed to intercept shoppers at the right time, right place. \nJoin us as we hold a spirited discussion on the quickly-changing on-demand landscape and what it means to millions of businesses everywhere. \nDon’t miss out!
