The recent drop of water levels in Lake Kariba may not be good for power generation but might allow for the discovery of more fossils, according to the owner of a safari camp.\nSteve Edwards of Musango Safari Camp has found six dinosaur fossil bed sites on the shores of Kariba dam in recent years.\nAlmost all of his finds are from the Triassic period, dating back 150 to 250 million years. They consist of \"bits of limb bones, ribs, jaws, teeth\" and other unidentified fossil bones, he said in an interview with News24.\nThe finds have been analysed by palaeontologists from the Natural History Museum in London. One of them could even be \"new to science\", though that is yet to be confirmed, Edwards has been told.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:08:24.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
