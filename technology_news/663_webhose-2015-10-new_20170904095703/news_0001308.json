But while China has long opened up to a competitive market environment, it’s still very much communist in employment issues. \n“So the talks involve how both companies will retain their staff by moving them around to other businesses they are active in, and that’s a complicated exercise.” \nBasil Karatzas of New York-based Karatzas Marine Advisors & Company, said: “It will be a stunning example of consolidation in the generally very fragmented shipping industry. It will most likely trigger more transactions, but this is not a ‘plain vanilla’ merger of two companies, but of two large companies, where the large get larger.” \nIt was previously reported that shares belonging to both companies had been suspended while each began restructuring their assets. \nThe merger between both carriers also comes at a time of decline as the companies have seen a combined loss of more than US$900 million in the past five years. \nIf both companies decide to follow through with its merger, it could mean that each carrier leaves its current alliance or see both join one of its prospective alliances, reshaping the landscape of liner alliances and causing fresh challenges for ports and terminals. \nCosco is currently a member of CKYHE and CSCL with the ‘O3’ alliance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:54:34.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
