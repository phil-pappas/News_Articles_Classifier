But are playing with 14 men? The Springboks brand could once lay claim to being the only team with a winning record against the All Blacks. In the professional era those claims have changed. The men in black are the most successful national side in any sport, with a winning record pushing 80%. The All Blacks are dominant, and from a brand management perspective, even more so.\nWith the Rugby World Cup in full swing and the quarter finals on the way, we at Fort Hartley thought it was interesting to look at the brand power of the national teams. Where does South Africa rank?\nNow this article is meant to create a dialogue, because I am not privy to all the information I need to make a statement or lament our status as a world rugby brand. I will share with you what I have found in my research and please feel free to let me know what you know that I may not know. Know what I mean?\nStarting with the Mighty All Blacks, that largest brand in the oval balled sport, I simply Googled “All Black Brand” and found pages of well written articles pertaining to the brand power of the All Blacks. Mark Jenner, managing director of branding agency Interbrand believes that the All Blacks actually give credibility to the World Cup itself. Their Own brand has almost doubled in value since Stephen Donald’s penalty saved the country from a self-induced great depression in 2011. According to London based consultancy firm Brand Finance , The New Zealand men’s rugby union team, is valued at NZ$197 million (€109 million). With Rugby heading into the Olympics in 2016, that number can only grow. With nineteen sponsors – including diverse brands such as insurance group AIG, airline Air New Zealand, jewellery brand Bulgari and sports giant Adidas – the All Blacks have leveraged their champion status by rapidly expanding their licensing partnerships. The brand of rugby’s most famous team can now be seen on flight safety videos, cologne and Rugby World Cup branded bottles of milk among many others. They are playing for keeps, with large brands. Check out this article on their brands evolution (including their own font) . I can’t find the Springboks brand guidelines anywhere, or even an article about them.\nFont the All Blacks\nJapan are the undisputed darlings of the 2015 tournament. Its criminal they won 3 of their 4 games and didn’t go through to the quarters, especially after showing up the Springboks for shear skill. The worth of that victory is sports branding catnip as winning means money. An estimated 30 million viewers tuned into Japan vs USA this past Sunday. Japan coach and part time comedian Eddie Jones was Quote: d as saying “There were 30 million people in Japan watching the game. Thirty million is the whole of the Australian population, plus the kangaroos, plus many of the sheep. Out of that 30 million there’s got to be parents who want their kids to play rugby. There’s probably kids in front of the mirror now practicing their goal kicking. It’s a fantastic opportunity for Japan to have a new generation of rugby players, fans and heroes. These guys are heroes now. They’ve changed the whole image of Japanese rugby.”\nGame On! This shirt is selling like sushi.\nAnd it is true, with Japan set to host the next world cup and targeting the Semi’s, Rugby is about to change. The Rugby fraternity has been crying out for another monetized force in the game. Argentina have come up nicely, and Italy have their game every 2 or 3 years that gives bookies a headache. But it’s a far cry from say Cricket, where Sri Lanka and now Bangladesh have risen to the inner circle of competitive players. (In the case of the former) Going from whipping boys to World Cup winners, or (the latter) beating the top ranked sides regularly at home.\nIf the USA got stuck in heavily and built on what they have done over the last few years, Rugby would truly become more of a global force than it already is, they are a sleeping giant. And what does this all mean for the All Blacks? Money. What’s the point of this article? Simple, type “Springbok Brand” into Google and compare the results, it’s literally selling T-shirts vs brand Knowledge (Google “All Blacks Brand”). Nobody talks about the Springbok brand value and finding articles of the same quality are like asking Jannie Du Plessis not to get a yellow card. That is the challenge to my fellow internet users, if you find anything I missed let me know.\nWith international brand management agencies talking about the All Blacks “loaning their brand to the Rugby World Cup”. As the 2nd or 3rd best team in the world, should The Springbok brand not be making a global drive to sell our brand? We don’t even own www.springboks.com , and I have no idea what is happening on www.springboks.co.za . Shouldn’t we have these basic issues tied up in the push for brand domination? www.springbokmagazine.com is a bit intensive to use, if it is meant to load quickly and be effective as an online source of information, it is complex when it could be simple.\nURL wobble\nIn essence I am concerned that we are not as forward thinking as our Kiwi competitors in handling our beloved rugby brand. They want to dominate foreign markets with their brand, do we? Fans are also drawn to the team on social networking sites. RadiumOne calculated each team’s total audience across leading global social networks Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Google+ and found that, with 4.52m followers, New Zealand had twice as many as England (2.26m) and three times as many as our beloved Springbok brand.\nSo hit me with your thoughts and opinions on my opinions and thoughts. And let’s hope the French deliver that once every ten years brand crushing game against the boys from the land of the long white cloud this weekend. Because Rugby is larger than any team, and I don’t like The All Blacks believing they own the Sport, even if they are the only ones being professional.", "external_links": ["https://radiumone.com/", "http://www.irishtimes.com/search/search-7.1213540?tag_company=Brand%20Finance&article=true", "http://www.forthartley.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/font.jpg", "http://www.forthartley.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10-12-2015-11-19-31-AM.png", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yVMKaNCUz6bGpmeVBmX2tBOVU/view", "http://www.springbokmagazine.com/", "http://dna.co.nz/#!/our-work/case-studies/nz-rugby-all-blacks-ip-creation-brand-strategy-engagement-management-systems/", "http://www.springboks.co.za/", "http://www.springboks.com/", "http://www.forthartley.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/japan.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:05:18.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
