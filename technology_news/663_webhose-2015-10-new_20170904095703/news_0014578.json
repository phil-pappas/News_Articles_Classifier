The highest-end 21.5-inch iMac now has a 4,096 x 2,304 (4K) Retina screen, which should be a big upgrade from the 1080p display found in the cheaper 21.5-inch models. \nThe update also makes it a bit more affordable to get one of those Retina iMacs. Before today the cheapest model (27-inch) cost a minimum of US$1,899, but now you can buy the Retina 21.5-inch iMac for $1,399 or a 27-inch Retina model for $1,699. This is similar to what we saw with the first Retina MacBook Pros , where the sharper screen started as an expensive option in only the larger model, but eventually became the norm across the entire lineup. \nThe new 27-inch iMacs also ship with Intel's new 6th generation Skylake processors , though the 21.5-inch models are still running 5th-gen Intel chips. \nApple also launched new \"Magic\" keyboard and trackpad accessories that switch from disposable batteries to rechargeable lithium-ion ones, which Apple says can last a month or more on a single charge. The new Magic Trackpad 2 also has a larger surface than the previous Magic Trackpad and, for the first time, brings Force Touch pressure sensitivity (which we'd already seen in the trackpads of this year's MacBooks) to a standalone accessory. \nAll the new iMacs include the new Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 in the box. The Magic Trackpad 2 is an optional $50 upgrade (in place of the mouse) at checkout. \nAll the new models, of course, run OS X El Capitan . \nThe new iMacs are available for online order from Apple starting today (no Apple Store pickup options just yet), starting at $1,099 for the non-Retina 21.5-inch model. When bought alone, the Magic Keyboard rings up for $99, the Magic Mouse 2 for $79 and the Magic Trackpad 2 for $129.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:05:27.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
