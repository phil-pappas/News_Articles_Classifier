The Portio Research report, sponsored by OpenMarket, titled, \" SMS: The Language of 6 Billion People ,\" examines the shift towards a 'mobile first' mind set, the unprecedented reach of SMS, and the growing emphasis on content personalization. It also reveals the three megatrends that are shaping the way consumers purchase goods and services, and interact with brands. OpenMarket and Portio Research will present a 60-minute webinar with InformationWeek on Thursday, October 29th at 9:00 AM PDT to discuss the report findings. \n\"With more people owning a mobile phone than a toothbrush, it's clear that 'mobile first' is much more than just a buzzword,\" said Karl Whitfield, managing director of Portio Research. \"The way we interact has evolved in such a way that our mobile phones represent a conduit to the world around us, as we use them to communicate, shop for goods and consume content. This means that companies should not just incorporate mobile messaging into their communications strategy, but rather build their strategy around it.\" \nAccording to the Portio Research report, the number of mobile connections globally continues to grow year-over-year, with the number expected to reach 10 billion by 2020, significantly outpacing the human population. This growth has facilitated a change in the way people communicate and consume media, moving away from the desktop PC and TV. This shift toward 'mobile first' or in some cases 'mobile only' should be reflected in how businesses expand their communication services.(1) \nThe report highlights that of the 7.3 billion people worldwide, 6.1 billion use an SMS-enabled phone, which amounts to 84% of the global population making it more prevalent than any global language. In fact, Application-to-Person (A2P) connects more people than any other platform in human history, making SMS the ideal mechanism for businesses to use to communicate with their customers.(2) \nTo date, the majority of enterprise communication has been broadcast in its nature, such as print, radio, television, or even email. In fact, we have reached a point whereby 70% of all email sent is spam. For the time-starved modern consumer, this approach doesn't work. The growth of social media, for instance, has served to highlight the importance of personalization. SMS affords businesses a direct line to each and every consumer while also facilitating two-way communications between brand and consumer. Together with its familiarity and ubiquity, SMS is the optimal channel for enterprise communication in the 'mobile first' age.(3) \n\"The shift towards a consumer-centric marketplace has meant that enterprise brands, regardless of the goods or services they are providing, have had to reassess their communications strategies,\" said Jay Emmet, general manager of OpenMarket. \"SMS offers a unique blend of reach, flexibility and personalization to make it the most effective tool for businesses looking to engage more with their customers. What's important is that companies avoid the temptation to treat mobile messaging as just another tool for broadcasting information. They should implement it as a meaningful, two-way channel for individual customer interaction.\" \nTo download the Portio Research report, \"SMS: The Language of 6 Billion People,\" visit: http://www.openmarket.com/download/portio-sms-the-language-of-6-billion-people/ . \nTo register for the webinar, visit: https://webinar.informationweek.com/1207?keycode=CAA1AC . \nAbout OpenMarket OpenMarket, a division of Amdocs, helps enterprises use mobile to transform their business.
