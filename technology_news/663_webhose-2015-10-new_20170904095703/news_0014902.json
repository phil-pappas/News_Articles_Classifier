Hide Caption 10 of 10 Story highlights Douglas Rushkoff: Anne-Marie Slaughter identifies problem of trying to multi-task family and career, while doing both well It's not possible, says Rushkoff He says we mistakenly think we can apply ethos of digital technology to other aspects of life Result: We remember little and experience less Douglas Rushkoff, a media theorist and professor of media studies at the City University of New York's Queens College, writes a regular column for CNN.com. He is the author of the book \"Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now,\" and of the forthcoming book \"Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity,\" (March 2016, Penguin). The opinions expressed are solely those of the author. (CNN) Technology has always been about choice: Fire allowed us to choose to live in colder climates. Electric lighting offered us the choice to read at night. Drugs give us the freedom to choose stressful, self-destructive lifestyles. And digital technology gives us the ability to do more than one thing at the same time -- or at least it feels that way. Douglas Rushkoff In Anne-Marie Slaughter's provocatively commonsensical new book, \"Unfinished Business: Women, Men, Work, Family,\" she's not concerned with the digital at all, but the problem she's pointing to is a form of its multitasking ethos writ large: the way women and men, but women in particular, must prioritize (that is, juggle) career and family. In stark opposition to the can-do feminism embraced by some of today's C-suite female superstars, Slaughter makes the simple but undeniably realistic case for lowering our expectations. The idea of parents perfectly balancing family duties so they can prioritize their careers equally just doesn't work in practice, says Slaughter. \"The problem is that 'fifty-fifty' is just too pat. Life rarely works out that way. And it's much harder to be honest about what it really takes.\" As a result, we must abandon the notion that anyone -- man or woman -- can fully dedicate themselves to both family and career at the same time. \"We often cannot control the fate of our career and family; insisting that we can obscures the deeper structures and forces that shape our lives and deflects attention from the larger changes that must be made.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:15:18.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
