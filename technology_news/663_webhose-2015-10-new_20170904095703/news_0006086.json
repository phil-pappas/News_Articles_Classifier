You can't go underneath desks or tables without someone removing it. Removing it is kind of a chore. It's not easily done. Also, it prevents you from transferring out of your wheelchair.\" \nThe technology can also double as a writing surface or meal tray, he said. \nAlexander Lo, a researcher in the Purdue Center for \nAlexander Lo, a researcher in the Purdue Center for Paralysis Research, uses an iPad on the RoboDesk. The RoboDesk is an assistive technology being developed at Purdue University to help people with disabilities use iPads and other mobile devices more easily.

We give them rights to it. Tell them how to make it, and they make it themselves.\" \nHe anticipates RoboDesk to enter the marketplace next year. \n\"I can't wait to get the first manufactured prototype because I'll be customer no. 1,\" he said. \n--- \nSource: The (Lafayette) Journal & Courier, http://on.jconline.com/1hQZCQZ Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:55:48.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
