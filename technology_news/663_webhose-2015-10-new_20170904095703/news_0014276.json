Lebkowski, Ph.D., President of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer of Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT: AST), a leading biotechnology company in the emerging field of regenerative medicine, will participate in a BioPharma Dealmakers webcast, sponsored in part by Asterias Biotherapeutics, featuring four companies developing regenerative medicine. Dr. Lebkowski will discuss the progress to date for the Company's transformative technology platforms, AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2, which address opportunities across multiple cancers, stages of cancer, and combinations therapies and AST-OPC1, which is focused on the treatment of spinal cord injury and other neurodegenerative diseases. \nThe webcast, part of the BioPharma Dealmakers series, is scheduled for 11:00 am ET on October 14 th . Webcast registration . \nThe webcast will explore some of the technologies and companies driving this rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine. Participants will learn about new approaches that have been developed to: Generate autologous cartilage cells for transplantation. Use pluripotent embryonic stem cellâ€“derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to treat spinal cord injuries. Enlist mAbs to slow or reverse senescence, and Use 3D bioprinting to create tissues for use in drug discovery and medical research. \nThe webcast will include a round table discussion and a Q&A session to enable participants to contribute their own thoughts on this highly innovative area of regenerative medicine. \nDr. Jane S. Lebkowski , has been actively involved in the development of cell and gene therapies since 1986. Other webcast participants include: Dr. Jeske Smink is Head of Scientific Affairs of co.don. Dr. Lewis Gruber is CEO and Chief Scientific Officer of SIWA Corporation. Dr. Sharon Collins Presnell is the CTO at Organovo, where she lead their R&D group.

(NYSE MKT: AST) is a leading biotechnology company in the emerging field of regenerative medicine. The Company's proprietary, industry leading platforms are based on its pluripotent stem cell and dendritic cell immunotherapy technologies. Asterias is focused on developing therapies to treat conditions in several medical areas where there is high unmet medical need and inadequate available therapies. AST-OPC1 (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) is currently in a Phase 1/2a dose escalation clinical trial in spinal cord injury. AST-VAC1 (antigen-presenting autologous dendritic cells) has demonstrated promise in a Phase 2 study in acute myelogenous leukemia. AST-VAC2 (antigen-presenting allogeneic dendritic cells) represents a second generation, allogeneic approach to dendritic cell vaccines.
