And her ministry is looking into a series of measures to promote the electric car, such as tax incentives and purchase subsidies. \nHer colleague at the Economy Ministry, Sigmar Gabriel, has said he was ready to support financial incentives, without specifying what form they should take. \nAnd he is in favour of introducing quotas for electric vehicles in the car fleets of public authorities, with the aim of boosting demand. \nSuch ideas are enthusiastically welcomed by VDIK, the association of international motor vehicle manufacturers, which is calling for a purchase discount of \"at least 5,000 euros\" per electric car during a still undefined \"transition period.\" \nIn 2009, the German government formulated a goal to have around one million electric cars on the road by 2020. And it restated that target earlier this year. \nBut the goal is looking increasingly ephemeral and at the half-way point, the concrete numbers are woefully short of target, with a meagre 19,000 vehicles on the roads in Germany in September 2015. \nThe government's goal \"is quite simply not achievable,\" said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Research in Bergisch Gladbach. \nThere was \"a lot of euphoria, but no vision for a feasible economic model\" for the electric car in Germany, he complained. \n- 'Concerted action' - \nThe VW scandal may provide a chance to restart the electromobility debate in Germany. \n\"But for that, real concerted action is needed between automakers, suppliers and the authorities,\" Bratzel said. \nOffering car buyers a purchase discount would likely prove only a flash in the pan with regard to kickstarting overall demand, the expert argued. \nThe main determining factors for the lasting success of electric vehicles would be considerations of \"battery autonomy, infrastructure and price,\" Bratzel insisted. \nPublic subsidy of any electromobility initiative remains controversial. \nThe opposition environmentalist Green party is calling for a general overhaul of the system of taxes for vehicles, arguing that powerful, big-cylinder and pollutant engines should face the highest levies. \nBut that is a road the government appears reluctant to go down. \nInstead, Berlin announced, just a week after the VW scandal broke, the construction of 400 battery-charging stations for electric cars at motorway service stations by 2017, as well as a number of \"privileges\" for electric vehicles on public roads. \nThey would, for example, be allowed to use bus lanes and benefit from free parking in towns and cities. \nHowever, at the end of the day, it is the local and municipal authorities that have the final word on such initiatives and they \"have no interest in jamming the bus lanes with private cars, even if they are electric cars,\" said Bratzel. \nAs time progresses and the dream of electromobility remains pie-in-the-sky, environmentalist groups are losing patience. \n\"Every year, Germany squanders seven billion euros on privileges for diesel, which is a pollutant technology,\" said Daniel Moser, who is responsible for transport issues at Greenpeace Germany. \nThe activists believe it will simply not be enough to transfer the privileges to electric vehicles. \nWhat was needed was an entire ecological urban transport system, ranging from trams, to bicycles and electric buses, \"not just more private electric cars clogging up towns,\" Greenpeace said. \njmh-spm/hmn/wdb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:41.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
