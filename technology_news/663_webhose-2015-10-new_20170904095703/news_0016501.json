Read a Technical Paper on the Port of Singapore and its two-tier terminal plan \nSeatrade Maritime reported Andrew Tan, CEO of the MPA, stating that Singapore faces “challenges that other ports may not have, such as land and sea space constraints, higher costs relative to the region and manpower constraints.”\n“To break the current berth capacity ceiling, one potential idea we are exploring is to use a two-tiered container terminal, which will significantly increase the yard storage capacity and quay crane productivity.\nInfographic: the Port of the Future \n“We should not restrict ourselves to traditional port layouts. One of these new land-use concepts is to develop a platform above part of the container port on which port-related and industrial developments, such as container freight stations, logistic hubs and other facilities, can be developed to intensify land-use.\n“The above-ground space development over part of the new mega container port could create significant land area for the development of a cluster of maritime and port business activities, including amenities and possibly commercial-residential areas for those working in the area to form a component of the future Tuas Maritime Hub.”\nThe MPA recently announced the construction of the terminal, which is anticipated to cost around US$1.8 billion and involves reclaiming around 300 ha of land in order for dredging work to begin.\nFor all the latest on the Port of Singapore, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:41:48.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
