A long-term client, Lycoming has been using Infolinx since 2004 to manage records housed within the county records center. Architected to include the integration of hundreds of retention schedules, Lycoming utilizes Infolinx to manage the accession of records from more than thirty county departments as well as their eventual timely disposition. While facilitating the implementation of a contemporary technology stack including the latest server operating systems and SQL Server versions, the upgrade also involved migrating from the legacy Infolinx SE thick-client software to the true thin-client Infolinx WEB.\nIn addition to deepened integrations with solutions such as Microsoft SharePoint®, Laserfiche® Records Manager, Kofax® Capture, Iron Mountain Connect™, and oneilBridge™, the Infolinx WEB 3.4 application boasts a completely redesigned, browser agnostic application interface, expanded records request capability, improved reporting functionality, and an extended security model.\n“We appreciate all of our clients, but especially those who have been with us for the long haul”, said Tim Butler, Infolinx Managing Director. “We look forward to another decade of providing Lycoming County with the same high level of customer service.”\nAbout Infolinx®\nInfolinx System Solutions is a leading provider of DoD5015.2-certified enterprise physical records management software.
