The network is made up of 80 container terminals in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Italy.\nECT’s terminals are linked via high-frequency rail and/or inland shipping connections to deepsea terminals in Rotterdam and Antwerp.\nThe terminals offer a combined total of 2 kilometres of quay and 1,400 metres of track, and together cover a surface area of some 57 ha.\nECT has recently switched its cargo-handling operations over to from the Eemshaven to the more modern terminals in Maasvlakte as a result of a terminal closure at one of the Port of Rotterdam’s oldest terminal. \nFact File: InlandLinks is the online platform for container terminals in the hinterland that offer intermodal services via rail and inland shipping to and from Rotterdam. InlandLinks allows users to identify the general options and specific advantages offered by Rotterdam-related intermodal transport.\nFor all the latest on ECT, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:28:35.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
