The applications, developed in cooperation with care professionals and the elderly, include a memory and activity game running on a tablet, a reminiscing and life story service, an access control application, and a robot assistant application. \nThe three-year METESE (Meaningful Technologies for Seniors – Safety, Comfort and Joy) project of VTT and the Japanese research institute AIST (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) studies the joint development of gerontechnology and its adoption in Finnish and Japanese care organisations. \nThe project is founded on the approach of co-design with the idea of encouraging the elderly and care professionals to get involved with the design and development work. The applications are brainstormed, assessed and tested together with the users with a systematic and long-term approach. VTT and Probot Oy are developing a robot assistant for the elderly based on the Jaco robotic arm with the purpose of studying the possibilities and limitations of robotics in care services. Elderly users and care personnel are taking part in the design process right from the start. \nThe adaptation of the care organisations and the care service system to new technology is also studied at the same time. The objective is to understand the needs of the elderly, the care personnel and the care organisation from the perspectives of both application development and co-design, increase the users' interest in technology, and lower the threshold for the adoption of new gerontechnology applications in the homes of the elderly and in assisted living facilities. The project seeks cooperation models that would also allow voluntary agents to become involved in making the adoption of new technology easier in the everyday life of the elderly. \nFinnish and Japanese care of the elderly and the adoption of technology are compared at assisted living facilities in both countries. The care service systems of the two countries are studied and analysed, through which the impacts of gerontechnologies and the involvement of different agents in organising care services for the elderly are assessed. At the same time, the ethical and societal effects of the applications are assessed. Accurate information on people's behaviour helps to improve retail design July 1, 2014 \nVTT Technical Research Centre of Finland has been developing an advanced tracking system based on depth cameras that provides accurate information on how people move about and behave in various spaces.

New Anchor Robotics facility opens to develop robots that help elderly to live independently September 10, 2015 \nBristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) is launching its latest project – the Anchor Robotics Personalised Assisted Living (ARPAL) facility - that will enable robotics researchers, elderly people with assistive needs and those ... Mobile robots could help the elderly live fuller lives September 29, 2015 \nMobile service robots developed by computer scientists at the University of Lincoln, UK, could soon be helping elderly people stay independent and active for longer. A smart rollator prototype that supports independent living among the elderly October 1, 2015 \nVTT has made the traditional rollator smart by retrofitting it with sensors and digital software that analyse user's physical condition and daily activities. This allows the device to collect useful information on user's ... Recommended for you Should cars be fully driverless? No, says an engineer and historian October 13, 2015 \nIf you follow technology news—or even if you don't—you have probably heard that numerous companies have been trying to develop driverless cars for a decade or more. These fully automated vehicles could potentially be ...
