The units exceed OSHA, ANSI and all relevant international standards. The Ductless design eliminates installation costs and allows the unit to be positioned over a sink or benchtop apparatus. There are three models available with a choice of 24\", 36\" or 48\" widths. The units operate at low noise levels and because they recirculate, they do not exhaust expensive conditioned and/or heated air into the atmosphere. A face velocity of 100 fpm ensures containment of fumes and particulates for operator protection. An alarm alerts the operator when the airflow falls to an unacceptable level. The unit can be placed on any bench top, and an optional polypropylene spillage tray can be provided when required. The rear of the unit has lighting to illuminate the work surface. All mechanisms in the head section are on the clean side of the filter, with the switches and electrical components being isolated from any contamination. The patented filter clamping mechanism allows for the filter to be easily installed and ensures an even seal at the filter face at all times to prevent bypass leakage. The main filter can be chosen from 14 different types of carbon, which include specialty media for vapors of organics, solvents, acids, mercury and formaldehyde. HEPA filters for particulate filtration are also available to suit your application needs. \nTypical applications for the Purair 5 include histology, powder weighing and sampling prep work.
