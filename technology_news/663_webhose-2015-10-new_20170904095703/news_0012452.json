If you think that getting stuff from your old mobile to your new mobile is difficult, think again. Cellular companies tend to only transfer contacts between phones and leave out the call logs, music, text messages, pictures, apps and the videos. AllPepole Mobile Trans is a piece of software that will do all that for you. Transfer more than just contacts: Copy over your text messages, apps, photos, call logs and music between all your devices with a single click. Transfer to multiple devices: Transfer any data you want shared between different devices such as Android, iOS and Symbian. Contract phones are also supported: Move your data from old phones to new ones, regardless of which cell service the phones have. When transfer contacts for you, all related information such as job title, company name and email address will all be attached, too. Besides contacts, other files such as SMS, photos, call logs, music, apps, calendar and video all also be transferred if you like.
