This new fossil preserves not only the articulated bones of the forelimb but also abundant remains of the plumage and of the soft-tissues of the wing.\nSpecifically, it documents, for the first time, an intricate arrangement of fibres which matches anatomically with a complex network of ligaments, muscles and tendons present in modern-day birds. This network ensures the position and controls the fine adjustments of the wing’s main feathers, allowing living birds to fly efficiently and master the sky.\nThe presence of these structures in the wing of such a primitive bird supports the notion that at least some of the most ancient birds were capable of performing aerodynamic feats in a fashion similar to those of many living birds.\nLead author Guillermo Navaln said that it’s very surprising that despite being skeletally quite different from their modern counterparts, these primitive birds show striking similarities in their soft anatomy.\nThe anatomical match between the fibres preserved in the fossil and those that characterize the wings of living birds strongly indicates that some of the earliest birds were capable of aerodynamic prowess like many present-day birds, said Dr Luis Chiappe.\nAncient birds may have flown over the heads of dinosaurs but some aspects of the precise flight modes of these early fliers still remain unclear.\nCo-author Jesus Marugan Lobon from Universidad Autonoma in Madrid said that fossils such as this are an open window to deep time and allow scientists access to the most intricate aspects of the early evolution of the flight of birds.\nThe study is published in Scientific Reports.\n 09, 2015 9:37 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:19:12.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
