It allows them to store money to save up for items and they can earn ‘stickers’ for saving certain amounts.\nThe youngest competitor was seven year old Anjali Ayres. She won the 'What the Fin Tech?' award' for her passion and innovative ideas. Organisers say the Hackathon encourages interest in the digital sector.\nThe Hackathon, the way we should look at it is a tool, which is often a part of open innovation. It's there to try to support and encourage collaboration and typically through collaborative processes you start people sharing their skills, sharing their knowledge, sharing their insight.\n– Mike Culverwell Director, Digital Greenhouse Play video Other prizes...\n2nd prize - Give.gg.
