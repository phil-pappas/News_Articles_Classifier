M-Enterprise Canada will take place November 16-18, 2015 in Toronto, Canada.\nThese mobility summits bring together C-Suite, Vice Presidents, Directors of Mobile Strategy, IT, Field Workforce, Architecture and Operations professionals from major organizations to learn how to use mobile technology to increase productivity, profitability, and improve customer service and experience. Sponsors are able to engage directly with these decision-makers looking for mobile solutions. The goal is to make the event an absolute “win-win” for both the attendee and the sponsor.\nM-Enterprise Boston and M-Enterprise Canada take a horizontal approach to mobility, bringing in senior level qualified decision-maker attendees and leading suppliers. Mobile leaders from UPS, Bank of America, Fidelity, Uber, Duke University, American Airlines, Mercedes-Benz and many more will attend M-Enterprise Summit to learn and share their experiences.\n“At M-Enterprise Boston and Canada business leaders will discuss their challenges and share their wisdom on opportunities they have experienced in going mobile. At both events we’re going to explore building the strategy and technical implication requirements for building apps that matter. We’ll also look at how companies are using IoT, wearables, big data and new analytics tools to reinvent business and drive competitive advantage,” commented Conference Chair Maribel Lopez, Founder, Lopez Research LLC.\n“The M-Enterprise Summit was a very rewarding experience and I was able to make numerous connections with people across multiple verticals. The mobility landscape is consistently changing and for us to stay ahead of the curve we need to bounce ideas off of each other and think outside the box. It was a very well executed event and I look forward to 2015!” stated George McQuillister, Principal IT Architect, Mobile Operations Support, Pacific Gas & Electric Company.\nMobile technology has become a business imperative and essential to meeting the expectations of employees and customers in the enterprise. It is complex and continues to challenge organizations as they try to keep up with rapid advancements. Developing a strategy and making the right decisions is a major challenge for IT executives. Our events are not exhibitions or traditional conferences, but focused world-class networking and business information exchanges designed to help IT executives overcome challenges.\n“This pre-eminent gathering of mobile professionals is idea-inducing at every turn; from seated sessions, to breakouts with sponsors and networking and learning with peers,” commented Christopher De Luca, Global Mobile Device Solutions Manager, Rakuten, Inc.\n“This isn’t your typical vendor/tradeshow event. It’s a targeted small group of passionate individuals getting together to discuss the ‘where we are at’ and ‘where we want to go’ in the mobility space. The content is targeted and well presented. The networking opportunities have been priceless! M-Enterprise is a truly fantastic event,” stated Advisory Board Member Pamela Heiligenthal of Forrester Research.\nSource:-nGage Events", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:51:53.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
