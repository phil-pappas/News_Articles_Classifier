Kurogo's Mobile-Optimized Middleware \"accesses and quickly mobilizes any data source or dynamic feed, such as maps, social media, news, videos, transit and more, and assembles this information into a curated and rich mobile experience.\" And with the Kurogo Admin and Publisher App Assembly System, non-developers can \"create and enhance native apps for any event or purpose, such as for new student or employee orientation, company training, or corporate events.\" \nKurogo 2.5's new features include: Theme Builder, a mobile theming tool that makes it easy to create a new theme and extend a visual brand identity to a mobile app. A variety of theme parameters are available: colors, typography (including custom fonts), branded images, icon sets and more. Launchpad, a home screen option for creating an entry point to a mobile app. Interface options range from the icon springboard to magazine-style layouts. A dynamic responsive system automatically optimizes and partitions the user interface for any size mobile device. Tailored banner messages can now be created, scheduled and delivered to any screen within an app, targeted to specific users. Dynamic geolocation provides localized information based on an app user's location. It automatically detects when a user travels between different office locations or campuses, and then interacts with the user to determine whether to switch to a new experience. Transit notifications enable users to receive a notification when a bus is about to arrive at their stop. \nFor more information, visit the Modo Labs site .
