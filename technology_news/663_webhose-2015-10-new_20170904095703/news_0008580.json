Picture: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Univ. of Arizona Source: Supplied\nDirector of planetary science at NASA headquarters Jim Green is pushing for the Curiosity rover to enter the sites, claiming the intense radiation environment found on Mars would have killed any bugs on the lander.\nHowever, a recent report from the US National Academy of Sciences and the European Science Foundation refutes these claims suggesting the opposite might be true.\n“Although the flux of ultraviolet radiation within the Martian atmosphere would be deleterious to most airborne microbes and spores, dust could attenuate this radiation and enhance microbial viability,” stated the report .\nAndrew Coates of University College London’s Mullard space science laboratory said he expected there to be heated discussion over the idea in coming weeks.\n“Curiosity now has the chance, for example, to do some closer up, but still remote, measurements, using the ChemCam instrument with lasers, to look at composition,” he told The Guardian .\n“I understand there is increasing pressure from the science side to allow that, given this new discovery.”\nIn addition to contamination fears, there is the logistic issues NASA would encounter sending the rover to examine the sites.\nLimitations in the Curiosity rover’s design mean it is only capable of travelling 200m per day and it can only roll over obstacles up to 65cm high.\nThis means without encountering any obstacles it would take the rover one year to reach its destination, which is time that could be better spent elsewhere.\nMan on Mars - Mission to the Red Planet 49:47 Getting to the red planet would involve a three year trek.
