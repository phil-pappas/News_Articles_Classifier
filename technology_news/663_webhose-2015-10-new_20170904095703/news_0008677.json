This is primarily aimed at determining the value of clinical imaging techniques and interventions in vascular access for renal replacement therapy, arteriovenous fistula, grafts and central vein catheters. The research role will involve working in a multidisciplinary team of ReDVA researchers focussed on defining the optimal pre-operative assessment and post-operative surveillance of arteriovenous access and determining the outcome of interventions in failing access. The research is fully funded. \nThe clinical role will be dependant on applicants experience and qualifications but could include interventional radiological procedures and outpatient clinics in NHS Tayside. We offer a complete range of interventional radiological procedures form standard vascular interventions, EVAR, FEVAR through to hepatobiliary and urological interventions. We have a team of 6 interventional radiologists in 3 intervention rooms and supported by excellent non-invasive imaging (4 MRI, 4 CT scanners, ultrasound). \nIn addition we have a comprehensive range of training courses in image guided therapy using advanced simulation and Thiel cadavers in the world renowned Cuschieri Skills Centre. Further research opportunities exist in device development and testing in the Institute for Medical Science and Technology ( www.imsat.org ) and the Clinical Research Imaging Facility (3T MRI, PET CT). \nLocation: \nThe post holder will be based within the Division of Cardiovascular and Diabetes Medicine, School of Medicine on the Ninewells Hospital Campus. \nPrincipal Duties \nThe duties will comprise undertaking research projects by assisting in study recruitment, data collection and analysis, under the direction of Professor Houston and clinical duties dependant on the post holders experience and qualifications. \nDay to Day Reporting to: Professor Graeme Houston \nReporting Line Manager: Professor Graeme Houston \nStaff Supervision: Professor Graeme Houston \nDuration of employment: 12 months Share this job", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:07:01.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
