The constant evolution of technology and growth of the industry presents no shortage of insurance coverage issues for companies. Philadelphia Insurance Companies’ (PHLY) new Integrated Technology product addresses those issues by offering a suite of specificly tailored coverages for complex, multifaceted technology organizations.\nPHLY’s product offers all the coverage needs for a technology company, in one location. Coverages can be tailored to meet the insurance needs of a wide range of companies including Light Assembly, Telecommunications, Computer Hardware and Software Distributors, Programmers, I.T. Consultants, Data Processing Schools, Computer Training Facilities, and Government Contractors.\n“We offer a broad definition of ‘technology services,’ because this industry is constantly evolving and offering new products or services,” commented Jerome Wilson, product manager in the Management & Professional Liability division at PHLY. “Our Integrated Technology product is a one-stop shop, meaning companies can be sure there are no gaps in coverage, and expect issues to be resolved more quickly than when multiple carriers are involved.”\nOne unique benefit provided by PHLY’s Integrated Technology product is the inclusion of subcontractors under the insurance. This protects a company in the case that issues arise from the use of a subcontractor for any number of reasons. Another important benefit is additional defense, on top of the coverage limits, since defense is a critical need for tech companies. PHLY’s Integrated Technology offers multiple coverages for liability exposures that fall under general liability or product loss. Coverage also provides access to risk management services including legal and data breach coaches, who are experts in the tech field. Policyholders will also find individual limits for each coverage, lessening the worry that limits will be reached.\nFor more information on the PHLY Integrated Technology product, please visit PHLY.com or contact a PHLY Marketing Representative at 1-800-873-4552.\nAbout Philadelphia Insurance\nPhiladelphia Insurance Companies designs, markets, and underwrites commercial property/casualty and professional liability insurance products incorporating value added coverages and services for select industries.
