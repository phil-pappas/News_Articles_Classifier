Traditional vulnerability management programs are also limited by the lack of security expertise in the cloud and by solutions that don’t support cloud environments. \nTenable customers upgrading to the latest versions of Nessus Cloud or Nessus Manager can now reduce their cloud infrastructure attack surface with new Nessus Agent support for Amazon, Debian and Ubuntu Linux, simplifying and extending vulnerability management for hard-to-scan devices in any IT environment. \n“Since the introduction of Nessus Cloud, Tenable continues to deliver choice and flexibility for customers who want to move some or all of their IT operations to the cloud,” said Ron Gula, CEO, Tenable Network Security. “Expanded Nessus Agents capabilities for three leading cloud OSes, and a new Nessus scanner coming soon to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace, enable customers to identify vulnerabilities and perform configuration and compliance assessments across on-premises and cloud environments.” \nTenable’s new Nessus scanner, available soon in the AWS Marketplace, targets and assesses Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances in multiple AWS accounts and reports data back to Nessus Cloud or Nessus Manager, making it easy to include AWS vulnerability assessment results in an overall vulnerability management program. \nFor more information on the latest extended capabilities now available in Nessus v6, please visit the Nessus product page. \nTo learn more about Tenable’s Nessus Cloud, and how to best manage your organization’s cloud solution, check out the latest in Tenable’s cloud security video blog series:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:22:19.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
