For the first time all countries now agree they need to act against climate change, which scientists say is already transforming the planet through melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying heat waves and warmer, more acidic oceans.\nThough major sticking points remain, including how to spell out the different responsibilities of nations in various stages of development, rich and poor countries have moved closer in recent years.\n\"We have gone very far from the Copenhagen atmosphere,\" said Pa Ousman Jarju, Gambia's environment minister.\nIt would be a major setback if some countries reject the draft in Bonn, leaving negotiators with little time to come up with a new one before Paris.\nSeveral delegates said they didn't expect that to happen, though the African move on Sunday underscored how easily the process, which is based on consensus, can be slowed down.\nOne of the most contentious issues is money. Rich countries have promised to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries reduce their emissions and deal with unavoidable impacts of climate change. But they are reluctant to make any commitments beyond that and say the most advanced developing nations should also chip in.\nThe World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank, said negotiators must be prepared to get \"their hands dirty\" in Bonn and deal with the sticky issues before the Paris summit begins on Nov. 30.\n\"What happens in Bonn can pave the way for a universal agreement in Paris that can be the turning point on climate action that the world needs,\" the group said.\n  Tension Ahead of Last Round of UN Climate Talks Before Paris  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:05:41.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
