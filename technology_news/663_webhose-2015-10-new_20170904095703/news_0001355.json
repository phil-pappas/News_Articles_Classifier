It sounds like a fiction but it’s real. Xiaomi – a Chinese startup company in Smartphone and wearable device has much attention from all over the world. Their rise has been unprecedented for merely five years. The Chinese Tech company has defeated Smartphone giants (LG, Sony) and have become the third biggest Smartphone manufactures in the world. Xiaomi CEO, Lei Jun relseased the Mi Band in 2014 – marking the beginning of Xiaomi activitiy in the wearable market. Surprisingly, after a year Mi Band became the world’s second largest manufacture -after Fitbit. According to IDC, in the first period of 2015, Xiaomi sold 2.8 million Mi Band; thus concluding why Xiaomi makes up 24.6% of the wearable market worldwide. Today, Xiamoi is the most valuable private tech startup in the world. \nWT | Wearable Technologies has been digging to find out what the company’s secret to success is. \nMi Band Mi Band is designed at the core of wearable device; with the ability to track your steps, distance, calories burned, activities and sleep. The Mi Band consists of the oval-shaped tracking module which has a matte chrome finish with a neat and a variety of colored rubber up. The Mi Band is super light and comfortable to wear. A plus for Mi Band is their 30-days of battery life; which is still a challenge for many wearable devices now. Moreover, the Mi Band is waterproof -down to 1m for up to 30 minutes. It means you can definitely wear the device all day long, even when you are taking a shower! The downside to Mi Band is it does not provide the most accurate trackers. However, its accuracy is acceptable in terms of what the consumer wants. Maybe this is so because sometimes Mi Band can overestimates your steps and distance, making you think your worked more than you actually did. \nPrice Strategy Selling a full-feature tracker at cheap price of $14.99 is a smart strategy when approaching the wearable market. They are able to keep this price because they are only selling their products online – where prices don’t need to include a profit margin for retailers. Moreover, Xiaomi keeps marketing costs low by marketing to their fan base instead of advertisments. Their scheme is quite smart, they host “fan parties” every few weeks in different cities. At these events Xiaomi Executives can meet enthusiasts and provide them with fun gifts. Besides, they have an army of employees to interact with consumers on social media such as Weibo (Chinese twitter). \nIn 2015, 40% of wearable devices on market are sold under $100. The other 60% are marked at high price range; such as Google, Fitbit, Pebble and Apple. However, despite the good quality of these proucts these companies have not received an ideal turnover. Even so people are now curious about activity trackers and becoming connected to their health. Nevertheless, it seems that consumers either can’t or won’t spend a lot of money on wearables. \nXiaomi’s low price seems to be enought to satisfy the curiosity of common conusmers. The success of Xiaomi’s price strategy alarms many wearables producers. The question that remains is when will the rest of the activity tracking companies be able to relsease their products for under $100? \nTo round things up, according to its CEO Lei Jun, in an interviewed with The Wall Street Journal stated that Xiaomi’s success formula is “simply about seizing the right opportunity.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:27:08.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
