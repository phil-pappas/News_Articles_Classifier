The customer's bank can then decide whether to pass that charge on to the customer but cannot add an extra charge on top.\nThe bank-customer association Facua said the new law, which must be applied by banks by Jan. 1, 2016, would not prevent lenders charging abusive fees as it didn't include a ceiling on ATM commissions.\nLow interest rates and a deep economic slump forced lenders to seek other sources of income. Caixabank's introduction in March of a 2 euro ($2.24) flat fee per withdrawal for rivals' customers upended the long-standing system in Spain whereby people were charged by their own bank for taking money out elsewhere.\nThe move sparked a backlash, as some customers were left being charged twice.\nBBVA and Santander also announced they would impose a 2 euro charge for ATM use out of their network.\nThe so-called \"cash-machine wars\" caused an uproar amongst consumer groups which said that the client was facing charges of up to 3 euros for a single withdrawal.\nThe Bank of Spain said in July that banking clients could not be charged twice.
