This move is also in line with Telkomâ€™s turnaround strategy to separate its wholesale and retail divisions to facilitate greater focus, accountability and most importantly, customer-centricity,\" the company said in a press statement. \n\"Over the past two years, our strategy has delivered positive results, but it is not yet complete. We have tackled inefficiency, complexity and high costs and our quest to improve our customer experience remains a primary focus. But to fundamentally change the way we do business, while also working to take up a meaningful and impactful role in an increasingly open-access environment, we have had to review our operating model,\" said Telkom GCEO Sipho Maseko. \n\"As a stand-alone business unit within Telkom, Openserve will be autonomous and will be responsible for its own profit and loss account,\" the company noted. \n\"Telkom has already begun reducing prices associated with wholesale network infrastructure access. With the launch of Openserve, we want to make a significant impact on the way we provide open access broadband to all South Africans. We welcome a more open-access environment and believe that we, as Openserve, can make important headway in helping all South African bridge the digital divide,\" said Alphonzo Samuels, the MD for Openserve. \nTelkom added that Openserve will \"play a substantial role in lowering the barrier to entry for new players and to increase the competitiveness of smaller players\".
