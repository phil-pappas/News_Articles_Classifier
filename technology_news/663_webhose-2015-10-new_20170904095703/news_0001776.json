He tweeted that his day began with a strikingly beautiful view of the Himalayas and vowed to visit them.\nKelly and his ex-astronaut twin Mark, on the ground, are part of an experiment on the long-term effects of space.\nRussia's Gennady Padalka holds the record with 879 days in space.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/70/8801854/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/70/8801854/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:31:57.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
