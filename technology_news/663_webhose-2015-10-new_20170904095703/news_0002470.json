(the \"Company\") (NYSE: SWI) today announced that the Company's board of directors, in response to an unsolicited expression of interest from a third party, has commenced a review of its strategic alternatives. This review may result in the Company's continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company or a possible sale or other form of business combination. The Board of Directors has retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor and DLA Piper LLP (US) as its legal advisor in connection with the review. \n\"Consistent with its duties, our board of directors has determined that it is prudent to undertake a review to see which alternative or alternatives, including our standalone plan, are the best way to maximize shareholder value,\" said Kevin Thompson, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. \"As the board conducts its review, we remain focused on strong revenue growth and cash flow and excited about continuing to deliver our world class products to help IT professionals manage all things IT.\" \nNo decision has been made to enter into any transaction at this time, and there can be no assurance that the consideration of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction. \nThere is no set timetable with respect to the board's review, and the Company does not expect to make further public comment regarding these matters unless and until the Board approves a specific action or otherwise concludes its review. \nAbout SolarWinds \nSolarWinds provides powerful and affordable hybrid IT infrastructure management software to customers worldwide from Fortune 500® enterprises to small businesses, government agencies and educational institutions.
