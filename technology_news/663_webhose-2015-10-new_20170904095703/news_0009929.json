He tweeted that his day began with a strikingly beautiful view of the Himalayas and vowed to visit them.\nKelly and his ex-astronaut twin Mark, on the ground, are part of an experiment on the long-term effects of space.\nRussia's Gennady Padalka holds the record with 879 days in space.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:00:33.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
