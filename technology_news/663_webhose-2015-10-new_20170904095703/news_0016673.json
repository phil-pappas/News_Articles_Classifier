About two hours later, Google said in posts on its status page that a full resolution was expected “in the near future” and that service had been restored for some users.\nThe segment that includes the cloud products generated $1.7 billion in second-quarter revenue, up 17 percent from a year earlier and a sharper gain than for the company’s other divisions. The affected products are available for free. Paying customers are mainly big businesses.\nThe services compete with Microsoft Corp. Office software suite and are designed to help people write documents, create presentations and store and analyze data.\nMultiple users on Twitter reported having difficulty using the services, including Jordan Nielsen, a self-identified children’s book buyer, who said she couldn’t access multiple “critical” documents stored in Google Drive.", "external_links": ["https://investor.google.com/earnings/2015/Q2_google_earnings.html\\", "http://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status\\"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:53:58.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
