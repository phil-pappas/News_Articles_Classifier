This accelerated training and certification program offers women a fast track to top jobs in cyber security. Qualified candidates complete SANS' intensive world class training and earn GIAC certifications at no charge. Participants that successfully complete the program are guaranteed cyber security employment opportunities. SANS Institute is working with the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), a non-profit focused on increasing women's meaningful participation in computing, to increase awareness of the academy with thousands of technical women participating in the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing Community. \n\"The cyber security industry urgently needs skilled professionals to fill critical jobs, and women have been a largely untapped resource. The Immersion Academy for Women was developed to provide a fast track for women who are interested in a career in cyber security,\" said Alan Paller , Director of Research, SANS Institute. \"The women's academy builds on the success of SANS' VetSuccess Immersion Academy for transitioning veterans. Extending the SANS CyberTalent Immersion Academy to women is the next logical step. We can't wait to see what amazing talent this program discovers.\" \nTo hlp address the severe shortage of skilled cyber security professionals, SANS piloted the innovative SANS VetSuccess Immersion Academy earlier this year. Designed for transitioning US veterans, the VetSuccess Immersion Academy is a faster, more reliable, and less expensive way to find, train and certify, and connect top cyber talent to employers. The SANS CyberTalent Immersion Academy for Women shares the goal of introducing highly talented, yet untapped, individuals to the cyber security industry. \nThe Immersion Academy is an intensive, accelerated program designed for completion in two to four months, depending upon the program selected. The admissions process for the women's academy is now open. Qualifying exams are being held October 5-30 .
