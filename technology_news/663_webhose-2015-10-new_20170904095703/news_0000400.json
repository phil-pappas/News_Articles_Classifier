The three pools were constructed just before Richard Nixon was ushered out of office. \nOn Nov. 3, Portage Public Schools voters will have a chance to approve a $128 million bond proposal that would build new Central and North middle schools, remodel West Middle, construct a swimming pool at each of the high schools, purchase 30 new school buses and acquire instructional technology that could lead to a computer or tablet for every student. \nOn the ballot with Proposal 1 will be Proposal 2 that seeks $16 million for a new multi-purpose stadium at each Portage high school. In total, the November ballot issue is $144 million. \nWhile supporters admit that the stadiums issue could face more opposition, they say they are getting good vibes for Proposal 1. \nRELATED: Two new stadiums proposed in Portage schools Proposal 2 \n'My biggest thing is I want to see everybody get out and vote,\" said Colleen Semler, head of Kids First, the citizens campaign committee that has been working with the district in sending out mailers, making a video, setting up a comprehensive web site ( www.portageps.org ), talking to parents and PTO groups, sponsoring coffees and talking with the media. \n\"I really think we can do it if everybody gets out there and votes. It will be successful for all of Portage, not just one particular group.\" \nCentral Middle was built in 1957, North Middle in 1961 and the three pools at the middle schools in the early 1970s. West Middle opened in 1972 and is considered to be in better shape than the other two middle schools. It would be remodeled if Proposal 1 passes. \nBackers of the proposals say that because North and Central middle schools were built more than 50 years ago, infrastructure and mechanical systems are ailing and the facilities lack the flexibility for modern education. \nDuring the months of discussions and studies, one of the main points of contention was the possible closing of West Middle and converting it to something else. Several residents urged the board to keep it as a middle school, and a community survey backed that up. \nThe survey of more than 400 residents said that 61 percent felt the three middle schools option was acceptable, with 62.3 percent indicating they would approve a 25-year bond for the three middle schools option. \nRELATED: Breaking down the 2 Portage schools bond proposals on Nov. 3 ballot \nAlso getting strong support was building two new pools. The survey showed 75 percent supported a new pool at each high school, with the same percentage backing a bond for the pools. \n\"I think the way it was handled was right, with the citizens group, the community forums, the surveys, the additional information board (the school website) and the final community survey,\" said Randy Van Antwerp, school board president. \nThe district also recently offered \"See For Yourself\" tours of Central and North middle schools and McCamley. A small gathering of parents and a few students was shown why district staff and officials feel the older buildings are insufficient for today's learning environment. \nFrom narrow hallways with sight issues to mechanical and electrical systems built nearly 60 years ago, before computers were a fact of life and education, the middle schools are functional but inefficient, they said. \n\"Kids learn differently today,\" said Central Middle principal Chuck Haskin as he pointed to desks and chairs in the hallway to accommodate one-on-one teaching and tutoring that can't be done in a classroom. \"The building is functional. We make it work. But we know we could do more if we had more options.\" \nThe pools, according to a Tower Pinkster facilities assessment, have major problems that would cost at least $10 million to repair or renovate. Problems include leaks in the gutter system and pipes, mechanical systems \"on borrowed time,\" pools inadequate for official swimming, diving and water polo competitions, the depth of the pools and high utility costs. \nOn a recent day the combined water polo team was practicing at Central Middle as coach Eric Lancaster talked about how they are challenged by having such a shallow end of the pool compared to other schools with deep bottoms at each end. \n\"We're the only team in the district still playing in a shallow-deep pool,\" Lancaster said as the group watched one goalie standing in three feet of water while the other goalie had to tread water in eight feet. \nThe 2015 bond campaign has been unique from the successful 2007 election in part because of the power of social media and flexibility of the district's website, www.portageps.org . \nThe website has become information central for the bond election, packed with documents, minutes, reports, surveys, a question and answer section that gets answers quickly and even a taxation calculator. \nFor example, the owner of a $150,000 home in Portage, which is the average home value in the city, would pay an additional $116.25 a year or $9.69 a month. \n\"For the average homeowner that's the cost of one pizza a month if they vote for this,\" Semler said. \nThe citizens committee also has a Twitter account @kidsfirst2015, and a Facebook page, There is also a Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/YES-For-the-Future-of-Portage-912416862181183/timeline/ \nWhile supporters like what they are hearing from some voters, they are hardly complacent about their chances for success. \n\"I have a good feeling about both proposals, but my concern is when you talk to people everyone just thinks it's going to pass,\" Van Antwerp said. \"I hope that does not mean they won't vote. We need people to get out and vote yes.\" \nTom Haroldson covers Portage, Vicksburg and Schoolcraft for MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette.
