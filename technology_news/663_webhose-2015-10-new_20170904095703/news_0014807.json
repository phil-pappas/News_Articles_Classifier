With a single click you can virtually talk face to face with your best friend, favorite family member, even long lost love. It’s so simple that even the greatest technophobe can figure it out, and apparently, so can most marine mammals. \nMeet Babyface and Sija. Two star crossed lovers, ripped apart because the world just couldn’t understand their love (really, I reached out to SEA LIFE Weymouth find out why the two seals were separated, but at the time of publishing this article, I have not heard back from them). The two seals had developed quite the bond when they lived together UK’s Cornish Seal Sanctuary, but after Sija conceived two pups she was banished to an all girls school for wayward seals. The whole thing came as quite the surprise for the caretakers, because Sija was on a contraceptive pill (because that’s a thing). \nTheir keepers felt remorse for breaking the two up, and hoped that a little digital therapy would ease the pangs of loneliness. Fiona Smith, the curator at SEA LIFE was unsure how the two would feel about the digital tablet. “At first the seals were both unsure about approaching the iPad, but once they saw each other they nosed up to it which was really nice to see.” You can see how the Sija nudges the screen and reacts to Babyface, when she’s not looking up at her handler for treats. \nStill, it’s nice to know that whenever she gets a little bit lonely and wistful for days gone by, Sija is just one click away from her beau, Babyface. \nFile this one under #SealFeels. \n[embedded content]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:35:06.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
