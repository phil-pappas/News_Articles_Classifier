Lithium's acquisition of Klout in 2014, the expansion of its Lithium Social Web (LSW) business, and its Total Community approach to solving customers' social marketing, engagement, and digital experience needs all necessitated a site upgrade. This is the third award for the Lithium.com site. \nAs Dayle Hall, VP of corporate marketing at Lithium noted, \"Our site has always been about showcasing the value we bring our customers and explaining our big ambitions for ourselves--and we do it in a simple and clear way. Our revamped site incorporates more industry thought leadership, presents new opportunities to discover how Lithium helps customers save money and increase revenue, and deploys new technologies to make our site not just a destination but also a gateway to our community, lead gen, and prospect tracking.\" \nThe Web Marketing Association (http://www.webmarketingassociation.org/wma/) is the producer of the WebAward Competition.
