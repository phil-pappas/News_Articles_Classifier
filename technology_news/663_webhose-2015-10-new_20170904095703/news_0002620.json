GeoTag can be used to accurately position all types of Ocean Bottom Cable (OBC), Ocean Bottom Node and Transition Zone cable systems for seabed seismic surveys in water depths down to 500 meters. \nThe highly flexible and reliable GeoTag solution operates with the smallest acoustic positioning transponder available on the market. The transponders are attached to the seabed seismic equipment and interrogated by a vessel-based transceiver. GeoTag's unique design allows for rapid maintenance such as battery replacement for improved crew efficiency. The transponders can also be stored on a reel and deployed mechanically when used with OBC systems, for seamless and cost-effective operations. \nWith the addition of GeoTag's acoustic positioning capability, Sercel now offers a complete, state-of-the-art acquisition solution for a wide range of seabed seismic surveys. GeoTag is fully scalable for use on small to large seabed crews deploying up to 10,000 acoustic positioning devices. \nPascal Rouiller, Sercel CEO, said: \"This new product capitalizes on our proven experience in acoustic positioning. It answers the need in the industry for more accurate positioning of seabed seismic equipment, particularly for 4D operations.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:26:25.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
