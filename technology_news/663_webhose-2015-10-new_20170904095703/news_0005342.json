The E-Bullet features a Bluetooth headset that syncs to any smartphone as well as a charger and a safety hammer to allow users to quickly escape from a car in an emergency situation. \nThe E-Bullet is an easy-to-use Bluetooth headset that, once set up to sync with a vehicle, automatically boots and connects to a mobile phone whenever the engine is started. The driver can easily answer and end phone calls without being distracted by a handset, making it safer to drive and engage in cell phone calls . \nThe device also includes an automatic charger. When connected to the vehicle, charging is automatic, so the headset is always ready to use. Further, it has a dual USB so that two devices can be connected in the car for on-the-go charging capability. Finally, the device features a metal safety hammer. This allows anyone trapped in a car to quickly and safely break a window or other glass and exit from the vehicle. Many experts recommend that everyone keep a safety hammer in his or her car in order to have a reliable way to exit the vehicle under any circumstances in which it may be difficult to open or roll down a window, such as when the car goes into water. \nAs seen at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/e-bullet-multi-function-blutooth-headset , the IndieGoGo campaign offers pledge levels of $31 for the first 500 donors, who will receive an E-Bullet device. The next 1000 donors will receive the E-Bullet for $34, and all donors after that will receive the E-Bullet for $40. \nFor more information, see the IndieGoGo page. \nAbout E-Bullet Multi-Function Bluetooth Headset: \nThe E-Bullet Multi-Function Bluetooth Headset is a unique device that features Bluetooth capability, a charger and a safety hammer. Now, the creator has launched an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds for production. \nMedia Contact", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:47:08.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
