The center's furtive recordings of Planned Parenthood officials discussing their retrieval of fetal tissue have sparked an uproar by conservatives and efforts by congressional Republicans to cut Planned Parenthood's federal funds. \nThe federation obtained a court order in San Francisco against public release of the footage. But in recent days, videos have been posted online at GotNews.com, a conservative website. \nThat website's founder, Charles C. Johnson, wrote on his site that he got the recordings \"from a source on Capitol Hill.\" \nDavid Daleiden, the abortion foe who leads the center, gave his footage to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee after it was subpoenaed by that panel's chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. \nVicki Saporta, National Abortion Federation president, said in a written statement that her organization did not know if Johnson got the footage from Congress. But she said she wants Chaffetz to investigate if it did and to take steps to make sure the videos are secure, citing increased danger to abortion clinic workers. \n\"The release of more videos will likely lead to more threats, intimidation and possibly violence against abortion providers,\" Saporta said. \nMJ Henshaw, a Chaffetz spokeswoman, declined to comment when asked about the abortion federation's request. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
