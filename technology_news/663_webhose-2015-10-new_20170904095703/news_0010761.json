Henry Vogel, former co-founder and CEO of social recommendation search engine Raved which BCG DV purchased last year, will lead global operations for DV Hatch along with the firm’s broader innovation and incubation efforts as a Partner and Managing Director. \nDV Hatch is a first-of-its-kind corporate incubator dedicated to funding, incubating and scaling internally developed IP and start ups in partnership with some of the world’s leading companies. DV Hatch will be connected to BCG DV’s global network of innovation centers in Manhattan Beach, London, Berlin and Sydney. BCG DV plans to open DV Centers and Hatches in several other key commercial hubs, both in the U.S. and abroad, as a focal point of its global expansion. In contributing its own risk capital alongside corporate partners to these new businesses, BCG DV is also establishing a new model for corporate innovation and venture capital. \nHenry Vogel brings more than two decades worth of entrepreneurial and investment experience to the role having previously served as the head of visionary companies including Apptera (Soleo) and Quigo (AOL). Henry also co-founded the pricing innovation practice at BCG and has filled leadership roles in corporate strategy and marketing at eBay. At BCG DV, Henry will oversee the integration of Raved and other BCG DV-incubated IP along with the build out of DV Hatch across ventures in the retail, consumer, financial services, transportation, healthcare and other sectors. \n“I'm excited to help leading brands and businesses own the next chapter of innovation and growth,” says Vogel. “BCG DV can unlock incredibly valuable assets from within corporate organizations and help our partners create truly disruptive new businesses that solve key consumer frictions, deepen relationships and generate new revenue streams, profit pools and competitive advantage. In doing so, we’re also looking forward to creating a new winning model for corporate venture capital.” \nVogel is joined at DV Hatch by Raved co-founder Alex Dukic and a team of world-class entrepreneurs, engineers and product experts. By developing partnerships with digital forerunners in the Bay Area and ultimately around the world, DV Hatch will extend BCG DV’s global innovation value proposition. \n“Large businesses need a new way to grow,” adds Jeff Schumacher, BCG DV Founder & CEO. “Our corporate partners have great brands and infrastructure.
