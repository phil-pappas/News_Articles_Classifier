Many have warned of a new battleground for resources emerging in the 21st century.\nThe U.N. conference on climate is to be held from November 30 to December 11 in Paris.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:41:52.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
