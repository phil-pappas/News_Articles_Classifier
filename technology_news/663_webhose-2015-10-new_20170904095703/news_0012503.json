The SanDisk pre qualification program is the first of many new programs and services that CMTL plans to introduce as it aggressively expands testing services into the flash/SSD market, which CMTL states represents an explosive growth opportunity. \nCMTL President, John Deters, stated: \"CMTL is excited to have an independent compatibility testing program relationship with SanDisk, the industry's most well known name and leader in the flash/SSD market place.\" Deters added, \"Unfortunately SSDs are not like hard drives and they wear out and lose performance with continued read/write usage. We are being told about massive miss representation with regard to sustainable performance and functionally as just one example of the information issues SSD customers are having to deal with.\" \nCMTL was established in 1996, as an independent third party memory products test lab to ensure memory product compatibility and functionality on any platform or system combination. To date CMTL has performed over 25,0000 computer memory product/platform advanced compatibility and functionality tests. \nSanDisk is a registered trademark of SanDisk corporation. \nContact: John Deters, CMTL , 770-238-2085, jdeters@cmtlabs.com \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandisk-fully-implements-cmtl-flash-memory-products-pre-qualification-testing-program-300157142.html \nSOURCE CMTL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:07:46.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
