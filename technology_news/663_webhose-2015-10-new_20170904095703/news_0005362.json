It is also being weighed down by\nlower energy oil prices that have undercut capital investment in the energy sector, as well as a so-called inventory correction.\nThe weak industrial production report added to soft trade, retail sales and employment data that have suggested a significant slowdown in growth after the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the second quarter.\nThird-quarter growth estimates are currently below a 1.5 percent rate. Slower growth and low inflation have diminished expectations of an interest rate hike from the Fed this year.\nManufacturing output fell 0.1 percent even though robust demand for automobiles lifted motor vehicle and parts production 0.2 percent. Manufacturing output dropped by a revised 0.4 percent in August, which was previously reported as a 0.5\npercent drop.\nFor the third quarter, manufacturing output increased at a 2.5 percent rate.\nThere were declines in the production of computer and electronic products, as well as electronic equipment, appliances and components. Primary metals and machinery output increased.\nMining production fell 2.0 percent as oil and gas well drilling tumbled 4.0 percent after increasing for two straight months. An almost 60 percent plunge in oil prices since June 2014 has hurt the profits of oil-field companies like\nSchlumberger ( SLB.N ) and Halliburton ( HAL.N ), leading to deep cuts in their capital spending budgets.\nUtilities production increased 1.3 percent in September.\nWith output declining, industrial capacity use fell to 77.5 percent from 77.8 percent in August.\nOfficials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much \"slack\" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to accelerate before it becomes inflationary.\n((Reporting by Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by Paul Simao))", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:24:45.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
