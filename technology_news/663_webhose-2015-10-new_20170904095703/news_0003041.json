The collection features a line of made-to-order handmade solid wood furniture, hand-thrown porcelain tableware, hand-poured soy & beeswax candles and a pair of classic bags, which are now available for purchase at kaufmann-mercantile.com/kaufmann. \"From the very beginning, Kaufmann Mercantile has worked closely with makers and manufacturers from around the world, sharing a deep appreciation for products made with honest, lasting materials and grounded in a sense of place.\" said Sebastian Kaufmann , CEO and Founder of Kaufmann Mercantile, \"Our new endeavor, celebrates the simple yet focused pursuit of distilling a piece to its most essential.\"\nKaufmann represents the latest evolution in the story of Kaufmann Mercantile which was sparked when a plastic stapler appeared on Sebastian Kaufmann's desk six years ago. The mass-produced product represented everything troublesome with throw-away culture, and so, he decided to launch an online homewares shop for a slower, more thoughtful life. Starting with eight carefully chosen products, Kaufmann Mercantile has steadily grown to offer two-thousand items – and now debut brand of originally designed homewares.\n\"We set out to find and provide enduring products for everyday life, and discovered in the process a growing desire for an antidote to today's techno-saturated lives—a connection to presence, provenance, materials and nature,\" said Kaufmann. \"Kaufmann is the result of that desire, a collection that inspires us to reengage with the natural world by surrounding ourselves with tangible reminders, whether it be in the form of a hand-thrown porcelain bowl or a gathering bench handmade in the Hudson Valley.\"\nThe Kaufmann Collection\nTo create Kaufmann, the team drew on the unique experiences and expertise of each craftsperson to develop an aesthetic set apart by timeless, effortless design. The new brand inherits many of Kaufmann Mercantile's defining values: a return to honest materials and transparent manufacturing that helps tell the story of how, when and where each piece was made. The collection includes four categories:\nKaufmann Handmade Solid Wood Furniture: Kaufmann crafted furniture is made by skilled woodworkers and celebrates the natural beauty and texture of the wood. Each piece is available in Black Walnut or White Oak, and hand-finished with mineral oil and beeswax. The collection includes the Kaufmann Gathering Bench, Trestle Dining Table, Kitchen Island and Ladder Chairs. The Gathering Bench and Ladder Chairs can be customized with bridle leather seat inlay. Made in New York .\nKaufmann Hand-Thrown Porcelain Tableware: Each piece of the Kaufmann tableware collection is hand-thrown, balancing classic forms and contemporary textures. Now available in a Natural Gloss; two custom matte glazes, in Cream and Almond, are coming soon. The collection includes the Kaufmann Dinner Plate, Salad Plate, Serving Bowl, Cereal Bowl, Mug, and Butter Dish. Made in Oregon .\nKaufmann Natural Candles: Kaufmann soy and beeswax blend candles are lightly scented with pure essential oils. Each is hand-poured into a glass vessel, making them all-natural down to the French cotton wick. Available in Grapefruit and Patchouli, Cedar and Juniper, or Lavender and Mint. Made in New York .\nLeather & Canvas Carry Collection Crafted by a second-generation leather maker, the Kaufmann carry collection features premium leather and brass hardware in modern, structured shapes. The line includes the Kaufmann Weekender and Tote Bag. Made in California. To learn more about Kaufmann and place an order, visit kaufmann-mercantile.com/kaufmann .
