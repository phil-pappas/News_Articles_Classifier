While the UK’s tax authority had taken the position that Bitcoin is a currency , tax authorities in some countries, such as Sweden and Germany, had argued that it should be treated more like a commodity, making transfers of it subject to sales taxes.\nWhile the ruling is not a surprise, because it follows a July recommendation from one of the court’s top lawyers, European Bitcoin businesses are breathing a sigh of relief. They had argued such taxes would give a competitive advantage to businesses outside the bloc that did not face similar threats.\nThe ruling is “the first step in securing Bitcoin’s future as a genuine alternative to national currencies,” said Richard Asquith, vice president at tax compliance firm Avalara.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/01/meet-britains-bitcoin-barrister/"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:27:59.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
