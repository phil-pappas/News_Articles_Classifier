Morgan Chase & Co. said Monday that it will consider giving certain big investors the chance to nominate members to its board, potentially joining a long list of U.S. companies opening up corporate elections this year.\nThe change to the bank’s JPM, +0.05% bylaws, which will be considered at the next regularly scheduled board meeting, would give shareholders the right to place their director nominees in the firm’s proxy statement. Specifically, the amendment would allow investors to nominate up to 20% of the board, or least two directors, and include a shareholder ownership threshold requirement of 3% for at least three consecutive years.\nCitigroup Inc. adopted a similar plan earlier this year with identical ownership thresholds. Among other companies that have taken the step are General Electric Co., Chevron Co. and Coca-Cola Co.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-to-consider-adopting-proxy-access-1445892324?link=mktw"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:54:38.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
