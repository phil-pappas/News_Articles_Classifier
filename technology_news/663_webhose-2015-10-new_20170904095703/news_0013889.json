It's as though the new Mac system isn't big enough to leave Yosemite.\nNonetheless, it's an upgrade worth having, especially because it's free. Although you're not getting a lot of new functionality, El Capitan is packed with goodies that will shave off seconds here and there. Those seconds will add up.\nBack up your system before upgrading, and make sure any apps you use frequently will work with the new system. Sometimes, it takes app makers weeks or months to catch up.\nHere are features worth checking out:\n• Pinning websites: A pin is like a bookmark on Apple's Safari browser, except the website you're pinning is always open and refreshing in the background. If you visit another website and come back, pins remember where you left off — as long as you don't close the browser.\n• Split screens and spaces: The Mac has long let you run multiple apps in separate windows, but you've been limited to one app in full-screen mode. This changes with El Capitan's Split View, a feature Microsoft has had since Windows 8's release in 2012. Although you can come close to split screens by resizing two windows and placing them side by side, you now just need to press and hold the green button on the top left of an app's window.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:43:42.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
