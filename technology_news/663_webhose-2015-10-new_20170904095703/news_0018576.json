Source: General Motors\nEver lock your keys in the car? General Motors says it’s going to have an app for that.\nVice President of Strategy Mike Ableson, speaking during an analyst presentation at the company’s suburban-Detroit proving grounds, showed images of an Apple Watch app under testing that lets owners lock or unlock their cars, or start them remotely. The application would ride a trend in the auto business of moving away from conventional components to operate the car, and it is one item in a stable of experiments GM is employing to keep up in the industry’s tech race.\nGM’s exploration of the Apple Watch is fueled by technology that it has long held at its OnStar unit. The telematics service has been fitted on GM vehicles since the 1990s, and the auto maker has been able to help buyers get into their cars and utilize them even if they have lost the keys.\nThe auto maker on Thursday laid out several other initiatives under way aimed at helping the Detroit auto maker compete with traditional industry players, including BMW, or taking on the start-ups, such as Uber Technologies or Tesla Motors. It also believes it can handle the threat posed by Google's self-piloted cars or Apple Inc.’s electric car targeted for late this decade.\nFor instance, GM next year will add a fleet of Chevrolet Volts that drive autonomously to its engineering campus in Southeast Michigan. Volts operate on battery power for 50 miles, and then can transition to a gasoline engine.\nGM employees will be allowed to reserve a Volt via an app, then use the self-driving feature to travel around the campus. GM will fit Cadillacs with autonomous-vehicle technology next year.\nGM also announced a new car-sharing initiative. In New York, residents of The Ritz Plaza luxury apartment building at Times Square will have access to shared Chevrolet SUVs. Parking spots will be available in 200 parking garages.\nA sharing service could help expose people to GM products who otherwise wouldn’t consider the auto maker, Mr. Ableson said.\nThe auto maker also unveiled an “eBike” concept, but provided little detail on plans for it. In about 2020, GM will put a fuel-cell vehicle on sale that was co-developed with Honda Motor.\nGM Product Chief Mark Reuss said his company is open to working with Japan’s Honda on other product initiatives.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO669_GMDIGI_G_20151001122518.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:42:21.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
