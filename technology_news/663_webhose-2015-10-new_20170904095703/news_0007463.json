Very extraordinary. This is pioneering situational awareness information for ground troops. \nWith a Q-Warrior upgraded helmet, a warrior has access to augmented 3D vision on the battlefield. \nHow does it work? \nEasy to use, Q-Warrior is designed to be intuitive and the display clips in easily to helmet FAST rails, immediately ramping up its utility. Weighing about six ounces, it’s also light on battery usage. \nRather than look down at a tablet or other display for data, once attached to your helmet this lightweight gadget provides a see-through display to provide critical data. \nLooking out from under the helmet, the warrior sees the real-world battlefield overlaid with data. It can provide critical head-up, eyes-out situational awareness to a dismounted soldier. \nWhat can you see? \nUpgraded Q-Warrior vision means you have complete awareness of everyone moving around in the battle space. \nThe 3D battle space is displayed in a simple way, making it easier for warriors to receive important data more easily. The real world is overlaid with digital data, graphics and imagery to enhance combat situational awareness. \nWhat sort of data? Immediate identification of hostile, non-hostile and friendly forces is important in combat. \nThe Q-Warrior does this and shows the warrior where they are in the battlefield. \nFriendly forces are shown in blue, while hostile forces show up as red. Their location is overlaid with accuracy and as they move they are tracked in the display. \nCoordinating small units in simultaneous activity can be tough, but with the Q-Warrior every team member can see where the others are at any given moment and how they are progressing. \nThis state-of-the-art tech also makes navigating easy. No more looking down at a handheld device to find waypoints, targets and other data. This is a heads up, eyes out way to adapt and mission plan downrange. \nUnmanned vehicles and other surveillance sensors can provide very useful data to warfighters. The Q-Warrior can take full colour sensor imagery from these sources and show it on the display for the warrior to review in real time. \nA team’s air controller can also use the Q-Warrior to see where air assets are at any given moment, as well as stay up to speed on their distance and altitude. For enhanced targeting and calling close air support, the tech enables exact target acquisition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:10:29.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
