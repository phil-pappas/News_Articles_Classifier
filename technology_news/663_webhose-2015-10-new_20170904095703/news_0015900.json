Sales fell 7 percent to $1.01 billion.\nNonetheless, CA chief executive Mike Gregoire said he was pleased that the company increased its new sales by more than 40 percent. \"This is an indicator of the great traction our products are experiencing and CA's value in today's application economy,\" he said in a prepared statement accompanying the company's earnings report.\nCA released its report after the close of regular trading on Wall Street. Shares rose less than 1 percent in after-hours trading, to $27.73.\nThe company, which was based for 22 years in Islandia before moving its corporate office to Manhattan in 2014, became one of the nation's largest software makers by selling mainframe programs to credit card companies, banks and other large enterprises.\nAs mainframe sales have slipped, CA has struggled to reinvent itself through cloud-based software and other programs.\nDuring the second quarter, CA's mainframe sales fell 9 percent, to $554 million. Sales of cloud-based and other enterprise software dipped 3 percent, to $368 million.\nThe latest LI business news in your inbox daily.
