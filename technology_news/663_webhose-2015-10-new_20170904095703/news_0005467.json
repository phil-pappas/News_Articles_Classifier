However it is important to realise that the Chinese economy will grow at a slower pace in coming years as the economy gets bigger and matures.\"\nWhile Mr Sebastian said he believed the Reserve Bank of Australia would sit on the sidelines in the face of the slowing growth, market pricing for an RBA rate cut in December had grown to an 80 per cent chance following Westpac's out-of-cycle hike.\nChina-exposed mining stocks were the main drag on the local market today, with gold stocks particularly hard hit.\nNewcrest dropped 3.38 per cent to $14.68 while Evolution Mining plunged 6.09 per cent to $1.465.\nFortescue fell 4.17 per cent to $2.30, while Alumina declined 4.07 per cent to $1.18.\nArrium shares rose 14.29 per cent to 12c as it moved towards its lower costs target.\nMeanwhile, telecommunications stocks were also soft, after online retail heavyweight Ruslan Kogan re-entered the Australian mobile market, signing a partnership with Vodafone to relaunch discount Kogan Mobile phone plans.\nTelstra gave up 2.57 per cent to $5.30 while TPG retreated 0.69 per cent to $10.725.\nThe banks were the firmest sector on the market, while energy stocks were also buoyant.\nâ€‹ Westpac shares rallied 3.66 per cent to $31.34 after raising $1.6 billion in an institutional offer, as part of its $3.5bn capital raising.\nCommonwealth Bank was the only lender among the big four to go backwards, as it dipped 0.16 per cent to $76.43.\nANZ shares lifted 0.66 per cent to $28.86, while National Australia Bank gained 0.6 per cent to $31.96.\nWoodside Petroleum added 2.04 per cent to $32.07 while Oil Search gained 0.41 per cent to $7.43.\nElsewhere, Treasury Wine was up 14.63 per cent to $7.40 after it raised nearly $400m to help fund its takeover of Diageo wine operations.\nLooking ahead, tomorrow the federal government is expected to release its response to the Murray financial system inquiry while Newcrest and Oil Search release quarterly production figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:13:23.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
