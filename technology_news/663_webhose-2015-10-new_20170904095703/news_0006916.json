It will help syndicates make larger, faster investments in early-stage startups and their follow-on rounds. It will also help promising new syndicates make investments while they’re building a backing from individual investors,” AngelList said in a blogpost. \nThe deal is also seen as the “largest-ever single investment by a Chinese private-equity firm in a US. fund,” The Wall Street Journal said in a news report. \nAngelList, which functions as a matchmaking site for startups and investors, was founded in 2010 by India-origin serial entrepreneur Naval Ravikant along with Babak Nivi. Since its inception AngelList is said to have facilitated over $200 million in investments for about 650 startups. \nAkin to Facebook or Reddit, AngelList relies on its thousands of members, as well as startups seeking investment, to create deal flow. In other words, AngelList uses the “syndicates” model that allows highly influential investors to pool money from their personal funds for investments. Some of its portfolio companies, such as ride sharing app Uber, have gone onto become unicorns of the startup world. \n“As we add more limited partner capital we’re going to add more syndicate leads who are voting with their own dollar,” Ravikant told the Wall Street Journal . \n“We’re going to deploy an army of leads,” he added. \nure Capital, or China Science & Merchants Investment Management Group, has about $12 billion under management. The fund has already chosen 50 top leads on the crowdfunding platform that will be consider for investments with the help of AngelList \n“CSC Upshot is about Chinese LPs expanding globally and showing that Chinese companies can go out globally and compete in a way that gets them exposure at the very earliest stage, instead of waiting for the Series D round,” Ravikant told Techcrunch . \nIn July, the Times of India had reported that AngelList intends to kick-off operations in India. AngelList has already taken its platform outside of the US with outposts now in the UK, Canada, Australia, and some parts of Europe. \nPrior to starting AngelList, Ravikant had co-founded Epinions (which went public as part of Shopping.com) and Vast.com. He is also an active angel investor and has put money in companies such as Twitter, Uber, Yammer, Stack Overflow and Wanelo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:37:19.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
