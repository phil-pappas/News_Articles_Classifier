However, it said medium-term demand outlook for both DRAM and NAND chips would likely stay healthy.\nSK Hynix reported an operating profit of 1.4 trillion won ($1.23 billion) in the third quarter, in line with expectations, compared with 1.3 trillion won a year earlier. Revenue rose 14.2 percent to 4.9 trillion won.\nAnalysts said ahead of the earnings disclosure that orders from smartphone makers like Apple Inc for new products likely helped SK Hynix's bottom line.\nThe won's depreciation also probably boosted profits, they said. The currency's average value against the dollar fell 12 percent from a year earlier, according to the Bank of Korea.\nSK Hynix, which competes with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , Micron Technology Inc and Toshiba Corp , said third-quarter shipments of DRAM chips grew 11 percent from the previous period, while the average selling price fell 11 percent.\nNAND chip shipments rose 15 percent sequentially, while their average price declined 15 percent.\nInvestors and analysts are concerned about the firm's outlook, as the weaker Chinese economy and weaker emerging market currencies undercut consumer electronics makers and their suppliers. Researcher Gartner expects global semiconductor sales to fall 0.8 percent, marking the first decline since 2012.\nSK Hynix shares are down nearly 30 percent so far this year as of Wednesday's close, reflecting such worries.\n($1 = 1,139.1600 won) (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:18:39.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
