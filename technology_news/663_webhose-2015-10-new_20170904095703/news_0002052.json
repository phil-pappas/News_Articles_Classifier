Dovetailing with the Society’s 2015 theme, “Technology Meets Patient Care,” Elements provide indication-specific and intelligent workflows for stereotactic radiosurgery that automate the procedure so caregivers can spend more time with patients and less time on technology. \nBrainlab has been leading the SRS field for two decades, all the while gaining constructive feedback from clinicians, which has been incorporated into a whole new set of Elements that offer indication-inherent intelligence. With Elements, Brainlab has identified, extracted and refined valuable, clinician-preferred features and benefits from iPlan and developed à la carte modules offered in a wide range of business models. \n“We’ve carefully analyzed what keeps good treatments from being perfect treatments,” explains Stefan Vilsmeier , President and CEO, Brainlab. “By focusing each Element on a single clinical indication, we are able to frontload intelligence and streamline processes, re-building from scratch the premier cranial, spine and lung software for radiotherapy. Clinicians can create a wholly personalized suite of Elements to deliver innovative stereotactic radiosurgery.” \nElements Cranial SRS* will become the core treatment software that complements existing workflows and will help overcome challenges and limitations in the industry. This software toolkit will enhance virtually every department’s workflows. Every step of the process, every software screen in Elements SRS will be based on clinical need and user necessity – doctor-patient interaction need not be compromised or shortened by cumbersome technological requirements. \nDynamic conformal arcs have been extremely successful over the past two decades, used to deliver millions of treatments because they are dosimetrically easy to validate and are dosimetrically robust in the planning and delivery process. Nevertheless, the increased flexibility in shaping the dose using VMAT techniques has also become attractive. \n“Combining conformal arcs with VMAT offers the best of both worlds,” explains Sean Clark, President, Brainlab, Inc. “Furthermore, Brainlab Elements are offered in different business models including subscriptions. This allows facilities to cost effectively invest in future innovations and capitalize on premium features as they are introduced. \nFor more information, visit www.brainlab.com/elements . \nAbout Brainlab \nBrainlab, headquartered in Munich, develops, manufactures and markets software-driven medical technology, enabling access to advanced, less invasive patient treatments. \nCore products center on information-guided surgery, radiosurgery, precision radiation therapy, digital operating room integration, and information and knowledge exchange.
