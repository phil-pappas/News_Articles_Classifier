Southern Power is a subsidiary of Southern Company, a national leader in providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, and Turner Renewable Energy is an investor of renewable energy projects in the United States. \nThe project, named Morelos del Sol, is expected to be built with approximately 111,744 CIS modules mounted on single-axis trackers. Located in Kern County, California, the project is part of Solar Frontier’s 280 megawatt US solar project development pipeline. \nThe project developer, Solar Frontier Americas Development LLC, a division of Solar Frontier Americas, is comprised of an experienced development team with offices in San Francisco, California and Reno, Nevada. They initiated construction on the Morelos del Sol project in July and commercial operation is expected in late November. The company currently has nine PV projects in various stages of development. \nCharles Pimentel, COO of Solar Frontier Americas, commented, “Southern Company is a leader in renewable energy development and we are pleased a company of its stature is purchasing Solar Frontier’s project.” \n“As a national leader in renewables, this acquisition fits Southern Power’s business strategy of growing the wholesale business by acquiring generating assets and building new units in targeted markets,” said Southern Power President and CEO, Oscar C. Harper. \nSolar Frontier Americas Development LLC develops PV projects installed with Solar Frontier’s advanced CIS technology, a solar module that generates higher energy yields (kilowatt-hours per kilowatt peak) in real-world environments than conventional crystalline silicon technologies. A world leader in manufacturing excellence, the company’s fully automated, state-of-the-art plant facilities deliver solar modules constructed with consistent precision and the highest level of quality. Solar Frontier’s projects have increasingly gained the attention of investors and project developers across the Americas. \nAbout Solar Frontier Americas Development LLC \nSolar Frontier Americas Development LLC, a subsidiary of Solar Frontier (a global energy solutions company), develops and sells high performing, utility-scale photovoltaic plants in the United States and Latin America.
