Visitors to the Peninsula Library System’s San Mateo County Library (SMCL) will have the opportunity to experience the event thanks to the library’s lightning-fast expanded Gigabit network and participate in the discussion afterward. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151019006658/en/ \nThe Gigabit network was provided to SMCL through CENIC’s California Research and Education Network (CalREN), a high-capacity 3,800-mile fiber-optic-based network designed to meet the unique requirements of research universities, K-20 students, public libraries and Bay Area cultural institutions. The concert will stream exclusively from SFJAZZ Center to audiences at the Belmont Library, East Palo Alto Library, and Redwood City Main Library at 11:00 a.m. PDT. \nThe matinee, part of SFJAZZ’s \"Exchanges from the Stage\" series, will feature performing artists from the SFJAZZ Collective, an all-star award-winning jazz ensemble made up of eight of the finest performers and composers at work in jazz today. The current octet is an international ensemble comprising alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón, tenor saxophonist David Sánchez, vibraphonist Warren Wolf, trumpeter Sean Jones, trombonist Robin Eubanks, pianist Edward Simon, bassist Matt Penman, and drummer Obed Calvaire. \n\"The CENIC Gigabit network has, for the first time, enabled SFJAZZ to begin to realize its vision of sharing the spontaneity and art of jazz with new audiences that might not otherwise be exposed to this art form,\" said Mount V. Allen, III, CFE, Director of Operations for SFJAZZ. \nWorking with the Califa Group and the California State Library, CENIC is committed to connecting all of California’s public libraries to CalREN. To that end, prior to the state’s funding of the High-Speed Broadband in California Public Libraries initiative, CENIC agreed to waive its typical fees over a five-year period -- a gift of more than $1.25M -- in order to get the project off the ground. Using the San Francisco Public Library (SFPL) and the Peninsula Library System as pilot sites, CENIC connected them at 10 Gbps and also loaned these library systems the equipment necessary to make the initial upgrades possible. Because libraries are so central to their communities, connecting them to CalREN will one day effectively provide all of California’s 38 million residents with high-performance access to the myriad resources that constitute 21st-century digital citizenship, and will provide California itself with all of the economic benefits of a fully digitally empowered population. \nBoth fun and educational, this SFJAZZ family matinee concert will provide a window into the exciting world of live jazz.
