As many governments now require annual benchmarking for commercial buildings and set penalties for non-compliance, greeNEWit, a firm driving sustainable community development, helps owners navigate the benchmarking requirements. As of September 27, 2015, Washington D.C. and Montgomery County will start fining non-compliant properties in violation of the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance (“BERDO”). The fine is $100 a day to buildings who do not submit the required calendar year 2014 benchmarking data to the District of Columbia's Department of Energy & Environment (DOEE). While this fine can vary across cities, they are consistently steep.\nThe ordinance requires certain building owners to monitor, report and disclose energy and water usage data for their properties. While energy benchmarking ordinances differ from one city to another, they contain several common elements, including reporting requirements, building type and size thresholds, disclosure requirements and additional requirements such as mandatory audits and efficiency upgrades.\nOnce energy use data have been reported to the city, nearly all energy benchmarking ordinances require that the information be published on a public website and disclosure at a minimum of the following: building identification, energy intensity, greenhouse gas emissions per square foot, ENERGY STAR® rating (where available) and water consumption per square foot.\ngreeNEWit offers support performing, tracking and reporting the new mandate to ensure compliance for multifamily properties and commercial buildings to avoid penalty. In addition, greeNEWit offers:\nAutomatic annual compliance with benchmarking laws in a subscription model Online access to a monitoring platform for your facility management team Continuous tracking of energy use to measure and verify the effectiveness of any improvements Identification of energy efficiency opportunities based on local rebates and building performance\nIf you are the owner of a commercial, multifamily or public building in Washington D.C. or Montgomery County, email Director of Multifamily Energy Solutions Michael Santiago at michael(dot)s(at)greeNEWit(dot)com before September 27, 2015, to see what requirements apply and avoid future fines.\nAbout greeNEWit\ngreeNEWit is the national leader in sustainable community development and smart grid integration.
