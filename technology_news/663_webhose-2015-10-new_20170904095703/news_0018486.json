The global financial services industry is expected to spend billions of dollars in coming years to improve their analysis capabilities.\nBut civil liberties campaigners have expressed concerns that use of such data could breach personal privacy. They also say it could be misused to discriminate against certain sections of the population in so-called profiling, for example based on age, gender, health or ethnic background.\nThe three EU financial regulators - the European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority, and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority - will focus on the \"opportunities and challenges\" related to the use of big data, they said in a joint statement on Monday.\n\"The topic aims to analyse the adequacy of sectoral regulatory frameworks and identify any regulatory and/or supervisory measures which may need to be taken,\" they added.\nThey will look into the matter in the coming year, but did give further details about the nature of the work or when they would announce findings.\nBanks are hoping to use in-house data in better ways to spot fraudulent activities more easily, look at spending patterns to decide where to locate a new branch or personalise financial products.\nLast month BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said it was going to use big data to help its portfolio managers pick stocks.
