PAUL, Minn. , Sept. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- This year Alexandria Country Day School (ACDS), a leading K-8 independent school, greeted middle school students upon their return from summer vacation with a unique addition to their classrooms: standing desks from Ergotron. ACDS' integration of Ergotron's LearnFit Adjustable Standing Desk was made in response to numerous studies that have shown the negative effects of sitting and how more movement during the school day encourages healthier behavior long-term and better student focus for improved classroom performance. In addition to limiting the type of teaching and learning that can occur in the classroom, sitting for long periods of time at traditional desks has been linked to adolescent health risks such as childhood obesity. While there has been a growing awareness of the importance of physical activity to both brain development and physical health, the traditional classroom setting has not been conducive to helping children remain active throughout the day – until now.\nAlong with welcoming a brand-new school year, September also marks National Childhood Obesity Month: an opportunity to spread awareness about this critical issue and excite change. Alexandria Country Day School's dynamic classroom initiative utilizing LearnFit Adjustable Standing Desks in its Middle School, as well as ergonomically responsive furniture in its Lower School, exemplifies an innovative response to this serious health concern while simultaneously improving student engagement and performance. Research shows that standing more throughout the day increases blood circulation, burns more calories, and helps maintain muscle tone and insulin effectiveness. This increased physical activity throughout the day also leads to greater student engagement, better on-task behavior and attentiveness, and enhanced academic performance. Head of School Scott Baytosh , who led this charge for change at ACDS, and is a standing desk user himself, sees ACDS' classroom initiative as the opportunity to make a bold statement about improving student health and increasing classroom engagement.\n\"We are tremendously excited to partner with Ergotron to provide dynamic and flexible classroom environments that get our middle school students physically engaged in their learning and also respond to the active and hands-on style of our teachers.\" Baytosh added, \"By replacing traditional desks with LearnFit desks in all of our fifth through eighth grade classrooms, we have made a strong commitment to this innovative approach, and we're eager to lead the way in utilizing classroom designs that respond to both the intellectual and physical needs of kids.\"\nContinuing to support the school's five-year strategic plan, including ongoing curriculum and instruction enhancements and interior and exterior improvements, the school purchased 128 LearnFit desks as well as TeachWell® Mobile Digital Workspaces from Ergotron using funds from a $3 million gift from an anonymous donor in 2014, the largest in the school's 32-year history.\nPart of school-wide classroom renovations designed to provide flexible furnishings well-suited to student learning and effective teaching, the LearnFit desks in the middle school and TeachWell podiums in all grades have been well received. Said Jim Girard , a 7th and 8th grade history teacher: \"I configure my classroom multiple ways throughout the day to allow for teacher centered instruction, group work, individual work and simulations. With the LearnFit desks, I can easily move set ups from a horseshoe shape, to multiple small groups and even all desks aside for an open floor space. Just one week into the school year, I am already enjoying the benefits of giving the students the option to stand or sit at their desks.\"\n\"We are very excited about Alexandria Country Day School's pioneering actions,\" explained Bob Hill , Ergotron's education manager. \"Their aim is to unleash the collaborative potential of their students, staff, 1:1 devices and personalized learning systems – as well as to provide a learning environment that sets up students for individual health and success.\"\nFor more information about LearnFit or Ergotron's education portfolio, please visit Education.ergotron.com.
