This case is still pending, and is unrelated to Friday's sentencing.\nUSA TODAY\nFormer Uber driver linked to series of assaults in Boston\nAn Uber spokesman confirmed to USA TODAY that Done passed Uber's background check before he began working for the platform, and that the state of Massachusetts confirmed he had a clean record prior to his arrest. None of the incidents that occurred between 2006 and 2010 happened while Done was working for Uber, and the car the victim entered was not the one she requested off the app.\n\"This was a tragic incident and we were grateful to be able to assist police and prosecutors in identifying the perpetrator,\" said Uber spokeswoman Carlie Waibel.\nA Massachusetts county District Attorney Marion Ryan encouraged the public to take precautions when using any ride-sharing service.\n\"While these apps are a modern convenience, they are not without their risks. Customers should make sure to verify license plates and car make and models before entering any vehicle, and remain active and aware of their surroundings,\" Ryan said in a Friday press release.\nThe way Uber conducts its background checks was a recent point of contention in the Massachusetts State House.\nFour bills were discussed in the State House last month that would put state regulations on for-hire transportation companies, especially on the process used for background checks.\nUber currently uses a third-party service to conduct background checks. One bill proposed by Gov. Charlie Baker, would give the state oversight on the process used to check potential drivers. Uber has openly voiced its support for this bill.\nElsewhere in the U.S., Uber's problems are piling up. This weekend, Uber Drivers called for a nationwide strike against the ride-sharing service on a Facebook group called UBER Freedom. Protesters organized in cities such as San Francisco and Dallas to call for better wages and higher fares.\nEarlier this year, a handful of drivers were granted class-action status on their lawsuits against the ride-hailing company after suing Uber on the grounds that they should be labeled employees and not independent contractors. In New York and Houston, taxi drivers have also openly argued that Uber is squeezing them out of a living wage.\nUSA TODAY\nRide-sharing vs. ride-hailing: Battle brews in Boston\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Trisha Thadani on Twitter: @TrishaThadani\n2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1RSe9c4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://middlesexda.com/news/press-release.php?reference=1315", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808585943810890-uber.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RSe9c4&text=Former%20Boston%20Uber%20driver%20sentenced%20to%2010%20years%20on%20rape%20conviction&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1RSe9c4", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RSe9c4&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc0937862a217af33f2702dadc63da97a8732b1a/c=67-0-468-401/local/-/media/2015/09/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635779962802806973-Uber-app.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad8856bdb038697f0c93298582a8db8f7afa7121/c=445-0-2216-1771/local/-/media/2015/07/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635725726630342479-AFP-542237623.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808585943810890-uber.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6593c38e3825aaa955c2abc76d2b0d3f05b791e5/c=0-0-533-400&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808585943810890-uber.jpg", "http://petition.uber.org/mass/", "http://www.twitter.com/trishathadani"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:06:11.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
