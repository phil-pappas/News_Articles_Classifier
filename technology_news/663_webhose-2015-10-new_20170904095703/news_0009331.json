When your legal pitch book is lined up next to those of competitors proposing similar solutions at similar prices, your content can really help you stand out. The aim of your legal pitch book is to bring across the message that your company is easy to work with and that your attorneys know their stuff – just like every other firm in the running. But it only takes simple things, like overly complex or technical language, to communicate the opposite message. A legal pitch book should be more original and less generic \nMost law firms take the generic route when it comes to their legal pitch book, and boast about the success of a few specific lawyers, as well as focus on references from previous or existing clients. But using an approach that’s so generic could set you up for failure. Presenting a generic legal pitch book to a potential client is nothing more than a summary of your firm. There’s no point in providing information that they could have easily researched themselves. \nThis generic approach will leave your client with more questions than answers – answers you need to be prepared for. Ensure that you keep the client front of mind and accordingly create your pitch book aligned with the prospect’s business goals. People want and respond better to relevant content. By doing adequate research about your client and the problem they are facing, your legal pitch book is made relevant to your potential client and the solution they need. A good way of ensuring this is to focus on a specific lawyer in your firm who has had success with similar cases. This will also help to build trust with your client and win their respect. Does your legal pitch book pack enough punch? \nAs the saying goes ‘first impressions last’ and your legal pitch book needs to impress from the get go. When creating your legal pitch book refrain from using clichéd phrases such as, ‘we look forward to working with you’. To the client this is far from enthusiastic, and quite frankly, just another generic term you use for all of your clients. \nYou need to at least put in the effort to come up with an original and client-specific phrase for your pitch book. Use a bit of emotion to indicate that your firm is genuinely enthused about working with the client. This should be conveyed on your first page and introduction to ensure that you attract and maintain the client’s attention to read through the rest of your pitch book. The bulkier your legal pitch book, the better, right? Wrong If you were given a 25-page pitch book or a 100-page pitch book, which of the two would you select to review first? The one that’s quicker to read, of course. Getting in there first with your pitch book being quick and easy to read will make a competitor’s weightier book seem like a drag in comparison. Also, when a compelling argument is kept brief, it will help to show that you’re confident and efficient. A legal pitch book written in lengthy, technical jargon won’t make you appear as more of an expert than your competitors. Writing in clear, simple sentences makes your legal pitch book an easier, and therefore more pleasant, read. A legal pitch book isn’t geared toward winning business only \nToo many law firms are focused on simply winning business through their pitch books. Not enough emphasis is being placed on the pitch book providing a holistic view of your firm. It pays to put aside time to make sure the firm’s personality is consistent throughout – especially if the content came from a dozen different contributors. If you don’t, your legal pitch book can sound disjointed, and by association, so will your firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:32:01.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
