Despite the limited market, there are still people opting to get themselves these devices. With the introduction of ZTE Grand Xmax Plus, affordable meets large screen. - Advertisement - \nBut does the Grand XMax Plus have what it takes to ensure smooth operation? Or will it get bogged down by its huge size? We shall soon find out in just a bit. \nSporting a 6-inch High Definition LCD screen that displays 720 x 1280 pixels or ~245 ppi pixel density, it seems like a fair trade between the huge screen size and the resolution. It probably has a lot to do with it being a budget device. Take nothing for granted though as the Grand Xmax Plus is equipped with Gorilla Glass 3 which ensures that you get the level of protection that you can be confident of that protects against scratches and bumps. \nWith a body measurement of 162.1 x 83.1 x 7.9 mm (6.38 x 3.27 x 0.31 in) and weighs 171.8 g (6.07 oz), it is indeed great to know that it has such a slim body and light as well. This makes sure that your hands won’t get too strained after prolonged operation with both your hands. \nUnder the hood of the Grand Xmax Plus is the Qualcomm MSM8926 Snapdragon 400 chipset, Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 processor, Adreno 305 graphics and 2GB RAM. The setup is just nice for a mid-range kind of performance that can easily run all your daily dose of activities and tasks that you ask of it. - Advertisement - \nOn the camera side of things, the Grand Xmax Plus is sporting a 13 Megapixel primary camera with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. Plus, there’s the 5 Megapixel secondary camera with a wide-angle lens that completes the package. You can expect pretty decent images being captured with this phablet. \nWith 16GB internal storage accompanying the device, you can be sure of ample space to install your favorite apps and games – and more of your photos, videos and other stuff. It can be further expended with a microSD card up to a maximum of 32GB. \nIt comes with Android Lollipop 5.1 and sorry to say but do not get your hopes up high in getting an update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0 OS. ZTE is not known to be able to provide the latest updates unless it is a flagship device. \nBattery-wise, the Grand Xmax Plus comes with a Li-Ion 3400 mAh battery. It provides a very awesome 6.5 hours talk time and up to 860 hours of standby time. It also features Quick Charge 1.0 that allows you to charge faster and keep playing, watching, sharing and talking longer. - Advertisement - \nThe ZTE Grand Xmax Plus allows budget users to get their hands on a large screen phablet without having to break the bank in this case. Huge screen is backed with a thin and light body, mid-range level of performance and camera; and a huge battery life. \nThe ZTE Xmax is available for approximately $169 USD or close to the equivalent in your market and is only available in black.
