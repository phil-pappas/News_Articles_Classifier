Elliott said it had conveyed the same proposals to Mitel.\nElliott, viewed as a specialist when it comes to activism in technology companies, has in the past rattled for changes at companies such as Hess Corp., EMC Corp., NetApp Inc. and Interpublic Group of Cos.\nPolycom in March agreed to pay the SEC $750,000 to settle civil charges that the tech company had inadequate internal controls and failed to report that a former chief executive used nearly $200,000 of corporate funds for personal perks.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n 08, 2015 09:55 ET (13:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:21:58.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
