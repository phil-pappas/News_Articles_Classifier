In the past winter it was 32,000MW, a reflection not only of demand management and energy efficiency but also lack of supply.\nMs Dlamini told the Association of Municipal Electricity Utilities (AMEU) conference in Sandton that municipalities could be more creative in diversifying their revenue, for example, by offering households hire purchase agreements for rooftop solar panels or energy efficiency solutions such as double glazing.\n\"It is time for a new operating model for municipalities,\" she said.\nOther speakers discussed the opportunities for municipalities to commission their own renewable power generation. They said there was a need for changes in legislation, including the Municipal Finance Management Act, to provide certainty to private sector power providers by enabling municipalities to sign long-term power purchase agreements.\nSilas Zimu, a special adviser to the president on energy, said the current act did not prevent municipalities from signing long-term agreements, as long as it was on the basis of a decision taken by a mayoral council.\nHe said metropolitan authorities did not need to rely on the Treasury to provide funding for renewable energy projects since development finance institutions were willing to do so.\nChris Yelland, the MD of EE Publishers, said the private sector had to be brought in to help with power projects. In the same period that private companies had added 1,600MW of renewable power to the grid, Eskom had added only 100MW.\nDave Long, an adviser to Business Unity SA, said the tariffs had to be acceptable. The National Energy Regulator of SA’s approved tariff was an average including old and new power generation assets, whereas developers needed a tariff that reflected the costs of new generation.\nPeggy Drodskie, the chief operating officer of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said this was a point made by chamber members, and it should be noted that private developers were taking risk and could not rely on bailouts.\nDennis Mokoala, an assistant manager of energy services at Polokwane municipality, called on the AMEU to approach the Department of Energy for funding to assist municipalities to deal with load shedding. He said municipalities incurred costs from load shedding, including loss of revenue, more overtime, crime and more frequent maintenance.\nIn Polokwane, overtime costs had increased by R120,000 a month because of load shedding while it had had to spend R750,000 on maintaining its switchgear annually rather than every three years.\nAnother R1.2m had to be spent on repairing cables between April and July as load shedding exposed weak points, Mr Mokoala said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:58:30.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
