My 12-year-old daughter watches YouTube videos of people who record themselves playing video games, devouring them one after another like a box of chocolates. So in August, when the opportunity arose, I did something that may earn me the title of Best Dad Ever or World’s Worst Parent, depending on whether you’ve reached puberty.\nI took my kids to video game little league.\nIf you haven’t noticed, video games are now sports (“e-sports” is the favored term). No, they’re not sports in the cardiovascular, tendon-tearing sense. Still, competitive game-playing requires dedication, cheetah-like reflexes, teamwork, tactical smarts and phenomenal concentration.\nElite e-sport stars make millions of dollars a year at tournaments and are watched by tens of thousands in the stands (and millions more online). In early August at KeyArena in Seattle, five young men who call themselves Evil Geniuses defeated a Chinese team on the multiplayer battle game Dota 2 and won $6.6 million.\nThere’s even the whiff of an old-fashioned sports scandal. One of the biggest e-sports leagues, ESL , began testing for performance-enhancing drugs after a professional Counter-Strike player said he and his teammates popped Adderall during a tournament.\nMany people wish e-sports would just go away, back to the scuzzy hotel ballrooms where video game tournaments were played for years. On the occasions when ESPN has broadcast e-sports, a flash flood of invective from traditional sports fans has filled Twitter.\nBut e-sports are clearly not a fad. I have heard smart people in the business predict that competitive gaming will make it into the Olympics in the next couple of decades.\nSo it’s only natural that organizers of competitive video gaming are coming after our children. “Why can’t gamers go to practice?” said Brett Morris, president of Super League Gaming , a new afterschool game league that started its first season this month.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story In August, the game league invited me to a preview. Since the league is aimed at players age 7 to 14, I thought it would be more informative if I brought along someone in the target demo, not to mention appear less creepy to other parents wondering about the middle-aged guy with the notepad.\n“Uh, yeah?” was how my daughter responded when I asked if she wanted to go, adding that little bit of inflection that let me know her answer should have been self-evident.\nTo anyone leaping to parental judgment, a defense: My kids are responsible, sensitive and empathetic when they’re not strafing enemies with imaginary gunfire or arrows. They read books, look people in the eyes when talking to them, hang out with friends, do well in school and run cross-country. They cry during the sad parts of movies.\nWe packed a laptop and headed to practice (my son, to his dismay, couldn’t attend because of another commitment).\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Here’s how the league works: For $80, your child gets admission to a weekly hour-and-a-half game practice that starts at 4:30 p.m. The practices take place in the auditoriums of local movie theaters around the country, including those owned by Regal Cinemas, AMC, Cinemark and iPic Theaters.\nKids get a team jersey and a lanyard with a laminated player pass bearing three league rules: no bullying, play nice, have fun.\nInstead of sitting in the bleachers at a ballfield, parents (who are admitted free) can grab a pack of Twizzlers and watch a god’s eye view of the game projected onto the silver screen.\nFor the first season, participants are playing Minecraft , the hugely popular and quasi-educational game that has been described as a digital version of Legos because players can build structures with blocky objects. (The league plans to add other games.)\nForming teams of four to seven, players will spend the first portion flexing their creativity (building a pirate ship, a spaceship and other objects). Then they tap into their competitive side in a “Hunger Games” type of survival battle, followed by a team challenge to collect energy orbs for a spaceship.\nA leaderboard shows individual and teams rankings, along with national league leaders. At the end of the six-week season, a $5,000 college scholarship will be awarded to the top player.\nOn a Saturday afternoon in late August, my daughter and I turned up at the Regal Meridian 16 Theater in downtown Seattle for practice. We were greeted in the lobby by Mr. Morris, a trim 45-year-old who wore jeans and a Super League Gaming T-shirt.\nThe league was founded in Los Angeles by John Miller and David Steigelfest, a couple of dads who love video games almost as much as their children do, and wanted their children to be able to experience the social benefits of playing in-person together.\n“We said to ourselves, ‘There’s nothing better than seeing your kid have fun,’ ” said Mr. Morris, who has two daughters, 9 and 13. “That’s why your kid plays Little League.”\nTo get youngsters to show up at the preview, one of 28 staged around the country, Super League Gaming hired YouTube celebrities to attend. This tactic proved only slightly less effective than handing out free Xboxes.\nMore than 100 waited to take selfies with Jordan Maron, better known by his nom de YouTube, CaptainSparklez , and Parker Coppins, who goes by ParkerGames . A few dozen continued to the auditorium to begin playing Minecraft.\nMy daughter flipped open her laptop, connected to the Wi-Fi and began hacking away at other Minecraft avatars with a pixelated sword (the game’s crude graphics result in entirely bloodless deaths). A low rumble of giggles and cheering emanated from players, their faces glowing from laptop screens in the darkened auditorium.\n“It’s everything I wanted as a kid,” Mr. Coppins said, after taking a seat between my daughter and me. “Seeing kids come into these events, I think this is one of those things where you think, ‘You’re not alone anymore.’ ”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story One of them was Cameron Delfin, 14, who beamed with pride at being one of the last players standing. “I made it to the death match!” he said.\nHis father, Robert Delfin, said he had no qualms about bringing his son to video game little league. “I hear parents say, ‘I can’t believe you let him do what he’s doing,’ ” said Mr. Delfin, a freelance photographer. “I say, ‘My kid’s an A-plus student.’ ”\nFor Mr. Delfin, having his son go to a physical location to play Minecraft with others was a welcome alternative to the anonymity of online play. “Here’s the beauty of this thing: You know who you’re playing against,” he said.\nBryan Giese brought his son, Declan, 13, to Minecraft practice to instill a sense of sportsmanship that he said was missing when players are not in the same room. He was also impressed to see that most of the players were girls, at least at the session he attended in Denver this summer.\n“There wasn’t as much gloating as I’ve seen before,” said Mr. Giese, a marketing director at a technology consulting firm. “When you’re in your house, with no one watching what you’re doing, you can get away with a lot more.”\nE-sports little league doesn’t end at middle school. When players advance into their teens, they can enroll in the High School StarLeague , which organizes matches among students from nearly 2,000 schools nationwide. More than 350 matches are held each weekend for one game, League of Legends .\nSome parents may wonder how video game little league is going to help with all the homework, SAT preparation and the household chores.\nTo counter the notion that video games get in the way of academics, the league plans to award $35,000 in college scholarships to winning teams in this year’s finals.\nTomber Su, the chief executive of the high school league, added that one of its online surveys found that many of its players had a grade-point average from 3.2 to 3.4.\n“I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a school system whose sports matched that,” said Mr. Su, who thought for a moment before adding, “Maybe chess club.”\nFollow our fashion and lifestyle coverage on any of these accounts: Styles on Facebook , Modern Love on Facebook , Styles , Fashion and Vows on Twitter and Fashion on Instagram .
