Rumala , Ph.D. in Health Sciences Program Director, attended the Priceless Luncheon to End Human Trafficking at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach, CA. Presented by the Global Center for Women and Justice (GCWJ) at Vanguard University, this luncheon raised money to fund anti-human trafficking initiatives in Orange County, CA and beyond. Dr. Orozco, Dr. Rumala, and Ms. Peck all expressed their desire to combat this societal ill through education and advocacy. In particular, this issue hits close to home for Dr. Rumala.\n“Ending human trafficking is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. As a product of both the United States and northern Nigeria, it was particularly chilling to see terrorist group Boko Haram abduct hundreds of teenage girls from my home region. My fellow sisters who struggle to get an education face injustices of human trafficking simply because they seek knowledge and a better life,” stated Dr. Rumala.\nThe annual luncheon, featuring keynote speaker Dr. Sandra Morgan, brings research, education and advocacy to the issues of human trafficking. Dr. Morgan is the director of the GCWJ and a former administrator for the Orange County Human Trafficking Task Force, illustrated how vital education is in preventing these heinous crimes.\n“Trident’s faculty strive to prepare students on current and relevant public health issues and human trafficking is especially important as it impacts global communities and engages healthcare providers, juvenile justice practitioners, K-12 educators, the business community and leaders, university leaders, law enforcement personnel, and community members at large,” said Dr. Orozco.\n“Dr. Morgan stressed the importance of education, as well as knowledge, dignity, and advocacy,” added Ms. Peck. “These are the essentials needed to bring about the end of human trafficking.”\nTrident University, a leading 100% online post-secondary institution that offers degrees at the bachelor’s, master’s, and doctorate levels, is committed to its community of adult learners and over 28,000 alumni.
