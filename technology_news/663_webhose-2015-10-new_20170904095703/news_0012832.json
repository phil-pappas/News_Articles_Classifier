Shire's shares are worth around 23% less than they were when it made the offer.\nMr. Ornskov said the recent selloff had complicated the situation. \"That's going to impact value expectations on our shareholder side and theirs, and that takes time,\" he said. Shire has maintained that any deal must use stock only to preserve the tax-free status of Baxalta's spin from its parent Baxter International Inc. in July.\nThe Shire boss has spent the weeks since taking his offer public trying to convince Baxalta's shareholders of the value of a tie-up, in the hope they will press management to agree a friendly deal. A hostile deal is virtually impossible as Baxalta is protected by a series of takeover defenses.\nMr. Ornskov emphasized that while he continued to consider smaller deals that he wasn't looking elsewhere for acquisitions in the same league as Baxalta. \"It wouldn't be feasible for a company to look at multiple deals of that size,\" he said.\nHis comments came as Shire reported a 4% increase in revenue in the three months to September 30 to $1.66 billion, thanks to strong sales of its best-selling drug Vyvanse.\nRevenue from Vyvanse increased 20% to $427 million in the third quarter. The drug was primarily approved for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder but earlier this year was authorized for use in binge-eating disorder, a newly recognized psychiatric condition. Mr. Ornskov said a significant part of its growth was likely due to this new use for the drug.\nShire also highlighted strong sales of Cinryze and Firazyr, both used to treat hereditary angioedema, a rare and potentially life-threatening disease that causes sudden swelling. Revenue from these drugs increased 29% and 25% to $188 million and $123 million respectively.\nThe company's rare disease drugs are among the most expensive on the market, but Mr. Ornskov said their high prices were justified since they had a \"significant impact on quality and length of life of these patients.\" He added that Shire had not experienced pricing pressure in part because although expensive, these drugs are used in only a small number of patients.\nThe Dublin-based company said net income in the three months to September 30 dipped 6% to $453 million, down from $480 million a year earlier, due to higher research-and-development spending, as well as a ramp-up in costs related to a several anticipated drug launches in the coming year.\nOperating income, which strips out certain one-off charges, increased 1% to $725 million. Shire confirmed that full-year earnings per share growth, excluding certain items that Shire considers \"noncore,\" would be in the mid-to-high single digits.\nShares in Shire were up 3.64% at Â£ 46.11 at 14:40.\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com\n 23, 2015 11:05 ET (15:05 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:48:28.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
