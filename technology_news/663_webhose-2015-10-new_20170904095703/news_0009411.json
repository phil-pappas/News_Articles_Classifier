Key Findings The report has the following key findings: - Despite challenges relating to implementation complexities and multi-vendor interoperability, SON revenue is expected to grow to more than $4 Billion by the end of 2017, exceeding conventional mobile network optimization revenue by nearly 60%- SNS Research estimates that SON can enable mobile operators to save nearly 40% of their electrical power consumption by dynamically activating and deactivating RAN nodes in line with the changing traffic and user distribution profile- SNS Research estimates that a Tier 1 mobile operator can save more than 30% of its overall OpEx by employing SON across the RAN, mobile core and transport segments of the network- Mobile operators have reported up to a 50% reduction in dropped calls and over 20% higher data rates with SON implementation- SON platforms are moving from reactive systems to more advanced implementations that incorporate predictive analytics technology to make necessary changes to a network before any degradation occurs- Infrastructure and software incumbents are aggressively eyeing acquisitions of smaller established C-SON players to accelerate their entry path into the C-SON market Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03180682-summary/view-report.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
