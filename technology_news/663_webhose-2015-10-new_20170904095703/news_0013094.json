Collaborating with Annapurna Labs, an Amazon company, NEXCOM has built the DNA 1720 with the Alpine AL314 processor. Today’s security devices for the SMB market struggle with bandwidth and compute bottlenecks either using old generation processors or not having enough network bandwidth. The DNA 1720 relieves networking bottlenecks and strengthens security control measures with high computing performance, high port density and support for DMZ network segmentation. Built with the Annapurna Labs’ Alpine AL314 processor, the DNA 1720 features high performance per watt, two 2.5G high-throughput SGMII interfaces, and hardware-accelerated packet processing performance. The DNA 1720 integrates optional VDSL (Very High Speed DSL), Wi-Fi, and PoE (Power over Ethernet) modules to flexibly aggregate and carry wireless broadband traffic and adapt to installation constraints for use in different office settings.\n“Intended for SMB environments, the network security appliance DNA 1720 is boosted by Annapurna Labs’ Alpine AL314 processor with four ARM® Cortex®-A15 cores and has a total of sixteen GbE LAN ports. The DNA 1720 delivers ample computing performance to provide firewall, UTM (Unified Threat Management), and VPN (Virtual Private Network) protections against unauthorized access attempts; while the DNA 1720’s high port density allows it to manage inbound and outbound traffic passing through a SMB network. Moreover, the DNA 1720 supports the design of the perimeter network with DMZ implementation to keep external-facing servers and services, such as FTP requests, from secure subnets,” said Hadwin Liu, Chief Architect of NEXCOM Network and Communication Solutions Business Group.\nFor different installation environments, the DNA 1720 allows various WAN connections to connect to outbound networks. Besides one WAN port, the DNA 1720 can be configured with VDSL, Wi-Fi and 3G/4G connectivity to provide alternatives to and/or backups for a wired network. For instance, NEXCOM has developed dual-band dual-concurrent 3x3 802.11n and 802.11ac modules for accessing high speed wireless broadband networks. PoE connection is another feature that comes in handy for offices in remote locations where power supply is an issue and for simplified cabling of Wi-Fi APs, IP cameras, VoIP phones, and office appliances.\nAlso, a RJ45 and a mini-USB console ports are provided to help IT administrators access the command line interface (CLI) for management purposes.\nAbout NEXCOM : Founded in 1992, NEXCOM integrates its capabilities and operates six global businesses, which are Multi-Media Solutions, Mobile Computing Solutions, IoT Automation Solutions, Network and Communication Solutions, Intelligent Digital Security, and Medical and Healthcare Informatics. NEXCOM serves its customers worldwide through its subsidiaries in five major industrial countries. Under the IoT megatrend, NEXCOM expands its offerings with solutions in emerging applications including IoT, robotics, connected cars, Industry 4.0, and industrial security.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXhjb20uY29tL1Byb2R1Y3RzL25ldHdvcmstYW5kLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb24tc29sdXRpb25zL2Rlc2t0b3AtYXBwbGlhbmNlL2Rlc2t0b3AtYXBwbGlhbmNlL25ldHdvcmstc2VjdXJpdHktYXBwbGlhbmNlLWRuYS0xNzIw", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uZXhjb20uY29t"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:49:49.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
