Friday marked a record 383rd day living in space for the NASA astronaut and commander of the current Expedition 45 space station crew. The previous record was 382 cumulative days held by American astronaut Mike Fincke.\nKelly, 51, who is well past the midway point of a yearlong mission in space , isn't done breaking spaceflight records.
