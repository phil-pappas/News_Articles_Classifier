It is a Platinum Power Seller on EBay and an Amazon Professional Seller with a physical location as well. The company has sold over 65,000 items for its customers, which include individuals, small businesses and non-profits and other fundraising organizations. Showing Comments Highly Confidential Business History 10 years with a single location; Owner has rights to open two additional locations in Montgomery County. Competitive Overview There is very limited DIRECT competition; no franchises and only a few independents. Potential Growth Opportunities for growth are huge. The seller estimates that less than 0.4% of the homes in the local market have registered as sellers with this business. Market penetration in the home zip code is about 5%, and less than 1% in surrounding zip codes. These numbers only include residences. The potential to reach businesses looking to sell excess inventory and non-profits looking for innovative fund raising options is phenomenal. In addition, the seller holds franchise development rights to open 2 more locations in the territory. These locations could potentially yield owner benefits similar to this location (around $115,000 annually each).
