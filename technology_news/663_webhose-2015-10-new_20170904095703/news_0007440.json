The 100-Day Challenge is just one such example, empowering members to follow through with their business goal implementation.\" \nWithin each participating member's local market, the public will be invited to take a tour of their location and meet their team. Many members are moving, remodeling and making over their stores in preparation. Activities offered will highlight neighborhood images, people and businesses. Events may also feature live entertainment, food and beverages. \nGuests of Global Open House events will catch sneak peeks at exclusive products and services, launched just in time for the holidays. These may include photo greeting cards in the latest styles, personalized notepads, stunning acrylic wall art, popular clipboard calendars and exclusive magnetic canvas designs. \nAttendees might also participate in free classes and demonstrations, as well as have the opportunity to create some of these custom products for themselves. Many may also receive unique free gifts and generous discounts from the participating members. \nNot only is the Global Open House an opportunity for members to connect with their community, it represents the camaraderie and entrepreneurial spirit that are alive and well within small business communities around the world. \nIn that spirit, for the first time, IPI - Member Network is opening up its 100-Day Challenge online global celebration to the public.
