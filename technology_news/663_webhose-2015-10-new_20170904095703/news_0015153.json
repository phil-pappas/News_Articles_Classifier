Fewer new patients are being prescribed the drug, Biogen has said, in part because of doctors' concerns about a rare side effect that was linked to a patient death last year.\nOther factors behind the slowdown include a lower reimbursement price in Germany and an increased number of patients discontinuing treatment with Tecfidera, in some cases because the pill stopped working for them, the company has said. Earlier this month, Biogen's sales chief left the company.\nIn the third quarter, Tecfidera revenue rose 19% to $937 million. But the growth rate slowed from the 26% year-over-year growth in the second quarter and the 63% growth in the first quarter.\nBiogen said Wednesday that it remains committed to Tecfidera and plans to increase its marketing activities behind the drug as part of the restructuring.\nThe company aims to complete the majority of the workforce reduction by the end of 2015. The company sees the changes cutting its annual run rate of costs by about $250 million.\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, Biogen reported a profit of $965.6 million, or $4.15 a share, up from $856.9 million, or $3.62 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the company's per-share earnings rose 18% to $4.48.\nRevenue grew to $2.78 billion from $2.51 billion.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast $3.80 a share in earnings on $2.65 billion in revenue.\nFor 2015, Biogen said it now expects revenue to grow between 8% and 9% from a year ago, up from its predicted growth of 6% to 8% in July. The company also raised its outlook on per-share earnings excluding certain items, to a range of $16.20 and $16.50 from the July estimate of $15.50 and $15.95.\nAnalysts, on average, were expected per-share earnings of $15.84 on revenue growth of 8%.\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com\n 21, 2015 08:30 ET (12:30 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:05:10.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
