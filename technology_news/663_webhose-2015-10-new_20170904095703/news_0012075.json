(NASDAQ: BLFS), the leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of proprietary clinical grade cell and tissue hypothermic storage and cryopreservation freeze media and a related cloud hosted biologistics cold chain management app for smart shippers (\"BioLife\" or the \"Company\"), today announced Van Nuys, CA -based HemaCare Corporation (OTCPK:HEMA) will validate BioLife's evo Smart Shipper and biologistex cold chain SaaS. An initial deployment of evo Smart Shippers will be used in transporting Leukopak starting material for CAR-T cellular immunotherapies currently in 3 rd party clinical trials in blood cancers and solid tumors.\nBioLife and HemaCare previously announced a supplier relationship wherein BioLife's CryoStor and HypoThermosol clinical grade freeze media and hypothermic storage and shipping media are used by HemaCare to extend stability and improve post preservation yield of blood derived T cells and other cell types used in pre-clinical research and clinical regenerative medicine applications. BioLife's biologistex cloud based cold chain management service is a new integrated logistics and track and trace web app used by shippers of time and temperature sensitive biologic materials. The evo Smart Shipper is a state of the art precision thermal shipping container with embedded payload monitoring, GPS location tracking, and cellular communication electronics that transmit critical shipment information to the cloud. This SaaS app enables users to monitor high value shipments during transit and configure actionable alerts for downstream recipients for location, approaching destination, delivery, package open, and remaining shelf life or stability via the patent pending StableAlert™ countdown timer.\nPete van der Wal , President & CEO of HemaCare, remarked on the decision to validate the evo Smart Shipper and biologistex app for clinical materials management by stating, \"We are very pleased to be an early adopter of BioLife's leading edge cold chain management solution. Our customers count on us to procure and deliver very high quality blood derived and other cell types. With their clinical grade biopreservation media, and now biologistex cold chain service, BioLife is providing the tools we need to support our clinical customers and their lifesaving cellular immunotherapies. We're confident our validation process will be successful and look forward to deploying these initial evo smart shippers with our customers.\"\nMike Rice , BioLife's President & CEO, said, \"We are thrilled to expand our partnership with HemaCare. They have become a critical supplier of blood derived and other cell types to the high growth regenerative medicine industry and their focus on supplying T cells for use in cellular immunotherapy clinical trials perfectly complements our presence in this important segment of the market. We have many mutual customers and it's very satisfying to see the cumulative impact of both companies' products, services, and commitment to quality be recognized by the leading clinical centers and commercial companies in the space.\"\nIn July 2015 , Frost & Sullivan forecasted that the stem cell therapy market is expected to be worth $40 billion by 2020 and $180 billion by 2030.
