(Lenovo) Tracey Lien Contact Reporter \nLaptop-tablet hybrids never quite took off, with consumers eschewing the all-in-one devices because they neither wanted an over-powered tablet or an underpowered work station. But the tide may be turning. \nLenovo launched two new devices Monday -- the Yoga 900 convertible laptop and the Yoga 900 Home portable all-in-one desktop -- muscling in on the territory of the likes of Microsoft with its Surface Pro tablet computers, Toshiba with its Radius 2-in-1s and, soon, Apple with its iPad Pro. \nRunning Windows 10 and powered by Intelâ€™s 6th and 5th gen i7 processors, respectively, the Yoga laptop and desktop are positioned as both powerful and portable devices; powerful enough to replace workstations, portable enough to double as a tablet. \nLike the Surface Pro, the Lenovo convertible laptop has a watchband hinge that allows the screen to rotate backward into tablet mode. The convertible laptop has a 13.3-inch screen, stereo speakers and a Solid State Drive offering up to 16GB of memory capacity. The portable desktop has a 27-inch screen and is cordless. \nThe Lenovo Yoga 900 will start at $1,199.99 and is available now. The Lenovo Yoga Home 900 will start at $1,549 and will be available in late October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:24:10.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
