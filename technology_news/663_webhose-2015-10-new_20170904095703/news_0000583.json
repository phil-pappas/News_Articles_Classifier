Each DOI is associated with a set metadata and a URL pointer to the full text, so that it uniquely identifies the content item and provides a persistent link to its location on the internet. Between them, Crossref and DataCite have already received almost a half a million works from publishers and data centers that include an ORCID iD validated by the author/contributor. With Auto-Update functionality in place, provided the researcher includes her/his ORCID iD at submission, information about these works can transit (with the researcher's permission) to her/his ORCID record. \nORCID Executive Director, Laure Haak, warmly welcomed this new development: \"Auto-update's benefit to scholarly communications is something that publishers, librarians, funders, and researchers can all agree on: it is a game changer.\" \nEd Pentz, Executive Director of Crossref, agrees: \"This integration with ORCID and our ongoing collaboration with DataCite aims to build on existing infrastructure, tying systems together to save time for researchers. We have a drive to encourage even more publishers to deposit ORCID iDs with us and would like to invite people to a webinar to learn more\". \nAnd Patricia Cruse, Executive Director of DataCite adds: \"We all share the goal of \"good science\" and making it easier for researchers to share their work is a big part of that goal. By ORCID, CrossRef and DataCite working together on Auto-update we are able to provide an easy way for researchers to further expose their work.\" ### \nMore information is available on the ORCID blog: https://", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:19:56.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
