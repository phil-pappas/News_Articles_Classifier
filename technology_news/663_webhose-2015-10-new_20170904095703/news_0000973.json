Bitcoin is widely seen as a form of money today, but over time bitcoin will come to be seen as \"a protocol,\" Mr. Srinivasan said.\nFor example, blockchain technology—which allows the bitcoin network to track the currency's movement from one online wallet to another—can be used to improve transparency and accountability in financial transactions, allowing a deeper level of financial auditing, Mr. Srinivasan said. \"You can track every cent.\"\nBlockchain technology could provide a new way to pay for content that is currently supported by advertising, he added.\nBut the technology's rise hinges on when it is incorporated into devices, just as the growth of the Internet was spurred in part by Microsoft Corp.'s decision to build Internet protocols into Windows, he said.\n\"We think something similar is going to happen with bitcoin where once bitcoin is built into devices, and devices natively have the capacity to turn power into digital currency, then a whole new class of applications will be built on the Internet,\" Mr. Srinivasan said.\nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com\n 17:15 ET (21:15 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:12:40.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
