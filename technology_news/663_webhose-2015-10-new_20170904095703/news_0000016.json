AEON ENERGY SOLUTIONS SHAPING THE FUTURE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY We deliver clean energy solutions and safeguard the environment for future generations — Joseph Majka ,CEO HUNTSVILLE , ALABAMA, USA, October 12,   Aeon Energy Solutions, Inc., Alabama, USA announces today the addition of the Apollo Group, Coevorden, The Netherlands to their line up of technology providers focused on the processing and delivery of biomass fibre and green renewable fuels to a global marketplace. The Apollo Group is a 168 year old company whose core business is the design, manufacturing, sales and installation of components and complete solutions for the mechanical handling and transport installations for the bulk and the packed goods industry. Internationally revered for best quality of products & services. The Apollo Group offers a broad range of products and is divided into four different companies separated along product lines; Vertical Conveying, Baling & Debaling and Logistic Systems. These three companies provide their own engineering and production capabilities. Additionally Apollo’s Service division is responsible for service and installation of all products made by the Apollo Group. The recognized leader in the Baling & Debaling industry, Apollo is the manufacturer of the Big Bale Press BBP65 as well as the Debaler DB230. Both machines are part of the “Big Bale Packaging Concept”. This unique combination makes the Big Bale Packaging Concept the most efficient and flexible packaging system available on the market today. The ISC Big Bale Press (BBP65) is a compact and fully automatic installation for compressing, packing and palletizing bulk products. “Aeon Energy Solutions is very excited to add Apollo Baling products to our lineup of solid technologies offered in the processing and packaging of green renewable fuels. A stellar 168 year history speaks volumes regarding the durability, experience, quality and service of Apollo products.” comments Joseph W. Majka, President /CEO of Aeon Energy Solutions. “Aeon is now providing an affordable solution to the age old issue of how to most economically ship wood chips. We can now offer a full solution consisting of the equipment or the finished wood chip products: green, dried, or heat treated and sanitized (Current EU Standards) with the addition of Apollo products”; further commented Mr. Majka. Apollo’s Big Bale Press 65 keeps foil consumption to a minimum by stretching the wrapping foil. As a result, there is a saving in packing materials up to 60% in comparison with traditional packaging methods. Apart from a variable big bale volume of 2m³ up to 7m³ and a big bale height of 1 meter up to 2.5 meters, the maximum production capacity of the Big Bale Press 65 is up to 28 Big-bales per hour in one compression cycle (depending on infeed capacity and material specs). Thanks to the compact and flexible size of the big bale, your product can be transported, delivered and stored in the most efficient way. Demonstrated below, a partial listing of the features and benefits of Baling wood fuel chips and other approved commodities. No fugitive Dust issues during transportation or storage Zero shrinkage/product loss during transportation or storage No special explosion barriers or protection typically required during shipment like bulk pellets No potential re-infestation after the sanitation process Full Outdoor storage capability .
