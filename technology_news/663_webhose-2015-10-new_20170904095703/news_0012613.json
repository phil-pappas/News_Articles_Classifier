Founded in 2014 by financial industry veterans Dr. Patrick Beaudan and Mari Kawawa, Emotomy was built to augment the high-touch activities of financial advisors. The platform is already providing customized portfolio management for more than 4,000 client accounts in the U.S. and Europe and has experienced 300% growth in the last 12 months. \nEmotomy provides easy client onboarding, customized investment approaches, instant personalized client marketing materials, and robust performance tracking and reporting.
