The result is Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X which we will be taking a closer look today – and whether the $100 price difference is justified to make you want to get the higher-spec model. - Advertisement - \nNexus 6P is considered to be the bigger brother of the two and also costs $100 more. Larger screen, better hardware, slightly better camera and bigger battery are just some of the areas that make it better than the Nexus 5X. But is the gap that huge? Let’s find out in further detail now. \nThe fact that the two devices come with the latest Android Marshmallow 6.0 makes for an unbeatable proposition. It would take many more months before any other flagship from other manufacturers will be able to have their version –that's if it can be updated at all. That alone have the X factor for these two new Nexus devices from Google. \nWith regards to the Nexus 6P, it comes in with a measurement of 159.3 x 77.8 x 7.3 mm (6.27 x 3.06 x 0.29 in) and weighs 178 g (6.28 oz). Equipped with a 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 1440 x 2560 pixels or ~515 ppi pixel density, it surely is the best out there. Feast your eyes on the amazing quality of the images on-screen. There will also be a fingerprint scanner at the rear that gives it a nice touch. In terms of protection, you can depend on its Gorilla Glass 4 to give you a piece of mind. \nMeanwhile for the Nexus 5X, it has been almost two years since the original Nexus 5 made its way to the scene. The device will have a body measurement of 147 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 in) and weighs just 136 g (4.80 oz). Sporting a 5.2-inch Full HD screen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~424 ppi pixel density, it will certainly make viewing a pleasure. This means that it is indeed slim and light indeed. In terms protection, there is Gorilla Glass 3 and oleophobic coating to protect it from harm. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the back of your device to complement the way you naturally hold it. \nThe Nexus 5X surely pales in comparison against the Nexus 6P which has a larger and much higher resolution screen. What is good, though, is that both fingerprint scanner will feature Nexus Imprint that can turn on your screen with one touch, unlock your apps quickly and easily, and let you breeze through checkout lines. And, by incorporating measurements each time you use it, Nexus Imprint gets smarter with every touch. \nIn terms of performance, you can expect a solid show from the Nexus 6P. It comes with the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.56 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics, and 3GB RAM. This will put it right up there with other flagships, and you only wish that it had an additional 1GB RAM. There won’t be any issue for this device to eat up everything that you can throw at it. \nWhereas for the Nexus 5X, will have the Qualcomm MSM8992 Snapdragon 808 chipset, a Hexa-core processor Quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 & Dual-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 418 graphics, and 2GB RAM. Somehow there’s a feeling that it could have been better with 3GB memory, but there must be a reason they opted for 2GB instead. It has a lot to do with the optimized software that the latest update brings to the table. \nPerformance-wise, we can conclude that the Nexus wins by a significant margin. Better chipset, additional two processors, faster processor speed, better graphics and a 1GB RAM advantage makes it great value not to be missed out. - Advertisement - \nThe camera has never been a great strength point for most Google devices, and both devices are no different. Still, the Nexus 6P has a pretty decent 13 Megapixel primary camera with 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, optical image stabilization, dual-LED (ring) flash, dual recording, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, photo sphere, panorama and HDR. As for the secondary camera, it has a 5 Megapixel camera for your selfie shots. \nOn the Nexus 5X, it comes equipped with a 12.3 Megapixel primary camera and a 5 Megapixel secondary camera. \nAs you can see, both offers what you would expect from most flagship devices. You can hardly find the difference between the two, though. But with a faster Google Camera app, you will never miss a moment. It also comes with an app called Google Photos, which is a new way to store, search, and share all of your photos and videos. Store an unlimited amount of photos and videos at high quality for free, and access them anywhere. Automatically organized and searchable by the people, places, and things in them, your memories are always easy to find and share. \nStorage-wise, there will be 3 options available on the Nexus 6P – you can choose 32GB, 64GB or 128GB. Just remember to choose wisely (or the maximum that your budget allows you), as it does not have an expansion slot. \nMeanwhile on the Nexus 5X, you get to choose to go with either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage only. It also does not come with an expansion slot. \nIt has always been this way anyway, so you better learn to adapt to it. What’s the point of having Google Drive or other cloud storage right? \nAs for the battery, you can expect great life on the Nexus 6P with its 3450mAh battery. It should be more than enough to power up the device for a day or two in between charging. You can also capitalize on wireless charging as a means of keeping it up and running. \nWhereas on the Nexus 5X, there’s a non-removable Li-Po 2700 mAh battery that should help in powering up the device for at least a day in between charging. \nBut the best part for both devices have to be the latest OS from Android called Marshmallow. This plain vanilla Android OS includes better power efficiency and better security and much-improved app permissions. You're always among the first to receive software and security updates. And you'll have the freshest, fastest version working for you right out of the box. In plain simple terms, it will be much faster and even more optimized than all other devices. \nLet’s see how the latest OS can help to prolong a device’s life by upgrading to Marshmallow. Built to get the best out of the world's most popular OS, Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X will give you the ultimate Android experience. - Advertisement - \nThe Huawei Nexus 6P is nothing short of brilliant. If you want the bragging rights for the next few months, then this device will give you that. Plus, it has a great screen, great hardware, and great battery as well. The only downside could be its rather average camera and the unavailability of an expansion slot (if you call that a weakness). \nThe LG Nexus 5X seems to be the weaker sibling and is there for everyone to see. You can say that the difference is a bit too glaring between the two. But if you still prefer a smaller screen and save that $100 USD, then it makes for a great pure vanilla experience; exactly how Google wants it to be. No bloatware and no unnecessary apps installed. \nThe Huawei Nexus 6P is available for $499 USD and is available in Silver, Black, White, and Gold. \nThe LG Nexus 5X is expected to be on sale in the middle of this month, and the 16GB version is expected to be available for $399 USD. It will be available in Carbon, Quartz and Ice colors. News From", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:50:25.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
