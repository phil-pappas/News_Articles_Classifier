It never went before the Chicago City Council, which makes the so-called 'Netflix tax' an illegal tax,\" Jeffrey Schwab, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center, said in a news release Thursday. \"If the city wants to tax Internet-based streaming media services, then it should put the measure through the political process, and let Chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process.\"\nChicago extends taxing power to online movies, music, more John Byrne and Amina Elahi Chicagoans who pay to stream movies and music from services like Netflix and Spotify will now need to fork over an additional 9 percent for the privilege, as will Chicago businesses that pay to use everything from real estate to court databases online, under a decision the city quietly made recently...\nChicagoans who pay to stream movies and music from services like Netflix and Spotify will now need to fork over an additional 9 percent for the privilege, as will Chicago businesses that pay to use everything from real estate to court databases online, under a decision the city quietly made recently...\n(John Byrne and Amina Elahi) The suit also argues that the levies violate the federal Internet Freedom Tax Act because they tax some Internet-based streaming media at a higher rate than similar services not delivered via the Internet.\nThe city's Law Department released a statement saying it intends to vigorously fight the lawsuit.\n\"The City has not yet seen the complaint, but we are confident that the ruling is a valid application of the existing Amusement Tax,\" department spokesman John Holden said in an emailed statement.\nEmanuel has turned repeatedly to increasing smaller taxes and fees to help fill the city's coffers.\nIn May he introduced a plan to require off-site parking companies at Chicago's airports to share their revenue with the city in exchange for pickup privileges at O'Hare and Midway airports.\nThe mayor also has raised fees for parking at downtown garages and cable TV and telephone line 911 service taxes, among others.\njebyrne@tribpub.com\nCity delays business side of controversial cloud tax until Jan. 1 Amina Elahi The start date for the business end of the so-called ‘cloud tax’ that drew ire from Chicagoans and tech companies last month is being pushed back to Jan. 1, the city said Friday.\nBusinesses were to be on the hook for collecting 9 percent taxes on streaming and cloud-based services starting Sept....\nThe start date for the business end of the so-called ‘cloud tax’ that drew ire from Chicagoans and tech companies last month is being pushed back to Jan. 1, the city said Friday.\nBusinesses were to be on the hook for collecting 9 percent taxes on streaming and cloud-based services starting Sept....\n(Amina Elahi) Twitter @_johnbyrne\n Spotify Politics and Government", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f191f1/turbine/ct-chicago-internet-streaming-tax-lawsuit-met-20150910", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55948a1b/turbine/ct-chicago-cloud-tax-met-0702-20150701", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55c520b1/turbine/ct-cloud-tax-delayed-0807-bsi"], "published": "2015-09-10T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:15:36.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
