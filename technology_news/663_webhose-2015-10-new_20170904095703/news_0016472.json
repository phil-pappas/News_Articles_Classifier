Brendan Esposito Share on twitter by David Ramli Australians could enjoy much cheaper calls when travelling overseas thanks to global roaming provisions in the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement.\nTrade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim nations sealed a major regional trade and investment accord on Monday night spanning 40 per cent of the global economy, prising open new markets for Australian services providers, manufacturers and farmers.\nBut one of the provisions could also slash the often exorbitant fees that mobile providers charge for Australians using their phones abroad.\nWhile telcos like Telstra often cop the blame when bill shock hits after a trip overseas, they are often merely passing on the costs imposed on them by foreign mobile providers.\nThe new provisions could governments strike deals to better regulate and reduce those fees.\n\"[TPP parties] agree that they may take steps to promote competition in international mobile roaming services and facilitate the use of alternatives to roaming,\" the TPP summary statement said.\n\"If a Party chooses to regulate rates for wholesale international mobile roaming services, that Party shall permit operators from the TPP countries that do not regulate such rates the opportunity to also benefit from the lower rates.\"\nThis means that if, for example, the mobile regulators for Singapore and Japan signed a deal to slash the roaming fees for their citizens then Australians would also get to access services at the same low prices.\n It's an important point because the 12 signatories to the TPP include some of the most travelled-to destinations for all Australians such as the US, Japan, Singapore and Canada.\nThe Communications Alliance represents Australia's biggest phone and internet providers including Telstra, Singtel-Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia.\n\"The TPP commitments around potential regulation of wholesale international roaming rates might eventually benefit Australian consumers if bilateral deals are done by foreign Governments to reduce roaming prices,\" he said.\n\"It remains to be seen whether regulation of international roaming rates will become fashionable among TPP countries – it has happened within the EU but that is a very different political landscape.\"\nAn Optus spokeswoman also said the company \"welcomes anything that helps us negotiate better roaming rates for our customers.\"\nBut mobile customers may have to wait some time for these provisions to kick in – a mobile roaming agreement between Australian and New Zealand regulators has been under negotiations for several years .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/tpp-deal-pacific-countries-agree-to-historic-trade-pact-20151005-gk1vq2.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "https://www.communications.gov.au/documents/explanatory-material-imr-bill"], "published": "2015-10-06T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:26:02.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
