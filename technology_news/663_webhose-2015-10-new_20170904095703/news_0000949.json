As part of this arrangement, and likely with others, Wuaki.tv will provide the latest technology on streaming apps plus the distribution to leading smart TVs currently in the European market. Gulli will also offer a brand and content portfolio including titles such as Pok√©mon, Power Rangers, Naruto or Littlest Petshop. \nUntil now the Barcelona-based streaming service offered titles on both a subscription and transactional basis in Spain while content was available only through the latter format in other countries. Wuaki.tv, expects to roll out its hybrid model in all the countries where it operates. \n\"We are pretty confident that this type of partnerships are a successful model that can easily be replicated across other European countries,\" commented Wuaki.tv CEO and founder Jacinto Roca.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:54:37.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
