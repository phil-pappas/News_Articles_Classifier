Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\nJohnson's letter to Victor Nappe, CEO of SECNAP, the company that provided the threat monitoring product, seeks a host of documents relating to the company's work on Clinton's server and the nature of the cyber intrusions detected.\nClinton has not said what, if any, firewall or threat protection was used on her e-mail server before June 2013, while the server was kept in her home in the New York City suburbs.\nA February 2014 e-mail from SECNAP reported that malicious software based in China \"was found running an attack against\" Clinton's server. In total, Senate investigators have found records describing three attempts linked to China, one based in Germany and one from South Korea. The attacks occurred in 2013 and 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:26:27.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
