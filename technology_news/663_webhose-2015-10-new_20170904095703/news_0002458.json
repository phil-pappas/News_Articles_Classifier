Picture: Itumeleng English \n\nWHEN the country’s biggest YouTube stars gathered at the colourful Google SA offices in Bryanston, the mixed bag of personalities was an example of the variety of popular voices to be found on the internet. \nFrom pink-haired gaming geek Grant Hinds to South African swimmer Calvyn Justus, each member of the group of eight had thousands of people following their vlog (video blog) and their YouTube channel to get their perspective on different matters on Wednesday night. \nAmong the internet sensations on the white couch was Theodora Lee, who has a community of almost 200 000 subscribers to whom she gives advice about getting through the teenage years. \nAnother advice vlogger is Aisha O’Reilly, whose area of expertise is hair and beauty. \nO’Reilly says it took a while for her to feel like she could vlog for a living.

People are out there working and I’m here making people laugh for free,” he said, laughing. \n“My aim was not to make money, but if I can earn a living from doing what I love, then I think it’s only fair.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:39:48.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
