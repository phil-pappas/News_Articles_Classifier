The use of the FDA-cleared Aspen Laser System Class IV Pinnacle diode laser was used on players to alleviate pain and increase mobility.\nAccording to the US Pain Foundation , more than 100 million Americans are affected by chronic pain. Laser therapy is best known for its ability to provide relief for chronic and acute pain. This technique eliminates edema as well – allowing greater mobility and allowing the body to heal even the most difficult deep seated pathologies.\n“I recently had meniscus removal surgery. After two days of treatments, my experience with laser therapy was excellent.” Said professional baseball player Tony Wolters. “My knee is stronger, and overall I am doing a lot better. It works! It gave me a lot more confidence in what I am able to do. I am definitely going to continue using this product throughout my career.”\nUnlike many pharmacological treatments that mask pain, laser therapy treats the underlying condition to promote healing. Pain management through laser therapy can be especially helpful to those patients who cannot tolerate injections or their prescribed drugs.\nMany physicians agree that managing a patient’s pain requires implementing multiple strategies and new, cutting-edge solutions to achieve maximum benefits. Plus, patients are searching for alternative therapies to manage pain and reduce dependence on medication. As the benefits of laser therapy become increasingly clear, more patients will be seeking treatment. A growth rate of 13% is projected over the next few years.\n“Based on our experience in our pain clinic, the laser has been very effective in healing many different types of pain,” said Ernest Khoury, MD, Metro Pain Laser owner. “It is also a useful adjunct to the traditional modalities of pain relief.”\nIn clinical studies, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) as a treatment for chronic pain has resulted in positive outcomes for those suffering from chronic pain. A study by Frontiers in Physiology in 2014 concluded “it is clear that LLLT may be beneficial for many individuals suffering from pain, regardless of the condition that is causing it.”\nThe US National Library of Medicine conducted a meta-analysis study on the efficacy of low-power lasers in tissue repair and pain control. After reviewing the results from over 40 peer-reviewed papers, they concluded that “laser phototherapy is a highly effective therapeutic armamentarium for tissue repair and pain relief.” These findings could be very beneficial to the millions of Americans suffering daily from chronic pain.\nLaser therapy has other clinical benefits including anti-inflammation, onychomycosis treatment, accelerated tissue repair and cell growth, improved vascular and metabolic activity, reduced fibrous tissue formation, improved nerve function, immunoregulation and faster wound healing.", "external_links": ["http://medlandingnews.com/pain101-chronic-pain-affects-more-than-100-million-americans/", "http://medlanding.com/aspen-therapeutic-cold-laser-therapy", "http://www.medlanding.com/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15345176?dopt=Abstract", "http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphys.2014.00306/full"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:20:15.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
