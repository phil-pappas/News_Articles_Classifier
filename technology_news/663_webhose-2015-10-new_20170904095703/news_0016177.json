Photo: AP\nApple's iPhone juggernaut is showing no signs of slowing down â€” at least where first-weekend sales are concerned.\nOn Monday, Apple said it had sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices since they became available for sale Friday, a record for first-weekend sales. That was up from the 10 million iPhones that flew off the shelves last year during the first weekend that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were sold.\nAny increase in sales was likely helped by the geography of the markets where the new iPhones became available. This year, the iPhones went on sale in a dozen countries and territories, including China, which is one of Apple's biggest markets. Last year, China was not one of the countries that sold the iPhone on the first weekend, apparently because the devices had not received approval from Chinese regulators.\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus is the first to come in 'rose gold'.

Jan Dawson, the chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said he also expected first weekend sales to be higher than last year because the period for preordering the new iPhones was longer than that for the previous generation of the device.\nAdvertisement The sales numbers came in slightly above some Wall Street estimates. Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital, projected that Apple would sell 13 million phones on the opening weekend, and he said that Wall Street expected that Apple would sell about 12 million. Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster had predicted sales of 12 million to 13 million.\nFirst-weekend sales help indicate overall iPhone demand, an important metric given that the device accounts for the majority of Apple's revenue. The initial sales also are a marker for how well the new smartphones may do during the end-of-year holiday season, which is typically the most significant sales period for consumer product companies.\nThe scene on Friday in rainy Sydney.

To cut down on long wait times in line, Apple let people sign up online for time slots during which to pick up their phones in stores.\nIves said he was at an Apple store in Manhattan on Friday, where he saw about 1100 customers in line for the 8am appointment slot and 500 more people walking in without appointments, which is more than he saw last year.\nAt the Apple store in The Grove mall in Los Angeles, customers stood in the 32-degree heat to collect their new phones. Store employees handed out free bottled water, packs of Capri Sun, fruit and granola bars and provided large umbrellas for shade.\nThe scene was somewhat more subdued in rainy Sydney, where a robot and a small collection of enthusiasts gathered , determined to be among the world's first to grab the new device.\nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:10:09.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
