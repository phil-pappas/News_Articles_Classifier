Even though Big Blue scooped up software Meteorix last month, the company has challenges, Ives says. \"They are trying to sell Humvees and big gas guzzlers where IT managers and CIOs are looking for Teslas,\" he said. \"That’s where a lot of these tech giants find themselves. They are not ready for this evolving IT environment and they really have missed out along with their tech brethren.\" His possible targets for IBM include cloud data companies Salesforce.com and security company Palo Alto Networks.\nOracle ( ORCL ). Rumors have been out there that CEO Larry Ellison might attempt to acquire competitor Salesforce, while Forrester Research CEO George Colony told Bloomberg Tuesday that Oracle might still try to outbid Dell for EMC. Oracle, a provider of database software, is losing customers because \"enterprise and governments are starting to move away from as more of the budget dollars (go to) cloud, cybersecurity and big data,\" Ives said. It could duke it out for the same firms IBM might be eyeing, he says, as well as enterprise software company Workday and big data company Splunk.\nUSA TODAY\nSell VMware before Dell-EMC bleeds more value\nCisco ( CSCO ). Another IT company that's lagged in innovation, Ives says. The San Jose, Calif.-based firm company could look to acquire security company Fireeye.\n\"M&A has been a bit slow to date and it’s about to significantly heat up,\" Ives said. \"A lot of these tech players don't want to find themselves without a dance partner.\"\nThe semiconductors industry, in particular, has been a hotbed of consolidation and isn't likely to slow.\nBack in May, there were two notable recent chipmaker mergers: Avago's $37 billion Broadcom acquisition and Intel's $17 billion bid for Altera. And on Monday, chipmaker Microsemi made a $2.2 billion bid for fellow Calif.-based chip company PMC-Sierra, outbidding a $2 billion offer from Skyworks Solutions from earlier in the month. \"We continue to believe that Semiconductor companies beyond Microsemi will look for scale and target companies\" that have good synergies, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves in a note on Monday.\nOther potential semiconductor targets include Maxim, SemTech, Power Integrations and Cypress, he said.\nA recent FBR & Co. report found that about 11% of U.S. semiconductor companies were acquired in 2014, FBR & Co. said, and about one third of all U.S. publicly-traded semiconductor companies would be acquired this year at the current rate of consolidation. FBR identified additional targets including Advanced Micro Circuits Corp., Lattice Semiconducting Corp, Cavium and Marvell Technology Group.\nM&A benefits can include lowering expenses by, for example, reducing management costs and redundant R&D, as well as increasing production efficiencies. A recent FBR & Co. report found that recent tech deals eliminated more than 10% of expenses in large acquisitions and as much as 20% in smaller acquisitions.\nWestern Digital CEO Steve Milligan told CNBC Wednesday that the company aims to realize $500 million in financial synergies from the SanDisk deal. \"We are very comfortable with the long-term view ... and the perspective of the combined company,\" he said.\nThe deal will \"position (WD-SanDisk) for further growth opportunities going forward,\" Milligan said. \"Fundamentally, this transaction is all about the growth in digital data that all of us are seeing.\"\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n3 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1LM3QFC TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810310689829822-XXX-11277307-H1418099-67530682.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LM3QFC&text=Big%20tech%20companies%20race%20to%20do%20M%26A%20deals&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810310689829822-XXX-11277307-H1418099-67530682.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2014/09/29906170001_3798928327001_thumb-newslook746944.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LM3QFC&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LM3QFC", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2516554966cde7c9afefe65bfc2c180c19f08786/c=226-0-3773-2667&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635810310689829822-XXX-11277307-H1418099-67530682.JPG", "https://twitter.com/MikeSnider"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:50:57.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
