This year, we’re meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona at the historic and serene Camelback Inn. Against the breathtaking desert backdrop, we’re ready to engage in the serious conversations that create payments innovation and forward our industry. \nDay-one kicks off with a round of 18 on Camelback’s Padre Golf Course. And, we’re excited to have W.net (Women in Electronic Transactions) hosting its quarterly meeting on-site at ETA SLF 15. \nETA SLF gets down-to-business thinking local, with Michelle Tinsley, Director of Mobility and Secure Payment Retail Solutions at Intel Corporation offering an overview of Arizona’s leaders in payments innovation and sharing exciting news about the local FinTech and Financial Services landscape. She will also highlight why payments are “hot” in Phoenix, speaking on-stage with Jim Goulka, Managing Director of Arizona Tech Investors, David Riddiford, President of Apriva and Randy Gustafson, Vice President of Innovation for the Arizona Commerce Authority. \nIn addition to offering the industry’s best networking and a local FinTech spotlight, ETA SLF 2015 will feature high-interest keynotes today on start-up successes with the CEO Roundtable featuring Irv Henderson, CEO of talech, Chip Kahn, CEO of Boomtown, Georgina Nelson, CEO & Founder of truRating, Michael Reitblat, CEO & Co-Founder of Forter, moderated by Dan Rosen, Partner at Commerce VC. And, we’ll hear about the new new CurrentC platform from Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) during CEO Brian Mooney’s keynote. \nOver the next 3 days, all ETA SLF’s must-attend sessions are designed to deliver impactful insights to the busy payments executive. If you’re a payments exec not here yet, hop a plane NOW and register on-site! http://electran.org/events/slf15/ \nFollow us on Twitter @ElecTranAssoc and stay tuned to Transactions Trends for the latest updates from #ETASLF15 – the most impactful payments tech gathering of the year!
