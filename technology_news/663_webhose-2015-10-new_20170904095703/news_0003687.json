Both operate in the 915 (US ISM Band) and 868 MHz (Europe) unlicensed bands. They are currently FCC certified and will be ETSI compliant at delivery which is scheduled for the end of the year. The 8-channel comes in both an indoor version and an IP 67 rated outdoor enclosure. It is designed for large privet networks or small demand public network deployments. It is capable of supporting up to 25,000 end nodes.\nThe 24-channel base stations comes in an IP 67 rated outdoor enclosure and drives 3 sectorized antennas. The sectorized antenna provides a cross polarized feed for better urban performance, improved signal to noise ratios (SNR) more coverage per site. It is designed to serve the public telecom carrier market looking to deploy a LoRaWAN network. It is capable of supporting up to 75,000 end nodes.\nThese new products join an already broad line of LoRa and Symphony Link based products. Link Labs’ Symphony Link line features a low and high power end node module, repeaters, an 8-channel gateway (indoor and outdoor versions) and a handheld network tester to allow for easy range testing for your application or network deployment. The Symphony Link platform includes a cloud-based server called Conductor for managing your data and a growing libraries of API’s for end application development. The existing LoRaWAN products include 64-channel base station for the US capable of serving up to 250,000 end nodes.\nThe breadth of this product line allows developers to quickly bring long-range communications to their devices and network operators to cost effectively cover cities and regions with a range of gateways, base stations and repeater technologies. These devices are capable of licensed or unlicensed deployment from 137 MHz-1020 MHz.\nThe company’s primary markets are building management, smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, industrial sensing and control, government and municipal applications, asset tracking, and the growing connectivity requirements of the Internet of Things. Link Labs’ hardware and software platforms were designed for these new networks. They allow wireless communication over longer range than traditional technologies like WiFi or ZigBee and enable batteries to last 7-10 years in many applications.\n“Link Labs is excited to be bringing these LoRaWAN based products to market and to supporting the European carriers with these products. It further demonstrates our commitment to the LoRa platform and the standards being developed by the LoRa Alliance”, said Bryan Eagle, VP of Business Development and Marketing.\nAbout Link Labs\nLink Labs is a leading innovator in low-power, wide-area network technologies for the Internet of Things (IoT). The company’s patented Symphony LinkTM technology and LoRaWAN products provide secure, two-way, low data rate, long range connectivity for Internet-connected devices. Link Labs has customers around the world and powers a range of IoT applications across industries, including smart cities, agriculture, building controls, automotive, healthcare, government, defense, retail, and utilities.
