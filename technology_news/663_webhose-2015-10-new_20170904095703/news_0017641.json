It is used extensively in soldier communications and future soldier systems that require significant weight and space reduction such as tactical radios, portable computers, navigation and surveillance systems, night vision, digital scopes, UAVs and airborne vehicles. \nThe ODU AMC® connector series include ODU AMC® high-density, ODU AMC® break-away and ODU AMC® push-pull. These advanced, high-speed connector solutions offer high-performance data transmission, high bandwith transmission, high-reliability and easy-handling. The product portfolio of the ODU AMC® high-density includes USB 3.0, USB 2.0 and an HDMI option. In addition to the USB 2.0 version and ethernet designs with transfer rates of 100Mbit to 10Gbit, ODU offers also a connector that combines USB 2.0 and ethernet transfer. \nThe connection systems in the ODU AMC® series are smaller and lighter than the MIL housings with RJ45 inserts. They are extremely robust, versatile and easy to handle. \nThe main characteristics of this product series are: 5,000 mating cycles durability, push-pull or break-away function for maximum safety, watertight protection IP68 and IP69, optimised colour coding, highly reliable shielding properties (360°), operating temperature range of -51°C (-60°F) to 125°C (+257°F), salt spray-resistance, high-speed data transfer capability, numerous high-density signal configurations and tailored versions for power (up to 15A) and data transfer (USB 3.0 with 5A power) in a very compact package. \nODU high-speed connector solutions include also a series of push-pull circular connectors and modular rectangular connectors that have a large applicability in industries such as industrial, measurement and testing and medical. \nODU provides the full suite of complementary products and services, including innovative options for cable assembly, over-moulding and turn-key system solutions. \nFor more product information, please visit the company website.
