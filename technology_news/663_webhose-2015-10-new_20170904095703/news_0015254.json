The company's consultants participated in a unique project - involving a series of interviews and polls - that captured and transformed their feedback into a new brand identity. \nHobson Prior's consultants were interviewed about how they viewed their employer, and what they saw as its key strengths and qualities. This feedback was collated to inform brand messaging, and to pinpoint six core values: Professional, Dedicated, Experienced, Specialist, Proactive and Ambitious. These values will shape the way Hobson Prior's people approach their work. \nWith each consultant focusing on one of 14 life science job functions, Hobson Prior employees take particular pride in their specialist knowledge; in the company's 2015 candidate survey, 96% said their consultant had a good understanding of their specialism. \nThis level of specialism has heavily influenced Hobson Prior's new visual identity, with bespoke imagery featuring synapses, DNA strands and atoms. Employees also had a say on the new logo, voting for their favourite from several options. \nJake Thomas , Managing Director at Hobson Prior, commented: \"Putting our employees at the heart of our new brand means that it truly reflects our identity. This also gives them a shared sense of purpose to continue our success story.\" \nThe new brand was received with enthusiasm by the Hobson Prior team, and was marked with a branded redecoration of all company offices. It has been closely followed by the launch of a new website at hobsonprior.com . \nWith a responsive design and improved functionality, the new site provides excellent user experience for candidates, helping them to search and apply for hundreds of life science jobs. Hobson Prior has continued to involve its consultants by running competitions for content ideas; as a result, the site offers a range of industry articles, guides and careers advice from the experts themselves. \nNotes for editors \nHobson Prior is a leading specialist life sciences recruiter, focused on finding mid to senior level candidates across the UK, Europe and Asia Pacific . Its clients range from small firms to large multinational organisations in the pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device and CRO industries.
