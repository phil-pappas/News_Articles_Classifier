The apps using Youmi’s SDK will be removed from the App Store and any new apps submitted to the App Store using this SDK will be rejected.\n“We are working closely with developers to help them get updated versions of their apps that are safe for customers and in compliance with our guidelines back in the App Store quickly.”\nApple does not allow third-party applications to share data about a user without obtaining users’ permission, and it rejects apps that require users to share personal information, such as email addresses or birth dates.\nResearchers at the mobile analytics firm SourceDNA said Sunday they had discovered hundreds of apps that extract personal information, saying it was “the first time we’ve seen iOS apps successfully bypass the app review process.”\n“But, based on what we learned, it might not be the last.”\nThe researchers said they found 256 apps with an estimated one million downloads that have a version of Youmi that violates user privacy.\n“Most of the developers are located in China,” the researchers said in a blog post. “We believe the developers of these apps aren’t aware of this since the SDK is delivered in binary form, obfuscated, and user info is uploaded to Youmi’s server.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:02:44.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
