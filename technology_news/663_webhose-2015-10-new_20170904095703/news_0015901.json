FUGOO’s highly acclaimed portable Bluetooth speakers have quickly become top-rated for their high-quality 360-degree audio, unparalleled battery life and IP67 rating which makes them 100 percent waterproof (1) , shockproof, dust-proof and snow-proof. They are the only speakers to offer a “ core + jacket” design enabling the user to change the speaker’s outer jacket, depending on the style, functionality and level of ruggedness and durability desired. \nClick to tweet : @FUGOOLife’s new #FUGOOXL now at @BestBuy in the US and Canada #Bluetoothspeakers #FUGOOmovement #waterproof #shockproof \nFUGOO Style XL, Sport XL, Tough XL – Bigger, Badder and Louder \nFUGOO’s newest speakers, the Style XL , Sport XL and Tough XL , deliver 38 watts of audio power via eight acoustic drivers; four neodymium tweeters, two neodymium aluminum domed mid-woofers and two passive radiators. To get true 360-degree audio, the drivers are strategically placed on all four sides at an eight-degree upward angle to deliver a 360-degree sweet spot. They easily fill an indoor or outdoor space in all directions with rich full bass, solid midrange, and crisp distinct highs. \nThe perfect companion for those who don’t want to be tethered to an electrical outlet or power bank, FUGOO XLs deliver 35 hours (2) of battery life, easily outlasting any other speaker of its size -- and even smaller ones -- two or three times over. For added convenience, they can also fast charge a smartphone or tablet directly from the USB charge port, and six dedicated control buttons (which glow on the Sport XL) make it easy to control the music directly from the speaker. In addition, the Style XL and Sport XL float in water, making them the perfect speaker for open water expeditions. \nFUGOO Style, Sport, Tough – Small and Powerful \nFUGOO’s smaller award-winning speakers, the Style, Sport and Tough, are lightweight and highly transportable, making them ideal for travel. They feature six drivers: two tweeters, two mid-woofers and two passive radiators, also placed on all four sides at an eight-degree upward angle for 360-degree audio. And with 40 hours (3) of battery life, they’ll often last a week or two of normal use without needing a recharge. \nDesigned for the Outdoors \nIn addition to their rugged design and IP67 rating, all FUGOO speakers include clever features that make them ideally suited for use outdoors. A range of optional mounts or carrying straps make them easily transportable and ideal for anyone that wants their favorite tunes wherever they go – the beach, paddle-boarding, kayaking, camping, or on the court. In addition, a hands-free mode and Siri and Google Now support make it easy to use voice commands to dial a phone number, set exercise timers or to check sport scores and weather forecasts. Lastly, FUGOO’s optional wearable waterproof Bluetooth Remote Control can be worn like a wrist watch or on a lanyard, so phones can be safely tucked away. \nAvailability and Prices \nBest Buy is FUGOO’s exclusive retail partner on the Style XL and Tough XL until Jan. 31, 2016.
