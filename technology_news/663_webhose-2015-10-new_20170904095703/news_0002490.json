(Adobe Systems) 01 PM Follow @htsuka We’re living in a retouched world, and it just got a little easier to bring your own snaps up to par. Adobe’s Photoshop has long been the photo alteration tool of choice — but at quite a cost. It didn’t seem worth buying Photoshop just to make a goofy picture of your cat on top of the Eiffel Tower.\nBut with Photoshop Mix, you can use its most common editing tools on your smartphone free. Mix comes with more than just the basics of cropping, instant color correction and filters. It lets you create layered images, blend photos together, crop and remix to your heart’s content.\nMost people aren’t going to be able to make masterpieces on their phones with Mix. But if you want to retouch some snaps — you can pull pictures from your camera or a number of cloud services — it’s hard to argue with the simplicity and versatility of this app. Users will need to sign up for an Adobe account. An Android version is in the works. Free, for iOS devices.\n— Hayley Tsukayama", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@htsuka"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:21:48.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
