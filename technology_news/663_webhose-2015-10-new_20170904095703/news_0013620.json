BrandMaker is making the most of the escalating demand for automating marketing fulfillment activities by providing a broad array of capabilities within its end-to-end MPOS platform -- BrandMaker Marketing Efficiency Cloud. The company's solutions can be implemented in an integrated and consolidated manner across all marketing optimization use cases within the digital and traditional marketing mix. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151020/278666LOGO \nOwing to enterprises' rising interest in MPOS, the BrandMaker Marketing Efficiency Cloud is finding significant application in planning and budgeting, project and workflow management, asset management, product information management, dynamic content creation, and analytics. It is emerging as the preferred MPOS platform across diverse verticals due its tangible benefits of shorter time to market and lead time, higher productivity and cost savings, traceable workflows, and greater transparency between global and local marketing teams. \nThe company has excelled in developing a highly modular platform, with key functionalities such as Marketing Planner, Media Pool and Brand Management Portal. Its services include production of advertising materials and advertising logistics through its SaaS-based Web-to-Print and Web-to-Web modules and BrandMaker's Marketing Shop. Its Digital Marketing Center module integrates with Google Adwords, Google Analytics, Facebook, Adobe Analytics and other technology applications that further enhance its digital marketing value proposition. \nApart from expanding its solution portfolio, BrandMaker has demonstrated sharp business acumen in employing a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, foraying into key vertical markets across Europe and North America, and strengthening market share in its core markets. It has had a string of successful deployments with marquee clients, including Audi, Bayer, EURONICS, Hewlett Packard, J.P. Morgan, MetLife, Michelin, Migros, UBS and Volvo. \n\"BrandMaker recently won a funding round in Europe for $30 million in capital, which will be channeled to sales and marketing to further expand in North America and Europe,\" said Frost & Sullivan Industry Analyst Hiral Jasani. \"Considering its expertise in dealing with multi-cultural and multi-lingual clients across Europe and the newly acquired capital, BrandMaker is in an excellent position to scale its operations in the lucrative North American market.\" \nBrandMaker stands out for its ability to cater to businesses of all sizes through its agile marketing process optimization solution. In 2014, it focused on widening its SaaS customer base and the strategy paid off in a big way, with the company recording a more than 50 percent increase in recurring licensing revenue. As a stand-alone MPOS vendor, it boasts an unrivalled customer base of more than 300 enterprise customers, with 300,000 users in 86 countries. BrandMaker's growth rate was much higher than the market average of 12.2 percent in 2014 and above the 10-18 percent of peer MPOS vendors. Furthermore, it has a larger customer base in the B2B segment than the B2C segment, setting it apart from the competition, which is more prevalent in B2C. \nBrandMaker further diversified its digital marketing portfolio by acquiring Advertzoom. BrandMaker can now offer cross-channel planning, monitoring and performance control across both online and offline channels to customers, especially those within the eCommerce sector. \n\"BrandMaker also has a solid partnership program spanning Asia Pacific, North America and Europe with notable alliances for distribution, implementation and support,\" noted Jasani. \"A wide range of interfaces gives customers the functional depth and flexibility to choose from an array of third-party integrations such as, for example, ERP or PLM systems.\" \nFor its extensible MPOS platform with the flexibility to scale for future growth and its customer-focused business strategies, Frost & Sullivan is pleased to present BrandMaker with the 2015 Global Award for Growth Excellence Leadership. \nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in growth and customer value.
