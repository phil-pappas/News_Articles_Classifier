He completed his PhD from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden in 1967. \nBetween 1978 and 82, Lindahl served at the University of Gothenburg as a professor of Medical and Physiological Chemistry. \nCurrently, he is serving as Emeritus group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, and Emeritus director of Cancer Research UK at Clare Hall Laboratory, Hertfordshire, UK. \nUS citizen Paul Modrich was born 1946. He did his PhD at Stanford University, Stanford, US in 1973, and is presently working as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and James B Duke professor of Biochemistry at Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, USA. \"The scientist trio have provided fundamental insights into the functions of cells, which can be used in the development of new cancer treatments.\" \nUS citizen Aziz Sancar did his PhD at the University of Texas, US in 1977. \nAt present Sancar is serving as Sarah Graham Kenan professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, US. He was born in 1946 in Savur, Turkey. \nTomas Lindahl, through his research, demonstrated the instable and decaying quality of DNA molecules, against the popular belief that DNA is an extremely stable molecule. \nBased on this insight, Lindahl discovered a molecular machinery, base excision repair, which constantly counteracts the collapse of our DNA. \nAziz Sancar has mapped nucleotide excision repair. This mechanism has been used by cells to repair UV damage to DNA. If people are born with defects in this repair system, they have tendency to develop skin cancer when exposed to sunlight. \nPaul Modrich has showed the mismatch repair of cells that occurs when DNA is replicated during cell division, which reduces error frequency a thousand times. \nInborn defects in mismatch repair are known to cause a hereditary variant of colon cancer. \nImage:Johan Jarnestad illustration.
