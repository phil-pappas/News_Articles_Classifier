Queensland man finds lost driver’s licence at beach after 17 years October 12, 2015 10:39pm Email a friend \nTHE amazing reunion of a Queensland man with the driver’s licence he lost at the beach 17 years ago has led to speculation about a Bermuda triange-like phenomenon at play off the Sunshine Coast. \nLifeguard Tye Schlenker lost his licence, along with the rest of his wallet and car keys, when they fell out of the pockets of his boardshorts as he was swimming at Kings Beach in Caloundra in 1998. \nBut last weekend a surfer found the wayward ID card in the surf at Bulcock Beach, about two kilometres from where it disappeared. \nA delighted Mr Schlenker, who called the discovery “unbelievable”, told the Courier Mail his first-ever licence was still in good nick. \n“It’s still in a perfect condition — it expired in October 1999,” the now 37-year-old said. \n“I had a bit of a mullet back then, which is a little ­embarrassing.” \nBut this is not the only notable find in the area, prompting questions about a Bermuda triangle-like phenomenon off the coast. Tye Schlenker reunited with his long-lost licence. Source: Supplied \nMetro Caloundra Surf Club vice captain Pat Gardiner told the Courier Mail he was walking on nearby Moffat Beach about five years ago when he found a lost wallet in the sand. \n“It turns out the owner had lost it while he was fishing at Dicky Beach three weeks earlier,” he said. \n“Those two beaches are a similar distance apart as Bulcock and Kings Beach. \n“I’ve heard of a couple of these kind of things happening — people losing things after a few weeks but 17 years is incredible.” \nAs speculation swirls about mysterious coastal conditions at play, news.com.au asked beach expert Dr Darrell Strauss, research manager at the Griffith Centre for Coastal Research, what was going on. \nDisappointingly, but not surprisingly, he had a very sensible explanation. \n“I think the chances are the wallet had been buried in the sand all this time and it’s been dislodged again recently,” he said. \n“We’ve had our first wave activity last weekend and in the last couple of weeks, and prior to that it’s been pretty calm for a really long time ... so a little bit of an increase in the wave activity over the past few weeks could have dislodged it from where it’s been lying all this time. \n“I can’t think of any other explanation.” \nLong-lost driver’s licences aren’t a common find on Australian beaches, but Dr Strauss said lost cameras, especially GoPros, were increasingly being found. \nJust this weekend a Gold Coast man put out a call for the owners of a lost GoPro camera he found at Currumbin Beach. A Queensland man is hunting for this couple who left their camera on a Gold Coast beach. Source: Supplied \n“I’ve also heard of an underwater video camera that made its way up the coast with the waves and was filming as it was bouncing around in the surf,” Dr Strauss said. \nBut sometimes, lost items travel a much longer distance before they return to land. \nHere are some of the stranger things were once thought lost at sea — but weren’t lost forever. \nPLAGUES OF THONGS \nLocals were scratching their heads when more than 3600 thongs washed up on a stretch of coastland in East Arnhem Land earlier this year. \nBut the rouge sandals were likely to have been lost in the water near Indonesia and East Timor and eventually brought to Australia on tides and currents in the Arafura Sea. \nThat’s not the first time wayward thongs from Asia have made their way to our shores — another 5000 of them were collected by clean-up crews in Western Cape York last year, while 4700 others ended up on a far north Queensland beach three years ago. \nESCAPED DUCKS \nIn 1992, a container of Friendly Floatee brand bath toys tumbled off a cargo ship in the Pacific Ocean, sending 28,800 unsinkable plastic ducks (and other animals) bobbing into the sea. \nOver the next decade, the ducks washed up on the shores of Hawaii, Alaska, South America, Australia and Scotland, delighting beachcombers, while others became trapped in Arctic ice. \nThe disaster turned valuable for oceanographers, who used the flotilla of bright, yellow ducks to trace ocean currents as they made their passage across the globe. \nThe ducks also helped to identify a vortex of currents in the Pacific Ocean, including one that is home to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling mass of plastic debris floating between Hawaii and California.

You can only see where flotsam started and where it ended up.” \nBut the Cornish Lego isn’t to be confused with Ego Leonard, the giant Lego man who has washed up on coasts in the Netherlands, the UK, the US, Japan and Austria since 2007. He appears to be the work of a guerilla artist. \nSEVERED FEET MYSTERY \nThey were never reported lost as such, but the gruesome discoveries of up to 12 severed human feet that washed up on Canada’s Pacific Coast between 2007 and 2012 sparked wild theories, notably about a local serial killer. \nThe feet were still their shoes, which ranged from hiking boots to Nike sneakers, and no other body parts surfaced. Investigators were baffled for years, until science came to the rescue. \nExperts explained the feet weren’t actually severed, but became detached from the bodies of their drowned owners as part of the natural decomposition process. The buoyancy of the shoes then let the feet float away, eventually reaching land. \n“It’s very explainable,” Stephen Fonseca, who followed the case , told the New York Post . “The unusual nature of this is that the feet were found in a very short period of time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:23:35.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
