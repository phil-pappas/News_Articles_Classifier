Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup 3D Medical, an ASX-listed medical company that prints customised 3D models of patients' bones and organs for doctors and surgeons, has acquired United States medical technology business Mach7 in a deal worth $60 million\n3D Medical had previously been the exclusive Australian reseller of Mach7's image management platform.\nThe company plans to rename after the merger as Mach7 Technologies and will be headquartered in Melbourne. But Mach7's team will remain predominantly in the United States, with the board being a combination of the two entities.\n3D Medical chairman Nigel Finch said the business relied on a seamless supply of medical image data, which it had previously had access to through partnerships with companies such as Canada's Intelerad , but this would be easier to achieve through the merger with Mach7.\nA 3D printed skull made by 3D Medical which has bought the American medical technology business Mach7. \"We can't do anything without an image and Mach7 gives us that image,\" he said.\n\"It also has between 30 and 40 enviable clients based in 300 sites in 10 countries across the world. We can now work through that client list and sell our services over the top of Mach7.\"\nAlmost 460 million shares in 3D Medical will be issued to the owners of Mach7, in return for 100 per cent of the shares in Mach7.\n3D Medical must successfully raise a minimum of $10 million for the deal to go ahead.\n3D Medical's printing service allows medical and healthcare practitioners to 3D print patient specific anatomical parts as functional and visual aid. 3D Medical Future plans The $10 million will be used to support further research and development, sales and marketing activities to accelerate Mach7's Australian presence, build out 3D Medical's data offerings, pay off Mach7's debt and afford the costs of the transaction.\nIn June 3D Medical signed a deal with Telstra Health for it to be a reseller of the Mach7 system.\nMach7 chief executive Albert Liong said the businesses were a \"perfect combination\".\n\"We provide the backbone for the data and 3D Medical then does the printing … We see a combined purpose to meet what the market needs,\" he said.\n\"Mach7 also gets access to the capital it needs to grow … Right now we have great traction in the US, with more than half our revenue and sales there. Outside of that there are great opportunities in Australia, south-east Asia and the Middle East.\"\nMr Liong will be the managing director of the combined businesses, with Mr Finch on the board as a non executive director.\nThe 3D medical product gives clinicians a better view of a patient's particular problem. For example, 3D Medical can print the arterial system around a heart, which varies in each person, giving surgeons a more accurate view of the heart before surgery.\n3D Medical reverse listed on the ASX in February. Its shares were put in a trading halt on Monday, but it was last trading at 7.8¢.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-26T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:18:37.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
