Apple said in 2013 it had paid an effective tax rate of less than 2 percent in Ireland over the previous ten years. EU state aid rules ban subsidies -- such as tax breaks - that single out certain companies for special treatment.\nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has sought a rapid conclusion to the EU’s probes into possible illegal aid through tax arrangements for Apple in Ireland, Starbucks Corp. in the Netherlands and Amazon.com Inc. and a Fiat SpA unit in Luxembourg. Still, the commission has indicated that she won’t rush the investigations at the expense of a thorough analysis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:43:28.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
