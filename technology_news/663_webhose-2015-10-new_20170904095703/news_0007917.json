October 21, 2015 MADISON, WIS. – Bell Laboratories launched the new 1-pound City Pack for CONTRAC and FINAL BLOX at PestWorld 2015 in Nashville, Tenn. Now, the bait BLOX is available in lightweight packaging for easy transportation. Designed with technicians in mind, CONTRAC and FINAL City Packs use the same reliable and effective rodenticide formulations, but in an easy-to-carry 1-pound pouch. The smaller pack size is useful to control inventory in the field and has a zip lock closure to keep bait fresh. “It’s exciting to offer PMP’s new, convenient packaging for our most popular rodenticide formulations,” said Sheila Haddad, Bell’s Eastern Regional Manager. “I am certain this will be a huge benefit for all PMPs in the city who have limited space to carry supplies.” CONTRAC is a bromadiolone formula known for outstanding rodent acceptance and control, the manufacturer reports. FINAL All-Weather BLOX contain the active ingredient, brodifacoum. CONTRAC and FINAL City Packs are approved for use on commensal rodents as well as meadow voles and seven other additional species (certain restrictions may apply). CONTRAC City Packs are also approved for use on Peromyscus (deer mouse, cotton mouse and white-footed mouse). The 1-pound City Pack for CONTRAC and FINAL All-Weather BLOX is now available through Bell distributors. For more information, visit www.belllabs.com .
