October 19, 2015 Credit: The American Chemical Society \nTrillions of microorganisms inhabit our bodies. Scientists call this community the microbiome, and it's one of the hottest topics in research these days. \nOver the past decade, researchers have learned a lot about the genetics of these microorganisms and the molecules they produce, for better or worse. In this week's Speaking of Chemistry, host Matt Davenport talks with Harvard University researcher Emily Balskus, Ph.D., about the next big things our gut can tell us. \nCheck it out here: 2 hours ago 1 Video: What does space smell like? March 4, 2015 \nYou can see it through a telescope, or watch a documentary about it, but you can't stick your nose out and take a whiff. Video: Critter chemistry: Three amazing insect scientists May 28, 2015 \nThere are an estimated 10 quintillion insects on the planet. While you may want to swat them all away, some of them are actually fascinating little scientists. In this week's Speaking of Chemistry, Matt Davenport brings you ...
