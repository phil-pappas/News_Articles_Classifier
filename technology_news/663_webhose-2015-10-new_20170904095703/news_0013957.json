Among the most notable ones access to an additional 100 channels, more Netflix locations, a service to request unlocks for channels and \"high strength encryption\". \nChannel refers to an offering on the Internet such as Netflix, Amazon Prime video or Hulu. The current version of the ProxMate browser extension works by adding so-called packages to the extension which unlock support for services. \nOnce you have installed a package you may access the service's website from any location in the world without being blocked from accessing it. \nThe new version will introduce support for more than 100 additional services on the Internet that subscribed users can unlock using ProxMate. \nExisting benefits such as unlimited bandwidth and data transfer, no logging of activity and a strict no-ads policy remain in place. The company expects to roll out the change in mid-October. It is likely that it will announce the costs for subscribing to the service then on its website. \nClosing Words \nIt all comes down to price especially since the subscription-based ProxMate has to compete with free offers and VPN services. Getflix for instance is available for a one-time payment of $39 currently on Ghacks Deals while the excellent VPN Private Internet Access for $59.95 for two years which translates to less than $2.5 per month.
