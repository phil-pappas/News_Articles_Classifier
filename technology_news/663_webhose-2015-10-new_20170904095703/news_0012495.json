Over 700 of Pulse’s Clarity DASUTCCR500NF distributed antenna system (DAS) ultra-thin, clear, ceiling-mount antennas will be deployed in the building. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

(Photo: Business Wire) \n“Pulse’s Clarity antennas are a great fit for the World Trade Center,” said Olivier Robin, general manager for Pulse Electronics Wireless Infrastructure business unit. “With almost everyone using a mobile phone or some type of wireless device, it is essential that employees and visitors of the World Trade Center have a clear connection, enough bandwidth for the internet, and minimal dead spots and dropped calls. The reconstruction of this historic building created demanding RF conditions of steel and reinforced concrete. The patent-pending novel design of the Clarity antennas resulted in extremely thin, translucent radiating elements for optimum visual appeal coveted by architects; yet they meet the RF needs for today’s advanced wireless networks.” \nPulse Electronics’ Clarity family of DAS antennas are translucent, making them nearly transparent. They have an extremely low profile, extending just 0.33 inches (8.4mm) below the ceiling. The antennas cover all cellular bands from 608 MHz through 2700 MHz and their PIM (passive intermodulation distortion) rating is better than -155dBc at 2x20 watts (2x43dBm), providing superior performance. The DASUTCCR500NF antennas are part of Pulse Electronics’ PIMinator ® line of low passive intermodulation antennas. \nFor more information on Pulse Electronics DAS antennas check out the datasheet at http://productfinder.pulseeng.com/product/DASUTCC500NF , visit the website at http://www.pulseelectronics.com , or contact Pulse Electronics at antennas.us@pulseelectronics.com . \nDASUTCCR500NF antenna photo at: http://www.pulseelectronics.com/image.php?blob_id=4362 \nAbout Pulse Electronics \nPulse Electronics is the electronic components partner that helps customers build the next great product by providing the needed technical solutions.
