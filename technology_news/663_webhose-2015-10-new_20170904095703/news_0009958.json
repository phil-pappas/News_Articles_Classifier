Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: LIXT) (\"Lixte\" or the \"Company\") has engaged the services of BioPharmaWorks LLC (\"BioPharmaWorks\") to enhance the value of its clinical candidate portfolio. The scientific team at BioPharmaWorks ( www.biopharmaworks.com ) provides expertise in multiple aspects of drug discovery, development and intellectual property.\nDr. John Kovach , founder and president of Lixte, commented, \"BioPharmaWorks brings exceptional expertise in virtually all aspects of drug development, ranging from drug design, synthesis, pharmacokinetics and metabolism to intellectual property law, biostatistics and predictive toxicology. The BioPharmaWorks scientific team will be working closely with Lixte management to bring their expertise to Lixte, just as Lixte's lead compound, LB-100, is nearing completion of its initial studies in patients.\"\nAdded Dr. Kovach, \"Lixte has emphasized the potential importance of its protein phosphatase inhibitors to the treatment of a variety of cancer types. These compounds also have potential applications to important non-neoplastic diseases, as do Lixte's proprietary histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Some of these applications relate to chronic neurological disorders, an area in which BioPharmaWorks has special expertise. Lixte's immediate task is to determine the most efficient approach to capitalizing on the clinical results of its nearly completed Phase I clinical trial of LB-100 as it moves into Phase II cancer studies and to complete pre-clinical development of other members of the Company's pipeline, including the HDACi. Adding expertise in both the strategic development of compounds and their protection is an area of critical importance to Lixte, which now has 23 allowed patents and a larger number pending in various stages.\"\nAbout Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc.\nLixte is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases and then design novel compounds to attack those targets. Lixte's product pipeline encompasses two major categories of compounds at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development which the Company believes have broad therapeutic potential not only for cancer but for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. Lixte's unique phosphatase inhibitor, LB-100, is in a Phase I clinical trial at two NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers and three US Oncology Research sites (see ClinicalTrials.gov: Identifier NCTO1837667).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
