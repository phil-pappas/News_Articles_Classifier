Arvedlund, Inquirer Staff Writer Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015, 3:01 AM \nDrexel University and Philadelphia Media Network will launch a mobile news app created by Drexel students to serve Millennial audiences.The mobile app, available to the public next year for download on Apple's iPhones, focuses on news in the Philadelphia region produced by the staffs of the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Daily News and Philly.com. \nThe app was conceived by undergraduate students at Drexel's Charles D. Close School of Entrepreneurship. \nWorking with digital media entrepreneurs Jordan Motzkin and Ari Winkleman, the students come from a range of disciplines, including marketing, business development, arts and sciences and media art and design. \nA second team of Drexel University co-op students at Drexel LeBow College of Business is testing and launching the beta version. They'll invite a hoped-for 2,000 beta testers-especially peers from local universities, affiliated school websites and newspapers-as part of the beta phase, said Rosalind Remer, vice provost and executive director of Lenfest's Center for Cultural Partnerships. \nFollowing the app's beta testing this fall, the co-op students will be embedded at Philadelphia Media Network's offices to fine-tune the app, its content, and design for launch in 2016. \n\"This is a real-world, real-time process that we plan to use as a template for the future,\" said Stan Wischnowski, vice president of news operations at Philadelphia Media Network. \nThe project was funded by a grant from Philadelphia Media Network owner Gerry Lenfest. \n\"This revolutionary approach benefits the students, our company and our journalism,\" Lenfest said in a statement. \n\"It will help ensure that current and future generations of young adults-indeed, all adults-will get the news they want in the way they want it.\" \nAdded Drexel's Remer: \"This carries the extra benefit of enabling students to pitch their research and product idea.\" \nThe Drexel-led app project is part of a company-wide strategy which includes a redesign of the website Philly.com and the unveiling of a professional sports app. \nThe free sports app, Philly Sports Now, features news and commentary from the Inquirer and Daily News and wires on the Philadelphia Eagles, Phillies, 76ers, Flyers and Union soccer. It's available at philly.com/iphonesportsnow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:41:08.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
