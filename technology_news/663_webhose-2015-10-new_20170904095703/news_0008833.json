There's a slightly smaller proportion in the market,\" she said.\nBased on these projections, the property sector, a vital driver for the economy, won't be as stimulatory as it has been.\nThe resulting softer growth in the broader economy should force the Reserve Bank to step in again and cut the cash rate to 1.5 per cent, with ANZ forecasting two more cuts in February and May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:45:01.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
