During the event, attendees will gain knowledge of the ever-shifting software environment and how software empowers the digital enterprise, which encompasses security, mobility, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. The Zones Software CustomerConnect conference, which is open to select Zones customers, takes place at the Rancho Bernado Inn in San Diego. “For organizations to run effectively and ensure the highest productivity gains, they must have the right software tools in place,” said Todd Leeson, vice president of Partner and Product Management, Software at Zones. “At CustomerConnect, the world’s leading technology brands will share the best practices and key considerations that companies need to be thinking about to drive positive business outcomes through the use of software tools and applications.”\nThe Zones CustomerConnect conference features a keynote address by IDC Research Vice President Amy Konary . Konary will present on the topic of “Key Trends in Enterprise Software.”\n“The software industry is going through a phase of dramatic change with the advent and adoption of 3rd Platform technologies,” said Konary. “This driver, as well as other key dynamics, is leading to the obsolescence of traditional pricing models and the development of new business models. It is now more important than ever that IT buyers understand the options available to them and think strategically about the ways in which they budget for and purchase enterprise software.”\nStrategically partnered with the world’s leading software brands, Zones has deep experience helping organizations optimize the return on their software investments by providing end-to-end services supporting all stages of the IT lifecycle, including advisory services, software asset management, deployment, migration services, as well as ongoing 24x7 managed services.\nBy bringing together a dedicated team of software solutions specialists, licensing experts and cloud solutions professionals in a centralized U.S.-based software center of excellence, Zones is uniquely positioned to help organizations drive impactful business outcomes through increased productivity, scalability, improved security, and more efficient management of software assets.\nThe Zones CustomerConnect event follows multiple announcements from Zones related to software.
