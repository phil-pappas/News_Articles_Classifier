MIAMI Oct. 23 2015 /- John Eggert Gaumard's executive vice pre...About Gaumard Scientific !-- Paragraph before: a href http://ww... http://feeds.bio-medicine.org/latest-medical-technology Date:10/23/2015 \nMIAMI , Oct. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Gaumard® Scientific Company today announced that it will demonstrate its innovative patient simulators at the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Scientific Sessions 2015 set for Oct. 26-29 in Boston . Gaumard's large-scale product display will be located at booth No. 1452. \nGaumard simulators, including the most technologically advanced maternal birthing simulator – Victoria – as well as the rugged and sophisticated Trauma HAL S3040.100 and the 5-year-old tetherless Pedi HAL S3005 simulator, will be featured in several demonstrations that address emergency care scenarios such as breech delivery, terrorism readiness and active shooter situations. Gaumard's extensive family of advanced simulators is fully tetherless, allowing for full mobility during emergency care training scenarios. \nJohn Eggert , Gaumard's executive vice president, said: \"This year's ACEP Scientific Sessions is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate \"Care in Motion,\" a feature of the wireless-tetherless experience we've built into our simulators. This enables our simulators to be used in the fast-paced environment of emergency care, where practitioners transport patients and administer care across a variety of locations and circumstances. With \"Care in Motion,\" training scenarios can take place anywhere: a patient care location, hallway, ambulance or even outside of a medical center.\" \nAbout Gaumard Scientific \nGaumard® Scientific Company has designed, manufactured and marketed simulators for health care education for more than 60 years.
