Also particularly because some of these issues are extremely serious,\" the Finance Minister told reporters in his office.\nHe said some issues can reflect on inter-community relations while others can reflect on sensitive areas such as Jammu and Kashmir.\n\"There are issues which impinge on our relations with our neighbouring countries and, therefore, there has to be a proper civilised mode of discussing and debating these issues,\" he said.\nTo a question on the Sena protest in the BCCI office against the resumption of cricketing ties, Jaitley made it clear that he would only urge the ally that it must realise that it is part of central and state government and it has a responsibility.\n\"Issues\nAsked about the tactics employed by Shiv Sena to register protests, he said the same standard of civility applies to all.\nReplying to questions on provocative statements made by BJP leaders like Sangeet Som, an accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots case, and whether the government should be strict with them, Jaitley said, \"You see, after the Prime Minister's comment, the President (Amit Shah) had called three gentlemen. He has very firmly told them that their statements are not appreciated by the party at all. They have been put on notice. Therefore I am sure that they corrected themselves\".\nHe said as a political organisation, as a party and as a government, \"our spokesmen are acting with utmost restraint and by various statements including the present one I am making to you, we have outright shown our disagreement with these kind of statements\".\nRefusing to go into the issue of individuals, he said that within the political space, there will be some people who rely on some kind of sensationalism in the media to create a constituency for themselves.\n\"Now, we have been able to identify people from their tactics and, therefore, the party has already put these people to notice. If somebody has made an error in the past, I am sure he will correct himself,\" he said.\nHe also said that media has a national role to play and should not allow it to be used as an oxygen by people indulging in these \"outlandish behaviour\".\n\"While we have a responsibility in public space to make sure that we distance from this kind of a behaviour, the kind of publicity that they get should also not be such that this leads to copy cat vandalism which we have seen in the last few days,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://web.ventunotech.com/plugins/cntplayer/ventuno_editorial_player.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:28:41.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
