These solutions leverage opportunities for cost savings and operational efficiencies by implementing committees on a more global scale rather than study by study. \nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20131120/PH19940LOGO \nUsing this program-wide approach, one ACI client recently saved over $2M on committee costs in a single Phase III program. Despite differences in protocols, processes, and endpoints, ACI was able to develop a robust, single-committee solution that reduced adjudication expenses by 38 percent. \n\"Traditionally, each study would have required a separate adjudication committee, each with its own charter, members, and project management needs,\" said Amy Ghelardi, Director of Client Services. \"In this instance, ACI identified key similarities between protocols to design a program-wide committee which could expertly evaluate safety and efficacy events for all trials, saving the client significant time and money.\" \nACI's approach stems from their medical and clinical expertise combined with business-side understanding of the clinical development path. ACI is able to smartly structure a committee's charter to allow new studies to be added or dropped, even allowing new members to be brought on as needed to provide additional specialized expertise in a consultative capacity. \nAside from cost savings, clients have noted benefits in committee decision-making when members have more global knowledge and awareness of overall product development. They also benefit from having fewer committees to worry about and a simpler startup and closeout. \nACI's Committee Expertise: -- Largest dedicated committee staff in the industry -- Global network of qualified medical experts that can serve as members -- Proprietary AIMSÂ® committee management software that streamlines processes -- Deep involvement in private-public thought leadership efforts for committee best practices \nAbout ACI Clinical ACI Clinical provides advisory services to solve complex issues in clinical research. We specialize in managing independent Endpoint Adjudication Committees and Data Monitoring Committees, clinical and safety consulting, and full-service biometrics solutions. \nFor more information, contact:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:46:29.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
