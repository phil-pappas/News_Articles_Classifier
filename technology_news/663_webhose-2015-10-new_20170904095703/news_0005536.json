The set of tools includes CampusNexus Student, CampusNexus CRM, Campus Nexus Finance, HR & Payroll and its fundraising platform. \nThe goal, university representatives said, is to replace the legacy systems with a unified platform designed to help them grow enrollment, increase retention, improve student engagement, make sharing among departments easier and inform data-driven decision-making. \n\"We understand that two-year institutions encounter significant enrollment shifts and budget constraints, yet are highly in tune with their community's needs,\" said Campus Management CEO Jim Milton. \n\"From recruitment and retention to alumni relations and advancement, we will now have the foundation we need for improving engagement across the student lifecycle,\" said ASU-Mountain Home Chancellor Robin Meyers.
