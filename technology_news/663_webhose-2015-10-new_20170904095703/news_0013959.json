Many top Maoist leaders (from Kerala) have been taken into custody. This is because of a very strong combined action initiated against them by the governments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,\" he told PTI here.\nReferring to the arrest of Jitender Oraon, an alleged commander of People's Liberation Army -- the armed wing of the banned Maoists in Jharkhand, Chennithala said\"very vigilant state police are trying to uproot\" the reds from the state. Oraon, a native of Latehar district in Jharkhand, was arrested by Ernakulam rural police on Friday. He had been working at an electric wire manufacturing unit near Angamaly for the past three years.\nChennithala said the government has chalked out a two-pronged strategy towards the Maoist menace in Kerala.\"First, flush out Maoists from vulnerable tribal hamlets through effective police action. Secondly, unleash development in the tribal areas. We are implementing both. All those Maoists, who were active in such areas, are now in police custody,\" he said.\nMeanwhile commenting on the heated political debates in the state over the death of Sivagiri Mutt's former head Swami Saswathikananda, Chennithala made it clear that no further probe can be ordered without fresh evidence. Heated political debates continued to rage in the state on Sunday.\n\"These allegations were investigated by the crime branch. Only if more evidence pours in, will there be a possibility of ordering further investigation,\" he said.\nSwami Saswathikananda was found drowned in the Periyar river at Aluva on July 1, 2002.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:34:47.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
