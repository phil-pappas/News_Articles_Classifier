Albanese, acting superintendent of Financial Services. \"Smart, targeted regulation that helps protect consumers and prevent illicit activity is vital to the long-term future of this industry.\" \nGemini is the first licensed cryptocurrency business for the Winklevoss brothers, best known for accusing Facebook Inc founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea. \n\"Our focus right now is operating a spot bitcoin exchange. In many ways, we're not really re-inventing the wheel,\" said Gemini chief executive Tyler Winklevoss told Reuters in August. \nThe Winklevoss brothers filed an application to operate as a trust company with the New York's banking regulator in July. \nA trust company is a type of financial institution technically different from a bank, analysts said. Under New York banking law, a trust company has all the powers of a bank to take deposits and make loans, alongside certain fiduciary powers such as acting as an agent for government bodies. \nAs a limited liability trust company, Gemini will maintain significant capital reserves consistent with that of a premier fiduciary business, the company said. \nGemini added that it will hold in custody all bitcoin deposits, the majority of which will be held in its offline, multi-signature, geographically distributed cold storage system. \nGemini said all fiat currency such as U.S. dollars transferred to Gemini will be deposited in a New York state chartered bank, headquartered in midtown Manhattan, and eligible for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp insurance, subject to applicable limitations. It did not name the bank. \nBitcoin's value has been highly volatile, having peaked at over $1,200 in late 2013 before crashing after the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange. One bitcoin is currently worth around $238.17 on the BitStamp platform. \n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Editing by W Simon) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:24:33.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
