The Hong Kong exchange suspended trading shortly thereafter at the company's request.\nReal Nutriceutical \"has massively fabricated its reported revenues and profits,\" Glaucus said. \"Its equity is worth HK$0.00 and trading of its stock should be halted to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery for creditors,\" the report added. Glaucus said it is short the company's shares, meaning it will realize a profit if the share price falls.\nReal Nutriceutical's chief financial officer, Poon Yick Pang, said the company will issue a response to the accusations as soon as possible and has no further comment at this stage. Late in the day, the company said in an exchange filing it would soon release a clarification announcement.\nThe allegations are the latest in a string of accusations of financial irregularities leveled at Hong Kong-listed companies that conduct a large part of their business in China. Earlier this year, Hong Kong's market regulator suspended trading in solar-energy company Hanergy Thin Film Power Group Ltd. following a rapid rise in its share price and said it would launch an investigation. Hanergy's chairman subsequently denied wrongdoing.\nSo far this year, Glaucus has released reports on China LNG Group Ltd. and Ozner Water International Holding Ltd., saying their shares were overvalued. Shares in the companies have fallen 77.4% and 37.3%, respectively, since the reports were released. Both companies disputed the reports at the time.\nAccording to Glaucus's report, the company's actual revenues, as stated in government filings, were 84% less than reported to Hong Kong investors and regulators during the 2011-13 period. The short seller also said the amount of tax Real Nutriceutical paid didn't correlate with the net income it claimed to generate, according to local government rankings of taxpayers.\nGlaucus added that Mr. Poon previously was a finance director at China Medical Technologies, a company that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after the short seller issued a report into its activities.\nMr. Poon confirmed Thursday that he was a director of finance for China Medical Technologies, though he added that he was responsible for overseeing mergers and acquisitions while another colleague managed financial reporting.\nReal Nutriceutical, formerly known as Ruinian International Ltd., made its debut on the Hong Kong exchange in early 2010, with the backing of an impressive list of investors. CK Life Sciences International, controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) were among the company's investors years before it went public. Ruinian changed its name to Real Nutriceutical just over a year later.\nBoth GIC and CK Life Sciences sold part of their stakes in the initial public offering and, in the year after company's listing, cut their holdings below the level that requires disclosure.\nShares in Real Nutriceutical, which has a market capitalization of $252 million, more than doubled from its IPO price during its first eight months of trading, but have since lost nearly 90% of their value.\nEarlier this month, the company proposed a HK$328 million ($42.32 million) rights issue at a steep discount to its share price to repay debt and pursue acquisitions. The issue was underwritten by Haitong International Securities Co. and Furui Investments Ltd., a company owned by Real Nutriceutical's founder.\nWrite to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com and Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 22, 2015 08:25 ET (12:25 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:06:18.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
