Customers can now seamlessly and cost effectively expand legacy systems to operate within an ISONAS Pure IP environment. ISONAS will also be displaying their latest software addition, EasyWeb 2015 . This browser-based software allows users to manage their credentials and monitor access points in real-time across the globe.\nThe Secured Cities Conference will focus on issues that affect public safety and will bring together law enforcement professionals, emergency management, security and government officials to collaborate and discuss real-world solutions.
