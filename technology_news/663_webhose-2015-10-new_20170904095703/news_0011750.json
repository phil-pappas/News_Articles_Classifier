For now, though, EMC's data-center software subsidiary VMware Inc. may be a casualty of the deal's complexity.\nStock in VMware, which trades under its own symbol, dropped nearly 20% Wednesday after EMC said it would reorganize the two companies' cloud-computing offerings into a subsidiary named Virtustream, which is expected to go live early next year.\nEMC Chief Executive Joe Tucci said Wednesday in a conference call with investors that Dell wasn't involved in the decision to create Virtustream, but he acknowledged the market reacted poorly to the news. \"I could tell you that what I think didn't come across was that putting these together will actually save money and actually put more profit on the VMware bottom line,\" Mr. Tucci said.\nThe announcement came as a surprise to investors, who were already worried that Dell's acquisition would prove a distraction to EMC and VMware and that EMC's offer of a tracking stock linked to VMware's value would dilute demand for VMware equity. Adding to their concerns, VMware warned investors that operating margins would fall below analyst expectations next year, hurt in part by Virtustream's costs.\nThe reorganization of cloud assets was one curveball too many for investors, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \"You have so many moving parts, the last thing you want to do is a joint initiative that further crushes margins for VMware.\"\nMoreover, EMC for some time has been under pressure from investors to spin off VMware, creating uncertainty about the latter's prospects. VMware Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Chadwick said in a conference call with financial analysts on Tuesday that customer concern over VMware's future hurt its bookings in its most recent quarter.\n\"Although we expect the Dell acquisition of EMC will give rise to significant revenue synergies for VMware over time, we believe it is realistic to anticipate various disruptions in the near term,\" Mr. Chadwick said.\nVMware CEO Pat Gelsinger expects to realize $1 billion in revenue synergies as a result of the acquisition over the next few years.\nVMware stock closed at $55.42 on Wednesday, down 32% from its $82.09 price before The Wall Street Journal reported news of the Dell-EMC deal on Oct. 7.\nCreating a cloud-focused subsidiary wasn't a bad idea, said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS Group AG. \"The problem EMC has is how they're doing things, not what they're doing.\"\nLike other large sellers of corporate technology, the Hopkinton, Mass., company is trying to reinvent itself in the face of big changes in how companies buy technology. Companies are moving to cloud-based computing services such as those offered by Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., and when they do purchase storage systems of the kind EMC specializes in, they have been buying lower-cost systems that bring lower profits.\nEMC's quarterly results, reported Wednesday morning, underperformed analyst expectations. Profits for the quarter ended September were a penny below expectations at 43 cents a share, excluding certain items. Revenues were less than 1% higher than year-ago numbers, totaling $6.08 billion, below the $6.17 billion analysts had expected.\nEMC shares were hurt by the VMware decline and closed at $25.77, down 6.3%. When the acquisition closes, EMC shareholders would receive $24.05 a share in cash along with the tracking stock -- essentially shares in Dell -- that will be linked to EMC's 80% stake in VMware.\nWrite to Robert McMillan at Robert.Mcmillan@wsj.com\n 19:08 ET (23:08 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:06:32.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
