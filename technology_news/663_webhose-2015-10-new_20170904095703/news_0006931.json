That gain was later erased and the stock slipped about 3 percent. \nIntel said it had $3.11 billion in net income on revenue of $14.47 billion for the quarter that ended in September, down from $3.32 billion in profit on $14.6 billion in sales for the same period a year ago. \nThe Santa Clara, California, company said profit amounted to 64 cents per share. The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 59 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $14.23 billion. \nFor the current quarter, Intel said it expects revenue in the range of $14.3 billion to $15.3 billion. The mid-point of that range is $14.8 billion, or roughly in line with what analysts were expecting. \nIntel's business has suffered as consumers and companies are buying fewer PCs, while more people are turning to smartphones and tablets that use chips made by Intel's competitors. Intel said Tuesday that the division which makes PC chips saw a 7 percent decline in sales from a year ago. The unit had revenue of $8.5 billion. \nBut the company has seen more success in recent quarters with chips that it makes for bigger computers that run in corporate data centers and so-called \"cloud computing\" operations. That division had revenue of $4.1 billion, up 12 percent for the year. \nIntel shares have declined 12 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has dropped nearly 3 percent. In after-hours trading following the earnings report, its stock fell 99 cents to $31.05. \n\nElements of this story were generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
