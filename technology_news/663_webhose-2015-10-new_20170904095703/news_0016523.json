The statement read in part: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Haystack will suspend service in Boston this week until further notice in the hopes of engaging with the Office of New Urban Mechanics and local lawmakers to identify a modified approach to parking issues that can be supported by City Hall. BetaBoston reports city council members acknowledged in banning the app that Boston parking could indeed use some improvement and innovation. All those who spoke mentioned that the city could do something on its own to leverage technology to improve the parking situation in the city. Meyer faced the city council last week and said a move to prohibit the app would be a signal from the city against innovation. Mayor Martin Walsh has been critical of Haystack, which has been described on social media as a form of so-called “#JerkTech.” However, prior to the council’s vote Wednesday, there did not appear to be any rules on the book that would outlaw its use in Boston. On Wednesday afternoon, mayoral spokesperson Kate Norton issued a statement lauding the ordinance. From the start, the City of Boston expressed significant concerns about any app that would seek to privatize and monetize public parking space. The City Council shared these concerns, and the ban put forth today will protect the interests of the City, our residents, visitors, and businesses, as we seek to ensure equal and fair access to all our public amenities. The City can encourage innovation and undertakes new innovations every day, but we cannot allow for the equal and fair access of public ways to be diminished by private enterprises seeking to profit from or reserve public amenities they do not own or lease themselves, and have no right to profit from or reserve. We support City Council's efforts today, and commend Councilor Baker on his leadership. The Mayor intends to sign this into law when it arrives at his desk. The app, which began operating in Boston in mid-July with a ridiculous launch party , allows users to tell other users they are leaving a street parking space and accept payment in exchange for the spot. At its core, users are selling access to public parking, though Haystack CEO Eric Meyer has argued they are merely selling information about parking. That argument has limited merit , because users leaving a space do not receive payment until the other user has parked in their place. Haystack first launched in Baltimore last spring before expanding to Boston a month and a half later. Baltimore officials have not banned the app. One Baltimore city councilor says that’s primarily because they expect it to die on its own . Pay-for-access parking apps have struggled to gain regulatory traction in other cities. San Francisco has notably moved to shut down similar parking apps, including Monkey Parking .
