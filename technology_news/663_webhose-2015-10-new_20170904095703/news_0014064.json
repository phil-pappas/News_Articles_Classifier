Muhammad Razif Ahmad, General Manager of the JPA, said the cost to expand the facilities and capacity at the port was estimated at US$1.2 billion.\nHe added that the logic behind the development plan was to handle the surge in container volumes over the next 10 years.\nMuahammad Razif Ahmad said: “JPA and the management of PTP are always looking at how to further expand, develop and strengthen operations at the port from time to time.\n“Prospects for port operations in Johor are bright in the coming years with the massive development taking place, especially in the southern-most part of the state.”\nUnder phase three of the expansion, the port would see another three new berths of 1.5 kilometres in length built and be operational by 2018.\nThe Port of Tanjung Pelapas currently has 14 berths, which each measure five kilometres and started operations in 2000.\nMr Ahmad concluded that a long-term plan is in the works, which aims to continue developing the port until 2045 in order to make it one of the major cargo ports in Malaysia.\nIntra-Asian ports have been struggling to adapt to mega-ships recently, as their infrastructure is not enough to support the largest containerships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:32:07.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
