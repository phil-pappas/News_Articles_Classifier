Team effort, perhaps, too had something to do with it. Anyway, it is a half truth as on page 224 the author writes, ‘The change in the Planning Commission could not be implemented fully because its leadership did not demonstrate that it was committed to it.’ We have Arun Maira blaming his bosses for not letting him do the job for which he was hired. Obviously, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Manmohan Singh did not let him have his way. While Ahluwalia was a ‘reluctant reformer’, Manmohan Singh was totally ignorant of the good work the author had done. The author’s assessment is based on one incident. At the farewell meeting of the Planning Commission on April 30, 2014, Manmohan Singh asked him the same questions that he had posed in 2009 and to which he had replied in 2010 and the Prime Minister had approved of the replies. While giving the title Learning to Work Together to part three of his book, Maira perhaps did not have Manmohan or Montek in mind. The new part starts with an anonymous Quote: , ‘There are always three sides to every story: Your side, the other side, and the truth’. Going by Maira’s version, age was catching up with Dr Manmohan Singh and he would ask right questions but won’t remember the answers. It is possible the socialist lobby in the Congress stalled reforms, pursuing politics of populism or freebies to win elections. Manmohan Singh wanted the Planning Commission to be ‘an essay in persuasion’ and ‘not a writer of long reports’. A seven-year-old-grandson of the author also thought so. He tells his grandfather, ‘Don’t write more of those fat books... Do something!’ It is true, much time, effort and paper can be saved if the bureaucracy and academic learn the value of brevity, simplicity and clarity. Maira not only humours his grandson but also indulges himself in the book. Proud of his strong credentials — education at Sanawar, St Stephen’s College; a TAS (Tata Administrative Service) job and experience of running Tata companies — he is liberal with self-praise and expects the reader to admire him. The book opens with laudatory comments from big names. It includes a chapter on Malaysia where Maira sold Tata trucks, beating competition from Ford, Volvo, Nissan, Mitsubishi and, above all, Mercedes Benz. The chapter may not be relevant to the central theme of the book but the author perhaps could not resist the temptation to share the uplifting experience with the reader. Today when Tata Motors and Tata Steel struggle for profits, one wonders where all the TAS talent has gone! The author seems to feel a strong need to defend his choice of a corporate career. He keeps reminding the reader how he wanted to serve the country. The book’s essential worth is Maira’s first-hand experience in a government office, fighting odds to bring change and evolving models for transforming the Planning Commission. He explains in detail how to bring about change and how running a country is different from running a company. The 2014 elections saw corporate loyalties change. In about one year, the Modi charm has worn out a bit. Maira is critical of a former PM but avoids saying anything unpleasant about anything under the new dispensation. Not a word about the abrupt end of the Planning Commission which was done without thinking through an alternative. Even today it is not clear what role NITI Aayog will play. Will it summon CMs to approve state plans and make financial allocations?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:01:49.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
