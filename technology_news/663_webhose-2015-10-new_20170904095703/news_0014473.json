These proof of concepts are an industry first and demonstrate the creation of an industry wide software-defined infrastructure ecosystem in the making, which will be a highlight of the fall conference at NYU on November 4 th and 5 th . \n“Since their creation following our Spring 2014 Conference, the ONUG Working Groups have played an increasingly important role in the ONUG Community,” said Nick Lippis, Co-Chairman and Co-Founder of ONUG. “The ultimate goal of the working groups is to open what is currently a closed industry and drive product development to meet IT business leader requirements for open enterprise cloud infrastructure.” \nWith this in mind, the Virtual Networks/Overlays and SD-WAN working groups, which completed product feature verification testing earlier this year, will be conducting proof of concept demonstrations, with the participation of over 15 vendor companies. The focus of these demonstrations will be on showcasing the working group use case top requirements, functionality, integration, and operability as vendor companies collaborate to address market needs. \nAdditionally, within the working groups, ONUG has seen a growing user demand for automation and orchestration of network infrastructure, evidenced by the emergence of four groups focused on making the network more open and automated in its management: Network State Collection, Traffic Monitoring/Visibility, Automated Configuration, and SDN Federation/Operability Orchestration. As a result, these groups have organized around their common goals as part of the ONUG Open Networking Management Stack and will collaborate to present their work at ONUG Fall. This management focus is unique to ONUG and a direct reflection of the changing user needs as organizations transition toward open software-defined cloud infrastructure. \nStatus updates can also be expected from the NSV and Software-Defined Data Center Security Fabric working groups. \nRegister for ONUG Fall 2015 to engage with the ONUG Community at large. \nAbout ONUG \nONUG is the leading user-driven community of IT executives focused on leveraging the power of their engineering and procurement to influence the pace and deployment of open networking solutions. The ONUG Board is composed of IT leaders from Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Cigna, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, FedEx, Fidelity Investments, Gap, Inc., Intuit, JPMorgan Chase, the Lippis Report, Morgan Stanley, Pfizer, UBS, and Yahoo.
