Yet how often and how comprehensively they scan--and follow through with remediation--reveals a different picture, according to results of a new survey to be released by SANS Institute on October 28, 2015. \nThe results of the survey seem positive at first glance: 62% of respondents consider their asset identification and classification capabilities to be \"mature\" or \"maturing\" (meaning they are improving). But only 19% perform scans weekly, and 19% scan more frequently, resulting in only 38% of respondents meeting the current recommendations included in the CIS Critical Security Controls. \n\"Organizations institute scanning programs for a variety of reasons, including to comply with various regulations, reduce risk by reducing the attack surface, improve their abilities to identify assets and enhance visibility into their systems, to name a few,\" says David Hoelzer, SANS instructor and author of the survey. \"But those results only arise from continuous monitoring programs that include all of an organization's assets.\" \nOnly 88% of public-facing systems and 64% of public-facing web apps are included in respondents' assessment and remediation programs. \nHoelzer continues, \"In addition to not scanning the right assets frequently enough, organizations face the challenges of lack of trained staff, budgets and management support.\" \nResults show that continuous monitoring does improve risk posture. Those who could measure improvements from their continuous monitoring programs point to improvements in their overall risk posture as a result of their continuous monitoring programs. Top improvements include increased visibility into enterprise systems and infrastructure, improved ability to accurately detect and remediate malicious events, and reduced attack surface enabling fewer incidents or breaches. \nFull results will be shared during a Wednesday, October 28, 2015 webcast at 1 PM EDT, sponsored by AlienVault , Arbor Networks , HP , and Tenable Network Security , and hosted by SANS .
