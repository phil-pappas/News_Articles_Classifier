Application partners are ISVs that conduct testing, and validation on the HP OpenNFV Platform . \nClearPath Network’s CEO Cliff Young commented “ We are excited about our collaboration with HP, and becoming an OpenNFV Application Partner. ClearPath’s Virtual Services Platform (VSP) combined with HP OpenNFV components, address CSP requirements for scaling out embedded virtual network functions that enable game-changing offerings and true CSP transformation.” \n“ The HP OpenNFV Partner Program provides an open, proven and innovative NFV environment for multi-vendor collaboration and exchange between all contributors in the value chain ,” said Werner Schaefer, vice president, Network Functions Virtualization, HP. “ ClearPath’s virtualized CPE (vCPE) technology is complementary with HP NFV offerings, providing a highly efficient and customized platform for delivering and managing virtualized services for service providers. We are pleased to add ClearPath Networks solutions to our application portfolio, and already jointly pursuing NFV opportunities with major operators .” \nClearPath selected HP because of the complementary fit between ClearPath’s VSP vCPE platform and HP’s Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Platform and NFV Director’s Network Service Orchestrator (NSO) as well as its open NFV ecosystem. “ Together we can offer a highly differentiated, high-value vCPE solution for managed service delivery to SMBs, ” said Cliff Young ClearPath’s CEO. “ We are already pursuing a number of joint opportunities with major operators in North America, Europe, and Asia .” \nClearPath leverages NFV and SDN to virtualize and optimize vCPE, which in turn has dramatically altered the economics for managed services delivery, enabling a range of scale-out use cases that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive. ClearPath’s VSP vCPE platform enables CSPs to: Offer a wide range of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) from many vendors Customize vCPE services across a large number of end users Deploy VNFs from multiple vendors across diverse NFV infrastructure at the provider or customer facility Lifecycle Manage (LCM) VNFs, VNF configurations, and NFV containers \nClearPath has qualified its VSP vCPE platform to run on HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Platform and is currently integrating VSP with HP NFV Director NSO. The combined solution, which complies with the NFV Architectural Framework , exploits ClearPath’s unique NFV containerization, application-layer service chaining, and VNF LCM to enable personalized managed services delivery to millions of end users. \nNews Highlights ClearPath Networks was selected as an HP OpenNFV Application Partner focused on personalized, highly-cost effective vCPE ClearPath has integrated its VSP vCPE platform with HP’s Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Platform and is currently integrating VSP with HP’s NFV Director Network Service Orchestrator ClearPath and HP are already pursuing joint opportunities with some of the world’s most innovative operators \nAbout ClearPath Networks \nClearPath Networks is a pioneer in NFV containerization and a visionary leader in distributed virtual network function lifecycle management for network operators globally. \nFounded in 2002 and headquartered in California, ClearPath enables delivery of Virtualized Network Function as a Service (VNFaaS).
