This page allows drivers to see how the Kia vehicles that Carolina Kia sells compare to their counterparts from other manufacturers.

SUVs are compared to SUVs, compact cars are compared to compact cars, etc. One newly redesigned vehicle is the 2016 Kia Sorento, which has several popular competitors including the 2016 Hyundai Santa Fe and the 2016 Ford Explorer . Some aspects of the 2016 Sorento that appeal to customers the most include the passenger and cargo volumes, the affordable starting price, all-wheel drive capability and fuel economy numbers. \nAnother vehicle that has just received a makeover for the new model year that many drivers have been researching is the 2016 Kia Optima.
