The stock is up about 17 percent since the start of the year, outpacing the 1.6 percent rise in the tech heavy Nasdaq. Equinix works with some of the biggest telecom and technology names. ‘We deal with the Verizons (VZ) and AT&Ts (T) of the world, along with the British telecoms and the Deutsche telecoms,’ he said. ‘We deal with all of the biggest tech companies like Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT).’ Smith said the next few years will focus on helping enterprises unlock value in the cloud computing space. ‘We’re talking about big pharmaceutical companies, health care companies, big travel and transportation companies, plus oil and gas,’ he added. ‘We call these enterprise companies.’ In 17 years, the company has accumulated an impressive base of over 6,000 customers, but growth could soon soar.
