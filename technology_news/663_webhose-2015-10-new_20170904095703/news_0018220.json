The ShoreTel environment is fresh, easy-to-use and intuitive, and will provide us with the best foundation for our future communications needs,\" says Wayne Bajema, IT manager, The Salvation Army (Australia Eastern Territory). \n\"Telephony integration with our messaging and applications environment will improve how we do business. For example, when we deploy UC in our Salvo Stores contact center, our agents will be better able to use the smarts in our IBM Notes customer management system to manage calls,\" says Bajema. \nThe first locations for the new ShoreTel UC environment were deployed recently. Soon The Salvation Army will relocate to a new territorial headquarters in Sydney, consolidating up to ten current offices and providing additional space for future expansion. ShoreTel Unified Communications will be ready for head office staff when they move into their new office space, which has also been designed to support more flexible working practices. \n\"We want to give our staff the ability to work anywhere, and not necessarily be fixed to a desk. ShoreTel Mobility will support this activity-based working approach which will make sure that our staff have the opportunity to stay connected in the office, travelling or out in the field,\" said Bajema. \nHP has designed a hardware/software hybrid solution for The Salvation Army, based on ShoreTel Unified Communications, Enterprise Contact Center and Mobility products. The solution had to cater to specific functional requirements for the organization's headquarters and branch offices, contact center, retail stores and aged care facilities, all with mobility capabilities. The core of the UC system is virtualized and is in an active/active dual data center deployment, with one data center in Sydney and the other in Brisbane. All other sites that require resiliency (for example, aged care) have physical ShoreTel phone appliances. The Salvation Army's existing underlying network is an HP Networking Core with POE switching for all telephony connectivity. \n\"With ShoreTel, The Salvation Army (Australian Eastern Territory) is setting itself up for its long-term needs. The simplicity and modularity of the ShoreTel UC platform delivers what the organization needs today and enables The Salvation Army to easily take advantage of future technology developments, including the adoption of cloud applications and infrastructure,\" said Frederic Gillant, vice president and managing director, Asia Pacific, ShoreTel. \nShoreTel is continuing to build momentum in the Australian not-for-profit sector, with further growth expected in the sector for the next 12 months. \nThe Salvation Army was founded as the Christian Mission in the slums of London in 1865 by former Methodist minister, William Booth. It is celebrating 150 years as an organization this year and currently operates in 126 countries worldwide. The Salvation Army began operations in Australia in 1880. The Salvation Army Australia Eastern Territory, covering NSW, QLD and ACT, is headquartered in Sydney and its mission is to save souls, grow saints and serve suffering humanity. \nAbout ShoreTel, Inc. \nShoreTel, Inc.
