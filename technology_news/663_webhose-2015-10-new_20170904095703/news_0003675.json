Jerry Brown calls for major utilities to compete as an alternative transportation fuel source by installing thousands of charging stations where people live, work and play. State officials hope to see a big cut in greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging residents to fuel their cars and trucks with electricity — a move that environmentalists say will pit utilities against oil companies in the marketplace. While oil companies aggressively lobbied against the oil reduction provision in the bill, California's largest private utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — were among those pushing to boost the electric vehicle charging market. The oil companies did not oppose the goal of increasing electric power for cars but point out that the state has policies to diversify transportation fuels. Utilities plan to compete with private companies to install tens of thousands of new charging stations to diminish driver worries of getting stranded with a dead battery. Electric car drivers and building owners will pay for the electricity, but all utility customers will pay for the chargers through their bills. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:25:51.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
