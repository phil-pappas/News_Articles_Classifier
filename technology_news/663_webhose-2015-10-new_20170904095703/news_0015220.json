Seeing as services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video have become increasingly popular, it comes as no surprise that studios are deciding to profit on their own service. \n“This is the future, in many respects,” said Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive. “We’re seeing more and more opportunities to reach consumers directly and not through middlemen, and we’re seeing consumers wanting product in different ways.” \nThe service is set to launch in the UK next month, but will be rolling across Europe next year. As for a launch in the US, there are currently no plans, but Iger has said that they wouldn’t rule it out. \nAs for other Disney properties, such as movies produced by Marvel and Lucasfilm, won’t be included in the service, but Iger revealed that services dedicated to these studios could launch in the future. \n“There’s a general sense that the world is going in this direction,” he said. “There will be multichannel TV and we will be part of it, but the app experience offers many more layers (and) much more richness in content than a channel, where one program follows another program.” \nWhile £9.99 for a full-on Disney experience sounds like a pretty neat idea, having to fork out an additional fee for Marvel and Star Wars flicks does seem like a bit of a cash grab.
