Techradar | 08 October 2015, 2:40 PM IST Share We know Facebook has a ton of ambitions in the virtual reality space, but now Mark Zuckerberg also announced the social networks is looking to expand into augmented reality. At Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit, Zuckerberg confirmed his company is looking into the augmented reality, noting that \"it was father out.\" Other than making a quick acknowledgement of the possibility of augmented reality, the Facebook CEO and founder did not have much to say on the subject. While virtual reality is focused squarely on creating immersive entertainment experiences, augmented reality could lend itself to thousands of more practical applications in the real world. For example, AR could be implemented into the car windshields to provide a constant stream of directions, while a surgeon could have their patient's vitals displayed at all times. Virtual Zuck baby While Zuckerberg didn't provide much on Facebook's plans in the AR space, he talked at length about virtual reality. The Social Network creator noted VR could be the next big computing platform, which has evolved from text to photos and video in recent years. As an expecting father, Zuckerberg went onto explain how he hopes he can share his new born with his friends and family in a whole new way through VR. \"I'm really looking forward to being able to capture not just a photo but to really capture the experience,\" Zuckerberg said. He then added that they should have the ability to feel as if there there when they watch his child's first steps in a virtual experience. Of course, if you mix that sort of experience into real life you it might create an Ally McBeal scenario.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:23:33.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
