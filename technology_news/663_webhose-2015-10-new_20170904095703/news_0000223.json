(NYSE: ROP), has entered into definitive agreements to acquire both CliniSys Group Ltd., one of the largest European suppliers of laboratory information management systems (LIMS) and Atlas Medical, a leading provider of clinical process and connectivity solutions in the U.S.. \nThese acquisitions, combined with Sunquest and Data Innovations, expand Roper's portfolio of companies focused on diagnostic solutions excellence even further, creating a unique breadth of capabilities that support clinical testing processes and connectivity to systems, instruments and providers across the world. \n\"Our mission is to make healthcare smarter and patients safer.

Collaboration between Sunquest and CliniSys will not begin until formal approval is received. \n\"We have admired Roper's and Sunquest's growth and achievements in clinical solutions. Their market presence aligns perfectly with where we want to be on an international scale, and their passion for diagnostic solutions matches our own. We are excited and confident that this is the right move strategically for both our clients and employees,\" said Fiona Pearson, chief executive officer of CliniSys Group. \nAtlas offers clinical process integration and connectivity solutions. Atlas's LabWorks platform connects diagnostic testing facilities to their customers and enables smart ordering, dramatically improved test utilization, and results reporting.
