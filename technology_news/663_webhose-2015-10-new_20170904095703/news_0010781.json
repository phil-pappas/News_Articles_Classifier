The traders have been given two months to comply with the instructions, failing which the UT Estate Office would begin its process of issuing notices. Ever since the demolition drive carried out by the Estate Office in June, the issue of size of advertisement panel and location of installing AC units has been a point of contention between the UT Administration and the traders. After a fresh round of meeting between the UT officials and the traders, the Chief Administrator with the aim of restoration and renovation of Sector 17, the city’s commercial hub, the Chief Administrator fixed the size of advertisement panel at four-and-half feet and allowed the AC units at right angle to the corridors at the location of beams. All such SCOs have concrete facade. Besides, the traders and telecommunication companies have been asked to hide the cluster of wires in conduit pipes that can be fixed behind the concrete surface made to install advertisement panels. Kamaljit Singh Panchhi, president of the Chandigarh Traders Association, who was present in the meeting with the Chief Administrator, said the fresh guidelines were being communicated to the traders. The Estate Office should stop issuing fresh notices to the traders in the two-month period allowed by the Chief Administrator, said Panchhi. Architectural controls for SCOs with brick façade In August last, the UT had agreed towards giving a legal framework to incorporate changes in architectural controls for shop-cum-offices (SCOs) with brick facades in Sector 17 E.

A three-and-half inch parapet at the rear of the showrooms has also been allowed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:04:22.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
