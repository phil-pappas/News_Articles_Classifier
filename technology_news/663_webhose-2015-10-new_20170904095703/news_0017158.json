The device is the first on the Cell C network to offer this functionality, as well as the only that is commercially available in South Africa. \nAG Mobile CEO Anthony Goodman says that the embedding of Wi-Fi Calling on this handset aligns with the brand’s goal of offering consumers affordable communications via quality devices. “Our decision to partner with reputable companies such as MediaTek and Lydrasoft not only allows us to tap into their international knowledge and experience but enables us to effectively incorporate cutting edge technology which further enhances our user experience.” \nBrett Cassidy, vice president of sales for Lydrasoft maintains that its 3GPP Wi-Fi Calling product will further entrench AG Mobile as one of Africa’s leading ODMs. “We are proud to be associated with all these players and were incredibly impressed with the record turn-around time – just four weeks - on the device development and roll-out. Furthermore, I believe that this service will go a long way in helping Cell C differentiate itself from its competitors.” \nIn addition to networks such as Cell C, AG Mobile’s clients include retailers such as Ackermans, Edcon and PEP. Goodman continues, “With 20 years’ experience we pride ourselves in offering strategic insight and subsequently delivering effective solutions for our customers. Not only does Wi-Fi Calling support Cell C’s strategy to offer improved network coverage but it has huge appeal to users as it can save on call charges via select packages, and when using international Wi-Fi hotspots and networks whilst travelling.” \nWi-Fi Calling enables users to make and receive calls, and send and receive SMS messages seamlessly whenever they are connected to any Wi-Fi network or hotspot. Unlike VoIP (app to app calling) customers do not have to download an application or purchase calling credit - the service simply needs to be activated via their phone settings on the AG Style. This integrated service means that you use your handset’s regular dialer to make a call, access USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) or send a text message. Furthermore, unlike apps such as Skype, WhatsApp and Viber, Wi-Fi calling is linked directly to your number so your calls logs and sms message conversations remain uninterrupted using the AG Mobile Style. \nWith an Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system the AG Style’s features include: \n· MediaTek® MT6582 Quad-Core 1.3GHz Processor \n· 5.0” FWVGA IPS Smart Screen \n· 8MP rear camera Auto Focus with flash \n· 2MP front camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:39:51.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
