Smith & Smith has hired R2D2 as its new COO. The Gotham Times is proud to announce HAL 9000 as its editor-in-chief. The Terminator has been hired as the head of HR for Friendly & Company Inc. \nGet ready for the rise of the machines. Only this time, it's not science-fiction. \nThe respected research firm Gartner predicts that over the next five years the make-up of the world's workforce will dramatically change. With the proliferation of smart devices, high-speed connectivity and the cloud, Gartner anticipates a new version of the digital age where smart machines (aka \"robots\") will take on traditionally human jobs. \nIt’s all made possible by big data, the ocean of information generated by both people and computers as we all interact with each other, data that can be mined and turned into knowledge. Just as humans use knowledge to make decisions and take actions, computers loaded with artificial intelligence software can do the same. \nArmed with connectivity, vast databases, and software that can analyze millions of choices in milliseconds -- computers are more efficient than ever. The new generation of robots is more likely to be a piece of software rather than a hunk of metal. They are becoming more cerebral, less physical. \nSo how will this affect us humans? \nImagine going to work in your driverless car, receiving a performance review from your \"virtual boss\" and having your \"virtual assistant\" answer an email from a smart device that needs some help solving a problem. \nThat's right. Your future boss may be a piece of software and your future customer may be a smart device that calls for help whenever it needs something. \nEven as I type this article, there are already thousands of “robo-writers\" authoring articles and reports across the world. Within three years, analysts predict that over 20 percent of business content will be generated by machines. No profession will be exempt from this rising class of digital workers. \nAs a tech guy I think this is all pretty cool. Finding ways to make the world more efficient is what tech is all about. However, great debate is brewing on whether our quest for efficiency is going too far. \nWill your job be replaced by a piece of software? Could your new robo-boss fire you? Do we really want emotionless computers making subjective business decisions? \nRight or wrong, massive gains in efficiency will always push massive changes in society. The market rewards those that can do more with less. If R2D2 and C3PO can get the job done better, faster and cheaper than their human counterparts, corporations will be forced to make tough personnel decisions in order to compete. \nOur market economy has proven that competition is a good thing in that it forces people to innovate. If a robo-writer takes my job as a columnist I will simply have to become a better writer. The same is true for most any job. \nAs they say in sci-fi movies: Resistance is futile. Human workers will have to adjust to this brave new world. But let’s not forget we still control the debate -- and our own destinies. We should get to decide -- not the robots -- what the future looks like. \nJJ Rosen is the founder of Atiba, a Nashville computer support, programming , networking, web design, and web development firm.
