Founded by the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center, the Blockchain Alliance is comprised of a broad coalition of companies and other institutions that have come together to address public safety concerns about digital currencies and the blockchain. \nJason Weinstein, Partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and the former Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of cybercrime investigations at the Department of Justice, will serve as Director of the Blockchain Alliance. \nIndustry participants include the Chamber of Digital Commerce, Coin Center, MIT Media Lab's Digital Currency Initiative and developer Gavin Andresen, BitFinex, BitFury, BitGo, Bitnet, BitPay, BitStamp, Blockchain, Bloq, Circle, CoinBase, CoinX, ItBit, Kraken, Noble Markets, and Xapo. \nThe Blockchain Alliance is engaged with the Department of Justice, including the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Secret Service, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and plans to engage with other U.S. and foreign agencies as well. \nPerianne Boring , President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said, \"It's no secret that Bitcoin has perception issues, which is a roadblock to mainstream adoption. Having an open dialogue with law enforcement and policymakers will help reduce anxiety about this transformative technology.\" \nJerry Brito , Executive Director of Coin Center, said, \"We look forward to partnering with the other participating companies and organizations to ensure that the capacity of Bitcoin and the blockchain to benefit so many is not overshadowed by the potential for misuse by a few. Working together, we can promote an approach to enforcement and regulation that supports, rather than stifles, innovation.\" \nJason Weinstein , Director of the Blockchain Alliance and Partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP, said, \"The companies participating in this initiative are not only good companies, but they are also good corporate citizens. For the blockchain to thrive, the industry must work together to correct the misperception of bitcoin as the 'currency of criminals.'\" \nAbout the Blockchain Alliance: \nThe Blockchain Alliance is a nonprofit organization formed to serve as a public-private forum for the Bitcoin community and federal law enforcement agencies.
