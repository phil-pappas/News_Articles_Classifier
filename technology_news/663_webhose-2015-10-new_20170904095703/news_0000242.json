With its contemporary design and small footprint, the HI-SCAN 6040C fits easily into any entrance area. Its electronics and software can be easily upgraded to meet future security requirements and scan for new or specific threats efficiently. \nThe high quality of the X-ray images makes detection of potential threats simple and minimises errors. Intelligent image display functions support the operator by distinguishing between organic and inorganic materials on the screen. This is particularly important for the rapid detection of explosives, weapons, drugs, food or money. \nFunctions to check operational status during start-up and operation, give regular information on the overall condition of the unit and make it easy to use. Diagnostic systems provide operators and technicians with specific information for troubleshooting and help reduce downtime. \nHI-SCAN 6040C can be included in a complete security checkpoint by adding other detection technologies from Smiths Detection such as people-screening systems or trace detectors for explosives or narcotics. \nShan Hood, Vice President Product & Technology of Smiths Detection, said: â€œSecurity incidents in public buildings around the world demonstrate how vulnerable our society can be. Our new HI-SCAN 6040C X-ray inspection system is tailored to the security needs of buildings where large numbers of people come and go every day. The upgraded electronics and software ensure that it is prepared for both current and future security requirements. \" \nFor more information on HI-SCAN 6040C, visit: http://www.smithsdetection.com/index.php/products-solutions/x-ray-inspection/170-parcels-baggage/hi-scan-6040C.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:20:41.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
