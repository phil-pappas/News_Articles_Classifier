This practice started during World War I and is now a vital part of patient care. The Association of Air Medical Services estimates that in the United States there are nearly 400,000 rotor wing transports and 150,000 patients flown by fixed wing aircraft each year. Critical thinking and efficiency are key with all air medical service organizations and they’re continually seeking ways to improve methods and procedures. With the increasing use of “the cloud” for administrative processes, air transport companies are utilizing online software to increase administrative efficiencies and employee communication.\nLife Link III is a leading medical air transport company in Minnesota. Effectively scheduling 70 medical personnel at six bases on an online calendar became a daily burden. They sought a better method and found Aladtec - an online employee scheduling and workforce management system.\n“What was bad about the calendar was the inability to access it unless I was at a desktop computer. It was highly inefficient, created a lot of work and there was absolutely zero automation to it. Every trade and time-off request had to be entered manually. Having to allot that sort of time for simply scheduling was detrimental to completing our mission,” explains Nate Lebeck, Operations Manager/Critical Care Flight Paramedic, Life Link III, Minneapolis, Minnesota. “By switching to Aladtec I save at least 1 to 2 hours a day. Add that up, and it frees as many as 10 hours a week for me to concentrate on more important tasks.”\nSince Aladtec is a cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) product, it’s available 24/7 from any computer, smartphone or other mobile device via the Internet. The Life Link clinicians appreciate the option of using the mobile web application. “I use the mobile app because obviously I don't have to be at a desktop. Whether you're at work or at home, it's right there in the palm of your hand,” shares Phil Nicolas, Flight Paramedic, Life Link III.\nWith the implementation of Aladtec, Lebeck says everything has become automated. When a clinician is hired, their shift rotations are permanently placed in the system. The responsibility to make trades and request time off is up to the employee to make within the Aladtec system. Then, their supervisor can approve it, or not approve it, with just the touch of a button. Life Link III also uses Aladtec to schedule outreach events and ride along requests.\n“I really do like Aladtec. I don't say that about a lot of products but this system has really made my job much more efficient. I would absolutely recommend Aladtec to other organizations; it’s a very good fit for our industry,” Lebeck concludes.\nAbout Life Link III®\nLife Link III operates six helicopter bases serving patients in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota.
