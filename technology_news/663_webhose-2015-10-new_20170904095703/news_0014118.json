It is much more certain that global sea levels will rise every decade as glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt, possibly raising water levels by as much as two feet by 2050. \n\"Major storms, extreme tides and sea level rise can all pile on top of each other, and planners must consider a worst-case scenario when sea levels are high and a major storm hits at extreme tide. Though tides recede in hours and storm surge recedes in days, sea level will not go down for centuries. \n\"Like the proverbial tortoise that wins the race, rising seas will eventually have a much greater impact than the other two issues.\" \nYou can read Dr Becker and Mr Englander's insight into preparing for superstorms at the foot of this page.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:11:46.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
