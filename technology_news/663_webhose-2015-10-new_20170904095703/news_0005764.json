And the figures involved are pretty staggering. WSJ's Dipti Kapadia explains the scandal in numbers.

And, depending on what the US Environmental Protection Agency eventually finds, it raises the possibility of even more severe punishment. \nVolkswagen confirmed to The Associated Press on Tuesday that the “auxiliary emissions control device” at issue operates differently from the “defeat” device software included in the company’s 2009 to 2015 models disclosed last month. A Volkswagen Touareg diesel being tested. \nThe new software was first revealed to Environmental Protection Agency and California regulators on Sept. 29, prompting the company last week to withdraw applications for approval to sell the 2016 cars in the U.S. \n“We have a long list of questions for VW about this,” said Janet McCabe, acting assistant EPA administrator for air quality. “We’re getting some answers from them, but we do not have all the answers yet.” \nThere is no word yet as to whether this will affect Australian models that will be released with a 2016 build plate, but considering almost 91,000 cars are being recalled locally it seems likely.
