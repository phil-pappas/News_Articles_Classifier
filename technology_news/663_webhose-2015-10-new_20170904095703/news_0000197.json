Just because you have one company that has done well today doesn’t mean it’s going to reign supreme,” he said in an interview.\n“You have to be able to put innovation at the centre of your government policy. Because the future is going to belong to those countries that are constantly innovating. Canada has done it before, and can do it again.”\nKundra laid out his prescription for digital transformation in the capital as the federal Liberals celebrated their resounding election victory.\nHe said it’s an exciting time for Canada because a fresh government could initiate an era of technology-driven innovation that’s essential to creating jobs and keeping the country competitive.\n“You’ve just had an amazing election, and you have a leader who has in front of him the opportunity,” said Kundra, who resigned from the White House in 2011 and is now executive vice-president for the Silicon Valley-based cloud computing firm Salesforce.\nNear the end of the 11-week election campaign, several prominent technology entrepreneurs voiced frustration that no political party had outlined a vision for their industry.\nHowever, the Liberals ultimately committed $200 million annually for three years to help tech startups grow. They also promised $100 million a year toward an industrial research-assistance program, which encourages innovation in small- and medium-sized businesses.\nWhile campaigning, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau pointed out that Canada has fallen to 22nd place for innovation among leading countries, according to a report from the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.\nKundra said countries, including Canada, will fall behind without a policy framework that embraces the future.\nHe encouraged the federal government to examine technology expenditures, noting that within his first six months at the White House he implemented a crackdown on wasteful spending that saved the U.S. government $3 billion.\n“Are you spending that capital in the old world — on mainframes and mini-computers?” he asked. “Or are you spending that capital to create jobs of the future around data science and cloud and social and mobile?”\nOther high-tech initiatives the government should consider include designing policies to attract talent and venture capital and investing in “intelligent infrastructure” for cities, such as smart grids, he suggested.\nThe day after the federal election, the country’s largest high-tech association released a proposed agenda for the new government, urging a focus toward improving Canada’s low innovation and competitiveness rankings.\nThe Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance issued specific recommendations ranging from consolidating ministries for a new “minister of science, technology and business innovation” to committing 10 per cent of government procurement spending to startups.\n“We need 21st century leadership for improving Canada’s business innovation performance and this must begin at the political level,” said CEO John Reid in a release. “Now is the time to pivot to the future.”\nMore on thestar.com\nMcDonald’s Canada to stop using chickens raised with human-use antibiotics\nPrivacy, telecom competition among Trudeau’s tech policy priorities: Geist", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:19:33.625+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
