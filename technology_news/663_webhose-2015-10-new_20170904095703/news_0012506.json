Investors interpreted the minutes as further proof that US interest rates may remain on hold for the rest of the year.\nThe dollar was sold off and, after an early dip, gold gained.\n\"The dollar has been sold off a bit this morning in the wake of the FOMC minutes yesterday,\" said David Govett, head of precious metals trading at brokerage Marex Spectron. \"There are people looking ... and thinking as long as uncertainty is in the global economy and China, the Fed are going to have to hold off,\" he said.\nGold doesn't yield interest and competes more easily against assets that do, like Treasurys, when rates are pinned near zero. Like most commodities, the metal is priced in dollars and becomes cheaper to buy for those using stronger currencies when the greenback softens on views that interest rates will stay low.\nLooking ahead, gold's next move could be lower as caution takes hold of the market.\n\"As prices were already testing the upper-bound of [the $US1,110 an ounce to $US1,150 an ounce] range, there appears to be reluctance by traders to further buy gold, even with the dollar falling,\" Howie Lee, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures, said in a client note.\nAll the other precious metals were higher on Friday. Spot silver was up 1.7 per cent at $US15.936 an ounce, spot platinum was up 3.3 per cent at $US974.66 an ounce and spot palladium was up 1.5 per cent at $US708.10 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:16:24.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
