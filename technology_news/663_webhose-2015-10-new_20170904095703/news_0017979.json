GE shares closed at $25.47 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.\nGE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt told the Journal that while he disagrees with some of Trian's points, he is in accord with most. \"The repurchase opportunity is right in front of us,\" the newspaper Quote: d him as saying. ( on.wsj.com/1PegKOk )\nWhile Trian has some criticism of the company, both sides say they agree on most aspects of GE's current direction, which includes the sale of the majority of its giant financing arm. Trian has not requested a seat on GE's board, the Journal reported.\nThe U.S. conglomerate said in April it would seek to sell some $200 billion of its GE Capital assets as it moves away from financial services and focuses more on manufacturing jet engines, power turbines and other big-ticket industrial equipment.\nOver the past couple of years, Peltz has targeted DuPont ( DD.N ) and PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) among others, demanding board seats and asking them to separate their fast-growing businesses from the ones where growth had stagnated.\nPrior to the wave of activist campaigns during the last few years, companies often resisted the approach of activist hedge funds, thwarting their efforts to shake-up management or restructure their businesses. But the growing cash piles and clout amassed by activists have granted them more board access.\nReuters could not immediately reach Trian or GE for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.\n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)", "external_links": ["http://on.wsj.com/1PegKOk"], "published": "2015-10-05T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:35:28.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
