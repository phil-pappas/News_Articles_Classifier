Uber has struck partnerships with Shopify, an e-commerce company, and Clover, a payments processor, to integrate UberRush into their services and help businesses from restaurants to retailers use Uber for deliveries.\n“UberRush is now a business for Uber,” said Jason Droege, who oversees the program for the San Francisco-based company. “It is no longer an experiment.”\nUberRush is managed by local merchants who sell their products however they like -- on the phone, online or in person, but not through the Uber smartphone app. The merchants schedule the delivery with Uber, which fetches the merchandise and texts the consumer when the product is on the way.\nIn New York City, UberRush also includes a peer-to-peer element, allowing people to use the delivery service to get stuff to their friends. Uber isn’t expanding that feature outside of New York.\nThe product isn’t to be confused with UberEats, another Uber project. With UberEats, people can order designated food items through the Uber application. UberRush won’t advertise the products that it delivers inside Uber’s application.\n“Rather than you run out to run an errand, pick up food, go to a retail shop, etc., we can have all those products brought to you in a cost-effective, affordable way,” Droege said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:39:27.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
