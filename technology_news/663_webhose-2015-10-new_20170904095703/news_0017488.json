DocsInk, recently selected as a finalist for the NC Tech Awards in the Use of Technology - Health and Wellness category, has been gaining notoriety on the healthcare front for its innovative charge capture system. Their website states – “Give us 45 days and we will give you an average of 17% increase in revenue and 90% reduction in length of time it takes to get your bills out the door.” Partnering with ConXit allows DocsInk to expand into new markets of physicians and bring them this revolutionary product.\n“We are extremely excited to enter into such an ideal strategic partnership,” said DocsInk CGO Joe Purnell. “This will allow ConXit and DocsInk to collaborate with existing ConXit’s national client base that have been clamoring for a real solution to the physicians’ everyday needs.”\n“The geographic footprint ConXit will provide DocsInk is very exciting allowing for our continued rapid expansion into vital healthcare markets,” continued Purnell. “The new healthcare connected communities, for DocsInk, will create environments of positive healthcare disruption by breaking down those barriers that exist between the provider, patient and hospital while giving the doctors more time to spend on what really matters!”\n“A growing provider concern is how to maximize revenue without increasing workload,” said ConXit CEO Shawn Miller. “DocsInk’s mobile charge capture platform solves both of these problems.
