Michael Horn, President and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, has admitted he was made aware of \"a possible emissions non-compliance\" in early 2014 \nClaims emerged in media reports Thursday that the group had not only deliberately fitted the cars sold on the US market with the defeat devices, but had also intentionally sought to cheat tests in Europe by doing so with vehicles sold on the continent. \n\"In Europe too, Volkswagen effectively cheated on emissions in a systematic manner,\" newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung claimed, citing its own research in collaboration with public broadcasters NDR and WDR. \nIt added that \"without the cheating software, the affected cars would not have been authorised under the Euro 5 emissions regulation\". \nThe car group, which submitted its plans and timetable to bring vehicles to compliance to German authorities Wednesday, is planning to begin recalling affected vehicles from January. The logo of German car maker Volkswagen is seen at Northern Virginia dealer in Woodbridge, Virginia on September 29, 2015 \nBut it admitted that it would only be able to complete the refitting by the end of next year. \nThe group has set aside 6.5 billion euros in the third quarter over the affair, but that was only the estimated sum to cover repairs of affected vehicles. The cost of fines and potential damages arising from lawsuits is hard to calculate. \nIn the United States alone, Volkswagen faces up to $18 billion in fines from the Environmental Protection Agency, plus potential payouts from class action lawsuits and penalties from other regulators. \nAsked about the looming fines, Mueller said, however: \"Think about this: no one died from this, our cars were and are safe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:11:17.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
