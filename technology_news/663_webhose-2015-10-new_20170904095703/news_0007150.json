Each lecture is broken up into short, easy to understand segments focused on a particular theme. Learners can ask questions and receive answers, which are then visible to other learners, about the segments. \nUsers can also select an English phrase as a theme or share those expressions with others in an effort to develop a better understanding of the phrase or expression. Users can follow each other based on the themes they’ve chosen and lectures they’ve posted. Users can save their own expressions and lectures in an electronic notebook. \n\"More and more internet traffic is created on mobile devices, and language education can benefit by adapting to this new reality,\" said Mark Kim, founder and CEO of English on the Go, in a prepared statement. \nThe iOS version of English on the Go is available at the iTunes Store . Visit Google Play to download the Android version. About the Author \nJoshua Bolkan is the multimedia editor for Campus Technology and THE Journal.
