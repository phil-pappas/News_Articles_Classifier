The approval will allow the company to begin selling the product throughout Canada. MolecuLight i: X is a novel, handheld fluorescence imaging device that: Provides real-time visualization of bacteria in chronic wounds. Integrates into hospital acute care, home care and long-term care workflows. Allows clinicians to better analyze the bacterial condition of chronic wounds with no patient contact or contrast agents. \n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278744 ) \nFor the first time, clinicians will be able to visualize bacteria in chronic wounds, this is particularly important for patients in an immunocompromised condition where the signs and symptoms of high bacterial loads or infection are not present. The MolecuLight i: X enables clinicians to quickly, safely, and easily visualize and precisely target clinically important bacteria in and around chronic wounds, in real-time at the bedside allowing them to initiate targeted and precise treatment plans. \n'Canadian clinicians will now have a powerful new tool for more objective assessment of wound bacterial status and better antimicrobial treatment decision making' says Dr Ralph DaCosta , Founder, CSO and Director of MolecuLight. \n'This is a historic day for wound care, we will now be able to offer clinicians real-time diagnostic information about bacterial load at the bedside' says Craig Kennedy , CEO. \nThe MolecuLight i: X has proven its effectiveness in clinical trials in over 180 patients. Results have shown the MolecuLight i: X can improve sample quality, healing rates, screen for high levels of bacteria and detect wound subsurface heavy bacteÂ­rial load as well as subclinical local infection in patients. The device will impact how clinicians treat wounds as well as improve patients' quality of life. \nAbout MolecuLight Inc. \nFounded in 2012, and based in Toronto, Canada , MolecuLight Inc. is a privately-owned medical imaging company delivering fluorescence image-guidance solutions that provide clinicians with new information about wound bacterial burden for better diagnostic and treatment decisions.
