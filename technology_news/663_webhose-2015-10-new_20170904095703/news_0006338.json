The photograph caused social media to swoon on Tuesday over Canada's newly minted prime minister, Justin Trudeau.\nThe day after Trudeau's stunning victory over Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the global focus was not on the Liberal leader's promise to withdraw Canada from the combat mission against Islamic State, or his pledge to run a C$10bn annual budget deficit for three years to invest in infrastructure, but on the apparently universal agreement that he was not just good looking, but model handsome.\nThe photograph, one of many circulated online of a shirtless Trudeau on Tuesday, was taken at a weigh-in for a 2012 charity boxing match.\nThe election of Trudeau, aged 43, the son of one Canada's most famous Prime ministers, Pierre Trudeau, was seen as returning a touch of glamor, youth and charisma to Ottawa. Trudeau will become the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history and brings an appeal more common in movie stars than statesmen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:32:03.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
