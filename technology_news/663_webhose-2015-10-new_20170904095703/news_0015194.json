Sales of $504 million were down 6 percent (-4 percent organic, +2 percent acquisitions and -4 percent foreign currency translation) compared with the prior year period. \nGross margin of 44.3 percent was up 30 basis points from the prior year period, while adjusted operating margin of 21.5 percent was up 70 basis points from the prior year. \nAdjusted net income of $69 million decreased 3 percent from the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share of 89 cents increased 1 cent, or 1 percent, from the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of $130 million was 26 percent of sales and covered interest expense by almost 13 times, while free cash flow of $105 million was 132 percent of net income. \nThe Company repurchased 911 thousand shares of common stock for $66 million in the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $179 million. \nIDEX’s third quarter was highlighted by a solid 89 cents of adjusted EPS and 21.5 percent adjusted operating margins, a 70 basis point operating margin expansion from the third quarter of 2014. Our teams faced continued market headwinds, but executed by delivering strong margin improvement and $105 million of free cash flow. North American industrials slowed during the quarter, contributing to the 2 and 4 percent decreases for organic orders and sales, respectively. \nThe challenging third quarter demand environment means we now expect fourth quarter organic sales to be down 1 to 2 percent, with full year organic sales down 2 to 3 percent. Restructuring actions executed in the third quarter will provide incremental efficiencies going forward. In the third quarter, these actions cost $4.7 million, and the total 2015 cost is now expected to be in the range of $8 to $10 million. These are permanent cost-out actions and the full benefit will be realized in 2016. \nContinuing to deliver total shareholder returns is critical to our long term success. Year-to-date we have repurchased 2.4 million shares for $179 million, deployed nearly $200 million on three strategic acquisitions across three platforms, retired €81 million of European private placement notes, and, in the third quarter, divested our Ismatec business. This was a non-strategic product line in our Health and Science segment, which sold for $28 million, and resulted in an $18.1 million pre-tax gain. Additionally, the acquisition pipeline is very strong, and our free cash flow and debt capacity allows us to use the strength of our balance sheet for a steady, disciplined pace of acquisitions for the foreseeable future. \nFor the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range 88 to 91 cents and full year 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.50 to $3.53 with adjusted operating margins of 21 percent. This guidance excludes the charges from the restructuring actions in the second half of 2015, and the gain from the Ismatec divestiture.” Andrew K. Silvernail Chairman and Chief Executive Officer \nThird Quarter 2015 Segment Highlights \nFluid & Metering Technologies Sales of $212 million reflected a 5 percent decrease compared to the third quarter of 2014 (-4 percent organic, +3 percent acquisition and -4 percent foreign currency translation). Adjusted operating margin of 23.3 percent represented a 120 basis point decrease compared with the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to non-cash acquisition fair value inventory charges recorded in the quarter as well as lower volume. Adjusted EBITDA of $56.8 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.8 percent, down 70 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2014. \nHealth & Science Technologies Sales of $185 million reflected a 3 percent decrease compared to the third quarter of 2014 (-3 percent organic, +4 percent acquisitions and -4 percent foreign currency translation). Adjusted operating margin of 21.7 percent represented a 40 basis point decrease compared with the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to decreased volume. Adjusted EBITDA of $52.2 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.2 percent, up 10 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2014. \nFire & Safety/Diversified Products Sales of $107 million reflected an 11 percent decrease compared to the third quarter of 2014 (-5 percent organic and -6 percent foreign currency translation). Adjusted operating margin of 30.7 percent represented a 460 basis point increase compared with the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to gross margin improvements at the dispensing and fire suppression platforms driven by favorable mix within these platforms along with productivity improvements across the entire segment. Adjusted EBITDA of $34.6 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.3 percent, up 450 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2014. \nFor the third quarter of 2015 , Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 42 percent of sales, 40 percent of operating income and 39 percent of EBITDA; Health & Science Technologies accounted for 37 percent of sales, 33 percent of operating income and 36 percent of EBITDA; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products represented 21 percent of sales, 27 percent of operating income and 25 percent of EBITDA. \nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures of Financial Performance \nThe Company supplements certain U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics with non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics in order to provide investors with better insight and increased transparency while also allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the financial information used by management in its decision making. Reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics are defined and presented below and in no way are considered a substitute for, nor superior to, the financial data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics other than the items noted below. Adjusted operating income is calculated as operating income plus restructuring expenses less the gain on sale of a business. Adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income plus restructuring expenses less the gain on sale of a business, net of the statutory tax expense/benefit. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated as net income plus interest expense plus provision for income taxes plus depreciation and amortization; while segment EBITDA is calculated as operating income plus or minus other income (expense) plus depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus restructuring expenses less the gain on sale of a business. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures plus the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation. \nTable 1: Reconciliations of Reported-to-Adjusted Operating Income and Margin (dollars in thousands)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:30.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
