This includes increasing the broadband speed in rural areas from 5Mbps to 20Mbps. \nThe budget would also cover high-speed internet projects, undersea cable system and national fibre backbone infrastructure. What is missing is any changes to broadband pricing as demanded from certain groups and consumers. \nThe Budget 2016 also includes prepaid rebates for users based on the GST amount although some telcos have voiced their concern about the lack of details in the execution of this plan. What is certainly welcomed was the abolition of GST charge on prepaid card reloads effective on 1 November 2015. \nNo rebates or exclusion has been given to postpaid users, which may see an increase in prepaid mobile users in the coming months.
