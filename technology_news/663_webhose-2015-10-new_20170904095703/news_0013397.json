Given the scope of development opportunities in the Territory, we hope to invest a lot more.” \nAdam Giles, Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, said: “In Landbridge, we have a partner that has demonstrated an outstanding track record of investment and innovation that has underpinned remarkable growth, and with it new trade and jobs. \n“We are confident that Landbridge will bring a similar approach to the Port of Darwin, and bring the Territory the benefits of their position, networks and experience in Asia.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:39:07.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
