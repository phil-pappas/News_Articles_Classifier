Kshitij Anand | 15 October 2015, 1:57 PM IST Share NEW DELHI: Two Indian IT majors, TCS and Infosys, failed to cheer investors with their September quarter earnings this week. While the numbers were broadly in line, some even beat expectations, management commentaries suggested some bit of caution despite currency tailwind.While the September quarter is seasonally slow for most IT companies, yet the numbers had clear stamp of the challenges the industry has been facing: which is that growth in general is slowing down.\"One must take into account that some of the IT companies have lowered their revenue guidance for September quarter; some did it for the previous quarter as well,\" says Kunj Bansal, ED & CIO, Centrum Wealth.\"What has happened is that with the slow growth rate for the industry as a whole, obviously, valuations will also be trending lower in tandem with growth outlook. That is what the trend will be, going forward,\" he said.At 17.4 times, the IT sector is currently trading in line with its 10-year historical average of 17.1 times. However, it is trading at a 14 per cent premium to Sensex, well above the historical average of 5 per cent, Motilal Oswal said in a report.The S&P BSE IT index is up nearly 4 per cent compared with a near 2 per cent drop in S&P BSE Sensex so far in 2015. Going forward, experts see muted growth for the sector, and advise investors not to expect big-bang returns on the counter in the near future.It is no longer a sector where big money can be made. There is limited upside left in IT and investors will be better off investing in cyclicals, they said. \"Very clearly, a paradigm shift is taking place. The old model is changing, which will cost a lot. We might have a good quarter here and a bad quarter there, but fundamentally IT companies' structure will change over time and I do not want to be part of the change, at least for the next year,\" said Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Consulting.\"The big rally is over. Maybe you can expect 5 per cent-10 per cent from here on, but there is enough money to be made in the rest of the market. IT remains a good defensive sector, where you will not lose any typically big money. That is the way you should look at IT,\" he added. We have collated a list of five factors that will weigh on the IT sector in the near future: Pricing pressure likely to continue: India's top software exporters are under pressure to drop prices to retain contracts of top customers. Even though volume growth has picked up, but rates have fallen by double digits for some, say experts. \"If we look at the IT sector historically, in the last 15 years, it has grown at about 25 per cent CAGR. In the last seven years, i.e. from 2008 to 2015, it has grown at 14 per cent,\" says Sanjay Dongre, Fund Manager UTI Asset Company.\"Indian IT companies have long been able to leverage their low-cost or cost arbitrage model in the overall global software industry. But in the last one or two years, in spite of high utilisation and higher rupee depreciation, earnings growth has been decelerating. The main culprit is the pricing pressure, which the IT companies are witnessing,\" he said. Growth slowdown a concern: Industry lobby Nasscom has already projected slower growth for the IT sector. It has projected software export revenues to grow 12-14 per cent in FY16, down from 13-15 per cent in FY15. Tata Consultancy Services reported 3 per cent revenue growth sequentially in the September quarter at $4.2 billion. Even though Infosys reported 6 per cent sequential growth in revenues, it slashed dollar revenue forecast for the year to 6.4-8.4 per cent. Cross-currency impact to continue: Euro/GBP/AUD/CAD have all reacted to the US dollar by +0.5 per cent/+1.0 per cent /-6.7 per cent /-6.0 per cent, which is likely to have a negative impact of 50 to 80 bps on IT firms' dollar revenues. The rupee depreciated against USD/EUR/GBP by 2.4 per cent /3.1 per cent /3.6 per cent; hence, operating margins will have a tailwind of 50-80 bps, brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a report.Infosys highlighted that the cut in dollar revenue growth rate was a factor of currency movements. Ahead of its results, HCL Technologies said its Q1FY16 dollar revenues would be impact adversely to the tune of 80 basis points on account of a sharp depreciation of multiple currencies against the greenback.\"In the IT sector as whole, one should take into account the cross-currency gains that the rupee is making vis-a-vis most of the emerging market currencies. The rupee might be down 3 per cent to 4 per cent against the US dollar in the past couple of months, but it is up between 10 per cent and 20 per cent against most other emerging market currencies,\" said Piyush Garg, EVP & CIO, ICICI Securities.\"If some amount of top line comes from countries which is other than Europe and the US, then one should take that into account. Some bit of that also may be playing over in IT stocks and that is one of the things we saw,\" he said. Talent acquisition: The introduction of new technologies plays a major role in the industry. Many technologies which are coming up require workers to acquire new skills to effective execute the project. \"Attrition in low teen is good for Indian IT, as it helps restructure the cost structure and weed out underperformers,\" Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report. It expects attrition to pick up in FY15. Here's how the IT biggies performed in September quarter: TCS: Attrition rose to 16.2 per cent, which the company attributed to improving demand in the IT sector and seasonality, said an ET report. HR head Ajoyendra Mukherjee said the level had fallen in absolute terms and would decrease in the third and fourth quarters. Utilisation dipped marginally to 86 per cent, excluding trainees.Infosys: While quarterly standalone attrition fell marginally to 14.1 per cent, consolidated annualised attrition rose to 19.9 per cent during the September quarter, said an ET report. Utilisation, including trainees, dipped marginally to 75.4 per cent on a sequential basis. Excluding trainees, utilisation rose to 81.3 per cent, though this level is still far behind than that of Tata Consultancy Services. Brokerages lower target prices: Some of the top global brokerage firms have turned neutral on Infosys, while one of them has downgraded the stock to 'sell'. Goldman Sachs remains 'neutral'' on the stock and pointed out that growth for the IT major has largely deteriorated in the second half in the past five years, despite a strong start to the year.UBS recommends a sell rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 810, while CLSA and BofA-ML have buy recommendations. Most of the foreign brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Macquarie remain mixed on their outlook for India's largest IT services exporter, TCS, after its September quarter results.Factoring in slower Q2FY16 revenue growth, some brokerages have slashed their FY16 dollar revenue growth forecast to below 9 per cent. \"The TCS stock is fairly priced and we have a 'hold' rating on the stock. Lower Q2FY16 revenue growth and demanding CQGR lead us to cut our FY16E dollar revenue growth from 11 per cent to 8.4 per cent (required CQGR 2 per cent),\" Edelweiss said in a report.\"We believe TCS' industry-leading growth will be challenged going forward and its margin levers are lower for positive surprise. We maintain hold rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,480,\" the report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:10:14.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
