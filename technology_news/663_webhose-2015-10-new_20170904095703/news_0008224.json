Lam says it will book $250 million in annualized savings within two years. \nThe buyout was announced during a round of heightened acquisition activity in the semiconductor sector. Western Digital Corp. is reportedly in talks to buy SanDisk Corp. Similar media reports have said SanDisk was in talks with Micron Technology Inc. \nLast week, Dell said it is buying data storage company EMC Corp. for $67 billion, marking the largest deal ever between two technology companies, eclipsing Avago Technologies' proposed $37 billion acquisition of rival chipmaker Broadcom announced five months ago. \nShares of KLA-Tencor jumped $9.99, or 18.6 percent, to $63.85 in premarket trading while Lam Research shares slipped $1.01, or 1.4 percent, to $69.02. Both companies are based in California. Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:15:36.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
