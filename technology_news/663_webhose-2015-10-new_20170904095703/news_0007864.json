Located off I-94 near State Street, the facility is Exotic’s second major expansion in Metropolitan Detroit in less than a year. The Ann Arbor Parker Store will offer hoses, couplings, and fittings for hydraulic, pneumatic, industrial and mobile applications—with a special emphasis on the needs of the region’s unique science, technology, and engineering-based companies. “The robust growth of Exotic’s customers in Washtenaw, Livingston, and Wayne counties played an important role in the decision to expand to Ann Arbor. For over 50 years we’ve been a valuable resource to customers in a diverse mix of industries from automotive manufacturing to semiconductors. That longevity enables us to provide an extensive inventory, specialized services and real-world experience,” said Steve Orlando, Vice President of Sales and Marketing. The area’s growing position as a center for research and development has generated demand for some of Exotic’s more specialized product offerings, including Parker’s chemical and laboratory tubing. “We picked Ann Arbor because it presents an opportunity for us to provide a more specialized mix of products and services to our customers,” said Tom Marino, President of Exotic Automation & Supply. “Add in the area’s top-notch colleges and universities plus the recent, robust growth of our customers in Washtenaw, Livingston, and Wayne counties, it was a clear win-win for us—and our customers,” Mr. Marino said. In addition to on-site tube bending and flaring, the company is also among the few who are able to offer both certified CNG and LPG vehicle conversion solutions along with a 24-hour mobile hose installation and emergency repair service, the Hose Doctor. “We’re proud to bring our Hose Doctor capabilities to the Ann Arbor location. It means customers will have emergency back-up for those unexpected incidents. The result is we’re offering around-the-clock service and support for customers throughout Washtenaw, Livingston and Wayne counties,” Orlando said. The Ann Arbor Parker Store is located at 3934 Varsity Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 . Call 734-794-2460 for more information. For a full list of all of Exotic’s Parker Stores in Michigan, click here .
