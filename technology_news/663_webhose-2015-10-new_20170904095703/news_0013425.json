It added that a wreath had been placed on the wreck of the fishing vessel, which sank on April 18 and is lying 375m below sea level.\nThe navy said 118 bodies had been recovered since the operation started in June. The same tally was communicated in a previous statement from September 7, suggesting that over the past weeks no more bodies could be recovered.\nAccording to survivors' accounts, the boat had more than 800 people on board, many of whom were locked inside its hold. In the immediate aftermath of the shipwreck, rescuers found 24 bodies floating at sea and 28 survivors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:16:52.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
