Bloomberg by Brian Womack Yahoo! reported sales that fell short of analysts' estimates as a turnaround effort led by chief executive Marissa Mayer enters its fourth year without significant growth.\nThird-quarter sales, excluding revenue shared with partner websites, was $US1 billion ($1.4 billion), missing analysts' average prediction of $US1.02 billion. The 8.3 per cent decline from a year earlier was the biggest quarterly drop in revenue since 2009. Profit, excluding some costs, was US15c a share, the company said on Tuesday, compared with the analysts' average estimate of US16c.\nYahoo, facing competition from larger rivals such as Google and Facebook, is failing to hold onto market share in key areas such as mobile advertising. The company's slice of US ads on wireless devices is set to fall to 2.4 per cent in 2017 compared with 3.3 per cent last year, according to EMarketer, despite new products and services for tablets and smartphones.\n\"She's focused on product, but nothing material has come of it,\" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B Riley & Co, said of Mayer. \"I don't see anything out there that changes the game.\"\nWhile Mayer tries to drive a reversal for the company she took over in July 2012, investors have been most interested in Yahoo's roughly 15 per cent stake in Alibaba Group Holding , now valued at about $US27 billion. Yahoo said last month it is on schedule to spin off the Alibaba shares, which make up a majority of the Web portal's stock valuation, in the fourth quarter.\nThe company also announced it had reached an agreement with Google providing Yahoo with additional flexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads. Google's offerings complement the search services provided by Microsoft, which remains a strong partner, as well as Yahoo's own search technologies and ad products.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:24:02.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
