Slovenia matters.\nOn Saturday, 5,000 people poured into the tiny country after being forced west, extending the journey for refugees seeking passage to Austria, Germany, or elsewhere. Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar announced he would dispatch the army to aid police in dealing with the sudden influx.\n“We are going to focus even more on safety and security and order so our country can function normally,” Cerar said. “If destination countries begin adopting stricter measures at the border, Slovenia will follow suit.”\nOne key difference between Slovenia’s approach and that of Hungary, which saw nearly 400,000 people pass through it this year, is that it will be registering the refugees. Government officials say they can only allow 2,500 people to enter each day and won’t accept new arrivals until the previous ones leave.\n“This could leave thousands stranded in Croatia and further east and south in Serbia and Macedonia - the countries on the so-called Balkan migrant corridor,” the AP noted .\nWith winter approaching and countries bargaining to clamp down on the flow of refugees, the pace of migration may quicken before it slows. The same goes for the tragedies as well. On Saturday, twelve people, including four children and an infant, drowned off the coast of Greece while trying to reach Lesbos.", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-new-migrant-route-slovenia-20151017-story.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/viktor-orban-hungary-refugee-crisis_5601b038e4b0fde8b0d021e3", "http://www.dw.com/en/hungary-seals-external-schengen-border-with-croatia/a-18787298", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/15/us-europe-migrants-germany-turkey-idUSKCN0S90N520151015g", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34559419", "http://www.smh.com.au/world/twelve-refugees-including-children-drown-as-boat-sinks-off-turkish-coast-20151017-gkbs83.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:06:37.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
