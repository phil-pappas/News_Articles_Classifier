An acquisition executive at the command would carry out that job, with the power to work with the military services on joint acquisition projects. The bill caps the command's annual acquisition spending at $75 million from fiscal 2016 to 2021. \nThe legislation also stipulates that the Defense secretary can respond to a cyberattack by designating a senior official to quickly acquire supplies and services needed to mitigate the effects of an attack, with the goal of awarding a contract within 15 days. \nNDAA tasks the Defense secretary with assessing how open standards are applicable to DOD's procurement of IT and with briefing the Senate and House Armed Services committees on the subject within a year of the legislation's enactment. \nThe IT Industry Council's IT Alliance for Public Sector has praised earlier versions of the House and Senate bills as business-friendly. ITAPS has suggested replicating the bills' measures for developing the defense acquisition workforce across government. \nThe Senate passed the bill with a veto-proof majority while the House did not. \nAt an Oct. 7 press conference, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Obama was misguided to threaten a policy bill when the president's real objection should be with the defense appropriations bill. \nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) echoed McCain's argument, saying: \"Why not get this done, at least show the world that our political institutions can function for our own national defense?\" \nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated Obama's veto threat on Oct. 7 over what the White House has called the bill's \"gimmick\" of using $38 billion in overseas contingency operations funding to skirt mandatory spending caps. Gross tapped for CIO post at FDIC \nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation appointed Lawrence Gross Jr. to be CIO. He is an IT manager with more than 25 years of combined federal and military service in progressively more responsible technology-related positions. \nMost recently, Gross served as CIO at the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency. He was also a deputy CIO at the Interior Department and associate CIO at the Treasury Department and has worked in IT areas at the Energy Department, Justice Department and Navy. White House celebrates the Challenge.gov anniversary \nThe White House celebrated the fifth anniversary of its innovation-seeking Challenge.gov program by unveiling nine new federal agency challenges and 14 nongovernmental challenges. \nThe prize-driven initiatives seek to address pressing local, national and global challenges, with a purse of prize money for successful innovators. \nIn the past five years, agencies have collaborated with more than 200,000 problem-solvers -- including entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and students -- in more than 440 challenges on topics ranging from accelerating the deployment of solar energy to combating breast cancer and increasing resilience after Hurricane Sandy. \nThe nine new federal challenges include efforts to commercialize NASA technology, help students navigate their education and career options, and protect marine habitats. \nThe White House also said the General Services Administration and NASA can provide mentoring support for agencies interested in conducting their own challenges. NASA and GSA have trained more than 2,000 agency employees to create and run prize competitions through workshops and online resources.
