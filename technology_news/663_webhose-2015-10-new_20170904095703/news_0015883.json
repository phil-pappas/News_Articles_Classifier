But in recent quarters, it has shown an ability to turn a profit, too.\nRevenue jumped 23 percent during the quarter, helped by strong sales of electronics and general merchandise, a good sign for the Seattle retailer ahead of the crucial holiday months of November and December, when retailers make a substantial percentage of their annual sales.\nPrime Day, Amazon's 20th-anniversary sale in July, boosted revenue by 2 percentage points, the company said. Amazon did not break out sales figures. The company also said that more people signed up for a free trial of Prime on that day than any other day ever. And it said people converted to the paid program at the same rate they do on major shopping days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the busy shopping days after Thanksgiving.\n\"Prime growth is fueling Amazon (in) getting a bigger share of the household budget,\" said Cowen analyst John Blackledge. He estimates there are about 38 million Prime members in the U.S.\nAmazon Web Services sales jumped 78 percent to $2.09 billion.\nAmazon Web Services is the biggest player in delivering Internet-based services for other companies. It has many times the business of its closest competitors, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM and Salesforce. There have recently been casualties in the cut-throat space, with HP announcing it was shutting down its HP Helion public cloud.\n\"Amazon Web Services is a significant part of the business, and the consistent release of new products and features leads us to expect dramatic profit growth in the coming years,\" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.\nAmazon had net income of 17 cents per share. The average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for a loss of 10 cents per share.\nThe online retailer posted revenue of $25.36 billion in the period. Thirteen analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $24.85 billion.\nFor the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $33.5 billion to $36.8 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected revenue of $35.2 billion.\nAnalysts said the strong quarterly results point to a happy holiday season for the retailer.\nStifel analyst Scott Devitt said Amazon's large and rapidly growing Prime membership base should help retail sales, while the strong cloud-computing business \"should continue to benefit from greater scale and innovation.\"\nAmazon shares have risen 81 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has stayed mostly unchanged. In the final minutes of trading on Thursday, shares hit $563.18, a rise of 80 percent in the last 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:01:17.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
