The excellent manual could be used to assist if necessary.”\nIn awarding this recognition, AV-Comparatives assessed all aspects of G DATA’s Antivirus Business including software installation, program execution, defense against unauthorized access, malware alerts, protection software, and the level of knowledge needed for the product to run efficiently.
