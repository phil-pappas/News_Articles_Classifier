The service area stretches more than 200 miles and encompasses the academic communities of Oxford (University of Mississippi) and Starkville (Mississippi State University). \nAt the request of the commissioner's office, MaxxSouth Broadband provided Pai a tour of its optical line terminals and related infrastructure that supports the company's fiber-to-the-home deployments in the Mississippi cities of Carthage--approximate population 5,000--and Starkville--approximate population 24,000. \nBy transmitting data as laser light waves over thin strands of glass, fiber-to-the-home networks provide more bandwidth and the capacity for advanced video, Internet and phone services. \n\"We know that Commissioner Pai is focused on ensuring high-speed access for similar towns across the country,\" Kahelin said. \"It's a huge compliment that MaxxSouth Broadband could serve as a role model for getting the job done right.\" \nMaxxSouth Broadband is a subsidiary of the diversified media holding company Block Communications Inc. The Toledo-based company has a 114-year history in the communications industry and an extensive background in modernizing cable systems to all-digital platforms and enhancing service options. \n\"MaxxSouth Broadband has quickly become a prominent example in the industry because of its ability to provide fiber-to-the-home service at affordable pricing,\" said Block Communication CFO Jodi Miehls. \"It's easy to see why the FCC has taken notice of MaxxSouth's investment to upgrade services for all of its customers.\" \nJust last month, MaxxSouth Broadband launched its state-of-the-art fiber data network in Starkville. The system overhaul replaced outdated transmission wires with a fiber-optic connection made directly to the home, providing customers with Internet speeds of up to 1 Gig. \n\"The investment in our community is tremendous and it will do wonders for our citizens,\" Starkville Mayor Parker Wiseman said earlier this year when the new network was announced. \"Thank you to MaxxSouth for the risk you have been willing to take on us.\" \nMaxxSouth Broadband also made headlines recently for developing a first-of-its-kind regional sports network. The channel provides live, high-definition coverage of high school and community college athletic events, as well as games from community sport leagues--an unprecedented initiative for a local cable provider. \nAbout MaxxSouth Broadband: Operating as a subsidiary of the media holding company Block Communications Inc., MaxxSouth Broadband's service area for video, high-speed Internet and digital phone stretches more than 200 miles and includes 60 communities throughout 20 counties in northern Mississippi and Alabama.
