(PRWEB) October 13, 2015 AxioMx Inc. , a leader in the development of high-quality recombinant antibodies, today announced that it has received a Phase I Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant (1R43GM112204-01A1). This Phase I award, which will be administered by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), will fund the development of a technique to rapidly convert single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) to full-length immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules, the most common form of antibody used in research today. AxioMx creates custom antibodies by screening a library of more than 10 billion different antibody fragments (scFvs) to identify binders to a target antigen. Although the use of scFvs in this process is simple and efficient, the molecule is in a different format than IgGs found in nature. “Although some of our customers prefer a scFv as their deliverable, many others request IgGs,” said Chris McLeod, president and CEO of AxioMx. “We are currently quite capable of accommodating this request; however, the funding we have received will support implementing a new method that can convert scFv antibodies into IgG molecules quicker and at lower cost than any other technique available.” “The beauty of this method is that it allows bacteria to perform all of the steps that previously required multiple hours of human labor,” said Michael Weiner, Ph.D., chief scientific officer and founder of AxioMx.
