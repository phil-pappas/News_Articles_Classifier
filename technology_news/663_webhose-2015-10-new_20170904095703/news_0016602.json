(NASDAQ: SYNA ) www.synaptics.com . \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information In evaluating its business, Synaptics considers and uses net income excluding share-based compensation, change in contingent consideration, and certain non-cash or non-recurring items as a supplemental measure of operating performance. Net income excluding share-based compensation, change in contingent consideration, and certain non-cash or non-recurring items is not a measurement of the company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income. The company presents net income excluding share-based compensation, change in contingent consideration, and certain non-cash or non-recurring items because it considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance. The company believes this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences in net income caused by the existence and timing of share-based compensation charges, change in contingent consideration, and certain non-cash or non-recurring items. Net income excluding share-based compensation, change in contingent consideration liability, and certain non-cash or non-recurring items has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's GAAP net income. The principal limitations of this measure are that it does not reflect the company's actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its net income and net income per share. \nForward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
