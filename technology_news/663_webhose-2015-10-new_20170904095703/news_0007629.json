Anthony Johnson Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Like many contractors, Laing O'Rourke is chasing public infrastructure work. Leaping into second place on the recent HIA-Cordell Construction 100 list shows it's succeeding.\nThe Australian arm of the UK company that built the facilities for the London 2012 Olympics is now deploying those smarts on Australia's largest regional infrastructure project, the Pacific Highway Upgrade.\nAlong with partner Parsons Brinckerhoff, it is effectively partnering with NSW Roads & Maritime Services to manage the $4.4 billion last section of the highway upgrade. As a result, the private-sector involvement on the final 155-kilometre section, which upon completion in 2020 will connect Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane for the first time with a continuous dual carriageway road, comes at the very beginning of the project, much earlier than under the usual procurement timeline.\n\"The government's set itself some pretty stretching targets about being able to get that delivered in a time scale and get it operational,\" managing director Cathal O'Rourke told The Australian Financial Review . \"If they followed more traditional procurement models, they'd have had to go into an internal development phase on that for a good period of time – probably a year – which erodes that.\"\nComplex: the Moorebank Units Relocation project by Laing O'Rourke Supplied Under the so-called Delivery Partner model, the Pacific Complete consortium will manage much of the initial design that the public-sector client would typically manage before bringing the private sector on board.\n\"We've been able to ... come in as a private-sector party, drive the concept design a lot quicker and get certainty around where we're heading, both in terms of time, outcome and cost,\" Mr O'Rourke said. \"And then work with them very collaboratively to drive innovation. So it gets access to very early-stage engagement from the private sector to try and drive those efficiencies.\"\nThere are some obvious safeguards. Companies in the consortium that packages and procures the work don't generally deliver work themselves, to reduce the scope for conflicts. But the model requires the client to hand over much of its day-to-day responsibility.\nProcuring better is crucial as Australia gears up to plug the $700 billion-odd deficit between the infrastructure it has and what it needs. The Productivity Commission 's report into infrastructure last year advocated better up-front planning on projects. The Defence Department , the biggest public buyer of construction work, is promoting so-called integrated project delivery, which also includes the private sector earlier in the process.\n But the growing collaboration and the use of computer-generated 3D models pose challenges for companies as both change their potential liability for faults that may arise.\nMr O'Rourke dismissed the concern. \"The counter to that is probably true that there's enough experience of where it goes poorly that we should be looking to explore other options,\" he said. \"There are ways to work that through. You've just got to be willing.\"\nThe contractor is counting on greater use of technology to give it the edge in winning more infrastructure work, such as the $350 million redevelopment of Sydney's ANZ Stadium , as resources-based work dries up. In February, Laing O'Rourke's $215 million contract with Samsung at the Roy Hill iron ore project was cancelled .\nThis month it will complete the $870 million Moorebank Unit Relocation for the Defence Department on time and under budget due to the client's willingness to involve them as contractor at an early design stage – although not as early as the Pacific Highway project – and the use of building information modelling technology.\n\"Through collaborative working we managed to set the budget, set the timeline and achieve that,\" Mr O'Rourke said. \"It actually came in under budget and returns money back to them. So you can get great outcomes when you do it. What you need is a brave customer.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "http://www.brw.com.au/p/professions/envious_tackle_the_the_australia_f319RFVupRI1T8Q2ssTwUJ", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-10-04T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:20:55.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
