If you find it hard to believe, then let’s meet OnePlus Two and Motorola Moto X Play as they battle for supremacy in the $300 price range. - Advertisement - \nHere’s a little bit of lowdown on both of them. OnePlus is kind of unique actually, where else can you find a manufacturer going through an entire year producing and selling just one device? OnePlus One was dubbed the flagship killer for 2014 as it shook the world with great specs and relatively low price against others in the flagship space. Going by the mantra Never Settle, startup company OnePlus shook the world last year and is currently aiming to do even better in 2015. \nThe Motorola Moto X Play has already been out in the market for more than a month now, but it feels like it didn’t get the attention that it deserves. And who in their right mind would call the Moto X Play a mid-range device? Because it certainly feels more like a flagship instead. To put things into perspective, Motorola has different lineup for different categories. They have for us Moto E for the entry-level, Moto G for the mid-range, and Moto X is catering for the high-end segment. \nNow let’s get started shall we. OnePlus Two has a dimension of 152.9 x 75.9 x 8.9 mm (6.02 x 2.99 x 0.35 in) and 166 g (5.86 oz) which is a tad heavier compared to its predecessor but having the same dimension overall. It has the resilient aluminum and magnesium alloy frame and stainless steel which makes for a sleek metal design. Durability and sophistication with an unrivaled premium feel. \nWith easily interchangeable covers that make it stand out. This time around, it will have even more colors to choose from and is highly customizable. Go on and make your phone unique in your way of styling. \nAs we move on to Moto X Play, it has a size of 148 x 75 x 10.9 mm (5.83 x 2.95 x 0.43 in) and weighing in at 169 g (5.96 oz). Certainly not thin but comparably is still lightweight. Talk about customization on the OnePlus Two, this device goes one step further in personalizing it for the users. With the Moto Maker, you can choose the soft-grip back and metal accents in your favorite colors or dress it up even more with a premium leather or real wood back. Or you can even engrave your name on the back so that people would know the rightful owner. \nThe OnePlus Two might be thinner and lighter, but the customization options found on the Moto X Play and the Moto Maker feature totally blows it away. \nAs we move on to the screens, we have the OnePlus Two sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD LPTS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. It also comes with a fingerprint sensor for authentication and unlocking purposes. Then there’s Gorilla Glass 4 for a little bit more extra protection than the normal. \nWhereas on the Moto X Play, there’s the 5.5-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density. In terms of protection, there’s Gorilla Glass 3 instead. But the best part is that it has a layer of nano coating which repels water and comes with IP52 certification. Spills, splashes or rain, will no longer ruin your day. \nThe screen looks nicer on the OnePlus Two with its rich LPTS technology and the fact that it comes with a fingerprint sensor highlights its flagship level. But when it comes to protection, the Moto X Play has the extra comfort of being able to withstand a bit of punishment from water, though. \nPerformance-wise, we can find the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-Core processor made up of Quad-core 1.56 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics and either 3GB or 4GB RAM on the OnePlus Two. \nMeanwhile for Moto X Play, we can find it with the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset paired with an Octa-core processor that is made up of Quad-core 1.7 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 405 graphics, and 2GB RAM. \nHere is where we can see that the OnePlus Two has the much higher raw processing power and should excel better in multitasking, thanks to its higher amount of memory. - Advertisement - \nAs for the camera side of things, the OnePlus Two has the 13MP-5MP camera setup. Feature-wise, it has 4128 x 3096 pixels, optical image stabilization, laser autofocus, dual-LED flash, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, and HDR. \nThe Moto X Play totally wins in this department thanks to its very highly-rated 21MP-5MP camera setup. The 21 Megapixel primary camera has a whopping 5248 x 3936 pixels, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED (dual tone) flash and the standard geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, and auto-HDR. You will be able to capture fast-moving pics with its auto-focus, and the pictures will look even more natural with the color-adjusting flash. \nOnePlus One was successful in its way due to the partnership with Cyanogen community and releasing their blend of a fully customizable Andriod OS. This time around, the OnePlus Two is equipped with its own Oxygen 2.1 which is based on Android Lollipop 5.1 instead. No news yet on whether it will get an update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0. \nHere is another department where we can see the Moto X Play has some great advantage. It is about bringing to you the best and purest Android experience, the way the developer meant it to behave. This means that you won’t be bogged down by unnecessary bloatware that normally the manufacturer will install for you. With Moto software, you can teach your device how to work best for you. And you will also fall in love with the efficient simplicity of the latest Android Marshmallow 6.0 once it is available on the device. \nIn terms of storage, again there will be two variants of the OnePlus Two, one with 16GB (and 3GB RAM) and another with 64GB (and 4GB RAM). Since it doesn’t come with a microSD slot, you should always get the 64GB since the price difference won’t be that much. \nOn the Moto X Play, you can choose to go for either for 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. The price difference isn’t that big though as well. And if you need additional space, you can expand further with its microSD slot that can take in up to a maximum of 128GB. \nBattery-wise, the OnePlus Two comes with a non-removable Li-Po 3300 mAh battery that should have no issues powering up the smartphone for a day or two in between charging. \nThe same can be said of the Moto X Play and its huge non-removable 3630 mAh battery. There’s the added advantage of fast battery charging that is certainly handy in lots of situation. - Advertisement - \nFor a startup company, OnePlus seems to be on top of its game and have a lot of positive things going on. And to survive with just one device all year long is nothing short of amazing and defies all odds. With OnePlus Two, it is picking up the baton quite nicely for them in 2015 and as expected, comes with a decent price tag. \nWell, who does not know the brand Motorola? As for the Moto X Play, it is close enough to be a flagship killer on its own. Should it have at least 1GB more memory, it would have been excellent. \nWhen you compare between the two, it will give you a hard time on which device that you should choose. On the OnePlus Two, it has a better screen, thinner, and lighter body with metal frame, more firepower and more memory, and dual sim capability. Whereas for Motorola Moto X Play, it has more personalization options, better protection especially with its IP52 certification, better camera ability, larger battery and a purer Android experience. \nThe OnePlus Two is currently available for $329 for the 16GB-3GB variant and $389 for the 64GB-4GB variant. It is only available in Sandstone Black color, and there are lots of other StyleSwap colors to choose from which can be purchased separately. \nThe Motorola Moto X Play is currently available for $309 for the 16GB variant and $359 for the 32GB variant. It is only available in Black and White and is highly customizable.
