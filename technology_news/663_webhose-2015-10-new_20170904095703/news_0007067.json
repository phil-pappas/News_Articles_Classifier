(NASDAQ: SAJA), a leading global language services and technology provider, today announced that The Floating Hospital has translated its website into Spanish using SiteSync, Sajan's website translation proxy technology. The Floating Hospital is a 149-year-old primary medical, dental and mental health facility, whose mission is to provide healthcare services to residents of New York City regardless of financial, insurance or legal status. \n\"I feared that a lot of the people who were in need of medical services wouldn't receive them simply because of language barriers,\" said Barbara LaPlaca, VP/philanthropy, communications & outreach at Floating Hospital. \"Sajan's SiteSync has enabled us to translate our website without needing to devote precious time and resources to it internally.\" \nSajan linked their technology SiteSync to Floating Hospital's Wordpress site and to Transplicity, Sajan's translation management system. This setup allowed content to flow seamlessly between systems to be translated into Spanish and updated automatically on the website. To date, SiteSync has enabled linguist-performed translation of over 27,000 words into Spanish across more than 150 Web pages. \n\"It's extremely gratifying to see the benefits of SiteSync really make an impact for a community-focused organization like Floating Hospital,\" said Jeff Kent, vice president of professional services at Sajan. \"We're currently rolling out the solution for additional clients right now, and more success stories are soon to come.\" \nAbout Sajan Sajan is a leading provider of global language translation and localization services, helping clients around the world expand seamlessly into any global market.
