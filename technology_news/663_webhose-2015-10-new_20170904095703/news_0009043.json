That was the steepest decline since January 2009, an economist at Destatis said.\nImports fell by 3.1 per cent on the month to €78.2 billion. However, the Destatis economist said the economic method of seasonal adjustment may not fully capture the summer vacation effect.\nGermany's current account balance, a broad measure of an economy's international financial position, showed a surplus of €12.3 billion in August in unadjusted terms. That was well below economists' forecasts of a €16.2 billion surplus.
