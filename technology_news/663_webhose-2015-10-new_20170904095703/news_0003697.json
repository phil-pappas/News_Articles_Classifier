It has already tied up with The Mobile Store for mobile phones, Michelin for tyres, Luminous for invertors and batteries, and Shoppers Stop for fashion products. \nThese brick-and-mortar stores will also allow provide customers value-added services. For example, phone buyers on Snapdeal will get help from agents of The Mobile Store to set up the device and avail services such as data transfer and screen guard installation. These services will be available across 70 cities in India. \nSnapdeal follows larger rival Flipkart in offering such a service. Flipkart launched a service in July this year whereby it allowed its customers to pick up their orders from 20 offline collection centres. These centres also offer value-added services such as assisted buying, spot trials and instant returns. In the first phase, Flipkart opened such centres across 10 cities including Delhi and Bangalore. It plans to open 100 such stores by March 2016. \nGlobally, many e-commerce companies allow customers to pick up their orders. US e-tailer Amazon, for instance, had launched Amazon Locker in 2011 that allowed customers to retrieve their packages at a local locker location using a personal code.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:20:42.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
