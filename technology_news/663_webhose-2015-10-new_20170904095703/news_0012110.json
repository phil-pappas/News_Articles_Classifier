He says he wants his digital media company to become bigger than ESPN, MTV and CNN combined. He has mused that Vice could be worth $20 billion if it went public. \nThe second line of his bio mentions that he has visited North Korea—twice. That healthy amount of bravado fuels Vice’s anti-establishment attitude. The international news company covers the kinds of stories that traditional outlets pass on—South America’s cocaine trafficking hot spots, Mauritian fat farms for women and Bangladesh’s illegal kidney market—and it’s attracted tons of young male viewers coveted by advertisers. \nExactly how many? “Hundreds of millions,” states Vice’s tip sheet. A company rep pegs it closer to 250 million to 300 million per month, as if the difference of 50 million were a measly rounding error. \nWhat is clear is that counterculture Vice is popular among mainstream companies. Verizon and Spotify pay to stream Vice’s content, while Bank of America and Pepsi pay it to sponsor content that gives their images a more youthful sheen. HBO has partnered with Vice on a long-form series that is the startup’s version of 60 Minutes. In 2013, 21st Century Fox invested $70 million for a 5% stake. Last year, A&E Networks (co-owned by Disney and Hearst) threw in $250 million for 10% ownership. The VC firm Technology Crossover Ventures ponied up another $250 million, putting Vice’s valuation at a cool $2.5 billion. Whatever Shane Smith is saying, investors are liking the sound of it. \nVice Media is No. 42 on Crain's 2015 fastest-growing companies in New York list .
