Many conventional gas detectors are based on electrochemical or chemo-resistive effects. Despite providing good selectivity in some cases, the performance of these technologies is limited by the nature of the chemical adsorption/diffusion process of the chemical at the surface or through the sensing film. Therefore, many types of conventional sensors suffer from a slow response time and memory effect and require frequent recalibration. Instability and poor shelf-life are additional challenges for gas sensing 1 . Important characteristics of different gas sensor technologies are: selectivity, sensitivity, size and power consumption, response time, and hysteresis effects. \nAn electrothermal gas sensor works based on the interaction between heat generation in an electrically conductive suspended element and heat transfer from the element via the surrounding gas medium. When electrical power dissipation occurs in a suspended hot element, the thermal conductivity of the gas surrounding the device determines the rate of heat loss. As a result, the steady-state temperature of the hot element is a function of the gas ambient properties. If the heater is constructed from an electric conductor with a sufficiently high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) this allows the average temperature of the heater to be determined by measuring the change in resistance when heating occurs in different gas ambient mixtures. Conventional thermal gas detectors have been employed in the form of relatively small pellistors 2 . Pellistors are solid-state devices used to detect gases that are either combustible or exhibit significantly different thermal conductivity relative to air. \nAlong with the development of MEMS technology, microhotplates were developed to operate at lower power and are based on a similar principal as pellistors. Zanini et al. 3 fabricated a calorimetric microhotplate sensor using silicon micromachining techniques. The device output was found to be proportional to the concentration of combustible gas, in this case hydrogen and propylene. The smaller size of these micro-plates allowed them to reach operating temperatures as high as 500 °C in approximately 20 ms at a power level of 100 mW. An electric circuit consisting of a Wheatstone bridge with two external resistors and a reference sensor was used to measure the steady-state resistance of the microhotplate. \nSuehle et al. 4 , 5 developed the first monolithic tin oxide gas sensor hotplate by commercial CMOS foundry fabrication. A response time of 200 s was observed for hydrogen detection and the device could achieve a temperature of 350 °C at 45 mW. Later Elmi et al. 6 developed smaller metal oxide microhotplates (50–120 µm in diameter) for detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sensors required 8.9 mW for detection. Decarli et al. 7 integrated a technique for the controlled deposition of nanostructured metal oxide films with MEMS-based microfabrication technologies to fabricate microhotplate gas sensors with tungsten and iron oxides. These metal oxide technologies exhibited a slow response time of several minutes. \nMicro-thermal conductivity detector (µTCD) gas sensors, unlike calorimetric or metal oxide gas sensors, are based on changes in the thermo-physical properties of the surrounding gas and do not rely on gas adsorption and reaction with a catalyst or thin films. Therefore, measurements can be taken more rapidly and the sensor can be operated in a continuous manner and repeatedly used without memory effects. Puente et al. 8 demonstrated a thermal conductivity micro-sensor for measurement and analysis of natural gas composition. Miniature thermal conductivity gas sensors have been developed as detectors for gas chromatography (GC) systems in which very fast response is required for the detector. Cruz et al. 9 fabricated a µTCD for this purpose. The design included a platinum heater resting on a silicon nitride membrane. The total size of the membrane structure was larger than 0.5 mm and the sensors consumed approximately 1 W power at typical GC flow rates. To improve sensitivity, four TCDs in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement were exposed to the reference flow, and column effluent and samples of output voltage were taken under a DC input voltage. \nBecause electro-thermal sensors rely on heat transfer as the sensing mechanism, some researchers have explored the nature of the thermal phenomena through modeling and simulations. The efforts include thermal modeling of microheater gas flow sensors 10 , 11 and electrothermal simulation of µTCD for geometry optimization 9 . However, previous works relied on significant simplifications in handling the complexity of physics and geometry. \nDespite advancements in the fabrication of µTCDs and efforts to make them smaller, the methods of measurement are relatively undeveloped and reported investigation of TCDs has been based on steady-state readings from a conventional Wheatstone bridge with DC excitation. The frequency method of 3 ω (3 omega) and time domain thermo-reflectance (TDTR) have been used in other applications for measuring thermal conductivity in solids, and transient hot wires (THW) have been studied in some fluid samples 12 , 13 . Relatively large geometries used in these studies involve long settling times, losses, complex 3D isotherms, natural convection effects, and radiation. Moreover, a frequency analysis method requires a lock-in amplifier and therefore relatively longer acquisition time. In the present work, a detection method based on transient thermal response was developed for detection of gas mixtures on a microfabricated ultra-low-power microbridge TCD fabricated from polysilicon. A test bed and associated experiments were designed to evaluate the power consumption and speed of this technique compared with conventional steady-state measurements. To provide more insights into transient phenomena and predict µTCD behavior, an accurate multiphysics model was developed that is capable of simulating transient response of the sensor in a gas medium with minimal simplification. The developed technology is especially suitable for emerging ultra-portable and wireless gas analyzers in the internet-of-things era in which power consumption and footprint are critical criteria.
