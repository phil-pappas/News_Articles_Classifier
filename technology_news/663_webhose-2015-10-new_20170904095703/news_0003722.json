Epson America today announced that Patterson Companies, Inc., parent company to Patterson Dental, and iDent have agreed to market a solution to U.S. dentists nationwide featuring Epson Moverio BT-200 smart glasses.\nWith the solution, a pair of Epson smart glasses will feature iDent's eye-CAD Connect software to assist dentists using a CAD/CAM system that produces 3D digital models of patient teeth for dental restoration.\nWith eye-CAD Connect, dentists can view a transparent, binocular display of the 3D model with the Epson Moverio BT-200 smart glasses while maintaining visual contact of the patient's teeth, eliminating the need to constantly look up at a computer monitor during procedures.\nThe eye-CAD Connect and Epson Moverio smart glasses solution will be officially launched and demonstrated at the CEREC 30 th Anniversary event , being held September 17-19, 2015 at The Venetian and The Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas .\nThe solution is currently being used by Dr. Vasquez and Associates, a cosmetic and general dentistry office based in San Diego, Calif. Daniel Vasquez , DDS, wears the Moverio BT-200 smart glasses in his daily practice while using a CAD/CAM system to scan his patients' teeth to create a wide-variety of dental restorations.\n\"Viewing a precise image display is indispensable to creating a quality scan and the Epson Moverio glasses deliver accurate and stable images with exceptional quality,\" Vasquez said. \"The Moverio smart glasses ultimately make me more efficient while increasing the precision of the scan and decreasing patient chair time.\"\n\"In addition, the Moverio reduces my own potential for repetitive stress injury,\" Vasquez said. \"By wearing the glasses I don't have to look down or over my shoulder to see how I'm doing in the monitor, preventing lower back, wrist and neck strain.\"\nOnce the patient's teeth are scanned, the dental CAD scanning system can immediately design and output a digital mold for a highly accurate crown that can be inserted into the patient's mouth during the same office visit, according to Dr. Vasquez.\n\"We are thrilled the Moverio BT-200 can serve as an invaluable tool in the dental field, and we are working closely with Patterson and iDent to launch the solution nationwide,\" said Eric Mizufuka , product manager, New Ventures for Epson America . \"This solution demonstrates the power of Epson's technologies and our unique ability to deliver high volumes of production smart glasses to the market at a reasonable price.\"\nThe optimal device for 3D augmented reality applications, the Moverio BT-200 smart glasses feature micro projectors located on each side of the lens that project transparent overlays of digital content directly in the user's field of view over the real-world environment, while sensors enable head-motion tracking for hands-free navigation.\nTo see the Moverio BT-200 in action, visit the official YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/moverio .
