Comments Email Print Ã— \nWith help from a $200 million fundraising round for BuzzFeed and $100 million that went to Hindi music-streaming service Saavn, the New York metro area pulled in $1.8 billion in venture capital investment in the third quarter of 2015. \nThe total was 3% higher than the same period a year ago, according to the MoneyTree Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, based on data provided by Thomson Reuters, released Friday. But spending was down 24% from the second quarter of this year, when investment in area startups hit a quarterly record . \nSo far this year, New York has recorded $5.6 billion in venture capital deals, already surpassing 2014's $5.3 billion year-end total. The amount is the highest the city has seen since 2000. \nNew York came in slightly behind perennial rival New England, which pulled in $2.1 billion in the third quarter, but far behind California's Silicon Valley, which clocked $7.9 billion in VC funding. \nNationally, VC spending in the quarter came to $16.3 billion, which was also below the prior quarter but ahead of the year-ago period. The $47.2 billion invested in the first three quarters of 2015 is bigger than the full year totals for 17 of the last 20 years, according to PwC. \nSpending in the quarter has spurred talk of a bubble, but PwC chalked up the results to more late-stage companies raising money privately and fewer turning to the public markets. \n\"You're getting deals in the survey now that would not have been there\" in past years, said Tom Ciccolella, U.S. venture capital market leader at PwC. \"Historically [for those companies], this would have been the IPO round. That pushes the numbers up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:51:17.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
