Heastie said he hoped to \"get a visual\" of issues Thiele has talked about in the Assembly.\nMost Popular LI mom, daughter get foreclosure dismissed Massive LI facility gets new major tenant Woman, 100, still works 66 hours a week Medical building plan can't go forward 'Staggering' boom in LI's solar-energy industry \"In New York, geography is very important,\" Thiele said, saying legislators from Long Island, New York City and upstate compete for different priorities.\nOver three hours, the speaker visited a vineyard, a fishing dock and a marine science laboratory, and was peppered with questions and opinions about a proposed minimum-wage hike, fishing regulations, environmental funding and other topics.\nHeastie has toured roughly 30 Assembly districts over the past several weeks, a spokesman for the speaker said. He visited the Setauket-area district of Assemb. Steve Englebright (D-Setauket) earlier Tuesday.\n0:43 Opinion Talking politics with Carl Heastie, one of Albany's three men in the room At WÃ¶lffer Estate Vineyard in Sagaponack, East End farmers emphasized the difficulty of keeping their industry alive amid some of the most expensive real estate in the country.

Because the market determines farmers' prices, he said, they can't easily pass added costs to their customers.\nHeastie predicted higher wages would put more money into the economy and raise revenue. \"We're not looking to put anyone out of business,\" he said, but people working 35 or 40 hours a week \"shouldn't have to live in poverty.\"\nAt the Shinnecock commercial fishing dock in Hampton Bays, fishermen crowded around the speaker and tried to explain the complex web of federal and state regulations that limit their catches.\n\"I never realized catching fish was this complicated,\" Heastie said.\nOpinion Editorial: Our to-do list for Albany's new leaders The speaker was joined at various points in the tour by officials, including state Sen.
