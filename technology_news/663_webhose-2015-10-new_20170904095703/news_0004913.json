( Milpitas, California ) announced today the launch of air-stable catalyst pills (CatPac's) for metathesis chemistry. The importance of metathesis chemistry was highlighted by the Nobel Prize awarded in 2005 to the pioneers of this application. This industrially-relevant application has been utilized in the production of valuable chemical entities such as pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals, and polymers. \nThe CatPac system was developed by XiMo, an emerging metathesis technology company and utilizes proprietary molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) catalysts. \"Our catalysts represent exceptional value to the chemical industry, especially in pharmaceutical development, given the low cost of Mo compared to ruthenium (Ru) (100-fold less expensive), and its high body tolerance (non-toxic as opposed to Ru),\" said Douglas C. Günthardt, Chairman of XiMo. \"We have made these highly active catalysts more convenient to use for rapid screening by formulating them in an air-stable pill format that we call the CatPac,\" added Dr. Georg Fráter , COO of XiMo. \"Our catalysts are also available in native form on commercial scale.\" \n\"As a provider of innovative chemistry solutions, we are continuously launching novel tools to enable discovery and development,\" commented Dr. John Chan , CEO of Aspira Scientific. \"We are very excited to deliver a broad Nobel-winning metathesis platform in a user- and IP-friendly manner which has been lacking in industry for some time.\" This latest addition complements well Aspira Scientific's broad portfolio of cutting-edge tools for drug and material development. Detailed product information for Mo-CatPac catalysts are available at: www.aspirasci.com/metathesis . \nAbout XiMo AG \nXiMo is a Swiss-based company focused on the development and application of proprietary metathesis catalysts for use in the specialty chemical, agro chemical, renewables, pharmaceutical, flavors and fragrances, polymers and advanced materials sectors. The company's molybdenum and tungsten catalysts are based on the breakthrough scientific research of founders Amir Hoveyda at Boston College and Richard Schrock at MIT, co-winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. XiMo partners with selected leading companies on a time-limited exclusive basis, providing access to its intellectual property and technical expertise, to solve important industrial chemistry problems and to enable development of novel molecules and materials. Our complexes deliver both high activity and selectivity in metathesis transformations, enabling efficient Z-selective cross-metathesis, as well as enantioselective reactions.
