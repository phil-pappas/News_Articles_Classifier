Morgan, Credit Suisse are underwriting the IPO. \nThe company, whose competitors include Heartland Payment Systems Inc, Vantiv Inc and Global Payments Inc , did not say how many shares it planned to sell or the price. \nThe filing had a nominal IPO size of $100 million. \n(Reporting by Rachel Chitra; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:49:48.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
