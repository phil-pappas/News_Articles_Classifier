The webinar will take place October 14 at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276077LOGO \nTweet This : CoSo Presents Free Webinar: Bridge the Gap to the Cloud with #AdobeConnect http://bit.ly/1MbkA9X via @CoSoCloud \nMany companies already depend on Adobe Connect to reach their collaboration, web meeting, and eLearning goals thanks to its rich feature set and high level of customization. Typically, these companies buy Adobe Connect and initially decide to deploy it in their own data centers, tasking their operations teams to manage it. Often, this seems to work well initially, but as usage goes up, it becomes more time consuming to manage the necessary infrastructure and reliability issues begin to arise. Inevitably, these organizations look to the cloud, but researching and deciding on the right strategy can take months. \nCoSo Product Manager Sean Morrison will help organizations find a quicker path by presenting the many options for cloud deployment and associated services to help organizations decide on the implementations that are right for them. He will also share some of the challenges faced and solutions created for some of the world's most well-known companies, including SAS, General Motors, KPMG, US Department of State, and the Learning Tree International, as they moved their own eLearning and collaboration tools to the cloud. \nAn Adobe Connect ecosystem veteran and long-time product lead at ConnectSolutions, Sean Morrison is a seasoned Adobe Connect expert. For the past five years he's helped build and deliver Adobe Connect value to CoSo customers. \nPlease join CoSo in learning how to successfully move Adobe Connect to the cloud.
