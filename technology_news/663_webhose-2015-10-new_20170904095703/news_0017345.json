HemisFares is a guided tour of the best-of-the-best tastes the planet has to offer – found exclusively at the Kroger family of stores, including Ralphs stores in Southern California. \nKroger introduced the brand with 27 authentic Italian products currently on shelves in Ralphs stores and plans to add more products and countries soon. \n\"Just like American barbeque can mean many different flavors: spicy, smoky, more of a vinegar base, Italian food changes considerably as you travel across the country,\" said Gil Phipps, Kroger vice president of Corporate Brands. \"Imagine landing in Italyand getting an in-depth, guided tour from village to village, experiencing the single best example of the most beloved foods from each region. Our goal with HemisFares is to bring only the best food finds to our customers.\" \nKroger is working side-by-side with the best food connoisseurs, some with decades of experience, to identify the most delectable, regional culinary treasures from around the world. Kroger's Corporate Brands team travels to those regions, diving into what makes each edible treasure and locality unique. Gelato, for example, originated in Sicily. HemisFares Sicilian Gelato is made from grass-fed cows who roam the Sicilian countryside. These cows are milked daily and provide the fresh cream used to make the rich and creamy HemisFares Sicilian Gelato that is sold on Kroger shelves. \nThe packaging on each product is also unique, as it tells the story of the food find. It takes customers on a journey, explaining precisely where it came from and what makes that product the best-of-the-best. Each HemisFares item has a \"find number\" on the packaging to direct customers to other similar products in the HemisFares brand that they may enjoy. \nCustomers can expect additional HemisFares products over the next year, from regions including Spain, Japan and others. \n\"Whether you're epi-curious or just like eating and sharing incredibly tasty food, when you see our HemisFares brand, you can trust the product within is the best this planet has to offer – bar none,\" said Phipps. \"We're sure customers will enjoy them as much as we enjoy finding them. So, join us on 'A Journey of Epicurean Proportions.'\" \nAbout Ralphs Ralphs Grocery Company was founded in 1873 and currently operates 209 supermarkets from its headquarters in Los Angeles.
