What's the pitch? \nDeveloped by ex-politician, current businessman and entrepreneur Lord Drayson, CleanSpace is a portable air pollution sensor that enables you to track your personal pollution exposure in real time.\nThe aim of harnessing such big data - once mass adoption has taken place - will be to manage and transform the pollution levels in the UK.\nHow much is needed? \nThe project is live on crowdfunder.co.uk until 27 October and is looking to raise £100,000. Within just a couple of days, more than £25,000 has been raised.\nWhat does it do? \nThe data collected by the sensor is fed to the CleanSpace app which allows owners to monitor and understand the type and volume of pollution they are exposed to while commuting.\nBy mapping your journey clearly, users can then determine the best routes for them based on those with the least polluted roads.\nRecognising that you have used the app and chosen cleaner routes, owners are rewarded with CleanMiles, which can be redeemed for a selection of rewards.\nAll the data will be fed in to a 'national pollution bank' that could become vitally important to monitor pollution levels across the country, and help to reduce life-threatening illnesses as a result.\nCleanSpace also uses the world's first wireless rechargeable technology. Lord Drayson and his team have developed Freevolt technology which harvests energy from 2G, 3G, 4G and WiFi signals.\nHow much is it? \nCleanSpace Tags are available on crowdfunder.co.uk for £65 each which includes a £5 donation to a CleanSpace charity partner - British Lung Foundation, EarthWatch or Sustrans. With a £275 donation, a family of five will be armed with a sensor each.\nFor more information, visit the Crowdfunder.co.uk page: www.crowdfunder.co.uk/cleanspace\nWhen will it arrive? \nShipping is free and sensors will be with backers by the end of November 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:12:11.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
