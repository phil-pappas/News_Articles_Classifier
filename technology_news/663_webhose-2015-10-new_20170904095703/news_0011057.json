( bit.ly/1VObil2 ) \nPepsiCo already has many licensees across a number of categories. Last year, it tied up with companies such as Danish luxury stereo and TV maker Bang & Olufsen and Italian shoemaker Del Toro for a range of products for its football campaign. \nPepsiCo's shares were down 0.5 percent at $99 in late afternoon trading on Monday, while the broader market was flat.
