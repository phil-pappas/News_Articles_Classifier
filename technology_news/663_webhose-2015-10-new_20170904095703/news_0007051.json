This full day coding marathon aimed to ideate, prototype and develop software solutions connected to the real life, using IoT technologies. Belatrix Software challenged Latin America’s brightest developers, engineers and software students to create innovations through a series of Belatrix “Hackatrix” coding hackathons.
