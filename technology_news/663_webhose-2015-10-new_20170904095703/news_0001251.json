That demonstrates that the handshaking is a chemosignalling behaviour,” said Sobel.\nGetty\nOther experts have agreed with the findings in Isreal.\n“It fits with the general idea that there is a lot more chemical communication going on that we are unaware of,\" said Charles Wysocki at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia.\nThe results of the study appeared in the journal eLife .\nNow the scientists say that the next step is to determine exactly what information we are transferring to each other with our scent.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27070-after-handshakes-we-sniff-peoples-scent-on-our-hand/", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech", "http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e05154", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:37:55.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
