Shapiro focused on opportunities for content creation and distribution, and emphasized how rapidly changing technology creates new opportunities for content creators. He said policymakers and industry should focus on innovation as a national strategy and support patent reform, greater spectrum and changes in copyright law to encourage innovation, give consumers choice and create new ways for content creators to benefit. \n“Innovation is our core national strength,” said Shapiro. “When I talk about innovation, I’m not only talking about technology. I’m talking about content creation, about the world of video, about the world of music, about the world of performance and about graphics.” \nShapiro reminded attendees that innovations in technology help solve world problems and benefit all industries, including the entertainment industry. While technological disruptions may be disorienting and, at times, uncomfortable, they grow the U.S. economy and create jobs. More, they make the pie bigger. \n“The barriers to entry to become a content creator have shrunk,” Shapiro said. “About 20 or 30 years ago, you had to ink a deal with a major studio or record company. Now, anyone can create an audience.” \nShapiro advised the entertainment industry to recognize and embrace the needs and desires of their audience. Consumers welcome disruptive innovations that are convenient, efficient and make it easier than ever to be entertained and informed. \n“Our goal is to give consumers choice and access, and provide a venue for startups in the content world. We want citizens to have access to content and creators to be rewarded for their creations.” \nAbout CEA: \nThe Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is the technology trade association representing the $285 billion U.S. consumer electronics industry.
