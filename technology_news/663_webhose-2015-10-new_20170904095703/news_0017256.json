Research published in the International Journal of Social Media and Interactive Learning Environments , suggests that LinkedIn users are well acquainted with and fairly happy with the technological performance of the network, but have mixed responses to its social benefits and raise concerns regarding privacy and professional authentication. \nAccording to Eng Li Yap and Qiyun Wang of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, the proliferation of online social networks has allowed communication and conversation to be carried out on an unprecedented scale across the globe.

However, they also found that some users had negative experiences: \"There are some uncontrollable negative aspects such as meeting unpleasant people, unsolicited invitation from strangers and unwanted advertisements.\" \nNevertheless, the team concludes, \"LinkedIn may have excellent potential as a professional development tool. The findings from this study indicate that adults are receptive to incorporating LinkedIn for their professional development.\" 14 minutes ago 0 Career-focused LinkedIn tops 200 mn members January 9, 2013 \nLinkedIn on Wednesday announced that more than 200 million people have joined the career-focused online social network since its launch nearly a decade ago.
