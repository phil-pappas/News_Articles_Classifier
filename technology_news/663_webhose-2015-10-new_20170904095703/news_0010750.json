However, an experiment conducted by Fortinet researcher Axelle Apvrille confirmed that malwares can be remotely uploaded to these Fitbit devices in less than 10 seconds.\nApvrille pointed out that hackers/attackers can easily send infected packets to a fitness tracker nearby at bluetooth-ranged distances and the attack occurs automatically without the users knowledge.\n“When the victim wishes to synchronize his or her fitness data with Fitbit servers to update their profile… the fitness tracker responds to the query, but in addition to the standard message, the response is tainted with the infected code,” he said.\nHe also pointed out that the actual damage occurs when people plug these devices to their computers. Once it is connected to a laptop or computer, the Fitbit device can transfer malicious software, which can cause a major crash or slow down your computer considerably.\nWith more people using digital accessories these days, Fitbits devices are perfect malware delivery systems. However, people do not really expect their fitness trackers to be a target for hackers unlike an USB stick, which contains valuable information.\nFortinet researchers had informed Fitbit about the issue three months earlier, but the company has not resolved it yet. As hackers keep on utilizing Fitbits as a platform to inject malware, it is suggested that you leave you device at home until the company beefs up the security.\n latest Fitbit malware Also Read Samsung working on an 11K display for smartphones Cost of mining will go up, miners on new Mines Bill IITians to test lunar rovers at Shaastra Problem of black money can be tackled by rationalising taxes: Arun Jaitley", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/fitty%20bitty_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/fitty%20bitty_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151022/technology-latest/article/beware-hackers-can-now-deploy-malware-your-fitbit-wearables-less-10", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:10:21.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
