Now, after nearly two years, 23andMe is announcing on Wednesday that it will begin providing customers with health information again, though much less than before and with F.D.A. approval. The company hopes the information, which relates to the risk of passing certain inherited diseases to one’s children, will reignite growth in its subscriptions — even as the company evolves from being just a consumer testing service into a drug developer. It has also revamped its website to make the genetic information easier to understand and is raising the price of its service to $199, from $99. “Part of what we tried to do over the last two years is take advantage of being off the market to redesign the entire experience,” said Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and chief executive of 23andMe. The company, based in Mountain View, Calif., initially offered consumers information on their risks of developing various diseases based on an analysis of the DNA in their saliva sample. The company created a buzz with its celebrity-filled “spit parties” and its message that consumers have the right to their own genetic information, without a doctor or regulatory agency being involved. It did not hurt that Ms. Wojcicki, now divorced, was married at the time to Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, and that Google invested in her company. But in November 2013, the F.D.A. demanded that 23andMe stop providing health information until it could obtain regulatory approval by demonstrating that its results were accurate. The setback was somewhat similar to what is occurring now with Theranos , another hot Silicon Valley medical testing company run by an entrepreneurial young woman, Elizabeth Holmes. In articles last week, The Wall Street Journal raised q uestions about Theranos’s accuracy (the company says the doubts are unfounded), and the F.D.A. has asked the company to stop using its method of drawing blood from a finger instead of the arm until it wins regulatory approval for the device used.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:32:19.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
