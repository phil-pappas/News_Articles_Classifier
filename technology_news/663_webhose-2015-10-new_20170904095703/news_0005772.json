It's an ongoing thing that continues to happen as we manage costs.\"\nDigitalGlobe made attempts to move impacted employees elsewhere in the company, and Wray encourages those laid off to apply for the dozens of open positions listed on the company's website : \"Like any organization, we continue to evolve every day, and every day we are looking to find opportunities for our people,\" Wray said.\nLast year, the company launched WorldView-3, the most advanced commercial imagery satellite ever made and opened up its gallery of satellite images for sale, bringing a new revenue stream to the company.\nDigitalGlobe in March moved into a new 482,000-square-foot Westminster headquarters from its previous home in Longmont. At that time, the company said it anticipated its Colorado staff would grow by approximately 400 employees, post-move .\nThe move to Westminster has been a good one for the company — the centralized location allows it to recruit across the entire Denver metro area, Wray said.\nTied to that move are state Economic Development Commission incentives for which the company asked in 2013, in exchange for keeping its headquarters in Colorado.\nDigitalGlobe was granted up to $4.4 million in Job Incentive Tax Credits for the promise of adding 435 jobs, Office of Economic Development and International Trade spokeswoman Holly Shrewsbury said.\nThe Job Growth Incentive Tax Credit is equal to 50 percent of the company's 7.65 percent Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax on net job growth each year. Those credits are not provided to the company until the positions are hired and in place for a year.\nWray said projections provided to the state from the beginning of the incentive process are still in line.\nIt does not look like these layoffs will impact the company's incentives, Shrewsbury said.\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or @LauraKeeney", "external_links": ["https://digitalglobe.csod.com/ats/careersite/search.aspx?site=1&c=digitalglobe", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:45.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
