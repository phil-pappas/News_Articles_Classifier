Toyota's Mirai fuel cell went on sale late last year. Toyota has received 1,500 orders for the Mirai in Japan, and it just went on sale in the U.S. and Europe.\nAnnual sales of hybrid vehicles will reach 1.5 million and by 2020 Toyota would have sold 15 million hybrids, nearly twice what it has sold so far around the world, it said.\nHybrids switch back and forth between a gasoline engine and an electric motor to deliver an efficient ride.\nThe Toyota Prius, which went on sale in 1997, is the top-selling hybrid, with about 4 million sold globally so far. Toyota is promising to develop a hybrid version in every category, including usually gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles, as well as luxury models.\n\"You may think 35 years is a long time,\" Senior Managing Officer Kiyotaka Ise told reporters. \"But for an automaker to envision all combustion engines as gone is pretty extraordinary.\"\nIse acknowledged some gasoline engine cars would remain in less developed markets, but only in small numbers.\nHe and other Toyota officials insisted on the inevitability of their overall vision, stressing that the problems of global warming and environmental destruction made a move toward a hydrogen-based society a necessity.\nExperts agree more has to be done to curtail global warming and pollution, and nations are increasingly tightening emissions standards.\nBut they are divided on whether all gasoline engines will disappear, or they'll stay on, thanks to greener internal combustion engines, as well as the arrival of clean diesel technology.\nTatsuo Yoshida, senior analyst at Barclays Securities Japan in Tokyo, said Toyota's goals weren't far-fetched.\n\"The internal combustion engine is developing and metamorphosing into hybrids,\" he said. \"Toyota has been working on this technology for a long time. When officials speak out like this, it means they are 120 percent confident this is their scenario.\"\nAs part of its environmental vision, Toyota also promised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from production lines during manufacturing in 2030 to about a third of 2001 levels.\nToyota said it will develop manufacturing technology that uses hydrogen, and will use wind power at its Tahara plant, both by 2020. It also promised to beef up various recycling measures, including developing ways to build vehicles from recycled ones.\nWhen asked why Toyota remained so cautious on electric vehicles, they said they take too long to recharge, despite battery innovations that have made them smaller, restricting them for short-range travel in cities.\nToyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, known as the \"father of the Prius,\" said the company was taking the environment seriously because it has always tried to contribute to a better society.\n\"We have the same principles since our founding,\" he said, showing on stage a photo of Sakichi Toyoda, the Toyota founder's father, who invented a textile loom in 1891. \"That is Toyota's DNA.\"\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama: http://twitter.com/yurikageyama\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
