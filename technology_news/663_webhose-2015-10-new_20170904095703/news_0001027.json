Whitsett said that nearly half will decorate their home, more than two-thirds of all celebrants will wear a costume and more than 157 million people are planning to celebrate and throw or attend parties. \nThe average person will spend $75 this Halloween on indoor and outdoor décor, costumes and candy, and nearly 70 million people plan on passing out candy. Total spending on Halloween will reach $6.9 billion, according to the National Retail Federation. \nTop costume trends for this season include: Adults: Customizable costumes with hoodies, masks, hats, wigs and other accessories. Boys: Star Wars, Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles and superhero muscle costumes from the Avengers continue to be most popular. About 70 percent of all boys’ costumes purchased are licensed products.
