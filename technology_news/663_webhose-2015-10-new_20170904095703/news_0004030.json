Many are culled by the failure to grasp the curriculum, which is in a language they don’t understand.\" So what you are saying is that even though they started school at the very same level as everyone else (Grade 1), the reason that they failed was because they were taught in a language that everyone else was taught in as well? I'm sorry, but that makes no sense to me.\n2) \"....many pupils cannot comprehend simple English literature...\" - Yes, English is one of the most difficult languages to understand, yet here YOU are writing an article in English, aren't you? How did you ever manage that? What makes you different from those that are \"failing to learn because they're taught in English\"? Maybe you applied yourself more consistently like the rest of us? I had a friend who moved here from Romania when we were in Standard 6. Yet even with his poor grasp of the language, he managed to be one of the top students of our class - because he applied himself!\n3) \"...much less handle mathematical problems appropriate for their grades.\" If you look it up, you will see that it is common knowledge that mathematics is a universal language - since the abolishment of Roman Numerals, the numeric system we now deal with is the SAME across the world for everyone and anyone. Quoting Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) said: \"The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.\" Galileo is saying that Mathematics is a universal language in itself, so what's the excuse here now?\n4) \"Black parents in particular insist that their children study in English. This is born out of the erroneous belief that African languages are of little value when it comes to education. But nothing could be further from the truth.\" Let's face it - English IS the international language of the planet. If you want to communicate with anyone, you have more chance of doing so with English. Even though it may not be spoken by the largest number of people (Mandarin and Chinese come to mind as they have the largest population), it is the most widely spoken language on the planet. Are we going to start complaining if tomorrow we wake up and the primary language of the planet is Mandarin or are we going to apply our minds to learning it?\n5) \"Learning through English presents its own challenges for black children. These are compounded by poorly trained teachers who struggle with the language.\" Maybe we need to ensure that the teachers doing the instructing have a better grasp of English if they want to use it as a tool. You can't teach someone how to tie a knot if you don't know how to do it properly yourself first, right?\n6) \"Many countries worldwide, including China, Russia, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy, study English as a subject, but use their indigenous languages for instruction in schools. Many of their teachers struggle to speak English.\" - This may help teaching other subjects, but again it won't help with mathematics as I had said previously regarding it being a universal language.\n7) \"The argument that maths, physics, biology or engineering cannot be done in isiZulu or Sesotho is fatally flawed.\" Completely agree with you on this one. ALL subjects should be able to be taught in any language, including sign language or gibberish. See my previous comment around mathematics.\n8) \"There is no reason the languages of our colonisers should continue to enjoy prominence above our own.\" True. However would you have communicated with the rest of the world then? Do you really think that they would be willing to adopt languages that are used by only a few select countries and especially when there is a minimal incentive to invest (time, money, resources and learning) in such a country? How many Chinese do you think understand isiZulu as opposed to English?\n9) \"Moreover, research has indicated that a significant number of black students drop out of varsity in their first year. The remainder struggle to finish their courses in time. One of the reasons is a failure to cope with academic demands.\" I don't see anything here about English. Also, you can't make it to varsity without passing English - so how on earth could English be to blame? Heck, I couldn't even get into varsity because my final grades were a couple of marks too low, yet here I am doing pretty well with my life.\nJust as a last points:\nFirstly, even though you took this article from the viewpoint of a Black person, you will notice that my responses were completely neutral in this regard.\nSecondly, both my parents arrived in South Africa from Europe, speaking only Spanish and Portuguese. They soon realised that in order to make a life (and survive), they had to adapt and learn the language. I in turn had to learn both English and Afrikaans when in school (a public one), taking my tally to 4 languages which I am now proficient in. How then did I manage that if English was not my first language to start off with? Are all the people whom you speak of not failing because the system of teaching that was implemented since our democracy in 1994 started failing us? For once we can't blame the scary old regime for the failures in our education system as we have already had a couple of born free's that have matriculated with the post Apartheid education system, yet cannot add 2 and 2 together.\nWhat we need is a solid plan to overhaul our education system rather than spending, no, WASTING time writing articles to make excuses for the failures of our current systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:18:20.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
