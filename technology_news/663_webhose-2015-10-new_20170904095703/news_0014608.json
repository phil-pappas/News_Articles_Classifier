Besides Christie, the lawsuit names as defendantâ€™s former state health commissioner Mary O'Dowd and other health department employees.\nThe lawsuit seeks at least $250 000 in compensatory and punitive damages, and Hickox's lawyers say they hope the case will change a quarantine policy they allege was driven by politics, not by public health concerns.\nHickox, aged 34, was working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone during last year's Ebola outbreak, which killed thousands of people. When she returned via Newark Liberty International Airport she was stopped, questioned and sent to stay in a tent outside a Newark hospital despite having no symptoms of the disease, which is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who's showing symptoms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:18:57.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
