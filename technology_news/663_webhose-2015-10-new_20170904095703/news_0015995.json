Plus, higher modelling speeds and faster setting times mean you'll spend more time innovating and less time waiting.” \nIn a launch video , Canon highlights the key areas it aims to address with this new technology; diversity of materials, durability, simplification of post processing and faster build times for advancing demands of 3D printing applications. \nThe machine is set to accelerate speeds and reduce costs at the same time offering users the opportunity to work with a wide range of general purpose resins and deliver a competitively smooth surface finish. The company has developed 3D Integrated Software, designed to seamlessly link 3D technologies and devices such as 3D scanners and allow easy handling of multiple formats of 3D data. \nCanon is the second high-profile brand to enter the market following HP’s Multi Jet Fusion storming onto the scene earlier this year boasting a breakthrough technology that promised to shake up the industry. \nThough this may be its first proprietary technology offering, Canon is no stranger to the 3D printing industry. The 2D printing stalwart struck a partnership with 3D Systems to market, sell and support its advanced manufacturing systems. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:00:30.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
