How about a Superdome or Who Dat sticker to send when the Saints score a touchdown? Yearn no longer, New Orleans.\nCityKey -- the first locally created, New Orleans-themed emoji app to hit the market -- is on the case.\nThe app, available for free on the Apple App Store beginning Friday morning (Oct. 9), allows iPhone and iPad users to download more than 50 localized emojis. Images include a stylized splashing go cup emblazoned with \"I'm Outta Here!\" as well as a bowl of gumbo, white shrimp boots, a shrimp po-boy, beignets and other New Orleans icons.\nThe CityKey app is the brainchild of illustrator John H. Clark IV, software developer Barrett Conrad, and Alyson Kilday, co-founder of the New Orleans creative agency Hop & Jaunt.\nThe three share office space in the Central Business District and first brought up the need for localized emojis in May. The idea took hold and it became \"a passion project,\" Conrad said.\nThe trio met weekly for brainstorming sessions over the summer. Kilday kept everyone on schedule. Conrad worked out the technical aspects of the project. Clark illustrated all the images. \"John is really good at capturing the essence of things, like the detail of the sugar on the beignets, all of that,\" Conrad said.\nCityKey will offer its emoji app for free download for iPhone users through the month of October. Once downloaded, users can add the range of emojis to their phone keyboard for use in text and social media messages.\nKilday said the app will be available for a small fee after this month, though the group has not settled on a price.\nKilday and Conrad noted the app has a \"few deep cuts of New Orleans culture.\" The bowl of yaka mein and the happy birthday sticker complete with safety pin and one dollar bills have drawn smiles from locals.\nKilday said they plan to add more emojis in coming months. They are planning a Mardi Gras expansion pack and would like to work with the Saints and the Pelicans to design sports-themed emojis, she said.\n\"I have a feeling we're going to get a rush of suggestions once this gains traction,\" Kilday said.\nThe three timed CityKey's release with NOLATech Week, which runs from Oct. 5-10. Conrad sees technology as just another way for the city to express itself.\n\"This town has practically every other kind of creative product, music, food, literature, art,\" Conrad said. \"Technology is just a new medium.\"\nThose interested in downloading the app can visit the CityKey website or search for \"CityKey â€“ New Orleans\" in the Apple App Store .\nWhat do you think about CityKey's New Orleans emojis?
