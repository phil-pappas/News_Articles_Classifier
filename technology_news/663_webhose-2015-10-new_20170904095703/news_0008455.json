(OTCQB: COYND), which operates the nation's largest law enforcement real-time, in-car information sharing, communication and data interoperability network. Brandon-COPsync, LLC, a distributor in selected U.S. regions of COPsync products and services, has received a purchase order for 22 locations within Bedford County Public Schools and the system will be installed in the coming weeks. Bedford County, located at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in central Virginia, is now part of an increasing number of municipalities that have joined the COPsync911 network as the system continues to be adopted across the nation. The COPsync911 system is activated by school staff when a threatening situation arises, and allows the staff to send an immediate and silent alert to all other staff, the local law enforcement dispatch center, all patrol cars and on-duty law enforcement officers, even if they are away from their patrol car. \"Ensuring the safety of Bedford County's 15 elementary schools, three middle schools and four high schools requires a concerted and coordinated effort among law enforcement and school staff,\" said Bedford County Sheriff Michael J. Brown, who serves as Chair of the National Sheriffs' Association CJIS/Technology Committee. \"As one who has been involved for many years in the development and deployment of new technology for officers, I firmly believe that such innovation is a key component of providing the best service to our constituents. The information-sharing facilitated by COPsync911 is an outstanding example of technology that can reduce response times and keep our schools safer.\" The system can inform patrol officers of the threat faster than dialing 9-1-1; hence, they arrive on the scene quicker and equipped with up-to-the-minute situational information about the unfolding emergency. Through the service, officers receive the threat alerts directly to the computers in their patrol cars. They can then immediately access a map to see the location of the school, and view a diagram of the building's interior so no time is wasted determining the exact location of the threat. The school staff, the responding officers and the local dispatcher communicate about the incident as it unfolds via a \"Crisis Communications Portal.\" Thus, officers are equipped with information that helps them develop an effective tactical response plan. The COPsync911 threat alert system can save minutes, when seconds count. \"As the first customer for the COPsync911 system in Virginia, the Bedford County Public Schools are paving the way for expanding the COPsync presence within the state,\" said Brandon Flanagan, CEO of Brandon-COPsync, the Company's distributor. \"School district officials are becoming increasingly more vigilant in ensuring the safety of their students, and parents are demanding cost-effective, actionable solutions. We have successfully implemented many COPsync911 systems throughout the New England area on school campuses of all sizes, and we are continuing to expand throughout the East Coast. We look forward to working with school officials in Bedford County, along with Sheriff Brown and his officers, to ensure a smooth rollout of the system and the protection of Bedford's students and staff.\" About COPsync, Inc.
