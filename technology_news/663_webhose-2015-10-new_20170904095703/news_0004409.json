Theia will debut at the IBM Insight 2015 conference in Las Vegas, October 25 - October 28th. Motio is exhibiting at this conference in booth 253 in the EXPO center. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151021/279360 \nTheia gives IBM Cognos customers a cutting-edge user experience, allowing them to harness BI assets and accelerate decision making with predefined business templates, customized branding, and organic charts. \nModern enterprises struggle continuously with user adoption. Established information delivery systems don't always offer the most relevant and engaging experience to users. \nIt takes significant effort to customize dashboards that deliver data. Theia addresses this challenge with predefined business templates, accelerating development and delivering insight to users right away. \nTheia provides a wide variety of highly interactive, easy to use dashboards and charts. This shortens the adoption cycle, reduces the workflow, and empowers business users with true analytics capabilities. Another advantage to Theia is the ability to customize what users experience. Outdated user interfaces can be fully modernized in one day. \n\"We are very excited for the opportunities that Theia will present to our clients. We strongly believe that we can positively impact user adoption rates within any deployment,\" said Darren Nelson, Director of Enterprise Integration at Motio. \"Theia's business templates and content flow are unique and compelling within the BI market. In my experience, Theia makes working with data fun again.\" \nAbout Motio Motio is a global software company and IBM Premier Business Partner.
