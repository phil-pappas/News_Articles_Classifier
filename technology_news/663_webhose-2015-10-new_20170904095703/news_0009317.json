Kids on social media Office of National Statistics \nGirls were far more likely than boys to spend over three hours on social networking websites. \nIn 2012 to 2013, around one in 10 girls (11%) spent over three hours on social networking websites compared with just 5% of boys. \nThe report found a “clear association” between longer time on social websites and children reporting difficulties that suggest mental health problems . \nThose children who spent more than three hours on social websites on a normal school day reported “significantly higher total difficulties scores” than either those who did not use social websites or who spent less time on them. Getty Facebook: Increasing numbers of children are spending more than three hours a day on social media \nThe report said: “Of those children who spent more than three hours on a social website on a normal school day, around 27% reported high or very high total difficulties scores. \n“This is more than double the proportion of those children spending no time on social websites on a normal school day (12%) and the proportion spending up to 3 hours a day on a social website (11%).” \nThe report said social media websites are “ever-present features of social life, especially for the young”. Getty Twitter: Spending more than three hours a day on social media can lead to mental health problems \nBut it added: “While they may provide an additional way to connect with others and form relationships and thus increase children’s mental health, they could also be a source of social comparison, cyber bullying and isolation, reducing children’s mental health.” \nOther research has shown a link between screen time (including watching television, DVDs and videos) and higher levels of emotional distress, anxiety and depression.
