It looks like OnePlus is getting ready to baulk at their tradition and offer something of a mid-range device to get a larger - Advertisement - \nHow many smartphone companies can survive with just one model per year? Well OnePlus did so well last year with just the OnePlus One device which have been sold millions of units. What makes it so successful is the fact that it is comparable to other flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 but sold at half the price – hence the flagship killer status for 2014. \nSo now that we already have OnePlus Two for the flagship in 2015, they are set to break the tradition and introduce OnePlus Mini for the first time. That is actually a great idea as it will generate more revenue for the company as well as getting more people on-board to give it a try. \nHaving said that, where does the OnePlus Mini stand in this case? Will it still be value for money that would not short-change anyone who bought it? Let’s find out real soon. \nWith a November 2015 release date, it is still uncertain on the OnePlus Mini size, measurement and weight. Perhaps we can get more details as we get closer to the release date. It should still maintain its magnesium body that makes for a better handling. \nWith the OnePlus Two sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD LPTS LCD capacitive touchscreen, the OnePlus Mini will be reduced significantly to just a 5-inch Full HD screen. True to its word, the Mini version will be a much scaled down version when it comes to screen size. There will also be a Gorilla Glass providing protection to its screen. \nIt should also have a fingerprint sensor but one additional feature that you can find on the OnePlus Mini is the IP67 certification which makes the device dust and water resistant up to 1 meter and 30 minutes. That’s a plus point that was not on OnePlus Two. \nHow would it fare then when it comes to performance? On the OnePlus Two, there’s the Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon 810 chipset, an Octa-core made up of Quad-core 1.56 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57, Adreno 430 graphics and 3GB or 4GB RAM. Whereas on the OnePlus Mini, you can expect it to be equipped with the Mediatek MT6795 Helio X10 chipset, Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, PowerVR G6200 graphics and 2GB RAM. That’s comparable but the limited memory might be a hindrance when you start to perform multi-tasking and running intensive apps or games. - Advertisement - \nAs far as camera is concerned, it should be having the same 13MP-5MP setup found on the OnePlus Two. Well, minus the Optical Image Stabilization – but the rest of the features are all there. This should dish out quite a performance indeed. \nIn terms of OS, it seems that OnePlus is really pushing hard on its own Oxygen OS which is based on Android Lollipop 5.1. This customized version should be running lighter and with lesser baggage than other manufacturers out there. \nStorage-wise, the OnePlus Mini will come with 32GB of internal storage which is pretty decent. But as with other OnePlus devices, you will have to make do without any expansion slot though. Be prepared to do some cleaning up every now and then. \nAs for the battery, the OnePlus Mini is expected to be powered by a non-removable Li-Po 3100 mAh battery which should have no issues powering up the device for a day or two. In fact, it is just 200 mAh less than what was on the OnePlus Two. - Advertisement - \nFinally, we can see OnePlus venturing out from just competing in the flagship space. With the introduction of OnePlus Mini, it can cater to a much larger audience who prefer a normal-sized screen and who may be on a budget. When you take into consideration other things, you can see that it does give real value for money with its amazing specs that is not far off from its flagship. \nThe OnePlus Mini is set to be making its own wave, come this November 2015. With the OnePlus Two selling at $329, we can safely say that the OnePlus Mini should be considerably lower than this, perhaps near the $249 price range. It will only be available in Sandstone Black.
