Baljeet Singh, senior product director of media, TV and video, said at Twitter’s #VideoNOW event Thursday, \"Twitter video is now open for business. Because it’s unfolding in the moment, you’re reaching users as they’re seeing the video in real time.” The new program opens up the Twitter Amplify ad program to let virtually any video publisher or creator monetize their content with 6-second pre-roll ads — without having a deal in place with an advertiser or agency. The updated Amplify service lets advertisers run video ads against content automatically, in a “programmatic” fashion, based on preferred content categories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:33:07.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
