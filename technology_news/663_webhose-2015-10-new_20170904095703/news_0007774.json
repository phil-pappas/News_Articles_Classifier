Business Insider | 23 October 2015, 7:42 AM IST Follow ETCIO Microsoft CEO Nadella addresses the media during an event in New Delhi \nMicrosoft just posted a solid earnings statement, handily beating on earnings and revenue. \nBut Microsoft confirms that it just had another round of layoffs. It won't say how many jobs were affected, but The New York Times places the number at \"about 1,000.\" \n\"The job reductions were spread across more than one business area and country and reflect adaptations to business needs. We go through this process in the most thoughtful manner possible, with the deepest respect for affected individuals,\" says a company spokesperson. \nThat's in addition to the job cuts earlier this year, which were largely in Microsoft's troubled phone division. \nIn a statement to the Times, Microsoft confirmed the layoffs and said that they were across business units, but declined to provide a number. \nIn the July of 2014, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced the company would be \"streamlining\" operations with the news that 18,000 jobs would be cut, representing 14% of its total workforce. It continued to have layoffs periodically through the rest of that year and into 2015. \nWhile Microsoft's past quarter was solid, it's still being hard hit by the shrinking PC market, which has long been its bread-and-butter. This past quarter, Microsoft changed the way it reports financial results - but it's been noted that under its old reporting structure, its results would have been underwhelming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:51:02.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
