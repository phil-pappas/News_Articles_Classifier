I hope that this research helps us understand ourselves better and why we are the way we are.”\nThe study involved 37 pairs of twins in which one brother was homosexual and the other heterosexual, and 10 pairs in which both were homosexual.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nThe scientists said that between 3% and 5% of the general population is gay.\nMale sexual orientation has been linked to several regions of the genome, but there is strong evidence that environmental influences are important too. Identical twin pairs who share the same genes often differ in sexual orientation.\nHormonal effects in the womb may be one significant factor.\nEach male pregnancy a woman has increases the likelihood of her next son being homosexual by a third. And in women, early exposure to male hormones is associated with higher rates of lesbianism.\nCommenting on the research, Prof Tim Spector, of King’s College London, a leading expert on twin studies and genetics, said: “It has always been a mystery why identical twins who share all their genes can vary in homosexuality.\n“Epigenetic differences are one obvious reason and this study provides evidence for this. However the small study needs replicating before any talk of prediction is realistic.”\nDarren Griffin, professor of genetics at the University of Kent, said: “To claim a 70% predictive value of something as complex as homosexuality is bold indeed. I wait with bated breath for a full peer-reviewed article.\n“While there is strong evidence in general for a biological basis for homosexuality my personal impression has always been one of a multiple contributory factors, including life experiences.”\nGil McVean, professor of statistical genetics at Oxford University, said: “Without validation of the result in an independent data set it is not really possible to know whether there is any substance in this claim.”\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/andrewgregory", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/3501/4221396001_4520537450001_4520380317001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:56:29.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
