The Islandia, N.Y., company has been shedding noncore businesses to focus operations on management cloud, application development and operations, and security.\nOver all, CA reported a profit of $174 million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $256 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, profit from continuing operations fell to 56 cents a share from 65 cents a year earlier.\nRevenue declined nearly 7% to $1.01 billion. Adjusted for currency impacts, revenue dropped 1%, CA said.\nAnalysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected profit of 56 cents a share on $1.01 billion in revenue.\nExcluding currency impacts, the company's bookings rose 92%, with bookings in North America more than doubling compared with the year earlier largely tied to one contract, CA said.\nWhile revenue accounts for payments collected during the quarter, bookings reflect the value of software fees and subscription, maintenance and other contracts customers signed during the quarter but that the company will collect over time. Technology companies, in particular, increasingly rely on bookings to give investors a long-term view of projected revenue.\nShares, largely inactive in late trading, closed at $27.71 on Wednesday, down 9% for the year.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com\n 17:02 ET (21:02 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:03:00.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
