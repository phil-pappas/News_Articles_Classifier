Automation Design + Entertainment is also celebrating their inclusion on CEPro’s list of the Top 100 integrators in the country.\nThe showroom will give their clients the ability to experience the benefits of smart home automation and the latest home theater technology. There will be a particular emphasis on Dolby Atmos, a new form of surround sound that more accurately re-creates the movie theater experience. As part of the new space, the integrators have included a custom theater room where clients can try out the audio technology first hand.\n“Dolby Atmos is a game-changer,” says president and CEO Peter Cook. “It’s like the difference between standard definition television and HD. The improvement is so substantial that once you’ve seen it, you can’t go back. Dolby Atmos is the same. Once you hear it, regular multi-channel surround sound seems hollow. Plus, it works just as well with music as it does with movies and TV. It’s totally revolutionizing home audio.”\nSince the showroom occupies a space formerly used by a video game development company, the renovation was quite extensive—however it yielded impressive results. In order to install the new displays, the entire area had to be refurnished, and over 50 programming stations had to be removed. The entire project took nearly a year to complete.\nAlong with an interactive Dolby Atmos home theater room, the showroom will include various smart automation components from manufacturers like Savant, Crestron, Control4, Lutron and more.\n“Running a business full time while building a new showroom was difficult, but we’re proud of the results. Thanks to our great clients and a lot of hard work, business has been booming. That's why we've been blessed to be recognized as one of the CE Pro Top 100 Integrators this year,\" says Cook.\nAutomation Design + Entertainment’s new showroom is open to the public from 9AM – 5PM or by appointment.\nAbout Automation Design + Entertainment\nAutomation Design + Entertainment is a full-service residential and commercial custom electronics design and integration firm.
