Smartphone camera specifications and features have improved so much through the years that they have become the preferred device for overall and everyday photography. InfoTrends report 2015 U.S. Mobile Imaging End User Study , based on a survey of over 1,300 mobile phone owners between the ages of 13 and 79, highlights the demographics of camera phone users and non-users, discusses influential camera phone features and factors, and highlights respondents’ mobile photo and video behaviors. The report also explores how today’s camera phones are affecting digital photography. Mobile phone manufacturers, app developers, and service providers can leverage the insights in this report to understand the wants and needs for current and future mobile photography products and services.\nWhen camera phone users were asked which three features were most influential in the choice of their current phone, the most popular motivators were brand, operating system, and size of the handset. Brand of phone was the most influential feature and staying with the same wireless carrier was the most important factor outside of features when choosing a phone, suggesting that phone owners are displaying some degree of brand loyalty and prefer to stick with something familiar if their experience has been a good one. Having a camera was a little less influential than it had been in years past, but the photography aspect is still one of the most used features on a phone.\nMost of today’s smartphones offer 8+ megapixel resolution and are capable of capturing photos that are considered “good enough” for most people. InfoTrends recommends that handset manufacturers focus on other aspects of the camera experience, including low-light capture, optical zoom, and improved flash. As mobile videography gets more popular, advanced video capabilities, like easy editing videos and 4K capture, will take mobile video to the next level.\nFor more information on the 2015 U.S. Mobile Imaging End User Survey , please visit our online store or contact Matt O’Keefe at 781 616 2115 or matthew.okeefe@infotrends.com.\nAbout InfoTrends\nInfoTrends, founded in 1991, helps technology vendors, their channels, and end customers understand market trends, grow their business, and improve their operations through a combination of deep subject matter expertise, innovative tools and data, and exceptional customer service.
