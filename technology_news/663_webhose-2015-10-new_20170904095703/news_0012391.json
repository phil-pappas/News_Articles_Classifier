The newly embedded eDrawings viewer, which works directly in any browser and does not need installation, allows users to preview and fully evaluate models and options before downloading. \nThe new 3D ContentCentral “Supplier Services”offer enhancements to the site’s online self-service CAD catalogue publishing solution, giving suppliers three different subscription levels to choose from. Features at the Professional subscription level include: Usage Report: Contains data that suppliers can use to understand the demand for their products; Verified Supplier Status : Highlights a supplier’s catalogue in the community, improving visibility to engineers and designers; Web Syndication : Models from a supplier’s online CAD catalogue can be previewed and downloaded on its corporate website to meet the needs of its direct visitors; Disk Space : Expanded storage for uploading content so suppliers can provide customers with their full range of CAD models. \nFor more details on Dassault Systèmes’ 3D ContentCentral’s enhanced capabilities, please visit: www.3dcontentcentral.com ### \nAbout Dassault Systèmes \nDassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.
