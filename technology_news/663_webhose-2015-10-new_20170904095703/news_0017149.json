DARPA\nMuch like robots, a good part of what makes us able to exist is internal electricity. Our nervous system pretty much consists of sparks of electricity jumping from one nerve to another to regulate nearly all our vital functions. Our brains are storms of electricity, our hearts pump thanks to electrical impulses and we make sense of the images that come in through our eyes through an electrical process.\nIt makes sense then that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a unit within the US Department of Defense that focuses on cutting edge research for military applications, is interested in exploring ways to treat the human body as the electrical system it really is.\nThey've created an initiative called Electrical Prescriptions, or ElectRx , to investigate how light, sound waves, magnets and outside electrical pulses could help soldiers heal. On Monday, the agency announced that it will be awarding grants to seven different teams involved with mapping and treating the body's electrical systems.\n\"We envision technology that can detect the onset of disease and react automatically to restore health by stimulating peripheral nerves to modulate functions in the brain, spinal cord and internal organs,\" said Doug Weber in a statement . Weber is the ElectRx program manager and a biomedical engineer who previously worked as a researcher for the US Department of Veterans Affairs. \"The peripheral nervous system is the body's information superhighway, communicating a vast array of sensory and motor signals that monitor our health status and effect changes in brain and organ functions to keep us healthy,\" he added.\nEach of the teams chosen by DARPA will be investigating a different way of approaching health and healing.\nAccording to Spectrum, the magazine published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , one team will be looking at inserting light-sensitive proteins into neurons which can be turned on or off using pulses of light. Another will inject heat-sensitive proteins into neurons and then dispatch nanoparticles to bind to them. Those nanoparticles can then be heated to activate the neurons. Another team will look at the use of ultrasound's mechanical effect on tissue and how that might turn neurons on or off.\n\"Ultimately, the program envisions a complete system that can be tested in human clinical trials aimed at conditions such as chronic pain, inflammatory disease, post-traumatic stress and other illnesses that may not be responsive to traditional treatments,\" DARPA said.\nTo that end, some of the research will focus on mapping the nerve pathways that lead to inflammation in the intestines and the body at large. Another investigation will focus on how stimulating the vagus nerve \"could enhance learned behavioral responses that reduce fear and anxiety when presented with traumatic cues,\" and help treat post-traumatic stress syndrome. The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve and helps control the parasympathetic nervous system , which is involved in regulating our heart rate and the activity in our intestines.\n\"Using the peripheral nervous system as a medium for delivering therapy is largely new territory and it's rich with potential to manage many of the conditions that impact the readiness of our military and, more generally, the health of the nation,\" Weber said. \"It will be an exciting path forward.", "external_links": ["http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=4770", "http://mentalfloss.com/article/65710/9-nervy-facts-about-vagus-nerve", "http://www.darpa.mil/staff/dr-douglas-weber", "http://www.darpa.mil/program/electrical-prescriptions", "http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/bionics/darpa-wants-to-jolt-the-nervous-system-with-electricity-lasers-sound-waves-and-magnets", "http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-10-05", "http://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/09/daceabd1-ad79-4d5d-8c06-eec69d2536e2/resize/570xauto/8fd26689d99a19ce67bdc86c96d89c0c/darpa-electrx.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:03:32.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
