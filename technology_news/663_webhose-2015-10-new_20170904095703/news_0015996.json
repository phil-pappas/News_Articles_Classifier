Twitter will lay off up to 336 employees, or about 8 per cent of its workforce, as co-founder Jack Dorsey readies to revive growth in the microblogging service provider's user base in his second stint as chief executive.\nThe layoffs, primarily in the company's engineering and product functions, come a week after Dorsey took over as permanent CEO.\nShares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose as much as 6.7 per cent to $US30.68 on Tuesday.\n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" Dorsey said in a letter to employees. \"And the rest of the organisation will be streamlined in parallel.\"\n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" Twitter chief Jack Dorsey. Bloomberg FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, however, said the company needed to focus also on \"rationalising sales\" along with engineering to achieve its margin targets.\nDorsey, who was appointed Twitter's interim CEO in July after Dick Costolo resigned, has been candid about the company's problems.\nMade some tough but necessary decisions that enable Twitter to move with greater focus and reinvest in our growth. http://t.co/BWd7EiGAF2\nâ€” Jack (@jack) October 13, 2015 Twitter's second-quarter growth in average monthly users was the slowest since the company went public on November 7, 2013. Its stock nearly tripled to a record high of $US74.73 in December 2013, but has fallen about 60 per cent since.\n \"The general thinking is that Twitter has a product problem, which is why they picked Jack to come in. You would normally not be cutting in engineering if you have a product problem. So I scratched my head a little bit on that,\" Seyrafi told Reuters.\nSince Dorsey took over as interim CEO, Twitter has rolled out a \"buy now\" button that allows users to make purchases and a feature that highlights the best tweets and content.\nCuts in the engineering department could hurt the company's \"ability to continue growing at a robust pace,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note.\nTwitter said it expected about $US10 million-$US20 million in severance costs and $US5 million-$US15 million in restructuring charges. Twitter expects to record most of these pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter.\nTechnology news website Re/code first reported the planned layoffs on October 9.\nTwitter said it expected its third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA to meet or top the higher end of its forecasts.\nThe company, which will report its third-quarter results on October 27, has forecast revenue of $US545 million-$US560 million and adjusted EBITDA of $US110 million-$US115 million.\nReuters", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jack/status/653912031997751296", "http://t.co/BWd7EiGAF2"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:40:12.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
