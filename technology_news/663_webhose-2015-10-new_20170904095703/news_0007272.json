The projects were announced as Chinese President, Xi Jinping visited the UK this week. \nThe projects will receive over £3 million in funding from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with matched equivalent resources from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). \nFunded under the Low Carbon Cities programme, the projects will encourage collaboration between leading UK and Chinese academics, combining research to reduce the carbon emissions of existing technologies. \nThe projects will also deliver fundamental research into alternative energy sources and a reduction of energy demand, all with a focus on future urban environments. \nBy using comparative research to examine social, political and technical challenges, this will help the UK and China to successfully transition towards future low carbon cities. This programme and joint funding process has been facilitated by the RCUK China office. \nProfessor Philip Nelson FREng, EPSRC's Chief Executive, said: \"The aim of this UK-China research collaboration will be to reduce worldwide CO2 production and ensure energy security and affordability. This is the first of three low carbon innovation projects between EPSRC and NSFC. The projects build on the strength of our internationally renowned research and will benefit both the UK and Chinese economies.\" \nProfessor Che Chengwei, Deputy Director General, Department of Engineering and Material Sciences, NSFC commented: \"NSFC has been working closely with EPSRC for several years to address challenges related to achieving a low-carbon economy. This latest programme, with a focus on future urban environments, will build substantially stronger links between Chinese and UK research communities in relevant areas. It will also brighten the future bilateral collaboration between both countries.\" ### \nThe four projects funded are: \nLow Carbon Transitions of Fleet Operations in Metropolitan Sites (Newcastle University, Imperial College London, and Southeast University) City-Wide Analysis to Propel Cities towards Resource Efficiency and Better Wellbeing (University of Southampton and Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology) The 'Total Performance' of Low Carbon Buildings in China and the UK (University College London and Tsinghua University) Low carbon climate-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities (University of Cambridge, University of Reading and Chongqing University) \nLow Carbon Cities forms part of the Low Carbon Innovation programme, a £20 million three-year investment announced in March 2014. Facilitated by Research Councils UK (RCUK) China, this programme builds on five years of successful collaborative research funded jointly by EPSRC and NSFC in energy research. Low Carbon Innovation will also support research to develop new low carbon manufacturing processes and technologies, as well as offshore renewables. \nNotes for Editors: \nFor further information please contact the EPSRC Press Office on Tel: 01793 444 404 or e-mail: pressoffice@epsrc.ac.uk \nFor a roundup of RCUK joint announcements between UK and China see http://www.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:46:13.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
