Such arguments often draw attention to the possibility that because an issue is uncertain, it may be less serious than anticipated. \n\"In fact, in many instances – including climate change – the reverse is true: mathematical analyses of the risk associated with climate change have revealed that as uncertainty increases, so almost always does risk. Similarly, potential surprises are more likely to be calamitous than benign, because the probability of extreme climate events (such as ice sheet collapse) increases with increasing uncertainty, all other factors being equal. \n\"The presence of scientific uncertainty doesn't just reveal a lack of knowledge but is, in many cases, a mathematical expression of the knowledge we do have. Uncertainty can therefore be a source of actionable knowledge rather than an indicator of ignorance.\" \nThe authors also argue that, because focussing on uncertainties can discourage action and distract people from decision-making, the debate about uncertainty should be reframed. \nProfessor Lewandowsky said: \"Climate projections typically express uncertainty in the outcome itself, but not in the outcome's time of arrival – for example, projections reported by the IPCC generally imply statements along the lines of 'by year X, average global surface temperature will rise by between Y1 and Y2 degrees'. \n\"Reporting projections in this manner invites wishful thinking because it increases the perceived variance in the outcome. Reframing this projection so that the uncertainty is expressed in the time of arrival can reduce the potential for wishful thinking because saying 'average global surface temperature will definitely rise by Y degrees, and this will occur between years X1 and X2' emphasizes the when rather than the if. \n\"Our research shows that when uncertainty is expressed in this manner, people perceive the consequences of climate change to be more serious and show greater endorsement of mitigative action.\" Scientists unmask the climate uncertainty monster April 4, 2014 \n(Phys.org) —Scientific uncertainty is a 'monster' that prevents understanding and delays mitigative action in response to climate change, according to The University of Western Australia's Winthrop Professor Stephan Lewandowsky ... New approach needed to deal with increased flood risk April 17, 2014 \nConsidering the impacts of climate change on flood risk may not be effective unless current risk is managed better, according to new research from the University of Bristol published today in the Journal of Hydrology. How climate science denial affects the scientific community May 7, 2015 \nClimate change denial in public discourse may encourage climate scientists to over-emphasise scientific uncertainty and is also affecting how they themselves speak - and perhaps even think - about their own research, a new ... How we mitigate uncertainty September 10, 2015 \nUncertainty is a paradox. On one hand, it is a potent and powerful force that motivates research, a need to know. The gratifying result of research is evidence used to guide practice and policy. Urgent research needed on predicting future regional climate change, report demands September 10, 2015 \nCrucial research into the changing spatial patterns of future climate patterns is urgently needed, a new review article has concluded. Recommended for you The lasting legacy of climate change October 15, 2015 \nAn international team led by Dr Nicholas Golledge, who holds a joint position at Victoria University's Antarctic Research Centre and GNS Science, has published a paper in the respected scientific magazine Nature titled 'The ... Bubble plumes off Washington, Oregon suggest warmer ocean may be releasing frozen methane October 14, 2015 \nWarming ocean temperatures a third of a mile below the surface, in a dark ocean in areas with little marine life, might attract scant attention. But this is precisely the depth where frozen pockets of methane 'ice' transition ... New insights into the dynamics of past climate change October 14, 2015 \nA new study finds that changing climate in the polar regions can affect conditions in the rest of the world far quicker than previously thought. Rising seas will drown mangrove forests October 14, 2015 \nMangrove forests around the Indo-Pacific region could be submerged by 2070, international research published today says.Even with relatively low sea-level rises, many mangrove forests had a poor outlook said Professor Catherine ... Sea level rise will swallow Miami, New Orleans, study finds October 12, 2015 \nSay goodbye to Miami and New Orleans. No matter what we do to curb global warming, these and other beloved US cities will sink below rising seas, according to a study Monday.
