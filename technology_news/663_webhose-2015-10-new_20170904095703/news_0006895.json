Be it in the UN, African Union, SADC …the list goes on. In recent years Pretoria has invited so many African leaders with dubious backgrounds and rolled out the red carpet for them. Even when human rights activists demonstrated against these leaders they did not budge.\n So the decision to withdraw South Africa from the ICC is not surprising at all. But I hope that the ANC government will provide the full reasons for the withdrawal to the people of South Africa for they deserve to know that to assist them in making up their minds. The reasons being given in the article are not convincing. I have read some of the reasons in the past wherein the ANC was agitating for the withdrawal. One reason that has continued to be given is the seemingly targeting of African leaders. But if you look around, the highest number of people killed in senseless wars and genocide are committed on African soil. Does the ANC government think that these leaders should not be brought to book? Surely, these guys need to get their thinking caps back from whomever they lent them to! To be fair to them the ICC is not perfect by any stretch of imagination but why are they not coming up with solutions to fix that which is broken instead of opting out? Nelson Mandela, are you hearing our cries? Africa needs you more than ever before, Tata !\nWho can talk about the development of capacity of the African Court of Justice as an alternative solution when people like Robert Mugabe still hold powerful positions in the AU? Granted, it is for a short period but does anyone think African leaders would welcome an effective organ like the African Court of Justice? Look what they did to another organ in the SADC…Do we need to remind people that African countries fail even to fund the AU operations and peace keeping missions. Come to think of it, even the AU was donated by China! Is it not part of the reason that China now controls the whole of Africa? God help us!\n One positive thing about the imminent withdrawal, though, is that the oppressed people of Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Burundi, Uganda, DRC and others now know that they are on their own. As Africans we need to unite and oppose any ambitions by SA for a seat on the Security Council for as long as the current ANC leadership is in power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:04:54.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
