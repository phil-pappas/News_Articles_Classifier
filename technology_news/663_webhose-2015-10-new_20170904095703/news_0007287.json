Equipment is driven completely by a computerized guidance system and monitored through a smart phone from anywhere in the world.\n\"Equipment is now driving itself without an operator on the machine,\" said Brandon Smith, vice president of Farb Guidance Systems, during the Idaho Technology Council's inaugural Capitol Connect Conference in Boise, ID. \"Be it across the road, or across the world, farmers can now take command and control of their equipment without being on the machine. Farmers and their families can have the quality life that they have earned and deserved with the assistance of Farb Guidance Systems' computerized guidance technology.\"\nDuring Smith's presentation to a group of prominent potential investors, Smith revealed their first platform, the FGS-1, which is a Caterpiller Skid Steer that now includes the company's innovative guidance system. \"With the ability to remotely farm their land, farmers will see a greater return both financially and personally … and will realize a number of leading edge advantages.\"\nDave Farb, founder and president of Farb Guidance Systems further explained the product’s “management by exception” capabilities. \"If the machine gets into a situation that it can’t handle, it sends notification and asks for instruction,” said Farb. “We give farmers the freedom to monitor their land and farm the land the way they want, from wherever they want, through the latest technology. When one or multiple units are in the field, farmers will realize they can see a greater return on generations of hard work.\"\nFor more information about Farb Guidance Systems, contact Brandon Smith, vice president at 406-270-7914, email This email address is being protected from spambots.
