Photo: Terry Lane\nThe future is upon us, at least for today: you've set up your new ultra high definition television and now you want to show your pals what it can do, and specifically how it works as the ultimate photo display device. You need to create a slide show of your best photos in genuine 4K with music and (if you absolutely must) the \"Ken Burns effect\" of panning and zooming on the picture. Erk!\n4K Slideshowmaker (free for Windows, Mac and Linux from www.4kdownload.com/download ) is the tool for the job. This is a small application, downloaded in a trice and easy to use – just drag and drop the selected photos onto its main screen, set the output in Preferences, add music, press the Make button and a file is generated in the mp4 video format. Obviously, to get the most impressive effect it helps to create the source jpegs in the 4K format of 16:9 and the pixel dimensions to 3840x2160.\nIf your photos come from a smartphone you might need to enlarge the image slightly. The standard output from an iPhone is 3264x2448 – the wrong aspect ratio for the television. Android phones give the user more control over the camera than the iPhone provides, some allowing the aspect ratio and file quality to be set manually. To achieve that sort of control with an iPhone it is necessary to turn to third party apps.\nThe E-M10 Mark II is a very versatile camera. Photo: supplied\nCamera+, free from the app store, is currently our preferred add-on control unit for the iPhone. It adds on-screen control for white balance, zoom, focus, stabiliser, macro and burst mode. But most important for television display it provides for 16:9 cropping. What's more, in 16:9 mode the files are saved as higher quality TIFFs. When the pixel width is adjusted in an editing program to 3840, the pixel height is automatically adjusted to 2160. The current version of Photoshop handles this considerable degree of enlargement well, using the \"Preserve details enlargement\" option.\nAdvertisement Owners of Nokia 1020 phones shoot 16:9 as the native format with pixel dimensions greater than 4K, so they get the benefit of reducing the image and increasing the sharpness for the slide show.\nWhile looking for iPhone camera apps we came across the RedDotCam which, believe it or not, turns your iPhone into a Leica. You get on-screen Leica-like \"knobs\" to control ISO, shutter speed and EV adjustment. It's not free but it is cheap for a Leica.\nREVIEW OLYMPUS OMD E-M10 MkII\nPrice: $770 (body only street price)\nTHE LOW-DOWN: The E-M10 is the junior sibling in the Olympus micro four thirds range, released in February last year and now upgraded to MkII with an improved OLED viewfinder, five axis image stabilisation which works in video mode, focus bracketing and limited 4K video for time lapse sequences. The 16 megapixel sensor is unchanged. The touchscreen LCD now displays the useful Super Control Panel by default, making easy access to every major camera setting. The two knobs on the top plate give quick control of some functions, including exposure compensation which can be done by feel without taking the eye from the viewfinder. There is even a simulation of an optical DSLR viewfinder. Smartphone integration is excellent. Overall, the ergonomics are very good.\nLIKE\nThe Olympus jpeg image quality, as always, is outstanding – RAW is even better. The bundled software includes Olympus Viewer 3 which is a good RAW image converter and general Lightroom-like image editor. The in-camera correction of converging verticals is sheer genius.\nDISLIKE\nPanasonic's recently released 20 megapixel micro four thirds sensor could make the E-M10 obsolete sooner than we would like.\nVERDICT\nWe have been using the original E-M10 since its release and have usually picked it up as our preferred camera – the MkII is better. The viewfinder and new control layout have given the camera a new feel and responsiveness and – at least for the time being – without a significant price increase. We confess to a tragic addiction to the Olympus retro design style, bringing the lovely form and function of the OM film cameras into the digital era. So OK, it's only cosmetics, but a thing of beauty is a joy forever. Or at least until MkIII arrives.", "external_links": ["http://www.4kdownload.com/download"], "published": "2015-09-26T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:43:09.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
