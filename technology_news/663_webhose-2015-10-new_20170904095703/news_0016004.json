Founder and CEO, Dr. Robert Harman, to present veterinary perspective on stem cell therapy at Third Annual Clinical and Surgical Translation of Stem Cells. Robert Harman, DVM, Founder and CEO of Regenerative Veterinary Medicine company VetStem Biopharma, Inc. is scheduled to speak at the Third Annual Clinical and Surgical Translation of Stem Cells Conference, November 10th in San Diego, California. Dr. Harman will present a veterinary perspective on stem cell therapy from VetStem’s clinical experience with 11,000 cases. As a leader in stem cell science and translation to the clinic, Dr. Harman will showcase clinical experiences in 1000’s of veterinary clinics across the US and Canada and provide insights in efficacy, safety, and medical acceptance in human medical field. He will cover clinical experiences and study data from both orthopedics and internal medicine cases. The conference brings together basic scientists and clinician-scientists, as well as medical practitioners and surgeons focusing on studying, characterizing, and deploying various classes of adult stem cells for therapeutic utility. “The opportunity to speak at such a prestigious conference right here in our home city is an honor and further recognition by the human regenerative medicine community of the value of veterinary clinical experience and contributions we have provided to the field of regenerative medicine over the past 12 years, with over 11,000 animal patients treated,” stated Dr. Harman. VetStem first pioneered adipose derived stem cell therapy for use in horses for tendon injuries, as an alternative to euthanasia. Just two years after the first horse was treated, VetStem treated the first cat and dog. In 2007 the first peer reviewed, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, multi-center study was published showing intra-articular injection of adipose derived stem cells in the hip joint of a dog decreased patient discomfort and increased patient functional ability. That same year Vet-Stem brought to market the Genesis Platelet Rich Plasma concentration system, as well as the first formal small animal stem cell credentialing course. In 2015, VetStem (now VetStem Biopharma) has announced the successful completion of a pilot efficacy study for allogeneic stem cell therapy (90 dogs, multi-center, blinded, placebo controlled) in support of an FDA INAD. Primary end point was statistically significant. The study will be submitted for peer reviewed publication.
