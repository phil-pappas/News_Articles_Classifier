I like the way it’s been put in.” \nShannon said the use of learning management systems such as Schoolnet and Schoology during the past three years has allowed the school to track individual student and class success more efficiently. \nSchoolnet provides instant test feedback and historical data, helping departments to identify trends, weaknesses and strengths. \nThe first class to use it was driver’s education, and it has grown since. \n“The more teachers use technology, the more they like it,” Shannon said. \nThe same could be said for students. \nMorrison said he frequently stops in the library and finds heavy student usage of devices with few problems. \nHalloran said students sometimes are in the library well before classes start using devices to complete their work. \nTo support all of the online activity, the school continues to add network connections and has the infrastructure in place to support growth for at least another three years, Morrison said. \n“It’s a continuous process,” he said. “We’ve received great feedback from teachers on our bandwidth even at peak usage times.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:08:10.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
