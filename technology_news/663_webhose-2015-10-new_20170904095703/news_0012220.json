Those who missed the earlier opportunity to grab the OnePlus 2 invite (or the elusive handset) could make the most of the one-hour open sales window on 12 October without any invite. \nOnePlus will be holding three separate open sales with one-hour windows across several time zones in Asia, Europe and North America. As the time-slots are region-locked, customers across various regions of the globe will get an even opportunity to grab a couple of these handsets with every order. \nThe open sales is not only region-locked with scheduled timings, but also restricted to just two phones per order. In other words, there is no limit on the number of orders you can place during the one-hour window, although you will be limited to just two phones at each checkout. \nHere are the time-slots for the OnePlus 2 open sale across various zones of the globe: Asia: 12:00-1:00 pm HKT Europe: 12:00-1:00 pm CEST North America: 12:00-1:00 pm PDTâ€‹, 3:00-4:00 pm ET \nIndian consumers will be eligible for open sale purchase of the smartphone via Amazon India from 12pm to 1pm without an invite, according to a recent post on the OnePlus forums . Prospective buyers should also note the estimated shipping time for their order at the time of checkout, as it could vary depending on the peak demand and high web traffic, which could result in delayed shipments and delivery times.
