The lignite industry provides some 85,000 jobs in Germany as a whole. \nJacobson said the group's plan \"ensures that the lignite remains buried and that activities are dismantled as soon as possible, but without jeopardising the social structures and energy supply\", promising \"a participatory process\" with communities. \n\"We need the political will from governments,\" she said. \nThe move comes ahead of December's UN-led climate conference in Paris, targeting a global accord to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nmtr-fz/boc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:44.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
