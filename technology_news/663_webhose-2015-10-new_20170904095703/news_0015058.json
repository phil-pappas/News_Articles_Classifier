After decades of being stuck in the lab, quantum science is about to emerge as a technology that will impact your everyday life. If ambitious plans succeed, by 2020 the UK could host the world’s most powerful quantum computer, a secure quantum network spanning the country, and numerous other quantum-powered industries. \nThis mission kicked off in 2013, when UK chancellor George Osborne announced a £270 million investment in quantum technologies. Researchers are now setting up hubs to focus on particular areas – computing, communications, sensing and imaging – and aim to deliver useful quantum devices within five years, starting in 2015. \nThese teams held their first annual meeting, Quantum UK , at the University of Oxford last month to discuss the five-year road map and potential hurdles to overcome – not least the perception that quantum is too weird to ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:45:10.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
