These changes will be rolled out to support customers over the coming months but include automated zone splitting and feature edge refinement. This has enabled some clients to mesh directly from their CAD packages.\nTotalSim has also been progressing its moving mesh capabilities. According to the company, this type of modeling looks like it could be one of the big development areas over the next year. Its applications are endless, from rotating wheels to dynamic sink and trim of sailing vessels.\nThe company is now also using the SIMPLEC (SIMPLE-Consistent) solver. The SIMPLEC algorithm is similar to the SIMPLE algorithm, but has shown to improve convergence and reduce the solution time. This enables larger under-relaxation factors, and hence the number of iterations required for convergence is reduced. This has helped reduce the number of solve iterations by up to 1,000 (25-35% speed up).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:57:22.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
