This hearing will examine barriers, regulatory and otherwise, to the deployment of wireless broadband facilities, infrastructure, and service.\" \nMayor Resnick reiterated that not unlike the majority of cities and counties across the nation, the City of Wilton Manors leverages its land use authority to determine where cell towers can be built, and its permitting requirements to ensure that they're constructed according to building codes. \n\"It's about protecting and maintaining our property values, but even more so, it's about the health safety and welfare of our residents, that we retain such authority,\" said Resnick. \nMayor Resnick has served on the FCC's Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (IAC) for six years and is the current chair for the 2014-16 term. He selected New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to serve as Vice Chair. Resnick and de Blasio serve on the IAC alongside other county, state, municipal and tribal officials, including Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, to advise the FCC on important communications-related issues that affect their residents. Mayor Resnick is also a shareholder and practicing attorney with GrayRobinson Attorneys at Law . \nABOUT THE FCC IAC The Intergovernmental Advisory Committee (\"IAC\"), formerly known as the Local and State Government Advisory Committee, was created in 1997 to provide guidance to the Commission on issues of importance to state, local and tribal governments, as well as to the Commission. The IAC is composed of 15 elected and appointed officials of municipal, county, state, and tribal governments. The IAC provides ongoing advice and information to the Commission on a broad range of telecommunications issues of interest to state, local and tribal governments, including cable and local franchising, public rights-of-way, facilities siting, universal service, broadband access, barriers to competitive entry, and public safety communications, for which the Commission explicitly or inherently shares responsibility or administration with local, county, state or tribal governments.
