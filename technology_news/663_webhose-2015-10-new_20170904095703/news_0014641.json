That helps screens mimic the feel and response of real buttons.\nNidec said it is now planning 90 billion yen ($750 million)in capital investment for the year to end-March, up by a quarter over its initial estimate.\nNidec has not confirmed its role as a supplier to Apple but a company spokesman told Reuters that two-thirds of the increase in spending would be on vibration motors while the rest would go on auto parts.\nThe company reported a 16 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit to 31 billion yen on stronger demand for precision motors and automotive components.\nIt did not change its annual operating profit outlook of 130 billion yen, a 17 percent rise over the previous year, citing China's economic slowdown and uncertainty over conditions in Europe.\n($1 = 119.9600 yen) (Reporting by Reiji Murai; Writing by Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by Edwina Gibbs )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:27:51.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
