So, specifically in our contract, we make the marketplace a broker of the transaction and we actually make all the people doing the work the merchant of record.\n“We’re paying the service person directly and they’re the person that actually takes the credit card transaction, not Airtasker, and Airtasker receives a fee as part of that transaction.”\nHe said that across the payments industry 1 per cent of all transactions were fraudulent, with that number increasing to 3 per cent with online marketplaces.\n“We have a fraud ratio of 0.007 per cent. With other marketplaces they have to hire the fraud guys to run the system, whereas we see ourselves as a managed payments platform. We become their fraud team and we also handle all disputes and refund requests.”\nPromisePay raised $2 million in June and recently hired a president for North America, fintech accelerator mentor Doug Wilber.\nAirtasker chief executive Tim Fung told The Australian that his team had worked hard to improve the user experience in recent months. Previously users had to arrange their own payments for Airtasker jobs, either through PayPal or even cash. “Users should not have to deal with payment when meeting people for jobs, and previously they’d have to find cash or run down to the ATM. It was a real pain,” he said. “We used to use PayPal but users hated it.\n“To pay with PayPal online you would have to go off-site, effectively, meaning you’d have to leave our page and get back to it later.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:46:16.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
