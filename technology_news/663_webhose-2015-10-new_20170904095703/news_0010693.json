As always, RelayHealth is ready to help its customers build on their ICD-10 successes.\" \nProviders can monitor critical industry KPIs affected by ICD-10 on RelayHealth Financial's real-time analytics dashboard at ICD10Central.com . Among these metrics, Berman notes that Days to Final Bill is important to keep an eye on, as it indicates whether providers are generating claims using ICD-10 as efficiently as they did using ICD-9. This number could drop, but should rebound once providers gain proficiency in using ICD-10. If the number dips and does not rebound, urgent attention is required, Berman said. \nVisit ICD10Central.com to monitor real-time Days to Final Bill results across the industry, as well as metrics including Days to Payment, Denial Rate, and Reimbursement Rate.
