Ireland is the centre for so many of the technology companies that transfer these data,\" he added. \nIn ruling the \"Safe Harbour\" agreement invalid, the European court said that \"legislation permitting (US) public authorities to have access on a generalised basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life.\" \nThe ruling also gave national data-protection authorities the power to decide whether existing safeguards were sufficient, clearing the way for Ireland's domestic courts to rule on the issue. \nSpeaking after the hearing, Schrems said the \"big question is going to be if the Irish DPC is going to do its job. \n\"Basically, the law is clear and the facts are rather clear as well so theoretically you could make a decision within weeks,\" he told reporters. \n\"But I don't think the DPC is going to go down that road, so very likely we will see a long and deep investigation and long debates with Facebook.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:23:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
