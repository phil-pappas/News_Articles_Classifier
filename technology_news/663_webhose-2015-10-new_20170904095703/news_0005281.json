Its products have been around since July 2014, and can be found in the bowels of your favorite spa, airport and of course, Amazon.com . They will be in Urban Outfitters this month. With the launch of this ad, the company hopes more people will recognize this alternate (yet efficient) way to freshen-up, even when there’s no time for a shower. The team hopes people will visit the Goodwipes website and obviously wants more stores to carry Goodwipes; It’s goodwipes.com , FYI.\n“This ad is a game-changer!” says Goodwipes President, Charlie Siciak, who is proud of the end result. “We feel our products fit neatly in the lives of men and women on the go, so either you’re in or you’re outstink or swim. Siciak went on to say, “whether you’re in a crowded elevator at Comic Con or forgot you had no running hot water, Goodwipes is the answer to the questionhow the heck do I not feel like a slimy bowl of beef consommé sitting out for three-days?”\nEven actress Lace Larrabee, who starred in the ad, was impacted. “I was less than generous when applying deodorant on our first day of shooting, but after all those takes wiping myself down with Goodwipes, I felt surprisingly fresh and clean! When I got home after that 18-hour day, I didn’t even shower! That’s the kind of impression Goodwipes left on me. And, getting paid to work with the hunky Goodwipes guys didn’t hurt either.”\nGoodwipes are made with natural tea tree oil, peppermint and ginseng for a soft, clean and fresh feeling. The body wipes are individually wrapped and perfectly sized to be your go-toon the go. Although they are big, strong and most importantly biodegradable, they come in pocket-sized packs. But please, dispose of them properly. The wipes are super-durable and much larger than a generic wet wipe. Plus, they don’t dry out the skin or leave behind that all-too-common sticky residue.\nSiciak has a clear approach to product marketing. “Goodwipes can easily throw around big words like “turnkey,” “outside-the-box,” “call-to-action,” and “soap,” but we don’t. That’s not our brand. We just let our attractively priced product create opportunities for plus-up initiatives, potential pop-up stores and sweepstakes. It’s all seamless and organic.”\nCo-founder Sam Nebel wanted to talk too. “We don’t test our products on animals because frankly, many of them don’t care how they smell, and neither do we. We put our wipes in the hands of hygiene-conscious consumers leading active and busy lifestyles who need to feel fresh on the go. When you feel fresh, you feel good. When you feel good, you’re the bomb! I also want the world to know how soft your skin feels after using a Goodwipeit’s like magic! We have something really special here!”\nGoodwipes body wipes are available for both men and women at an MSRP of $8.00 for 10 individually wrapped wipes. So get fresh fast!

They were fed up with the goo-goo-gaga baby-butt-wipe product offerings. Today, with their innovation and design-driven products, Sam and Charlie intend to make Goodwipes the “go-to” wet wipes brand.\nPress Contact: Perry Krasnove, pkrasnove(at)hotmail(dot)com 732-580-0275\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018676.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrCLDNQXdaM", "http://goodwipes.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13018676.htm"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:08:54.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
