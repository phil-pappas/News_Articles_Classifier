The easy-to-use cards provide a step-by-step guide to help young people learn computer languages, such as Javascript and HTML. \nManuel Kohnstamm, Liberty Global’s Senior Vice President and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, said, “Over the past year, our partnership with CoderDojo has gone from strength to strength, enabling CoderDojo to reach more young people and equip them with essential coding and programming skills.
