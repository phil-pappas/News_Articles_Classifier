While this figure is considered to be the least among emerging markets, and almost ten times less than other developed economies, India's huge market size makes it attractive for chocolate makers such as Ferrero. \nFerrero's expansion strategy will put pressure on its competitors in the premium gifting segment, especially during a festive season such as Diwali, when people exchange sweets. \nEarlier this month, Ferrero unveiled a new brand identity and packaging for its premium chocolate brand Ferrero Rocher in the country. \nThe new packaging comes with a QR Code to help consumers understand the ingredients and process that goes into the manufacture of Ferrero Rocher products. \nImage: Chocolate maker Ferrero Rocher plans to invest in India.
