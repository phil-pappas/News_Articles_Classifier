Kearney had forecasted sales in the US$26 billion fresh prepared foods segment would grow at 6-7 per cent through to 2017. \n\"This is up from its 5-6 per cent in the 2007 to 2012 period. This growth will outpace the anticipated 2-3 per cent in retail grocery food and beverage,\" he said. \n\"These healthy 'vending machines' are a great example of innovative and entrepreneurial firms responding to consumer behaviour changes. \n\"We should expect to see these vending machines popping up in office tower foyers, train station platforms, transit hubs, gyms and campuses around Australia.\" \nDr Mortimer said the vending machines' design tapped into the psyche of health-conscious consumers. \n\"Gone are the big flashy, brightly lit machines - in their place are machines with earthy, warm colours and recycled timber facades,\" he said. \n\"It is vitally important for businesses attempting to capture the health conscious, time-poor consumer to use materials that portray rustic, authentic and artisan messages and as well sustainable, re-usable packaging. \n\"Placing fresh salads in non-recyclable containers and selling them from oversized ostentatious machines, simply sends the wrong messages. \n\"Further pushing their social agenda, most companies distribute unsold inventory at the end of the day to charity groups and the homeless.\" \nHe said to further improve convenience, the machines offered pay pass, tap and go technology to enable hungry consumers to grab a quick 'healthy' fix, without the need for loose change. \n\"I would certainly expect to see further extensions to these types of vending machines once the 'fresh' message has been established,\" he said. \n\"We can expect to see fresh Vietnamese rolls, sushi, sandwiches and even heated options, like soup and Asian inspired laksas. \n\"l see no limit to what might be offered.\" \nWhile the healthy vending machine channel is predicted to grow, such food options were sensitive to local demographics, Dr Mortimer said. \n\"I think there will always be a place for vending machines with energy drinks, salty snacks and sweet treats.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:10:36.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
