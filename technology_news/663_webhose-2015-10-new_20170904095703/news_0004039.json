At this year’s Aircraft Interior Expo, it’s all about building a better aircraft cabin and the passenger experience, and it shows in the selection of seminars. Topics include building quieter cabins, cabin cleaning and maintenance, cabin lighting and electronic integration and inflight entertainment.\nJay Richardson, Director of Sales, commented, “It’s great to be back at Aircraft Interiors. There are so many innovative ideas, seminars and exhibitors at this show and we are always looking for ways Ellsworth Adhesives can assist though adhesives, dispensing and other specialty chemicals. Our Engineering Sales Representatives are available at the show to answer any questions on new projects, products and applications or adhesives customization through formulating and repackaging.”\nEllsworth Adhesives is displaying the latest technology of adhesives and dispensing equipment for the aircraft interior design and manufacturing industry. A few of the products Ellsworth Adhesives is highlighting include EP1400 and EP1405 from Resinlab and a Pail Ram Dispensing System from Fluid Research. EP1400 is a two part mineral filled, flame retardant epoxy syntactic foam. It utilizes glass and polymeric microspheres to reduce cured density and improve machinability resulting in a smooth feathered edge. Incorporation of the glass microspheres allows the product to be resistant to crushing and reduction of cured density when pumped under high pressure in meter mix dispensing equipment. EP1405 is formulated to remove the flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether, which is no longer available due to chemical regulations. It is a two-part mineral filled flame retardant epoxy syntactic foam designed for edge fill applications, and provides excellent protection against water, humidity, salt spray and other chemicals. The Fluid Research Pail Ram Dispensing System is designed for bonding edge-fill with syntactics for honeycomb panels. This dispensing system is programmable flow rates and ratios, tool-less calibration, check-less pumps, no pump recharge, continuous flow, and low pulsation.\nThrough their wide variety of value-added services, Ellsworth Adhesives aims to fulfill specialty chemical needs, from initial technical advice through customized product fulfillment.
