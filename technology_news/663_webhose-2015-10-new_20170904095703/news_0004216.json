It is not only the right thing to do, it is the law,” she said. \n“Recently, 48 employees at South Health Campus and across the Calgary Zone were found to have inappropriately accessed a patient’s information,” Kaminski said. \nWithin a couple of hours of the AHS announcement, the United Nurses of Alberta (UNA) released a strongly worded statement saying the “honourable” thing would be for Kaminski to resign because of the way the statement was issued and the confidentiality of employees was breached. The union also disagrees with the conclusions of the AHS about the privacy breach. \n“In this case, United Nurses of Alberta vigorously disputes the conclusions reached by the employer in all cases and is confident that upon application of due process the actions against our members will be shown not to be justified under the circumstances and the law.” \nThe union also said the protocol for issuing the statement was not followed because the union was not notified and disciplinary meetings had not been done with all affected employees. Further, the statement about the breach was widely distributed in a large workplace and identities of the employees facing discipline are well known, and the information was leaked to media. \nUNA believes this a breach of confidence illegal under Alberta privacy legislation. They plan to pursue the matter. \nScott Sibbald, a spokesperson for Alberta’s privacy commissioner, confirmed in a statement that AHS submitted “high-level details” of the breach on Sept. 18. \n“Our office is investigating this situation but considering we handle these situations on a case-by-case basis, and the magnitude of this particular breach, we have to perform our due diligence under the legislation before speaking specifically on these incidents – or whether these incidents will lead to offence investigations,” Sibbald said. \n“More broadly, improper access of health information is becoming an epidemic within electronic medical record systems.” \nSibbald observed that, “The health information of Albertans cannot be treated like a social media site where you can access it and begin to creep on other people’s information, no matter how curious one might be.” \nThis year alone, Sibbald notes there has been one conviction and two charges for improper access of health information. The office is currently handling numerous other breaches that could become offence investigations. \n“There’s a number of other cases, I think more than a dozen, that have the potential at this point to become offence investigations as we collect more details,” he told CBC News. \nIn total, there have been four convictions under the Health Information Act that have resulted in fines, including one with Criminal Code charges.
