The constructed genomes are being used by diverse research and development (R&D) groups across Syngenta as basic reference tools to complement internal efforts. \n\"Our deep understanding of NRGene's genomic capabilities was built upon NRGene's numerous successful full genome assembly projects done on many leading varieties of our key crops,\" stated Dr. Roger Smith , senior team leader at Syngenta in the Genomics 2 Breeding Group. \nDeNovoMAGIC proprietary algorithms enable the full mapping of even the most large and complex genomes, including heterozygous and polyploidy genomes. In addition to the work for Syngenta, DeNovoMAGIC's technology has already mapped the first-ever wheat genome, rainbow trout, and multiple varieties of maize, soybean, vegetables and forestry, among others. \n\"Using genomic data and big data analysis of genomic information in new and novel ways for seed R&D is a key factor in maintaining our competitive advantage,\" stated Dr. Joseph Clarke , principal research scientist at Syngenta in the Genomics 2 Breeding Group. \n\"Syngenta's use of DeNovoMAGIC delivers the basic genetic infrastructures crucial for the cutting-edge genetic tools employed for breeding by the leading seed companies,\" said Dr. Gil Ronen , NRGene's CEO. \"We envision that our collaboration with Syngenta will lead to the development of higher yield, hardier, and more profitable seeds.\" \nAbout NRGene \nNRGene is a genomic big data company developing cutting-edge software and algorithms to reveal the complexity and diversity of plants and animals for the most advanced computational breeding. NRGene tools are being employed by some of the leading seed companies as well the most influential teams in academics and NGOs. NRGene is located in Ness Ziona, Israel . http://www.nrgene.com . \nAbout Syngenta \nSyngenta is a leading agriculture company helping to improve global food security by enabling millions of farmers to make better use of available resources.
