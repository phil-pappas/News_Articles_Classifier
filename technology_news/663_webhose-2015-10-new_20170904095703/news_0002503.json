She said a different approach during the trial would likely not have changed the outcome, and Rhodes would have still been convicted.\n\"In the context of all the evidence, the areas for cross-examination raised by the accused, even considered together, are not significant and, in my view, could not have affected the verdict,\" said Beard.\nRhodes had claimed any sexual activity with the woman during the 2006 incident was consensual. The trial judge found his version of events wasn't credible.\nRhodes' case has dragged through the system for a number of reasons.\nHe first went on trial in 2011 and was found guilty. But his sentencing hearing made national headlines after Justice Robert Dewar suggested the victim may have been partially to blame for what happened.\nDewar called Rhodes a \"clumsy Don Juan\" who may have misunderstood the victim.\nHe noted the victim wore a tube top, high heels and plenty of makeup and cited her flirtatious behaviour.\n\"Sex was in the air,\" Dewar said. Rhodes was given a conditional sentence after Dewar rejected the Crown's bid for a three-year prison term.\nDewar's comments immediately came under attack after they were reported in the Free Press. Politicians of all stripes joined student and feminist groups and those who work with sexual-assault victims in decrying the comments. Many said they feared Dewar's remarks would deter other victims from coming forward.\nThe Canadian Judicial Council, which has authority over more than 1,100 federally appointed judges, launched an investigation.\nThe council decided no formal discipline was required, calling Dewar's conduct an \"isolated incident.\" It noted Dewar agreed his comments were \"totally inappropriate\" and had apologized directly to the victim.\nThe Crown appealed Dewar's decision and a new hearing was ordered, which led to the same verdict but a much stronger sentence.\nwww.mikeoncrime.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:54:15.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
