Excess animals are typically sold to make sure the available food can support the population. Antelope Island is on the Great Salt Lake, about 50 miles north of Salt Lake City.\nBison were first brought there in 1897 with a group of a dozen animals that would form the foundation for today's free-ranging herd.\nThe island is named for its native pronghorn antelope.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:48:07.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
