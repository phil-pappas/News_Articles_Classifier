Most Indonesian CVD patients are under 56 years old and still economically productive. This very young CVD onset raises the question of whether local circumstances may play a role. \nShe continued that infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, measles, chicken pox, bronchitis, tuberculosis and dengue fever are common in Indonesian children. Researchers hypothesised that infections experienced in childhood and adolescence might adversely affect the vasculature and initiate atherosclerosis, leading to premature acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or heart attacks. \nOne explanation is that infection initiates chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis in the arteries, said Qanitha. \"It could be that infection modifies CVD risk factors and leads to ACS.\" \nShe concluded that the findings may apply to other countries in South-East Asia where infectious disease is still prevalent. Here governments and policymakers should have a combined strategy for tackling infectious disease and cardiovascular disease. Early-life infection may be a relatively unknown contributing factor in ACS occurrence. \nThe study has been present during Poster Session 1: Databases, Registries and Surveys.
