The winning team will receive a prize of $2 million, while the second and third-place finishers will receive $1 million and $750,000.\n\"It's essentially capture the flag, but a league of their own for machines to play their own capture the flag against each other,\" Prabhakar said.\n\"Who do you think is going to win?\" she was asked, to which Prabhakar responded, \"A machine.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Rock bottom?
