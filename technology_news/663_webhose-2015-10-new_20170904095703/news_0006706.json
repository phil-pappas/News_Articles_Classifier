Earnings per share exceed the previously stated guidance range of 7-9 cents on a GAAP basis and 14-16 cents on a non-GAAP basis due to a combination of higher revenues and lower than expected operating expenditures for the quarter. Robust licensing demand across the CEVA technology portfolio and acceleration of shipments of LTE based smartphones powered by CEVA DSPs are driving this record high revenue.
