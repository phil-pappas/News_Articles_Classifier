The SB Nation account that was suspended, @SBNationGIF, specializes in such highlights.\nThe main Deadspin account was down for roughly an hour before being re-activated around 8 p.m. EDT, while @SBNationGIF was still suspended.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Twitter+suspends+accounts+after+NFL+complaints"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:24.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
