The old system had vested those powers in a group of India's top judges.\n\"The court said it (the panel) will obstruct judicial independence that is the backbone of the constitution,\" said Prashant Bhushan, one of the lawyers who challenged the new law.\nModi faced accusations of interfering with the judiciary after coming to power last year, when a candidate for a Supreme Court appointment accused the government of running a campaign to block it.\nCritics say the government should have no role in selecting judges and the new panel could lead to politicisation of appointments, but the government says the old system needed to be revamped as it was not transparent.\nCommunications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad defended the government's action, saying several of India's law commissions, charged with considering legal reform, had recommended changes to the old system, which had also worried some top judges.\n\"There was complete political unanimity,\" Prasad, a former law minister, said on Friday, adding that the new panel had been formed after \"deep consideration\" over 20 years.\nSome lawyers, however, say both the old and new systems of appointing judges are not ideal.\n\"A system of judges appointing themselves is imperfect,\" said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer, who does not back the new system because she fears it gives the government the power to influence decisions.\n\"Let's not forget that the government of India is the largest litigant before the courts,\" she said.
