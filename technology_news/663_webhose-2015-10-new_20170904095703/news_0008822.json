It is the product of our focused mission to improve the health of children and is possible because of our R&D, which have allowed us to pioneer methods to influence the behavior centers within the prefrontal cortex of children, conditioning children to make healthy lifestyle choices.”\nThis talk follows a recent presentation during the 2015 MedicineX at Stanford University’s medical school, which is the leading academic conference at the intersection of emerging technology and medicine, where they announced statistically significant clinical outcomes from fooya! in peer reviewed clinical research trials conducted at the Baylor College of Medicine’s Children’s Nutrition Research Center and during the nationwide ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp.
