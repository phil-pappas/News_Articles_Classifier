I especially like old westerns. I watched the 1948 movie \"Fort Apache\" the other night. It stars John Wayne, Henry Fonda and Shirley Temple to name a few.I couldn't help but notice, as I always do with all old westerns, that the movie had hundreds of Indians, but none of them were fat. Why is that? If you are a bowhunter, you already know the answer.Even today with ultra-light compound bows, lightning-fast carbon arrows, super-sharp expanding broadheads, camouflage, scent-eliminating clothing, cover scents and hundreds of bowhunting gadgets designed to increase your odds, killing a deer can be a pretty tough deal. Wouldn't you hate to know whether or not you eat depended on your bowhunting success?Incredibly, the Native Americans did find success. Nearly every Native American tribe, including tribes in Alabama, used some form of bow and arrow as a weapon for hunting. Even though we think of the bows and arrows used by Alabama tribes as primitive, think progressive technology. They were much better than the bows and arrows used by the Native Americans 100 years before them.Bows as hunting weapons date to the Stone Age. Some arrowheads discovered in America have been dated to be 13,000 years old. Arrowheads have been discovered among the bones of extinct animals such as the wooly mammoth. Native Americans had thousands of years to improve the technology.Like the bowhunters of today, each generation of Native Americans improved on the archery technology that their forefathers used. They learned to use stronger wood bows capable of shooting faster and longer distances. They learned to wrap their bows with sinew to make them stronger. They built faster and stronger arrow shafts and more streamlined broadheads, eventually capable of shooting clear through a deer. Just as today, the deer's nose was a major obstacle to taking a deer with a bow and arrow in those days. Native Americans eventually learned to cover their bodies in river mud to cover their scent.Native Anericans shot bows and arrows to survive. They had a lot of time to sit around and think about making their equipment better. We tend to think of the longbows, re-curves and original compound bows that our grandfathers used as ancient technology. I suspect the Native Americans felt the same way about the bows and arrows that their grandfathers used.If you are a a bowhunter, you spend a lot of hours in a tree thinking. I think about the Native Americans on occasion and how they may have once hunted the same patch of land and what they had to hunt with and what I have to hunt with.What they accomplished is downright impressive. \nMike Bolton is editor of Alabama Outdoor News.
