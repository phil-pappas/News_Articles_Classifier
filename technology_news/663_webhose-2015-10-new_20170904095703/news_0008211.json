What distinguishes the marriages that last from those that don't is not how often they argue, but how they argue and how they treat each other on a daily basis.\"\nPoll loading â€¦\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/jparsons989", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorSciTech", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12094/abstract;jsessionid=17FEF2A4691B432028795489E39BFA02.f01t03", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTech"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:48:22.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
