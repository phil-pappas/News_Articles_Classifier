YouTube announced a subscription service in the U.S. called Red on Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015. (Screenshot via YouTube) \nRed targets YouTube fans who want to skip ads, while giving them a chance to pass along some cash to their favorite video creators, who'll share in the new revenues. It comes as streaming services like Hulu, Pandora, Spotify and TuneIn offer ad-free as a paid option. \nThe plan, which launches Oct. 28, includes exclusive access to new videos launching next year, as well as the YouTube Music Key service -- to be called YouTube Music going forward -- for music videos. \nThe original videos will range in length from a few minutes to feature-length movies and come from established YouTube stars such as the Fine Brothers. A subscription will eliminate ads from all YouTube services across devices and platforms except for the YouTube Kids app, which is operated separately. Advertisement \nYouTube still intends for advertising revenue to remain its core business, and executives say they believe it could take a while for paid subscribers to grow significantly, but consumer appetite for ad-free experiences is booming. \nAd-blocking software has become popular on personal computers, and Apple's iOS 9 operating system update last month allowed ad-blocker apps to run on its mobile Safari browser for the first time. Worldwide usage of ad blockers rose 41 percent last year to nearly 200 million people, according to PageFair, a firm that seeks to counter ad blockers. \nAnd yet content providers are finding a way to make money from eliminating ads, too. \nInternet radio giant Pandora Media Inc. made $54.6 million on subscription and other revenue in the quarter through June, mainly from its $5 a month ad-free plan, Pandora One. Its subscription revenue is growing faster than ad revenue itself. \nHulu launched a \"No Commercials\" plan in September for $4 more per month than its regular $8 subscription, and TuneIn added a premium tier for $8 a month in August that throws ad-free music together with audio books and sports play-by-play coverage. \nRed could help boost the ranks of Google Play music subscribers, which stood at around 815,000 in the U.S. at the end of last December, according to royalty tracking firm Audiam. \nThat's far short of leader Spotify with 20 million paying subscribers globally. Apple CEO Tim Cook told a technology conference this week that Apple Music has 6.5 million paying subscribers and millions more still on free trials following its launch at the end of June. \nYouTube is part of Google, a division of the newly created holding company Alphabet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:48:53.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
