Photo: Stewart Allen Source: News Corp Australia\nMalcolm Turnbull says he’s running a 2Ist century government, but what does that mean for 21st century start-ups? We ask the experts what the Prime Minister and his Assistant Innovation Minister Wyatt Roy should do to build the sector.\nThink like a start-up\nPhil Morle, chief executive of start-up accelerator Pollenizer. is a self-styled start-up scientist. It’s not a term he uses lightly. “The reason I call myself a start-up scientist is because science at its heart has a powerful methodology behind it, which is don’t just believe what everyone says to you, go get the evidence around it to prove that it’s right,” he says. “You start with a big idea and then you get the evidence to prove whether it’s true or false. A start-up scientist starts with a hypothesis about what will make a particular business successful and then gathers the evidence to see if that is right. Along the way you prove that some elements of your hypothesis are wrong, you replace those with the correct elements and then the whole thing comes together in a working business model. It’s all evidence-driven and therefore a lot less risky.”\nThe ability to recognise when your equation doesn’t add up and take a few steps back lies at the heart of agility and, according to Morle, a core ingredient of what makes a start-up successful.\nSo what can the big end of town, or government, learn from this agile methodology of a lean\nstart-up? The key lesson, he says, is the approach to mitigating risk one step at a time.\n“You have to force your execution of an idea in such a way that you deal with a series of little failures, like a baby learning how to walk. The government way of teaching a baby to walk is to write a lengthy consultative discussion paper and then push the baby on to the pavement to learn how to walk. The reason we have this waterfall approach — where you write lots and lots of discussion papers — is that at an intellectual level it feels the best way to minimise risk and keep the surface area of risk at a minimum.”\nHe suggests that this legacy needs to be challenged and cites the example of a company such as Tesla: “Tesla is a start-up but it has a government-scale ambition; it’s an enterprise that’s taking the whole planet towards sustainable energy in a commercial way and in a lean way. If Tesla worked like a government works they would have sat down and come up with a discussion paper on what it will take to get batteries installed in every household and probably would have come to the logical conclusion that it’s just economically unviable.”\nGet real\nDaniel Petre, Partner, of venture capital fund Airtree Ventures, warns that with start-ups boasting billion dollar valuations crawling out of the woodwork some are starting to “run away from themselves”. Having lived through the “serious” bubble of 2000, he knows what happens when things go amiss and says that entrepreneurs and investors should brace for a pullback. The current tech wave may not share the same trajectory of the last tech bubble but the days of unrestrained optimism could be numbered. “We’re starting to see the first signs that people are starting to question the valuations going around,” he says.\nHowever, the anxiety is unlikely to derail things in the short-term: “I think there’s no question that because of the cost of building a start-up has come down so dramatically over the past 15 years, from when I first started investing, because processing power costs have gone down to zero, storage costs are going to zero, you’ve got mobile devices, so you can create a start-up for between $50,000 to $100,000,” he says. “Seven or eight years ago it would’ve cost you a million dollars. So I think the ecosystem that produces way more start-ups will continue, because the cost is so low and the opportunities to innovate are so high. There are so many areas that are still going to continue to innovate.”\nBut Petre is a realist: nine out of 10 start-ups fail and professional investors will have to temper their bullishness. “You’ve had this phenomenon globally and in Australia where high-net worths have poured lots of money into start-ups directly. They’ve gone to pitch days and they’ve backed companies. They might be really good dentists or good surgeons but they’re not very good investors. So you get this crazy company with a product but no customers and it raises $300,000 with a $7m valuation. Well that’s just crazy. I think that phenomenon, of a mass amount of money at the angel level, I think that’s going to change a bit.”\nPetre says unicorns — start-ups that have reached a valuation of $1bn or more — may soon become a rare breed. “There have been something like 50 unicorns developed in the US this year, and now no-one believes that three years from now that those 50 companies will be worth a billion dollars or more.”\nStop the talent drain\nTechnology entrepreneur and founder of Nitro document management service Sam Chandler says Australia has had a net outflow of tech talent over the past five to 10 years and is now “net negative” for entrepreneurs. He’s hopeful that they will return given the right policy settings. There are already signs the Turnbull government’s professed commitment to innovation could lead to a talent circulation, rather than a talent drain.\nChandler’s journey may have started in Melbourne but Nitro now has offices in San Francisco, Dublin and Slovakia. “In order to get circulation, people have to leave,” he says. “You shouldn’t stop people leaving, because if they go to Stanford or they go and work in Silicon Valley, or they work in London or Tel Aviv. They’re going to make a network and they’re going to bring back knowledge, they’re going to bring back that network value. That in Australia could be incredibly valuable in the decades to come.”\nChandler adds that there needs to be an emphasis on building network pathways between Australians and overseas businesses and academic institutions, to leverage the world’s best talent and make sure Australian innovators either end up back in Australia or contribute to the local economy in some way.\nHe is candid about how close we came to losing our tag as the lucky country. “To be honest I think if we hadn’t had a change of leadership we probably would’ve ceased to be the lucky country,” he says. “I’ve spent some time with Wyatt [Roy, Assistant Minister for Innovation], and I think he’s the sharpest politician I’ve ever met. And to be that sharp at 25 is scary. I have a lot of confidence in him and Malcolm. If we get our technology and innovation policies right, I do think a lot of Aussies will come back. And I do think that others, so non-Australians, will come here because it’s a great place to start a business or scale a business.”\nChandler says Australia could learn much from Israel, which has a vibrant indigenous, organic start-up scene and Ireland, which laid the groundwork for direct foreign investment with a compelling tax policy 30 years ago. “If we just went and took the three best lessons from Ireland and the three best lessons from Israel, and put an Australian spin to them, we would be orders of magnitude more successful than we’ve been so far.”\nStart speaking digital\nAnnie Parker, co-founder of Telstra start-up accelerator muru-D and founder ofCode Club, says the job of building the foundations of an innovative Australia starts in the classroom, not just in start-up hubs and co-working spaces. These spaces are important but she says that we can’t expect to foster the next generation of Australian technologists unless we start teaching children the language of the digital age.\n“Coding and computational thinking is the next universal language and are the basic steps that are needed to prepare us for the unfolding digital revolution,” she says. “We shouldn’t expect every child who learns coding to become the next Mark Zuckerberg but we don’t teach children so that they can all become Shakespeare.”\nParker, who spends much of her time at muru-D helping start-ups, is passionate about the Code Club — an initiative committed giving every child in Australia the chance to learn to code and develop websites, animations or computer games. She says that as the world becomes increasingly data-driven learning how to code becomes the basic building block that underpins problem solving skills and logical thinking.\n“Our education system is struggling with this and it’s not a question of if we need to change, it’s a question of how?” she says. “Children today know how to be great consumers but they don’t know how to create anything, and that’s a problem. Code Club is a stopgap measure to make children more literate but the long-term solution lies in training our teachers and modifying the curriculum.”\nWith the Turnbull government signing off on the Digital Technologies Curriculum, Parker says it will take time before meaningful changes start to filter through the system.\n“But we will absolutely need to take the teachers with us on the journey, with training programs designed to help their skills. The solution doesn’t lie solely with the government or policy. The public and the private sector both need to get involved (with educational institutions), it has to be a partnership.”\nParker is under no illusions as to the enormity of the task, admitting that the real problem is that the existing education curriculum is so packed that it’s hard to figure out how coding and computational thinking can be accommodated.\nThis story was first published in the Deal Magazine.", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/15/1227569/879950-79d45848-6e48-11e5-8cb9-949f91ef4ac5.jpg", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/the-deal-magazine"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:47:47.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
