The result: a more engaging and detailed 3D streaming map that’s elevated the city’s planning and development capabilities. The City of Fayetteville’s GIS Manager, Richard Tuinstra, spearheaded the plan to design a mapping system that utilized three-dimensional mapping and web-based architecture while getting a high rate of return on the investment. Tuinstra took an approach outside the traditional GIS “box”, seeking content that could run on scalable web architecture. He found CyberCity 3D, Inc., a leader in geospatial city modeling headquartered near Los Angeles, CA.\n\"The City of Fayetteville has always understood the great benefits of using 3D GIS for its daily operations, from Public Safety, Parks and Recreation to Urban Design and Planning, but has found it difficult to get a good start,” stated Tuinstra. “Partnering with CyberCity 3D has made our first steps in 3D GIS a quick and easy process. The result so far has been well received by our City Manager’s office and the City staff members. Some of the great advantages of this mapping system are that it only requires a simple web browser and is very user friendly. We can’t wait to expand geographically and thematically on what we have achieved right now.”\nAccording to the city’s Information Technology Director, Dwayne Campbell, the plan had to include three requirements. “First, it had to avoid costly, time-consuming training and software licensing. Second, the solution needed to be delivered as a software service in an open environment capable of running on all mobile devices. Finally, the city needed a strategy that enabled it to continue to leverage our existing investment in Esri’s ArcGIS software.”\nThe city ultimately chose the combination of CyberCity 3D buildings for their accuracy and interoperability, while looking to CesiumJS.org for its open source 3D globe mapping. CyberCity 3D created more than 550 buildings for the project, from best-in-practices photogrammetry, to insure GIS integrity and flexibility. CyberCity 3D also provided imagery and street names via its streaming images services on the Cesium 3D Globe; as a government institution, the City of Fayetteville pays no streaming fees for the 3D Globe and image layers. In addition, the city requested a tree layer; the existing GIS zoning and district mapping data the city generated with Arc GIS software was also seamlessly included.\n“The unique combination of CyberCity 3D’s buildings, the Cesium 3D Globe, and ArcGIS software create an unsurpassed mapping system for the City of Fayetteville,” stated CyberCity 3D CEO Kevin DeVito. “This dynamic move to 3D will enable the city to best plan for its future while engaging its employees, stakeholders and the community at large in an immersive manner.”\nAs an early adopter, the City of Fayetteville has gone from using 2D PDF maps to owning cutting edge, 3D GIS content on a platform that reaches not only city employees and stakeholders, but every citizen. This dynamic solution vastly increases their understanding of the geospatial elements of the city. Its deployment also allows for the easy addition of other GIS layers such as business points of interest or FEMA poly-layers for environmental planning and sustainability, expanding the map’s usefulness, engagement, and ROI.\nAbout CyberCity 3D, Inc.:\nSouthern California-based CyberCity 3D, Inc. is a global leader in modeling and streaming 3D content for smart cities as well as those who build them. The Company’s core technology is its patented 3D modeling process. CyberCity 3D buildings offer the best-in-class smart data and up to six-inch accuracy.
