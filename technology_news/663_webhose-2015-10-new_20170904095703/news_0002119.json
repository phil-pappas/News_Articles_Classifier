(NYSE: GDDY ), the world's largest technology provider dedicated to small businesses, is revealing its first-ever company-wide salary analysis as part of its push to address gender diversity in the technology industry. The benchmark report delivers on a commitment made at this past summer's White House Demo Day. Over the summer, GoDaddy conducted an audit of internal salary data, which analyzed like-for-like roles and compared how men and women were placed in the salary band for comparable roles. GoDaddy sets its salary bands by role and level based on industry-standard data, and on average takes a market-leading position, which puts GoDaddy's median salary generally higher than those in the industry. For every dollar a man makes at GoDaddy company-wide, a woman is paid roughly one cent more, which also holds true for non-tech women. Women in technical roles at GoDaddy make approximately 99 cents on the dollar, and in the management ranks, women are paid and estimated 96 cents on the dollar. On the whole, women and men are paid close to parity – here is the specific percentage break down: Total Company: women paid .28% more than men Technical: women paid .11% less than men Non-Technical: women paid .35% more than men Management: women paid 3.58% less than men Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276648-INFO The salary gap between men and women in management positions surfaced as a key finding, and is consistent with reported industry trends. GoDaddy is committing to understanding the root cause of the gap so it can create sustainable change. Theories on the gap include potential differences with time-in-role, promotion pacing and attrition. Another potential cause may be the practice of basing a new candidate's salary, in part, on their previous compensation. It's a concept GoDaddy describes as \"paying it backward,\" meaning the lower salaries are passed on as women move from one job to the next over the course of their career. Additional analysis also revealed an absence of women in more senior individual contributor technical roles. The company specifically analyzed software development engineers and software development test engineers, and found that in both categories, the population of women decreases as the seniority level increases.

On the whole, women have a good salary trajectory at GoDaddy, yet we aren't going to stop with this report. Now we have to understand the reasons why we don't have more women represented in some senior software development roles, and the drivers behind gender pay gap at the management level,\" said GoDaddy CEO Blake Irving , who committed to gender diversity when he joined the company in January 2013 . \"There is empirical evidence that shows products created by diverse teams are just plain better. It's the right thing to do, and it's the right thing for our business because it translates to a better customer experience.\" Updated Gender Diversity Stats Additionally, GoDaddy is releasing its overall diversity statistics, and now reports women represent 20 percent of its technical workforce and 25 percent of the company overall. It has increased its women in management roles to 25 percent. And a number reported over this past summer shows GoDaddy has increased its women interns and new college graduate hires from 14 percent to 39 percent, year-over-year, in both categories.

GoDaddy defined \"technical role\" in keeping with the Anita Borg Institute standard ( See Technical Workforce ). Management is defined as all employees with titles that include Director, VP, SVP, EVP or Chief, as well as supervisors or managers with direct reports. Senior leaders are employees who report to GoDaddy's CEO or COO/CFO. \"Over the past year, GoDaddy has made strides in creating a more inclusive community that is welcoming to everyone. Clearly, having engaged leadership is important to driving real change,\" said Telle Whitney, CEO and President of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology. \"I'm pleased to see real progress, but it's important to remember that there is much more work ahead to close the gender gap in technology. Diverse thinking is critical to transforming an organization's culture, from leadership roles to entry-level positions.\" GoDaddy has committed to a range of deliberate actions aimed at holding itself accountable and driving more forward progress, including a pledge to transparency and training. Commitments : Publish gender diversity and salary statistics annually; Work with the Center for the Advancement of Women's Leadership, at the Clayman Institute at Stanford University to conduct unconscious bias training, and to learn best practices for ensuring consistent talent reviews, interviews and hiring processes; Review time-in-role, performance, as well as hiring and promotion practices; Expand recruiting networks and drive a diverse recruiting slate in all roles; and Support and expand internal diversity organizations, such as GoDaddy Women in Technology. GoDaddy ranked as one of the Anita Borg Institute's Top Companies for Women Technologists this year, and is a sponsor and presenter at this week's Grace Hopper Conference (GHC), the world's largest technical conference for women in computing. GoDaddy will be recruiting women who want to help very small business owners around the world, many of which are women-owned. CEO Blake Irving will be discussing transformation and diversity, including the GoDaddy salary analysis during his GHC plenary session, today, Oct. 14, at approx. 4:30 p.m. Central Time .
