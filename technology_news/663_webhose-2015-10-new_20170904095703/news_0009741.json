The hub is the result of a three-year partnership with VISIT FLORIDA to tell the world about Florida’s great outdoors. It can be accessed at http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/florida-pristine-parks/ . This Smart News Release features multimedia.

The new editorial hub allows readers to dive into these picturesque parks by offering insider tips, recommendations of what to see and do, fun facts and nearby areas to explore. \nA stunning aerial photo gallery showcases the parks as seen from above, while another gallery highlights the wide range of activities available to adventure-seekers, such as rope swinging over the unspoiled Suwannee River, kayaking on the crystal clear Rainbow River and snorkeling in Biscayne Bay. \n“National Geographic has quickly become the most prolific distribution partner we’ve ever worked with,” said Paul Phipps, VISIT FLORIDA’s chief marketing officer. “Creating robust and relevant content that tells the Florida story is at the core of everything we do, but, at the end of the day, you have to reach those potential visitors. Our collaboration with National Geographic has provided the perfect combination of incredible storytelling and reach.” \n“We are extremely proud of this ongoing partnership and the launch of the new editorial hub focusing on Florida’s pristine parks, especially as we approach the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016,” says Kimberly Connaghan, vice president and publisher, National Geographic Travel. “This visually rich hub celebrates the natural beauty, wildlife and wonder that are unique to the Sunshine State and demonstrates Florida’s continued dedication to the conservation of its pristine parks.” \nAs part of the partnership, National Geographic is launching an “Explore Florida Outdoors” Instagram photo contest. Photographers are asked to tag their best shots of Florida’s incredible natural attractions and reserves, pristine parks and indigenous wildlife with #FloridaOutdoorsContest and provide brief captions for a chance to win a trip for two to the beaches of Fort Myers and Sanibel. The contest runs from Oct. 14 to Nov. 13, 2015. For complete details and official rules, visit www.nationalgeographic.com/floridaoutdoors . \nEarlier this year, National Geographic Travel debuted the Florida by Land and Water hub, which highlights the 50 best wild and natural experiences in Florida and features an interactive map that captures reporters’ and readers’ recommendations. The partnership also includes National Geographic journalists reporting from the Sunshine State, and shared storytelling on the National Geographic and VISIT FLORIDA websites.
