H-P will also help customers run their software on existing public-cloud services such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, he said.\n“Our own public-cloud offering is not really a core area for us,” Mr. Hilf said.\nBy acting as a broker for other public-cloud services rather than as a competitor, H-P is playing to its strength as a seller of hardware and managed information-technology services, said Cassandra Mooshian, an analyst with Technology Business Research Inc. “This was a well-thought-out, strategically positive move,” she said in a research note published Thursday.\nH-P is the latest of several companies to retreat after trying to challenge Amazon in the cloud. Dell Inc. in 2013 shut down its public-cloud business, and Rackspace Inc. announced earlier this year that it would no longer sell such services.\nThe move frees H-P to focus on its $US28 billion hardware business, which is under threat. Hardware sales declined 1 per cent in the company’s most-recent quarter, while on Thursday Amazon reported that its AWS unit scored year-on-year growth of 78 per cent. The research firm Gartner Inc. said that the public cloud is outpacing corporate data centres in taking on new workloads as measured by computing capacity.\nMr. Hilf said that H-P, nonetheless, has ample opportunity both as a seller of private-cloud technology and as an integrator of other companies’ public-cloud services.\n“We’re not stepping away from our commitment to [the] cloud at all,” he said. “What we’re doing is focusing and deepening our investments in the areas where we have that momentum and advantage.”\nH-P began building Helion Public Cloud in 2010 and rolled it out two years later. But the offering was an also-ran from Day One, according to analysts and former employees.\n“Basically, H-P released at the end of 2012 a product that they hoped would be highly competitive with Amazon’s circa 2009 platform,” said Gartner analyst Lydia Leong. “They severely underestimated what would be necessary to be competitive in this market.”\nIn addition, Helion Public Cloud was plagued by technical problems with OpenStack, an open-source cloud-computing software platform that underpinned the project, according to some former H-P employees. OpenStack was created by Rackspace and NASA.\n“They just didn’t understand how to compete at scale,” said a former employee assigned to the public-cloud project, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to speak publicly by his current employer.\nPressure mounted to generate revenue. However, H-P’s sales commission structure encouraged its sales staff to push hardware rather than cloud computing, according to another employee who worked on the project.\n“Had there been less revenue pressure and had we invented the H-P sales force properly, it would be a very different story today,” he said.\nMr. Hilf disputes this characterisation, saying that H-P’s decision to drop its cloud effort was motivated by a desire to focus on its strengths.\nH-P wouldn’t say how much money it spent on Helion Public Cloud, but Mr. Hilf, who formerly worked for Microsoft Corp.’s Azure cloud division, described it as a relatively small-scale effort. “It was nowhere near the investment profile of an Amazon or an Azure or Google,” he said. Mr. Hilf declined to provide revenue figures or the number of employees assigned to the project.\nWith the end of its public cloud, H-P will invest in its ability to help customers integrate Amazon and Microsoft’s cloud services with their own operations, and it will reassign Helion Public Cloud employees to other jobs within the company, Mr. Hilf said.\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:41:46.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
