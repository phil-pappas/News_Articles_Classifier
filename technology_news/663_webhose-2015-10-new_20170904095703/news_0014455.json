This view from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows battered terrain around the north pole of Saturn's icy moon Enceladus. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute) \nIt will make a much closer pass on Oct. 28, when it will dive through the sprays of icy water spewing from the moon's southern polar region, coming within just 49 kilometres of the surface. Scientists are hoping the close encounter will provide information about the chemistry of the ocean under Enceladus's icy crust and how much hydrothermal heating is going on in that underground ocean. That could provide more information about Enceladus's potential to support microbial life. \nEnceladus is Saturn's sixth largest moon and about 500 kilometres in diameter – less than a sixth the width of our own moon. \nCassini, designed to study Saturn and its moons, was launched in 1997. It arrived and entered orbit around Saturn in 2004. \nIt first witnessed icy jets spraying from Enceladus's south pole in 2005. \nMore recent research suggested there are hot springs bubbling on the floor of Enceladus's ocean – possibly similar to the hydrothermal vents on Earth's ocean floor that support a rich variety of life far from sunlight, the energy source that powers most other life on Earth. NASA's Cassini spacecraft spied this tight trio of craters as it approached Saturn's icy moon Enceladus for a close flyby Thursday. It passed within 1,839 kilometres of the surface.
