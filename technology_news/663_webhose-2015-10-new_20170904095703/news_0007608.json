The electronic miscellaneous document (EMD) standard allows an agent to efficiently purchase an airline's ancillary products on behalf of travellers in the same way they would purchase a base airfare. This will enable Virgin Australia to make their ancillary products broadly available and easy to buy through all channels. \"Virgin Australia is an important Sabre customer and we are wholly committed to supporting their global growth across all their sales channels,\" said Roshan Mendis , senior vice president, Sabre, Asia Pacific . \"Our investments in industry-leading technology and data analytics give Virgin Australia an edge by providing unique insights that they can use to convert travel demand into bookings.
