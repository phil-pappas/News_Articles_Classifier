For the relatively newer devices used in electrophysiology and ablation markets, continued education is critical to increase cardiologists' confidence in these types of cardiac treatments. The EP market is expected to experience growth across all product segments over the forecast period. \nThe more recent products are expected to experience strong growth on a percentage basis but not on an absolute unit or market growth basis simply because newer devices take a while for physicians to adopt. Also, considering the severity of the procedures, it will take years of practice before a device can fully take off. Therefore, most of the devices sold for newer market segments will go towards training and clinical studies. \nThroughout the forecast period, there is expected to be a significant growth in demand for catheter-based ablation procedures due to an increase in public knowledge, technological improvements and an increase in the number of EP labs in rural areas. \nBiosense Webster was the leading competitor in the EP lab system, ablation catheter and diagnostic EP catheter markets. The company has been able to maintain its dominant position in the market by offering a wide range of EP and ablation devices while utilizing their expansive distribution network to improve sales. \nThe company retains its title as majority market leader in ablation. Other major competitors in the market include Angiodynamics, Biotronik, Boston Scientific, GE Healthcare, MicroPort, Siemens, Stereotaxis, St. Jude Medical and Topera. Certain companies, such as Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical, also offer a wide range of EP and ablation products and sell them through large distribution networks. \nThis report covers market segments in: US Electrophysiology Lab Devices Cardiac Ablation Catheters \nThis 356 Page Report Includes: In-depth, Professionally Researched Data That Has Been Formatted and Analyzed to Gain Actionable Insights as Quickly as Possible Executive Summary Market Value Forecasts until 2022 and History Back to 2012 Market Drivers and Limiters Detailed Competitive Analysis for Each Market and Segment As well as contains Procedural Codes! \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:37:55.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
