The front view of the float begins with two bears playfully riding ocean waves, while a sailboat captained by a Sailor Bear rocks gently overhead. A castle featuring Build-A-Bear’s icon, Bearnard, serves as the centerpiece, complete with a friendly, smoke-breathing dragon climbing up to see a Princess Bear, who showers the crowds with confetti. The sides of the float feature different scenes of wonder and adventure including a classic teddy-bear tea party, as well as a trip to outer space on a rocket ship manned by an Astronaut Bear, who turns his head to gaze upon the world as he flies into the air with bouncing stars. \nMore than 50 million viewers tune in to watch the magic of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade each year. The latest design from Build-A-Bear is one of only five new floats that will take part in this year’s event. \n“As we look ahead to our upcoming anniversary, we recently unveiled a fresh look and feel through our new Discovery concept stores, so it was important to reflect that into the design of our newest float in the Macy’s Parade,” added Collins. “On Thanksgiving Day, our float will allow millions to get a peek at the fresh face of Build-A-Bear.” \nBuild-A-Bear is a multi-generational brand that will celebrate its 20 th anniversary in 2017. Since the company was founded in 1997, more than 145 million furry friends have been made. \nIn addition to the Parade experience, this holiday season, Build-A-Bear is once again teaming up with Macy’s to offer shop-in-shops at seven Macy’s locations nationwide so that shoppers can take part in the full Build-A-Bear Workshop experience inside a Macy’s store. \nBuild-A-Bear Workshop will also bring its wildly popular Merry Mission story to life with the return of everyone’s favorite eight reindeer, along with a brand-new face, to stores this season. Glisten, the strongest, fastest reindeer of all time will light the night and help Santa and his team deliver toys to everyone on the nice list.
