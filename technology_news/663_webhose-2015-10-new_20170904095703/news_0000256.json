Image caption Kenneth Williams looks like he'll probably be checking his Facebook despite being in \"vacation mode\" \nFollowing the popularity of Facebook's Celebrate Pride filter (which covered profile picture with a rainbow affect), users will soon be able to set a profile picture that reverts back to a previous one at a specified time. \nIt basically means you'll be able to set a profile picture which backs a particular cause or an out of office-style picture on your birthday or while you're on holiday. Image caption The featured photos section is optional so you won't find pictures of you looking worse for wear on your 18th popping up for a future employer to see \nA third, potentially less exciting, update sees the introduction of easier control over what people see on your page with a customisable space at the top of your profile. \nYou'll be able to write a Twitter-style bio, choose certain details describing your work and education to appear at the top of your profile and pick up to five featured photos to go at the top of your profile. \nThe area will be visible to anyone who visits your profile, but you can control what, if any, information appears there. \nThe announcement follows Facebook explaining that a message some users were seeing that suggests the site was about introduce a subscription fee was a hoax. \nA post on the official Facebook account said: \"While there may be water on Mars, don't believe everything you read on the internet today. \n\"Facebook is free and it always will be. And the thing about copying and pasting a legal notice is just a hoax. Stay safe out there Earthlings!\" \nFollow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:17:49.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
