This compares with 294 million dinars a year ago. \nZain's net profit in the first nine months of 2015 was 118 million dinars, down 27 percent from a year earlier. \nThe operator said foreign exchange losses as a result of a stronger dollar versus the dinar had reduced its profit for this period by $25 million, while the amortisation of recently acquired radio spectrum in Jordan and Iraq had also impacted its bottom line. \nIn Kuwait, Zain competes with Ooredoo Kuwait, a unit of Qatar's Ooredoo, and Viva, an affiliate of Saudi Telecom Co (STC).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:29:32.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
