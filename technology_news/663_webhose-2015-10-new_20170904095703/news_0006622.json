And climate finance mobilised last year, developing nations point out, is no guarantee of what will be available in 2020 and beyond. \nMore recently, the world's poorest countries have also pushed for payouts -- beyond the $100 billion -- for \"loss and damage\" caused by global warming. \nThe United States and the European Union have balked at the concept of \"compensation\", but agreed to engage on the issue. \n- Slashing emissions - \nOne pillar of the Paris climate agreement will be the pledges that nearly 150 nations have already made for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. \nChina, the United States and the European Union -- which together pump out over half the world's carbon dioxide pollution -- have led the way. \nThe emissions reduction plans presented so far, however, would still cause Earth to warm by 2.7 degrees Celsius, well past the danger mark, according to an analysis released in early October. \nIn response, some negotiators have proposed including a mechanism that would encourage countries to re-evaluate and ramp up their efforts over time. \n- Blame game - \nBuilt into the negotiations is the principle that rich countries have been the major cause of the problem and are thus more responsible for fixing it. \nThe talks are taking place under the auspices of the 1992 charter of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which enshrined this principle of \"differentiation\". \nBut wealthy countries insist that much has changed since then, and point out that nations once tagged as \"developing\" have made huge economic leaps and become big polluters in their own right. \nChina is now the world's number one emitter of carbon pollution, overtaking the US, and India is number four. The extent to which the \"differentiation\" principle will stymie progress -- as it has in the past -- remains to be seen. \nTen of the world's leading oil and gas companies vowed Friday to help fight climate change, notably by shifting towards cleaner natural gas, but their promise was dismissed by Greenpeace as a public relations ploy. \nThe initiative to limit climate-altering greenhouse gas emissions comes six weeks ahead of a critical summit in Paris to negotiate a global climate rescue pact. \n\"We are committed to playing our part,\" chief executives of the 10 companies in the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative said in a joint statement, adding that they \"recognise\" the goal of limiting the global average temperature rise to two degrees Celsius (3.6 Farenheit). \nThe companies -- BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance, Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total -- account for nearly a fifth of the world's oil and natural gas production. \nThey said they had already reduced greenhouse gas emissions from their operations by 20 percent. \nThe oil and gas groups foresaw a shift towards relatively clean natural gas, promising to contribute to \"increasing the share of gas in the global energy mix\" without giving details. \nThey also outlined technical solutions including carbon capture and the elimination of \"routine\" flaring of natural gas, which oil groups have already promised to halt. \nInvestment in gas, renewables and technologies such as carbon capture and storage systems, \"will contribute greatly to reducing the cost and impact of climate change for future generations,\" they said. \nAt a press conference in Paris, BP chief Bob Dudley said the big 10 energy firms were competitors but they could also cooperate. \n\"The technology can provide a solution for the future,\" added Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne. \nEnvironmental defence group Greenpeace however derided the initiative. \n\"The oil companies behind this announcement have spent years lobbying to undermine effective climate action, each and every one of them has a business plan that would lead to dangerous global temperature rises, yet suddenly they expect us all to see them as the solution, not the problem,\" Greenpeace campaigner Charlie Kronick said in a statement. \n\"Their latest intervention contains nothing meaningful that will significantly aid the decarbonisation of the global economy,\" he said. \nThe November 30-December 11 Paris climate summit offers an opportunity to make a shift towards clean renewable energy, Kronick said. \nThe energy companies made no mention of carbon pricing, in which the prices of goods and services reflect the cost of carbon pollution, as an option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even though six of the 10 companies had endorsed it in June. \nShell spokesman Jon French said the company \"absolutely\" still supports carbon pricing. \n\"There are a variety of carbon pricing systems that could be envisaged,\" French told AFP. \n\"Ideally, a market-based pricing system would be preferable to us.\" \nCarbon trading -- in which governments essentially issue permits to pollute that can then be traded on an open market -- is being called into question with many critics calling instead for a simple tax on greenhouse gas emissions. \nHome-stretch climate rescue talks set for Bonn Paris (AFP) Oct 16, 2015 - Officials tasked with crafting a global climate rescue pact gather in Bonn Monday for the final negotiating session before a year-end summit in Paris must seal the deal. \nWhile political momentum, backed by civil society, has coalesced around the goal of reining in runaway global warming, the devil is in the detail. \nIn this case, that is a new, streamlined blueprint which observers predict will make fur fly when negotiators reconvene. \nThey will have only five days to thrash out a long list of deeply divisive issues, starting with how to divvy up responsibility for limiting, and adapting to, fossil fuel-driven threats to Earth's climate system. \nThere is also the question of who should foot the bill. \nThe session must yield an \"advanced draft\" to be polished by government ministers and heads of state for adoption at the November 30-December 11 Paris meeting. \n\"There is a lot to fight for at this meeting next week in Bonn,\" said climate analyst Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n\"What the negotiators have to do is ensure that all the options are reflected in the text, that they're whittled down to a manageable few that ministers can grapple with.\" \nAfter the 2009 UN conference in Copenhagen failed to produce a universal climate deal, nations set a new deadline of 2015 for an agreement that will enter into force in 2020. \nThe overarching goal is to limit average global warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. \nBeyond that, scientists warn, lies climate catastrophe: ever-more violent storms, droughts and land-gobbling sea-level rise. \nThe global thermometer has already gone up by 0.8 C. US government scientists have declared July the hottest month in history, and said 2015 appears set to overtake 2014 as the hottest year since records began in 1880. \n- Need to 'ratchet up' - \nThe Paris pact will be underpinned by a roster of national pledges for curbing carbon pollution. \nBut experts say the nearly 150 submissions received so far from nations accounting for 80 percent of emissions, placed the planet on course for warming closer to 3 C. \n\"The big issue for Bonn will be establishing an 'ambition accelerator',\" climate policy expert Mohamed Adow, of NGO Christian Aid, told AFP. \n\"It is vital that a review system is created to track the global efforts and strengthen them over time.\" Yet nations are not agreed on a mechanism to \"ratchet up\" the pledges -- the only way left to stay on the 2 C track. \nAnother stumbling block is money to help developing nations switch to less polluting energy and adapt to climate impacts, such as rising seas, that can no longer be avoided. \nFor many developing nations, their emissions-curbing pledges are conditioned on financial aid. \n- Slimmer blueprint - \nAfter two decades of bickering, Bonn will be the last official chance before Paris to haggle over the wording of the agreement. \nSince the last meeting in September, the joint chairmen of the talks, Algeria's Ahmed Djoghlaf and Daniel Reifsnyder of the United States, have slashed the blueprint from 80-odd pages to 20. \n\"This was a very significant step forward,\" said Greenpeace climate change advisor Jens Mattias Clausen. \nHowever, \"this has come at a price: some key pieces are either missing or have become too weak in the text right now,\" especially provisions for finance and strengthening pledges. \nAs a result, the meeting is likely to get off to a rocky start, said observers. \nYet, hopes are that negotiators will have been bolstered by political signals in recent weeks that world leaders are committed to a deal, they say. \nIn September, the United States and China laid out a \"common vision\" for a \"low-carbon transformation of the global economy this century\", and in June Pope Francis called on the world to take up the \"urgent challenge to protect our common home\". \nUN chief Ban Ki-moon said Thursday he was \"reasonably optimistic\" for a positive Paris outcome. \nFrench climate ambassador Laurence Tubiana said she was also hopeful. \n\"Up until the last, last minute, we will not know what the quality of the agreement will be. But we will have an agreement.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:16:06.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
