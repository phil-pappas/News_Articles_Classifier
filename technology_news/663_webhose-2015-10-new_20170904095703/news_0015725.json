The company's late-stage pipeline includes ARX-04 (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30mcg) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in a medically supervised setting; and Zalviso™ (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients in the hospital setting. \nARX-04 delivers 30mcg sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid, sublingually through a disposable, pre-filled, single-dose applicator. AcelRx has reported positive results from the pivotal Phase 3 SAP301 ambulatory surgery study, and has advanced ARX-04 into a study (SAP302) in emergency room patients. Zalviso delivers 15 mcg sufentanil sublingually through a non-invasive delivery route via a pre-programmed, patient-controlled analgesia device. Zalviso is approved in the EU as well as Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein and is in late-stage development in the U.S. AcelRx submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for Zalviso and received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA on July 25, 2014. The FDA subsequently requested an additional clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness of product changes made in response to the CRL, and the Company is working with the FDA regarding the resubmission of the Zalviso NDA and initiation of a clinical study to support resubmission. \nThe Company has two additional pain treatment product candidates, ARX-02 and ARX-03, which have completed Phase 2 clinical development.
