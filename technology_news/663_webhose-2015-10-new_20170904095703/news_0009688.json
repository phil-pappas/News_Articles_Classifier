In the NASA study, scientists calculated how much strain may remain locked in faults, and they estimated a potential for a quake up to magnitude 6.3. Magnitude-5.8 quake shakes buildings in south-central Alaska June 25, 2015 \nA magnitude-5.8 earthquake has rocked south-central Alaska, but the U.S. Geological Survey says there's little likelihood of damage. 7.5 quake on California fault could be disastrous March 30, 2014 \nExperts say a bigger earthquake along the lesser-known fault that gave Southern California a moderate shake could do more damage to the region than the long-dreaded \"Big One\" from the more famous San Andreas Fault. Earthquake jolts Big Bear area of Southern California September 16, 2015 \nSeismologists have downgraded the magnitude of a light earthquake that jolted the Big Bear Lake area of the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California. NASA study improves understanding of LA quake risks October 21, 2015 \nA new NASA-led analysis of a moderate magnitude 5.1 earthquake that shook Greater Los Angeles in 2014 finds that the earthquake deformed Earth's crust across a broad region encompassing the northern Los Angeles Basin and ... Recommended for you California 2100: More frequent and more severe droughts and floods likely October 21, 2015 \nIn the future, the Pacific Ocean's temperature cycles could disrupt more than just December fishing. A study published in Nature Communications suggests that the weather patterns known as El Nino and La Nina could lead to ... Study finds the warmer it gets, the more world economy hurts October 21, 2015 \nWith each upward degree, global warming will singe the economies of three-quarters of the world's nations and widen the north-south gap between rich and poor countries, according to a new economic and science study. Climate change could affect fall foliage timing October 21, 2015 \nClimate change could substantially alter the timing of the autumn season in New England over the next century, a new study finds – in ways that are not simply based on rising temperatures. Scientists find link between comet and asteroid showers and mass extinctions October 20, 2015 \nMass extinctions occurring over the past 260 million years were likely caused by comet and asteroid showers, scientists conclude in a new study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Life on Earth likely started 4.1 billion years ago—much earlier than scientists thought October 19, 2015 \nUCLA geochemists have found evidence that life likely existed on Earth at least 4.1 billion years ago—300 million years earlier than previous research suggested. The discovery indicates that life may have begun shortly ... Study implicates global warming as a factor in increasing economic losses due to hurricanes October 20, 2015 \n(Phys.org)—A trio of researchers affiliated with Universidad Nacional Autónoma in Mexico, and VU University in the Netherlands, has conducted a study on the source of an increase in property dollar amounts lost over the ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:22:59.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
