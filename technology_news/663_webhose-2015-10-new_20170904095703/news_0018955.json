Apple sets iPhone sales record Technology giant says it has sold more than 13 million iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models since launch. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar.\nHuawei says the watches will be available in Australia from October 16.\nApart from running Google’s Android Wear operating system, Huawei Watch comes preloaded with 40 watch faces. It is water resistant with an IP67 rating, and has a 300 milliampere hour battery which Huawei says will deliver 1.5 days of battery life. Huawei also cites 75 minutes for charging.\nHuawei Watch has a 1.4-inch AMOLED sapphire crystal display with 400x400 pixel resolution, is 13mm thick, and weighs from 51 to 131 grams depending on the watchband.\nHuawei Watch and Samsung’s recently showcased Gear S2 are the new entrants taking the fight to Apple Watch. The Gear S2 isn’t an Android phone, it uses Samsung’s own operating system, Tizen.\nBut both have been designed to pair with later model iPhones as well as Android devices. Google recently released a version of Android Wear for iPhones to make this viable.\nHuawei G8 smartphone. Source: Supplied\nThe G8 phone meanwhile is an LTE device with a 5.5-inch full HD display, 13 and 5 megapixel cameras and a fingerprint sensor mounted on the back. The screen is the same size as Apple’s iPhone 6s Plus.\nIn my initial tests with the G8, the sensor was very quick to recognise my index finger print, although I had initial trouble locating my finger accurately on the back sensor as you can’t see it from the front.\nThe sensor will unlock the phone and restore it from standby mode in one action. You also can press it to take photos.\nThe G8 comes with up to 64GB of storage which you can supplement with microSD card storage. It weighs 167 grams, runs Android Lollipop 5.1, has a 3000 mAh battery, takes a nano SIM, and will run on Telstra, Optus and Vodafone LTE networks.\nHuawei says Australia will be one of the first countries outside of China to stock the G8.\nHuawei MediaPad M2. Source: Supplied\nThe third device, Huawei MediaPad M2 , is a smallish form factor 8-inch tablet around the size of iPad Mini. It’s designed as a media consumption device with a 1080p full HD display at 283 pixels per inch and dual speakers with Harmon Kardon sound.\nIt has 8 and 2 megapixel back and front facing cameras, supports LTE Cat 4, and an “eye protection mode” for comfortable reading. Huawei says it will be available in Australia by the end of October.\nIt is likely to be available on a telco plan and maybe through retailers later. Pricing is not announced though. A version supplied to retailers may support two SIM cards, but details are yet to be announced.\nTomorrow Google is expected to announce a Nexus phone made by Huawei called the Nexus 6P with an even slightly higher 5.7-inch display. The Mountain View company is also expected to announce a Nexus 5X by LG, and to formally launch its new Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system.\nChris Griffith travelled to San Francisco courtesy of Huawei.\nBattle of the smartphones", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/164967-e9e6e3a2-6660-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/163915-5f69c406-6660-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227548/544657-f6af68ca-6633-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/09/29/1227549/163969-6384bc80-6660-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/12/1227523/798528-d4ddd836-5773-11e5-9f97-acb83e2be6e0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:42:52.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
