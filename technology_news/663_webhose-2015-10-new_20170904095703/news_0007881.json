The program is due to run until September 2016 and may go beyond that date if the ECB judges that more is needed to bring inflation closer to the central bank's medium-term target of just below 2 per cent.\nThe ECB's accommodative policy received support Friday from a top official of the International Monetary Fund. Poul Thomsen, the director of the IMF's European department, praised the ECB, saying \"it should continue to stand ready to extend QE, if inflation fails to pick up or if financial conditions tighten.\"\nIn his speech, Mr Draghi said \"headline inflation is expected to remain very low in the near term, until upward base effects relating to energy prices push it up towards the end of the year.\"\n\"Inflation rates are foreseen to rise further during 2016 and 2017,\" he said.\n\"Faced with a more challenging external environment than six months ago, the euro area economy has shown signs of resilience,\" said Mr Draghi. \"However, developments surrounding the slower growth in emerging-market economies are posing renewed risks to the euro area outlook.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:14:05.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
