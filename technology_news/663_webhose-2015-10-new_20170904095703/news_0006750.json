Everybody living in SA knows (or should know) the realities of poverty in our society.The reality though, is that free education is not affordable, unless there is increased taxes, or reduced state expenditure.I do question, though, if as a country we are spending money wisely in the tertiary space. In my opinion there should be a transparent list of the qualification required on an ongoing basis. So many engineers, accountants, doctors, political scientists, psychologists, etc etc.All professions can then be graded from critical to nice -to-have. The grading needs to be a collaborative effort between business, academics and the state.Fee structures can then be graded accordingly. R0 for the critical degrees and full fees for nice-to-have degrees. Whilst this may seem unfair to somebody who wishes to do a nice-to-have degree/diploma, surely the current developmental requirements in SA are paramount and we need to encourage students and tertiary institutions to match the societal needs.\nSo whilst it may be unaffordable to have free tertiary education for all - it may be wise to have some free education where it is needed the most. We cannot as a country afford to pay for tertiary education just for the sake of it. It needs to be directed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:05:50.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
