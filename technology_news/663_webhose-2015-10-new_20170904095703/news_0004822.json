But I just thought, I’m going to shame these selfish bastards on Facebook,” she told news.com.au. \nThe 44-year-old business owner said she confronted a man in a green sedan outside the small Kingston shopping complex on Wednesday when he left his car illegally parked over the two special spots while waiting in line at the nearby post office. \nAfter he refused to move she snapped a picture and posted it for Facebook captioned: “check out this looser. Not only 1 disabled park but 2 ... Then he informed me I was scumbag for taking the photo.” \n“He said ‘I don’t care, dob me in’, so I thought mate, this is it,” she tells news.com.au.
