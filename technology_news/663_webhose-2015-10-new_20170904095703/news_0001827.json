Is this little girl underwater or jumping into the water? Picture: Imgur\nMichael Morrow News Corp Australia Network IF there’s one thing the internet loves, it’s a mind-bending photo just like this.\nImgur user ‘maskari’ posted the image of a girl playing with some water over the weekend, and social media users were quick to point out its weirdness.\n“This girl looks like she’s underwater and jumping into water at the same time,” the caption said.\nAt first glance, the splashes (bubbles?) around the child’s face makes it look like she is swimming underwater.\nIllusion? ... Millions have debated what this girl is actually doing in this photo. Picture: imgur/maskari Source: Supplied\nBut on closer inspection her hair is dry, meaning she hasn’t gone underwater yet?\n“Her hair is dry. She is just jumping in a shallow pool and little droplets have flown around her looking like air bubbles,” one Imgur uses said.\n“She’s neither underwater or jumping in... She’s obviously squatting down in a shallow pool and splashing the water up!!!” another said.\nSince being uploaded the photo has been viewed close to 3.2 million times.\nWhat can you see?
