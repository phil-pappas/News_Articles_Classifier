This has been achieved by fixing the catalysts to separate supports, so that they cannot interact with each other. \nThe polymer support created by Marcus Weck and his group forms spherical micelles with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell. \"The polymer support created by Marcus Weck and his group forms spherical micelles with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell.\" \nThe micelle has the ability to catalyse two reactions to transform alkynes into chiral alcohols, with the help of a cobalt complex into the core and a rhodium complex into the outer shell. \nThe micelles' reactions demonstrate good selectivity, and produce higher yields than either the stepwise reaction, or separate micelles containing each catalyst, which is attributed to the reaction intermediates, diffusing easily between the two layers of the micelle. \nMarcus Weck said: 'In nature, reactions with different conditions are placed into 'pockets' in the cell, preventing the different reactants from flowing together and destroying each other. \n\"We wanted to apply this idea to transition metal catalysis. \n\"One person installs the motor, the next the wheels. We want to build a small factory of catalysts to install several chiral centres in the molecule.\" \nTransition metal catalysts are easier to modify than biological catalysts, which rely on complex protein folding to create chiral pockets. Ligands attached to transition metal catalysts can be swapped out to tune the catalyst's properties. \nTherefore, Weck expects his system to be easily adapted for other reactions with incompatible catalysts. \nWeck and his group are involved in the research of organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science. \nImage: US researchers find way to for incompatible catalysts to work in tandem.
