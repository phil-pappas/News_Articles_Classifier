Entitled “Total View for Total Engagement: New Challenges in Reaching and Engaging the SMB Audience,” the CMO Council report found these attempts to capture the SMB market are likely to fail without rich insights and understanding of the customer, including the ability to quickly identify where valuable prospects exist in order to maximize reach into the market. \nKey Findings Marketers’ SMB strategies are largely rudimentary. Fifty-six (56) percent of respondents admitted that their SMB marketing plans are only somewhat evolved, with 14 percent saying SMB marketing plans either did not exist or were not very evolved at all. Marketers feel that they are being held back by gaps in customer data and intelligence that predict attitudes, values and predispositions in the buying journey. This lack of insight has led marketers to be less than enthusiastic about their media mix (63 percent are only moderately satisfied that their current media mix is effectively reaching and impacting their SMB customer) and the caliber of their customer interactions (61 percent admit their current engagement model needs improvement). Customer-centric B2B marketers are twice as likely to have very loyal SMB customers compared to those who are not. Marketers who prioritize obtaining a 360-degree view of the SMB customer benefit from higher levels of customer loyalty and brand recognition. Customer-centric B2B marketers are ten times as likely to effectively communicate value and engage SMB customers compared to those who are not. More than half (54 percent) of brands are either struggling to define their value propositions in a relevant way or are only moderately effective at engaging to fully realize the SMB market opportunity. \n“More than ever, B2B marketers’ ability to facilitate massive SMB customer growth is dependent on the depth and quality of customer insights and the company’s ability to derive strategies that maximize the reach of marketing efforts based on these insights,” said Angela Zener, senior vice president of marketing at Radius. “Predictive analytics can help B2B marketers target the prospects who are most likely to convert and, therefore, enable exponential business growth. As marketers reiterate the process — discovering new markets, acquiring customers, measuring success and repeating the process based on new insights — success is repeatable, outcomes are sustainable and SMB customer acquisition growth can be truly remarkable.” \nKey Recommendations \nTo effectively position themselves within the SMB market and create intelligence-driven approaches to reaching these customers, the report recommends marketers do the following: Find the right customer. In an environment where marketers have fewer chances to get their engagement opportunities right, quickly identify new opportunities to engage with data-supported confidence. Segment to the opportunity. Look beyond conventional market qualifiers, such as business size, and begin to harness data and analytics to bring key customer signals to the surface in order to identify the right opportunities. Adopt account-based strategies, even when targeting SMBs. Use the same level of customization that would normally be reserved for large business accounts on SMBs, enabling effective messaging at scale. \nThe full report is available for free from Radius. \nAbout Radius \nRadius was founded in 2009 on the premise that finding the best business opportunities is often still much harder than it needs to be.
