Source: Supplied\nLocal start-ups are closing initial rounds of funding like never before but it’s what happens next that’s the real challenge, according to Gareth Berry, chief executive of cloud software start-up Unleashed Software.\nMr Berry, whose New Zealand-based company offers inventory management software and is now pushing into the US and Britain, has completed funding rounds of $4 million, $5.2m and $4.5m in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. He says while the first round is always the scariest, each subsequent raise presents a fresh set of challenges.\n“When we raised our third round in Australia it was really hard work,” he told The Australian. “It does get more difficult each time.” According to Mr Berry, the conversation with investors gradually becomes less about the dollars and more about the fundamentals and the future of the business.\n“When you’re dealing with a brand new set of people and a brand new set of rules, it’s investors who are looking for completely different things,” he said. “They’re not interested in companies that are 20 times multiples of revenue; they’re looking at the fundamentals of business.”\nThat includes the composition of the team, the scalability of the business and its global growth potential, Mr Berry added.\nFortunately for Unleashed, each of its funding rounds has included existing investors and, according to Mr Berry, it all comes down to picking the right seed investors the first time around.\n“Depending on who you get that initial seed investment from makes a big difference in the follow on rounds,” he said.\n“The whole idea is you’re taking that money to grow the business, so you want to be able to demonstrate you’ve used the seed funding wisely to get your idea off the ground.”\n“If you can do that then it gets a lot easier for your existing seed investors to dip in again.”\nUnleashed’s 2015 funding round came courtesy of a range of existing backers, including MYOB founder Craig Winkler. But Mr Berry says that at the end of the day there are some factors, like market volatility, that are impossible to avoid.\nUnleashed was chasing a figure “in the tens of millions” this year, according to Mr Berry, but ended up closing a $4.5m round. “One of the VCs that I spoke to loved me, he loved the business, and said look, I’d love to tip in $4m, but I’ve just seen 40 people this week and the person just before you was looking for two times revenue,” Mr Berry said.\n“So he said that it was much easier for him to double his money in that business than it is with my business. And because of the sheer volume of these start-ups now looking for those second and third rounds, the multiples and the expectations is now enormous.”\n“Unless you’re an Uber, Airbnb and absolutely own your segment of the market, it’s pretty tough.”\nThis article was first published in The Australian Business Review.", "external_links": ["http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/start-ups-fundings-tough-says-unleashed-boss/story-e6frg6n6-1227558037463", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/05/1227558/037436-475ed682-6b1d-11e5-9bb9-94d25a90b8df.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:59:04.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
