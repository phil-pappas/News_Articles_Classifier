Lufthansa is going to be the first airline to roll out such a service for its customers.\nThe digital bag tag developed by Rimowa Electric Tag can be updated via Bluetooth by passengers. The tag stores the similar information as the traditional paper tag that are generally placed on the baggage while check-in.\nThe innovative app will reportedly generate the data which is sent to the digital tag during the check-in process. This will bring down the time and hassle travelers had to face and now they only have to place the luggage on the belt at the Lufthansa baggage drop-off counter.\nThere are added advantages of this innovative digital tag and protects the vital information from low temperatures, humidity or heat. The physical appearance or the shape of the tag is the same as the traditional paper tag.\nLufthansa plans to implement the luggage check-in app from the beginning of the next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:06:13.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
