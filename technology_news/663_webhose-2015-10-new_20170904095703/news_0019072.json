Tenth Ward Distilling Company will focus their products mainly on whiskey but will also be producing some brandies and other barrel aged spirits. They aim to be progressive and a little offbeat by experimenting with unconventional ingredients, recipes and aging techniques.\nThe distillery is on schedule to open in the spring of 2016 at 508 East Church Street. In the late 19th century the area was known as Frederick’s Tenth Ward and served as the inspiration for the company’s name. As part of the industrial area of Frederick, there’s a strong tradition of hard work and grit that the owners hope to carry through their products and the distillery as they begin construction on the space.\nThe founders have started Frederick’s distillery network group, are members of the Maryland Distillers Guild and are excited to be one of Frederick City’s first distilleries in decades.\n“Our area is already known for its craft breweries and wineries. The growing craft distillery industry is a perfect fit for Frederick,” said Richard Griffin, Director of Economic Development for The City of Frederick.\n“A vibrant craft distilling industry brings skilled jobs, visitors and an enhanced focus on locally-produced products.\" said Kevin Atticks, Executive Director of the Maryland Distillers Guild.\nTenth Ward’s equipment is being built by Anthony Zaca out of Washington state. The 2 custom made stills will forge unique small batch spirits, including some limited edition products.\nThe distillery will feature a tasting room and tours and special events will be available for adventurous tasters.\nInterested parties can sign up to receive email updates on the company’s website, http://www.tenthwarddistilling.com .\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001090.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13001090.htm"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:14:32.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
