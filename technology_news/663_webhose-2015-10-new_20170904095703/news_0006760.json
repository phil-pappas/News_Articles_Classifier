The business and technology publication combed the market to identify the top 20 cyber security companies that are making a splash in 2015. \nThe standard enterprise security toolbox constantly leaves those tasked with protecting enterprise data a few steps behind attackers. As the scope and scale of attacks becomes increasingly alarming, the appetite for new and innovative enterprise security tools is heating up to a boiling point. The market is responding with an explosion of start-ups hungry to fill the industry's need for capabilities that prevent, detect and contain attacks. \n\"Necessity is sparking innovation,\" says Chris Inglis, former NSA deputy director and current Chairman of the Securonix Advisory Board. \"We've been defending the wrong things and using the wrong tools for the job, and the consequences have been devastating. The market is demanding better and technologists are stepping up.\" \nSecuronix has emerged as one of the most significant players developing new solutions to ever evolving cyber security threats. The company pioneered the use of behavior anomaly detection capabilities for cyber security eight years ago. It has worked with some of the world's leading enterprises in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, manufacturing, and technology to develop a robust enterprise-class security analytics solution that now leads the fight against their most challenging insider and cyber security threats. \nThe Securonix solution analyses volumes of data at scale and in near real time to establish a baseline of normal user and system behavior, and flag suspicious behavior anomalies. The result is a sophisticated artificial intelligence platform that detects insider and cyber threats in real time. \nAdopters of Securonix have been praising its sophistication and accuracy, particularly its insider threat detection capabilities. Insider attacks were the most costly of breaches in 2015, but are nearly impossible to detect with traditional security tools. The Securonix platform has proven successful at finding insider attacks; unknown attacks, and effectively defending enterprises from new and emerging attackers as it identifies behaviors that indicate threat, rather than just known threats. Securonix is now enjoying widespread adoption at some of the world's largest global enterprises. \n\"We're answering the question that has plagued information security leaders since day one: How do I know when something is happening in my environment that shouldn't?\" says CEO Sachin Nayyar. \"And we're enjoying tremendous growth because of it.\" \nAbout Securonix Securonix is working to radically transform all areas of data security with actionable security intelligence.
