Photo: Mia Matsumiya Twitter profile\nMany women who experience online sexual harassment cope by deleting inappropriate messages and trying to forget about them. Mia Matsumiya, a professional violinist based in Los Angeles, chose to save them.\nFor the last ten years, Matsumiya has collected over 1,000 obscene communications she's received in a folder called \"creepiness.\" Now she's sharing them all with the world, on a tongue-in-cheek Instagram account aptly named @perv_magnet .\nAccording to Buzzfeed , Matsumiya gained a following after she started blogging about her band performances in 2003. Since then, she's received a seemingly endless torrent of sexually aggressive messages on Facebook, MySpace, OkCupid and other social networking sites.\nThe public product of this attention is part modern art piece, part depressing reflection of what Internet users will say behind the safety of a screen.\nAdvertisement \"Five years ago, I wanted to make a coffee table book out of all these f—ed up messages,\" Matsumiya told Newsworthy . \"I thought they were hilarious, anthropologically interesting and would make an entertaining but disturbing read.\"\n WTF? This is so offensive. I only use Colgate.\nA photo posted by Mia Matsumiya (@perv_magnet) on Oct 8, 2015 at 2:38pm PDT\nDespite the dark, explicitly obscene and downright threatening material in Matsumiya's collection - several messages include references to rape and other forms of bodily harm - she approaches the screenshots on Instagram with humour.\nOne message prompted her to say, \"Please someone get me my Purell.\"\nMany of the messages make reference to Matsumiya's race. \"Being 4'9″, Asian American and a musical performer has sort of been a nightmare combination when it comes to harassment,\" she told The Huffington Post . \"It seems to attract an insane amount of unacceptable, predatory behaviour.\"\nThough Matsumiya said she is largely desensitised to the tenor of these messages, she became frightened when she discovered that one of the men who sent her frequent messages had been arrested for stalking another Asian woman.\nWhen the police found him at a public library, she told Buzzfeed , the man had a hard drive containing photos of Matsumiya and hundreds of pages of stories in which he fantasised about stalking and raping her.\nMatsumiya told Dazed Digital that at one point, the harassment became so severe she stayed in Japan for six months, \"barely using the Internet\" until she felt safe enough to return to the US.\nSince the inaugural @perv_magnet post went up four weeks ago, Matsumiya's Instagram account has garnered over 26,000 followers. Many of the commenters are supportive of her project, with some women exchanging horror stories of what - or rather, who - they have encountered online.\n Should I believe him? He says he doesn't stalk! #pervmagnet\nA photo posted by Mia Matsumiya (@perv_magnet) on Sep 27, 2015 at 10:31pm PDT\nOn the other hand, others might as well be featured on the Instagram account themselves.\nA commenter wrote in response to one post, \"in some of these guys defense you are a 5 foot tall Asian whom [sic] is pretty hot I don't have fetishes Per se but I think everyman would be attracted to you.\"\n\"The biggest critics are the ones who believe that I'm bragging about how many 'compliments' I receive,\" Matsumiya told Dazed. \"Have they read these messages? They're so dehumanising, degrading and aggressive. I'm guessing these might be the same guys who actually send these messages.\"\nAccording to Newsworthy , \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" director James Gunn suggested that Matsumiya simply repost some of the comments and keep the Instagram going \"in an infinite loop.\"\nConsidering the state of the Internet, it's indeed hard to imagine Matsumiya running out of material any time soon.\nThe Washington Post", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/perv-magnet-instagram-account-reminds-us-how-awful-the-internet-is-for-women_56180649e4b0e66ad4c7d03f", "http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/newsworthy/a-conversation-with-the-woman-who-saved-more-than-1000-gross-online-messages-2015102018#ixzz3p5Ou4naV", "https://instagram.com/p/8l4unzk8T6/", "https://instagram.com/perv_magnet/", "https://instagram.com/p/8KaIxJk8fc/", "http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/27023/1/woman-documents-ten-years-of-online-harassment-on-instagram", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/a-woman-collected-the-online-harassment-shes-received-in-the?bftw&utm_term=.lkvMKPaB1#.vynVBwD1p"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:08:44.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
