The list price for Praluent is about $14,600 a year while Repatha is priced at $14,000.\nBoth drugs are approved for patients who can't achieve adequate cholesterol reduction on the widely used class of drugs called statins, most versions of which are generic and available to patients for a few dollars a month.\nUsing the combination of negotiated discounts and a special program that requires rigorous documentation that patients are candidates for the drugs, \"we were able to achieve the economics we need\" to include both drugs on the formulary, said Steve Miller, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Express Scripts. Dr. Miller declined to disclose terms of the discounts.\nIn a statement, Sanofi and Regeneron said they \"are pleased that patients in the U.S. now have increased access to Praluent\" and that they are \"decided to establishing agreements with insurers to help achieve that goal.\"\nAmgen termed the decision \"an important milestone for patients\" and said it \"will continue to engage constructively with other payers to enable patients to have access to Repatha.\"\nThe drugs are injectable medicines that dramatically lower LDL or bad cholesterol that is a key culprit in heart attacks or strokes. Large scale studies are under way to determine whether the LDL reduction achieved with the drugs actually translate into fewer such events.\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for Sanofi\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=FR0000120578\nAccess Investor Kit for Sanofi\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US80105N1054\n 06, 2015 18:05 ET (22:05 ", "external_links": ["http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US80105N1054", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=FR0000120578", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T09:37:51.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
