(NYSE: BHE) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. Three Months Ended Sep 30, Jun 30, Sep 30, 2015 2015 2014 ---- ---- ---- Net sales (in millions) $630 $664 $731 Net income (in millions) $21 $21 $17 Net income - non-GAAP (in millions) $21 $22 $23 Diluted EPS $0.40 $0.40 $0.31 Diluted EPS - non-GAAP $0.41 $0.42 $0.43 Operating margin (%) 4.1% 3.9% 3.0% Operating margin - non-GAAP (%) 4.3% 4.2% 4.0% \n\"In the third quarter, we were pleased to deliver a 30 basis point year-over-year and a 10 basis point quarter-over-quarter improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin as a result of continued focus on portfolio mix, lean and operational excellence initiatives, and working capital management,\" said Gayla Delly, Benchmark's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Benchmark's solid profitability results, evidenced by our 4.3% non-GAAP operating margin, were achieved despite lower-than-expected revenues. Notwithstanding our excellent operational achievements, headwinds in the industries we serve challenged our top line. Greater-than-expected demand from Computing customers partially offset end-market demand weakness in the Industrial, Test & Instrumentation and Telecom sectors. Medical revenues were pushed into the fourth quarter due to the timing of program qualifications.\" \n\"We expect our third quarter new program bookings to result in annualized revenue of $110 - $130 million when fully launched within the next 12-18 months. Bookings aligned again this quarter with our focus on early engineering engagement and long-term manufacturing solutions for customers in both higher growth and traditional markets.\" \nMs. Delly concluded, \"Benchmark remains committed to creating shareholder value through a balanced approach to capital allocation, which consists of supporting our business, investing in strategic growth initiatives and continuing share repurchases. We returned $18 million to shareholders through share repurchases during the third quarter, and $71 million over the last 12 months. We also have a strong balance sheet and were excited to announce this morning our planned acquisition of Secure Technology. We remain confident that we are taking the right steps to drive growth and enhance value for our shareholders and our customers.\" \nThird Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights -- Cash flows from operating activities were $78 million -- Cash and cash equivalents were $462 million at September 30, 2015 -- Accounts receivable were $467 million at September 30, 2015, and calculated days sales outstanding were 67 days compared to 68 days at June 30, 2015 -- Inventories were $422 million at September 30, 2015; inventory turns were 5.5 times for both the second and third quarters \nThe cash conversion cycle improved by one day from the previous quarter -- which was four days less than forecasted due to lower than expected revenues. Benchmark continues to execute on improvement initiatives in receivables, payables and inventory, and the Company expects to make further progress in the coming quarters. \nThird Quarter 2015 Industry Sector Update The following table sets forth revenue by industry sector for the referenced quarters. Sep 30, Jun 30, Sep 30, 2015 2015 2014 ---- ---- ---- Industrial Controls 31% 30% 30% Telecommunications 24 27 32 Computing 22 20 21 Medical 14 14 10 Test & Instrumentation 9 9 7 --- --- --- 100% 100% 100% === === === \nOur performance varied by sector in the third quarter, resulting in lower-than-expected revenues across the Company's primary end-markets. Telecommunications revenue declines were greater than expected, while customer revenues in Computing were better than expected. Strength in Computing and new program introductions in Industrial Controls and Test & Instrumentation did not offset the headwinds associated with slower capital spending in the Company's end-markets. Additionally, slower-than-expected new product qualifications impacted revenues in Medical. \nThird Quarter 2015 Bookings Update -- New program bookings in the third quarter were $110 to $130 million -- 16 engineering awards supporting early engagement opportunities -- 21 manufacturing wins across all market sectors \nMargin Improvement Initiatives Benchmark continues to diversify its portfolio into higher-margin business sectors and pursue lean and operational excellence initiatives. The programs drove higher operating margins, and the Company expects further benefits to accrue over time. Benchmark remains committed to achieving its goal of a non-GAAP 4.5% operating margin. \nCapital Allocation -- Third quarter 2015 common share repurchases totaled $18 million or 0.8 million shares -- Amount remaining on current share repurchase program is $51 million -- Over the past three years, more than 50% of free cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases \nIn addition to ongoing share repurchases, Benchmark spent $8 million in the third quarter and has spent $33 million year-to-date on capital expenditures related to improving operations and expanding capabilities for customers. For the full year, capital expenditures excluding acquisitions are expected to range from $40-$50 million. \nFourth Quarter 2015 Outlook -- Revenue between $620-$640 million -- Diluted earnings per share between $0.39-$0.43 (excluding restructuring charges) \nSecure Technology Acquisition Benchmark also announced today that is has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Secure Communication Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Secure Technology\"), a leading engineered products and solutions provider to industrial, defense and aerospace customers, for approximately $230 million in cash, on a debt-free, cash-free basis subject to a working capital adjustment. \nThird Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call Details A conference call hosted by Benchmark management will be held today at 10:00 am CT (11:00 am ET) to discuss the Company's financial results and outlook, as well as the Secure Technology acquisition. This call will be broadcast via the internet and may be accessed by logging on to the Company's website at www.bench.com . \nAbout Benchmark Electronics, Inc.
