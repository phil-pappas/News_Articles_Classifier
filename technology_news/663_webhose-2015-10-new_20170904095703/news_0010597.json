The unique design offers a modern and minimalist design, which includes full-range high definition audio. The Qube+ Bluetooth Speaker and Powerbank tightly squeezes in four full-range, high-performance stereo drivers in the front and complimented those high-performance drivers with two passive subwoofer dishes in the back.\nBeyond the amazing sound quality and gorgeous aesthetics, it uses the latest NFC technology, so pairing is fast and easy. The Qube+ also uses the latest Bluetooth 4.0 chipset to establish the strongest connection possible and most efficient use of battery. It offers everything one would want from a portable speaker, it’s even sand and water resistant. However, before everyone can enjoy the Qube+, Matrix Audio needs help. That’s why they launched this Kickstarter campaign . The goal of this project is to raise $50,000 CAD by November 15, 2015. The funds raised will go towards tooling and mass production.\nTo help bring this innovative product to market, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between November 2015 and January 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. Any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign!\nHelp Matrix Audio reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Warren Palma\nTitle: CEO\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
