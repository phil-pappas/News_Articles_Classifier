In addition, the company also announced that Tom Miller will continue as his role as President. Both Quest and Viascanqdata have signed the agreements subject to certain closing conditions expected to be finalized this week, and subsequently a Form 8-K will be filed with the SEC. \nQuest Solution has scheduled a conference call for its enhanced senior leadership team to discuss this transformative combination. Details on how to access the call are listed below. \nMr. Gaudreault joins Quest Solution from Viascanqdata where he served as Chief Executive Officer prior to the merger. During his tenure with Viascanqdata, Gilles completed the financial and organizational restructuring of the corporations that were consolidated to form the Viascan Group in 2012. Under his direction, multiple entities were streamlined into a unified operation of data collection and management including software design, hardware reselling and manufacturing of labels and ribbons for various applications. \nTom Miller, President and Chairman of the Board of Quest Solution, Inc., commented, \"This is a key step in our efforts to build an organization and a leadership team to support consistent growth and profitability. Gilles has been instrumental in the merger of Quest Solution and Viascanqdata and his strategic experience with organizational structuring, consolidation and integration will be instrumental in ensuring the smooth integration of our two companies. Gilles brings more than 35 years of financial and strategic transaction experience from a variety of industries. His insights, visionary thinking and ability to execute will be invaluable as we move forward as a combined company and further accelerate our growth.\" \nMiller continued, \"By focusing 100% on the role of President I will provide my full attention to the operational aspects of our combined company, while Gilles applies his talent for strategic positioning and financial structuring to the continued growth of Quest Solution. This executive structure combines our complementary skill sets and is an excellent fit for the overall management of our company. Combining our strengths will be of great benefit to our customers, suppliers, employees and our shareholders as we take actions to grow the company both organically and through future acquisitions.\" \nMr. Gaudreault added, \"For over 20 years, Viascanqdata worked hard to build this corporation into one of the leading enterprise mobile computing integrators in Canada. It is a privilege to serve as CEO of Quest Solution as we move through the next phase of our evolution. By this combination of companies we are expanding the scale of Quest Solution by nearly 25%, establishing a U.S. and Canadian cross-border presence and significantly increasing opportunities for cross-selling. Customers are seeking an integrator that can provide bar code labels and bar code printer ribbons with service and data collection solutions with no border between Canada and the U.S., and suppliers like Zebra and Honeywell are looking for an integrator that can service their large accounts in North America. The combination of Quest and Viascanqdata is uniquely positioned to meet this opportunity. Our combined strength will allow us to better serve customers across each of our markets with a wide array of turn-key product and service offerings. As part of a listed Company, we will have better access to capital and the ability to provide greater visibility to our customers.\" \nMerger with Viascanqdata \nThe Quest Solution and Viascanqdata merger is to be effective October 1. Terms of the transaction include the issuance of 5.2 million restricted common shares of Quest Solution to two parties, Mr. Gaudreault and Mr. Kurdi, $1.5 million in promissory notes to be paid out over 48 months, beginning in January 2016 and the assumption of trade payables and other debts as well as acquisition of all assets and inventory in the Company. \nConcurrent with the closing of the merger, the company has signed an agreement for a $15 million facility with Faunus Group International, Inc. (\"FGI\") that is secured by the company's accounts receivables and is subject to final closing conditions. This is in addition to the $4.8 million facility Viascanqdata already has with FGI.

We consider the combination with Viascanqdata a key milestone on our path to building a scalable business with strong returns on invested capital. We do not take the issuance of our shares lightly.
