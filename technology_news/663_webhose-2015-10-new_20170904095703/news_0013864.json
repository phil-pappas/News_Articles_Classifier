However, Amicus said Friday that following recent meetings with the FDA, more time will be needed to complete the application.\nThe monotherapy treats Fabry disease, a genetic disorder that affects about 5,000 to 10,000 people across the world, and possibly more, according to Amicus's website. The disease is caused by deficiency of an enzyme that is intended to degrade a specific lipid, the company said. Buildup of the lipid results in symptoms such as pain, kidney failure and higher risk for heart disorders and stroke.\nAmicus said Friday that U.S. regulators had questions about the treatment's gastrointestinal effects and requested the drug maker to combine two studies in its application. The company said making the changes could take several months but didn't offer specific details.\nShares of the drug fell 55% to $6.14 in late afternoon trading, giving the company a market value of $731 million.\nCompany officials defended the treatment, saying it believes the data supports approval in the U.S. and Europe. They added that it is working with the FDA to determine the best regulatory pathway for the drug.\n\"We do not intend at this point to do a new study,\" Amicus Chief Executive John Crowley said during a conference call, according to a transcript from FactSet. Mr. Crowley said he believed the company had all the data needed to make its case for approval.\nJoseph P. Schwartz, an analyst for investment bank Leerink Partners LLC, disagreed. \"Additional clinical data will be required to bolster the case for approval in the US,\" he said.\nMr. Schwartz, a note to clients Friday, called the company's reversal a \"huge surprise.\"\n\"As recently as Wednesday,\" he said, \"the company said that they were on track to file their NDA before the end of the year.\" The analyst said it appeared Amicus may have misinterpreted earlier meetings with U.S. regulators.\nAn FDA spokesman said the agency doesn't discuss current or pending product applications.\nAmicus said Friday that the company remains on track to receive a regulatory decision on the drug from European authorities. That decision has been expected late this year or early 2016.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nOctober 02, 2015 15:45 ET (19:45 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:14:54.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
