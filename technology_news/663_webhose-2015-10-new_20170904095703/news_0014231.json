The list of consumer products and retail companies pointing at problems with the Chinese economy is growing, with Hugo Boss announcing Thursday that a third-quarter decline in Chinese sales will hurt quarterly results.\nThe companies have ranged from luxury products to fast food, and they’ve cited reasons including poor product launch timing, brand weakness and a slowdown in high-end spending. But the success of one company—sporting megabrand Nike—suggests that a deliberate approach to the Chinese market can help companies grow\nHugo Boss AG BOSS, -11.07% cut full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and special items guidance on Thursday to a 3% to 5% increase from 5% to 7% growth after a sales decline in China during the tail end of the third quarter. And Burberry Group PLC BRBY, -1.92% on Thursday reported that revenue for the six months ending Sept. 30 was down 2% to GBP377 million in the Asia-Pacific region as the company feels the effects of a decrease in Chinese luxury spending .\nIt isn’t just luxury brands that are feeling the pinch. Yum Brands Inc. YUM, +3.57% which owns the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food chains, listed a number of missteps—from introducing a premium product during the Chinese currency devaluation to losing focus on its brand position—when it announced third-quarter earnings on Thursday. The company further lowered its guidance for the year and said it is concerned about Chinese sales.\nSee also: 5 missteps that contributed to Yum Brands’ grim third-quarter results\nChina’s economy is showing signs of life, with the stock market ending the week up 6.5% . This is the second consecutive week of gains, the first time that is happened since August. But it was only two days ago that the pace of price increases in China disappointed, raising concerns that the country wouldn't reach its 7% gross domestic product target by year-end.\nAlso important to keep in mind: The Chinese middle class has overtaken the U.S. in size, 109 million adults versus 92 million. Experts say the middle class in emerging economies will continue to grow, which is expected to stabilize and boost the economy.\nSome consumer-focused companies appear to be succeeding in the Chinese market. Nike Inc. NKE, +1.03% forecast healthy growth in China over the next few years during its investor day on Wednesday.\n“[W]e expect to deliver mid-teens growth in this market over the next five years, with the geography reaching $6.5 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2020,” said CFO Andrew Campion. Nike expects $50 billion in annual revenue by that year.\n“We remain very mindful of the macroeconomic dynamics in China,” said Campion. “But China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity for Nike. Growth in China will continue to be fueled by growth in consumption across a rapidly emerging middle-class. Sport participation is also on the rise.”\nObservers credit Nike with spotting trends and taking the time to learn about Chinese customers, using its marketing budget to establish connections with shoppers there—but the company still has room to grow because it hasn’t reached all of the market yet.\n“Sports participation is growing rapidly in China and Nike’s category offense has only affected 20% of the market,” wrote Sterne Agee CRT in a Wednesday note. “Nike expects to further roll out its grass roots efforts in China to grow the business profitably.”\n“Nike is perhaps the pre-eminent foreign company in building direct relationships with the Chinese consumer outside of Apple,” said Brian Buchwald, chief executive of consumer intelligence company Bomoda. “Nike relies on a stable of superstar athletes, huge marketing budgets for both online and offline, a significant retail footprint, and a meaningful investment in digital communications to stay one step ahead of the international competition.”\nBuchwald believes that companies have too often painted China with general marketing strokes rather than digging into the details of what will appeal to the market.\n“We focused our strategy on the right consumers, categories, consumer-led concepts and cities,” said Elliott Hill, president of geographies and sales at Nike, on Wednesday.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://on.mktw.net/1NbYlPJ", "http://on.mktw.net/1LR4E84", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hugo-boss-cuts-guidance-amid-weak-sales-in-china-1444929769"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:39:16.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
