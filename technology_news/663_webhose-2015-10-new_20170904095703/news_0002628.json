Thayer – and Casey at the Bat (Jays Take Fans On Wild Ride To Remember – Oct. 15):\nThe outlook wasn’t brilliant for the hometeam nine that day;\nThe score stood three to two with scant innings left to play.\nThe ump had ruled against our lads, in the most egregious call;\nAnd, yes, a sickly silence fell upon the patrons, no a full-blown pall.\nA straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest\nClung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;\nThey thought if only Jose could but get a whack at that –\nWe’d put up even money now with Jose at the bat.\nAnd suddenly a Ranger error, and another and another,\nThen Donaldson blooped a hit, and we were tied, oh brother!\nOh, somewhere in this promised land, oh somewhere hearts\nare light;\nYes our man Jose did not strike out, he did his at-bat right.\nThe ball flew high, the ball flew long, on its parabolic arc;\nHis lips curled in a knowing snarl, he flipped his bat to mark\nA shot heard round Toronto fair, where pandemonium supplanted deep despair.\nOh, yes, somewhere in this favoured land, the sun is shining bright.\nThe band is playing some where, and somewhere hearts are light;\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;\nAnd, yes, all this in Toronto, when Bautista clocked his clout.\nGeoff Smith, Kingston\nFor Globe photographer Fred Lum to stay locked in on Jose Bautista in that magic moment after he belted in his three-run homer – and simultaneously capture the collective elation of the players, the fans and, by extension, the nation – is a testament to why great photojournalism remains so essential to telling our stories in print media. That front-page shot knocks it out of the park.\nCam Taylor, Peterborough, Ont.\nYes, we were there. My husband, bless him, surprised me and our four kids with tickets to Game 5. Being the frugal one, I wasn’t particularly pleased with his impulse buy. This quickly changed at the pleasure of getting the kids from school early so we could dress in our Jays shirts and hats and head downtown. They were so excited and full of joy, it was infectious.\nEven people on the subway felt their excitement. The game was just as described by Cathal Kelly, “agony and ecstasy.” Our youngest was so overwhelmed by all the emotions of the evening, he threw up in his souvenir cup on the way home and passed out from exhaustion. What a night.\nYes, we were there.\nLucy Coyle, Toronto\nFans strike out\nMove over Rob Ford, Toronto has a new international embarrassment – the hundreds of Blue Jays fans who pelted the field and other fans with open beer cans and water bottles in their outrage over a correct call by the umpires.\nCathal Kelly saying the team was “almost robbed” (by a correct call?). Verbal garbage.\nTony Carlson, Waterdown, Ont.\nI love the Jays, cheer them all the way, but as a proud Canadian the fans’ behaviour embarrassed me. I know Torontonians believe they are the centre of our great nation, so they should start acting like real Canadians. Polite, respectful, with a bit of dignity.\nRobert Turnbull, Richmond, B.C.\nTrade deal equity\nRe TPP Trade Deal Opens Door To More TFWs (Oct. 15): The comment by Stephen Harper’s spokesperson that allowing more temporary foreign workers is okay, because “Canadians will benefit from the same treatment in the partner countries as their nationals will benefit from in Canada” has a view of equality reminiscent of the famous observation by Anatole France in 1894: “In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.”\nSimon Renouf, Edmonton\nLast one standing\nRe Bullets for Babies (editorial, Oct. 15): Organizations like al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Islamic State needn’t plot terrorist actions against the U.S. They can just sit and watch as Americans, armed to the teeth, waving their Second Amendment and with the NRA’s blessing, annihilate each other until no one is left standing.\nLarry Diamond, Vancouver\nNew-era bribery\nRe Little-Known Law Would Allow Financial Groups To Delve Deep Into Lives Of Public Officeholders (Oct. 15): The era of envelopes stuffed with cash being delivered in hotel rooms is long gone. The new era of bribery consists of transactional payments.\nI saw two of these in my career in finance: The common thread in such undertakings is early retirement, delayed payment and entry into a different business for a limited period.\nThose with nothing to hide should not be inconvenienced by the legislation. Without the “Politically Exposed Persons” legislation, the corruptible will continue to benefit at the public’s expense.\nAlex Doulis, Toronto\nKa-ching, ka-ching\nDoes Stephen Harper’s cash register go as high as $120-billion? That is a conservative (pun intended) estimate of the federal debt he has added since taking power. The Conservatives actually “lost” $3.1-billion in 2013.\nHow can you lose track of that much money? Maybe it’s under the cash box of the register he’s using as a prop at campaign stops this week. Mr. Harper is an economist in the same way Sweeney Todd was a barber.\nJoseph S. Davis, Gibsons, B.C.\nRe Surging Liberals Dealt Blow As Campaign Co-Chair Resigns (Oct. 15): New way of doing politics in the post-Harper era? It’s not even “post” yet and they’re already cozying up to Big Oil. Disgusting.\nFrank Campbell, Regina\nA lot of poop\nRe Ottawa Halts Montreal’s Sewage Plan (Oct. 15): So now that Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq has put Montreal’s sewage dump on hold, is Victoria next? According to the Victoria Sewage Treatment Alliance, Victoria pumps 82 million litres of raw sewage into the surrounding coastal waters every day. This represents almost 30 billion litres of raw sewage per year.\nDermod Mark, Guelph, Ont.\nWe are fortunate to live in a peaceful, prosperous and beautiful country. Is it too much to ask that we clean up our act when it comes to the widespread dumping of raw sewage? Whichever major party makes the commitment to deal with this issue if they are elected will get my vote.\nAs regards niqabs and brothels, quite frankly I just don’t give a …\nMartin Read, Toronto\n Comments A A", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:42:00.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
