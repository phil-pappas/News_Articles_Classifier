The terminal had the alternative of continuing with standard diesel or electric RTG equipment, or opting for an automated RTG technology which introduces remote operators for vertical movements and interchanges with road trucks and terminal trucks.\nThe latter option included extra wide RTGs to allow for a bypass road under the RTGs, as well as ensuring the truck driving area is shielded off by fences from both the stack area and RTG runway area to allow for gantry movement automation.\nRead a Technical Paper from TBA on training for terminal planners \nA spokesman from TBA stated: “The options were evaluated from an operational and cost perspective, and given the particular size of the expansion, manning practice and labour cost; it was difficult to introduce automation with financial KPIs to the operator’s preference.\n“One of the other key aspects in favour of conventional equipment is the ability to easily interchange equipment between existing and expansion area.”\nTherefore the terminal opted for conventional equipment.\n“The different size of RTG equipment is not ideal for operational flexibility. One of deciding factors was the inability to copy this automation solution directly from the expansion area to the existing RTG equipment and yard.”\nTBA performs such analysis on a regular basis, you can review TBA in the PTI Supplier Directory, or contact the company directly at info@tba.nl\nEnjoy TBA's 360 Terminal Experience below: \n \n\nFor commercial reasons the terminal involved cannot be named", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:07.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
