With laptops at their fingertips throughout the day, the third-graders pick up their assignments online, collaborate on work and even blog about what they’re learning. \nAll students in third through sixth grades in the South Bay Union School District are now using their own Chromebooks loaded with educational apps that include the Google Classroom suite, the Epic! ebook library, and KidBlog. They’re creating and sharing documents, exchanging ideas and developing skills as fast as a high-speed Internet connection. \nJennifer Oliveira, the district’s educational services coordinator, calls the approach “technology with a purpose.” Students use Chromebooks in all subjects each day. \n“So it’s integrated technology, not ‘Take out your Chromebook, it’s technology time,’” she said. \nKids in Annabel Coyle’s third-grade class next door are also blogging — and think it’s pretty fun. \n“I think it’s cool because you get to tell (other students) about a story,” said Alysia Perez, 8. \nTeachers pose a literary question to their students, then they log on to KidBlog and write their response. They share their blog entry with other students, who offer critiques, and defend the work with their peers. \nIn Salazar’s class, that’s what Jakim Armendariz is working on during part of the morning’s language arts segment. \n“If I was Charlotte, I would put kind and funny on the web because I like people that are funny people and kind people,” he writes in his blog about the classic children’s book Charlotte’s Web, in which a spider weaves inspiring messages into her web. \nCoyle said having her students so deeply engaged in reading and writing during lessons has given her the freedom to work with small groups and give everyone the attention they need, whether it’s to help someone who’s struggling or give an advanced student an extra push. \nShe also enjoys not having to dictate to students how they get their work done in the class. \n“I give them a menu of things they are responsible for, and it’s up to them to get it done,” she said. “They are learning how to organize themselves.” \nTeachers have attended a series of trainings to master ways to integrate technology into their daily lessons and use the Chromebooks to their fullest extent, including an intensive summer workshop. \n“It’s a little overwhelming,” Salazar said. “I also see it’s very beneficial. It’s a process. I see the kids doing a great job learning, and I’m learning as well.” \nTo extend learning into the homes of its students, the district formed a partnership with Computers 2 SD Kids this year. \nThe affordable technology program offers qualified students and their families a computer, software, training and support, and Cox Cable provides internet access for just $10 a month. \nIf you have a student in the South Bay schools, you can find out more about the program by calling Michelle Syverson at (619) 628-1625.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:17:29.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
