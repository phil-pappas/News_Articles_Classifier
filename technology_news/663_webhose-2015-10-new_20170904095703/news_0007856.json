Hanycz, Ph.D. as the university's 29th President Friday during an inauguration ceremony held on campus. In her speech, Hanycz extolled the value of making education accessible to those who may not have the economic means as a way to uplift an entire community. \n\"La Salle must recommit itself to the mission of providing access to higher education to those in our community who show promise and who might not otherwise have such access. This commitment is one that may strain resources already frayed, but if a Lasallian education is no longer accessible, we will become another tool of injustice and our mission of faith, service and community will be nothing more than a hollow shell,\" said Hanycz. \nShe went on to say, \"Together, we will build the vision for this university. It will be a vision of faith, of hope, of commitment to the future and with service to our students and community at its very heart, and it will belong to all of us.\" \nA copy of the speech can be found here . \nThe inauguration, held in the Tom Gola Arena, marked the first time in La Salle University's 152-year history that the institution will be led by a layperson and a woman. Hanycz joined La Salle University as President this past July from Ontario, Canada, where she served as principal (an equivalent of President) of Brescia University College. \n\"Having worked hand-in-hand with President Hanycz over the last several months, I can attest to the fact that she is exactly the leader our university needs,\" said Steve Zarrilli, Chair of La Salle University's Board of Trustees. \"She is dedicated to our Catholic and Lasallian mission and continues to approach her service to our university in a Lasallian way, with a focus on uplifting the community.\" \nHanycz began her career as a securities and employment litigator for a law firm in Canada after earning her law degree from Dalhousie University in Halifax and a master's degree and Ph.D. in law from Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. In 2003, Hanycz decided to pursue her passion for teaching when she took a position at Osgoode Hall. Years later, after becoming principal at Brescia University College, Hanycz implemented a bold and strategic plan that increased enrollment by 50 percent in five years. \nThe theme of the inauguration, \" Inspired by Faith. Dedicated to Service. United in Community, \" was rooted in the Brothers of the Christian Schools' core values of faith, service, and community. Leading up to Friday's Inauguration Ceremony, a week-long series of events took place for the entire La Salle community to celebrate the university's Catholic and Lasallian heritage and values. \nInauguration Week kicked off with the Lasallian Day of Service on Saturday, Oct. 3. More than 800 La Salle students, faculty, staff, and alumni gave back to their communities by performing service projects at more than 40 locations in Philadelphia and across the country. Additional inauguration events included a faculty and staff panel discussion on \"The City as a Classroom: Lasallian Higher Education in Philadelphia,\" student dinners with President Hanycz, and an inauguration Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. \n\"It has been an incredible privilege to lead La Salle University over the last several months and it is an honor to now officially be installed as La Salle's 29th president,\" said Hanycz. \"Each day that I spend on campus only reaffirms how proud I am to call myself a Lasallian. Just as the Christian Brothers who precede me have, I am committed to carrying the mission of St. John Baptist de La Salle forward and offering a quality and transformational education experience that provides students with the tools to lead productively in their careers, at home and in their community.\" \nLa Salle University was established in 1863 through the legacy of St. John Baptist de La Salle and the Brothers of the Christian Schools teaching order, which St. La Salle founded in 1680. La Salle is an educational community shaped by traditional Catholic and Lasallian values. In a national survey, Money magazine ranked La Salle as a top five college in the Philadelphia region for educational quality, affordability, and alumni earnings, and cited the University as a \"Value All-Star.\" Globally, the Lasallian educational network includes 1,000 schools (60 of which are institutions of higher education) serving 940,000 students in 80 countries. \nContact: Scott Hoeflich \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-inauguration-address-president-hanycz-extolls-value-of-making-higher-education-more-accessible-300157883.html \nSOURCE La Salle University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:03:02.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
