Before you look at your calendar and check to see if it is 1995, let me just remind you of something: Lately, Windows laptops have by and large been, well, terrible.\nEven high-end ones have had poor trackpads, lacklustre keyboards and overly plastic build quality. All of that has stood in the way of a great Windows 10 experience . Heck, I’ve said it for many years: The best Windows laptop is actually a MacBook Air .\nMicrosoft’s Surface Book. Source: Joanna Stern / The Wall Street Journal\nBy announcing the all new Surface Book on Tuesday, Microsoft wants to make sure that this is absolutely no longer the case. And from my short time trying out the device, it seems to be on the right track.\nForget everything you have known about poorly-made Windows machines. The magnesium Surface Book feels solid to the core. An incredibly sturdy, snake-looking hinge keeps the screen locked to the keyboard and brushed metal edges ensure there is no flex. Now, that does mean the 3.3-pound laptop feels noticeably heavier than my 2.96-lb. 13-inch MacBook Air, though no heavier than the 3.48-pound MacBook Retina Pro. (Spec-wise, the Book is much closer to Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Pro.)\nOpen up the machine and the touchscreen pops on. The 3000×2000-pixel 13.5-inch display, with such a small bezel surrounding it, is striking. And below that is a full-size, backlit keyboard that immediately felt very comfortable to type on. One early gripe: The white lettering on the silver color keys is hard to make out under the bright lights of Microsoft’s press corral.\nMicrosoft’s Surface Book stacked on top of an Apple MacBook Air. Source: Joanna Stern / The Wall Street Journal\nSo, how about that trackpad?! Did Microsoft finally fix the biggest problem with Windows laptops? I will need far more time to road-test its performance but so far… it’s so much better than everything else on a Windows laptop right now. Scrolling with two fingers on the glass pad feels smooth in the Edge browser, and swiping three fingers swiftly up brought me a view of all open windows.\nOf course the Book’s insane trick is that it is actually still a tablet. Press down on an eject key and the screen detaches. The hinge really does feel like it can take a beating, though the undocking process felt a bit clunky in my first pass. (On one model I tried, we had to redo the docking process to get the trackpad and keyboard working again.)\nStill, when you consider for a second that beneath the touchscreen are the guts of a high-end PC, it’s simply bonkers. The 0.30-inch thick tablet can have up to a Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. The optional discrete Nvidia graphics card sits in the keyboard along with another battery. Of course, battery life is going to be the real question. Microsoft is promising up to 12 hours in laptop mode.\nHolding the very large tablet in the crook of my arm, I was able to scribble some notes with the new Surface Pen. Unlike last year’s Surface Pro 3 , you can barely hear the pen hit the screen. Even better, on both the new Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book, the pen attaches firmly and magnetically to the left screen edge.\nThe Surface Book’s backlit keyboard.

That’s $500 more than the base Core M-powered Surface Pro 4 with its new keyboard that also has a substantially better trackpad. (It also $200 more than a similarly configured 13-inch MacBook Pro.) Microsoft is betting those who want more performance and a laptop-like experience will pay up.\nI’d wait on my full review before deciding on if paying up is worth it. But after years and years of second-rate laptop hardware, I’d say Windows fans can start looking forward to better days (and start saving their money).\nWall Street Journal", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2015/08/11/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-macbook/", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ431_Surfac_G_20151006160148.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ425_Surfac_G_20151006155901.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ421_Surfac_G_20151006155600.jpg", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/windows-10-or-os-x-a-mac-user-falls-for-the-pc-again-1438106055", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/windows-10-laptops-in-search-of-great-hardware-to-match-great-software-1439316432", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/handwriting-isnt-deadsmart-pens-and-styluses-are-saving-it-1423594704"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:41:28.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
