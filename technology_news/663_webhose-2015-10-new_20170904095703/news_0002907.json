You won’t see much advertising for Subaru, but for the good, solid below the line stuff. My car weighs 1400Kg, I weigh 75kg.\nI feel good about the dependability my car confers. I don’t feel good about the colossal waste. I don’t feel good about my sense of alienation from those who walk the streets.\nI have a client who is doing an urban mobility fair in a European capital. ‘Urban mobility’ is not moving paraplegics from A to B in chairs. It’s about reimagining commuting. I can safely use this marketing buzzword ‘reimagining’ because urban mobility is more like sevens rugby than the fifteen man game. It’s open and fluid.\nThere are obvious health, economic and environmental reasons to cut back on private car ownership. My consideration is simpler. I appeal to the man in the street; or rather the fashionable young woman moving freely, quietly and cleanly along it.\nI offered my client a hipsterish, next gen, new economy riff. “My prediction is that in the future high status individuals will be those who live carbon neutral lives.” This is a variation on the Christian message of humility. Will our value system shift back to medieval-like glorification of the saintly life?\nAnd the truth is I think it would be great if everyone cycles, or walks, to work. And I also think it would be great if we all slowed down. And in fact maybe it’s not the mode we’re using to get there, it’s more our attitude. Why rush? What’s so important that it can’t wait a few minutes? Only two things warrant extreme urgency – when you’re heart stops beating, or you can’t breathe.\nEverything else responds better to slow and steady attention. Research into the behavioral sciences (not to mention common logic as to what constitutes the good life) proves that the tortoise beats the hare.\nBetter to do a few things well, rather than give our distracted attention to lots of different things. Quality beats quantity hands down. Relaxed, focused people accomplish more and waste less. They may not be good for Prozac reps, but they’re good for society. What’s that got to do with urban mobility? Technological change is one side of the equation, the other is a return to balanced living.\nI won’t give up my Subaru just yet. I use it for ferrying children. Joshua (nine) looked at me with new eyes when I he first saw it: “This is the best car in the world.”\nBut, I am wary of the youth’s opprobrium. The last time I asked Josh if he liked my car his response was: “Like…d – past tense.” What had caused the change of heart? Josh, like all youngsters, is addicted to newness, and the novelty had worn off. My dependable tortoise had lost its appeal. Private car ownership is dead. The future, it seems, is multiple car sharing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:10:14.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
