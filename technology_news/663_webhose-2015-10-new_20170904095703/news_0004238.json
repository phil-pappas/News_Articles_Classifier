I am struggling to pay for my daughterâ€™s university fees even if I am working. (I do not want to dwell into my responsibilities as a mother and aunt to late sister's children) I am a tax payer whose child does not qualify for NSFAS and I am paying through my tax handsomely to the NSFAS fund.\nStudy patterns are changed these days e.g. as a public servant, my child must drop out from university and be unemployed and uneducated. Her children will benefit under NSFAS scheme and their children will not qualify under the scheme as they will be working and SO GOES THE CIRCLE!\nMy son completed his tertiary studies which cost me an arm and a leg and am still paying for his study loan. He is doing his internship and his sister is doing her 2nd year at university. I am a single parent who does not give up on her children's education even if it takes wearing the same pair of shoes to work everyday, I am gladly doing it for my children and my sister's children!\nMy take is, NSFAS should be for all but with varying degrees of assistance given.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:19:49.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
