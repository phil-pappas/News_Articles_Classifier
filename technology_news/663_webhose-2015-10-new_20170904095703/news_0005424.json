Burnett, the board's chairman, in a letter posted on the agency's website. ADVERTISEMENT Nevada is home to many legal gambling operations and its treatment of fantasy sports websites would set an influential precedent across the nation. The news was first reported by The New York Times.\nThe move comes just one day after reports that the FBI and Justice Department are investigating daily fantasy sports sites to see if the violate any federal laws. \nThe fantasy sites have been under intense scrutiny after it was revealed that an employee of DraftKings made $350,000 on a rival site and also disclosed key data on customers' picks. That led to concerns about insider trading, though the companies have denied any wrong doing. \nOnline fantasy sites have been able to operate because of an exemption from the federal law that bars many forms of online gambling. They are treated as games of skill rather than gambling, but critics have questioned that treatment. \nThe American Gaming Association said they welcomed the decision in a statement Thursday. \n“The casino gaming industry has repeatedly called for greater legal clarity on daily fantasy sports. We appreciate that the Nevada Gaming Control Board has provided that clarity as well as a roadmap for DFS companies and casinos to provide popular fantasy sports within Nevada borders,\" the group said. \n\"We will continue to seek additional clarity in other jurisdictions, as eliminating ambiguity is in the best interests of all parties, including consumers.” \nThis story was updated at 8:21 p.m. Share on Twitter Get TheHill's free daily Technology email \nFrom Hillicon Valley Team the overnight email is a round-up of the day's top technology stories delivered every weekday morning.
