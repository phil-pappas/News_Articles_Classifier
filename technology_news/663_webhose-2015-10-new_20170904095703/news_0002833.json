It has been criticized for not telling customers for more than a day. \nIt is the third known cyberattack in a year on Talk Talk, which provides mobile phone, broadband Internet and pay television services. \nShares in the company plunged more than 7 percent Friday morning to 248.4 pence ($3.83) on the London Stock Exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:41:34.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
