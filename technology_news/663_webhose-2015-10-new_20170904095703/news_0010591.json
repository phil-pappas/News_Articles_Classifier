The close encounter with the object known as 2014 MU69 would occur in 2019. It orbits nearly 1 billion miles beyond Pluto. \nFlight controllers already have sent commands for the course change. In all, four maneuvers will be needed. Thursday's is the first. \nNew Horizons became Pluto's first visitor from planet Earth in July. The team plans to formally ask NASA next year to fund the mission extension for studying MU69. Scientists promise a better name before showtime. 2 hours ago 1 Image: Views of Pluto through the years July 16, 2015 \nThis animation combines various observations of Pluto over the course of several decades. The first frame is a digital zoom-in on Pluto as it appeared upon its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 (image courtesy Lowell Observatory ... Blue skies, frozen water detected on Pluto October 8, 2015 \nPluto has blue skies and patches of frozen water, according to the latest data out Thursday from NASA's unmanned New Horizons probe, which made a historic flyby of the dwarf planet in July. Ready for its close-up: First spacecraft to explore Pluto July 14, 2015 \nNASA's New Horizons spacecraft was expected to get up-close and personal with Pluto on Tuesday, on track to zoom within 7,800 miles (12,500 kilometers) of the small icy world left unexplored until now. New Horizons team selects potential Kuiper Belt flyby target August 29, 2015 \nNASA has selected the potential next destination for the New Horizons mission to visit after its historic July 14 flyby of the Pluto system. The destination is a small Kuiper Belt object (KBO) known as 2014 MU69 that orbits ... Lead scientist of Pluto expedition has book deal October 1, 2015 \nYou've seen the images from Pluto. Now, the lead scientist of the historic NASA expedition is ready to tell the whole story. Sun provides dramatic backlighting for latest Pluto pictures September 17, 2015 \nThe newest pictures of Pluto are so up-close and personal that the mission's top scientist says it \"makes you feel you are there.\" Recommended for you Hubble spies Big Bang frontiers October 22, 2015 \nObservations by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have taken advantage of gravitational lensing to reveal the largest sample of the faintest and earliest known galaxies in the Universe. Some of these galaxies formed just ... Game theory experts to analyse space debris removal October 22, 2015 \nResearchers from the University of Liverpool are using strategic game theory to analyse the accumulation of space debris, and to assess removal efforts and mitigation measures to limit its growth. Astronomers catch a black hole shredding a star to pieces October 21, 2015 \nWhen a star comes too close to a black hole, the intense gravity of the black hole results in tidal forces that can rip the star apart. In these events, called tidal disruptions, some of the stellar debris is flung outward ... Cosmic 'Death Star' is destroying a planet October 21, 2015 \nThe Death Star of the movie Star Wars may be fictional, but planetary destruction is real. Astronomers announced today that they have spotted a large, rocky object disintegrating in its death spiral around a distant white ... Magneticum Pathfinder: Evolution of the universe in an unmatched precision October 21, 2015 \nWithin modern cosmology, the Big Bang marks the beginning of the universe and the creation of matter, space and time about 13.8 billion years ago.
