It is possible no deal for the company will come of it.\nThe Lexington, Ky., company had a market value of $1.9 billion on Thursday afternoon. As of June, it had more than $1 billion in debt.\nSince 2010, the company has gone on an acquisition spree, snapping up a number of software assets, as it tries to lessen its dependence on the fiercely competitive printing business and move more toward services and software in an increasingly digital workplace. In 2013, it pulled out of the inkjet printing business, though it still sells large format printers and supplies.\nIn March, Lexmark agreed to buy software developer Kofax Ltd. for about $1 billion. Before that, the company had considered striking a so-called inversion deal where it would buy a rival and move its headquarters overseas to a jurisdiction with lower corporate taxes.\nIts transition hasn't always been smooth. Shares of the company are down more than 20% year-to-date, and for the second quarter, it posted revenue of $879 million, a 1.5% decrease from the year-earlier period, and a $36.3 million loss. It also announced it would slash 500 jobs.\nIf Lexmark were to be bought, it would be the company's latest change of ownership. Lexmark was International Business Machine Corp.'s low-end desktop printing division before the business was sold to buyout firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice in 1991. Lexmark currently has about 12,700 employees, according to its website.\nIt would also be the latest in a recent string of mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry. Last week for example, Dell Inc. struck a $67 billion deal to buy EMC Corp. There has also been a wave of semiconductor consolidation this year, with Western Digital Corp. agreeing to buy SanDisk Corp. for $19 billion and Lam Research Corp. notching a $10.6 billion deal for KLA-Tencor Corp. just this week.\nWrite to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com\nAccess Investor Kit for \"NIRI Demo Co\"\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014\n 22, 2015 16:55 ET (20:55 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US4592001014", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:58:57.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
