Seminar Overview\nVirtualizing infrastructure offers significant potential benefits to the business, including faster and more dependable delivery of IT services, and the opportunity to reduce run-the-business costs. As financial services institutions evaluate their range of options, they must balance the business value gained with a number of management considerations, including ensuring that they maintain data security and comply with applicable regulations. This seminar will discuss architectural frameworks for the virtual enterprise, with considerations on the role of BPO, AAAS, PAAS, and IAAS in public and private clouds. Speakers will provide perspectives on selecting workloads for the cloud, defining service levels, and creating security profiles for applications and data. Attendees will gain insights on the management and process impacts of introducing cloud-based services into the environment, with a specific focus on IT service management, cost management, vendor management, and business value management.\nProfile\nFor over 47 years, the Wall Street Technology Association ( http://www.wsta.org ) has provided financial industry technology professionals, vendors, service providers, and consultants forums to learn from and connect with each other.
