The new service helps companies work with devices, networks, data collection, etc.\nSo far, working with devices, security, networks and data collection for Internet of Things applications had been a tough task for online sellers and manufacturers. The Amazon's new service aims at bridging the gaps in this segment.\nWith Amazon IoT, Amazon Web Services' has a new product to sell for the IoT, the most happening space.\nPriced at $5 for every million messages, Amazon IoT is available in beta version now. Amazon IoT has been loaded with device registry, a rules engine and publish-subscribe device gateway feature.\nThese would support the MQTT protocol. Matt Wood, AWS executive, in his presentation on the eve of launching the new service, said: \"There're new C and JavaScript software development kits and an Arduino library to help developers work with the service.\"\nAmazon IoT comes with many features that make the job easier in building applications. One feature called 'Device Shadows' enables users to control devices easily. It doesn't require specific knowledge on how to communicate with the device for users.\nAWS is focusing on Amazon IoT and how to make it connected to other Amazon's services such as S3, DynamoDB, Amazon Machine Learning and Lambda.\nMany technology start-ups have developed several IoT products as well. Amazon has acquired one such start-up 2lemetry this year. GE and Salesforce have also launched services and tools helping companies work on IoT.\nAmazon IoT enables users to use standard gateways and protocols MQTT and HTTPS to ingest incoming data from devices. The pricing is also based on a number of messages published to AWS IoT, which means it involves only publishing costs of users.\nThe latest launch of new service is not an unexpected one. Global media was predicting the possible launch of new service from Amazon for some time. This alerted other IT majors as well.\nGlobal IT majors such as IBM, Intel, Cisco put in efforts on Internet of Things for few years. IoT has become a major focus for global IT companies particularly, online retailers leave no stone unturned in exploring the platform.\nThe $75-bn e-Commerce giant is emphasizing on several ways to make the online platform a place for everyone. It's sending invitations to artisans to come onboard. It has opened an arts-and-crafts bazaar online.\nAmazon has developing tools and applications that help companies, manufactures, artisans to sell their products on Amazon platform, but also build applications from their internet-connected devices.\nFor instance, Microsoft has recently launched virtual product called 'AzureCon.' The AzureCon is a suite of tools for Internet of Things for developing applications. AzureCon comes with a package of tools that helpthe user build and run applications on internet-connected devices.\nIntel, Texas Instruments, Freescale, Beaglebone, Raspberry Pi, Resin.io, Seed, etc, are associated as launch partners for the new Azure certified for IoT program.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.springboardplatform.com/storage/js/ingage/apingage.min.js", "http://mgid.com/", "http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/08/aws-launches-amazon-iot-a-cloud-service-for-internet-of-things-data/", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/08/amazon-announces-aws-iot-a-platform-for-building-managing-and-analyzing-the-internet-of-things/#.ohpask:1M7S", "http://mgid.com/advertisers/?utm_source=widget&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=add", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/business/amazon-challenges-etsy-with-strictly-handmade-marketplace.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:04:06.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
