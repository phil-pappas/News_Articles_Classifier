Intergraph acquired intellectual property rights to New Zealand Police OnDuty mobile application Posted on 12-Oct-2015 21:30. | Filed under: News : Computing . Intergraph has acquired the Intellectual Property rights to OnDuty, a new suite of mobile applications developed in collaboration with New Zealand Police. Under this first-of-its-kind agreement for New Zealand Police, Intergraph Security, Government & Infrastructure (SG&I) will further develop and take to market the OnDuty suite to public safety agencies beyond New Zealand. Once commercialised, New Zealand Police would receive royalties for further technology investment and innovation.\"This agreement is a natural extension of our decades-long partnership and commitment to New Zealand Police, one of the most advanced public safety and security agencies in the world,\" said Steven Cost, president of Intergraph SG&I, who participated in a signing ceremony at police headquarters in Wellington with Police Commissioner Mike Bush. \"The agreement aligns with our global strategy to help advance emergency services' productivity through mobility. We are excited to help take New Zealand Police's world-class technology to the next level.\"OnDuty is expected to help streamline workflow and reporting, and provide greater collaboration, thereby optimizing police time and productivity. It is designed to provide unified access to information from various police systems. OnDuty allows officers to easily receive alerts, view information, update statuses, complete paperwork and attach multimedia files from their mobile devices in the field without having to return to station. Any new jobs created or new information added to existing jobs will be instantly accessible and visible to other team members. The first release of OnDuty is scheduled for November 2015, with more tasking functionalities planned over the next 12 months.\"The global reach of an organization such as Intergraph will ensure the best possible exposure for the intellectual property developed in collaboration with New Zealand Police,\" said Commissioner Bush. \"We expect that agreements such as this will prove to be a fundamental building block to the further success of our Policing Excellence strategy.\"OnDuty was developed under the Innovation through Mobility program, a vital part of New Zealand Police's proactive Policing Excellence strategy. The prototype was created in the police Mobile Innovation Lab and Experience Centre, whose aim is to drive collective innovation among New Zealand Police and its strategic partners, including Intergraph, and the rapid deployment of technologies to benefit day-to-day operational policing.A long-time Intergraph customer, New Zealand Police utilize a suite of integrated solutions, including Intergraph's industry-leading computer-aided dispatch system, I/CAD, and its Mobile Responder app, which has been deployed on more than 10,000 police smartphones and tablets. The global leader in public safety and security solutions, Intergraph helps protect 1 in 12 people worldwide. Intergraph solutions increase public safety and security performance and productivity, while reducing the total cost of ownership for mission-critical IT investments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:15:26.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
