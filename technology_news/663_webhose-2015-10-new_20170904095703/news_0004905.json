What she valued most then was being able to play in her bedroom alone. \n\"I remember practicing for hours by myself throwing a ball at the wall,\" she said. \nIn 2002, she resigned from her position as deputy head teacher of a school in Cambridge and moved north to Lincolnshire to begin life as a hermit in an ex-council house with a garden big enough to allow her to grow her own food and keep a few chickens. \n\"A hermit is a person who chooses to live alone, and does that with the intention of, in some sense, finding God,\" said Denton, who spent time living in a monastery before teaching. \nShe made an official commitment to life-long hermitage in 2006 at a special Catholic mass. \nDenton, whose LinkedIn page is immaculately maintained, earns a living through calligraphy and by designing and producing bespoke stationery and cards, although she says she doesn't attract \"hoards of customers.\" \nShe also writes for a church publication about some of the trials and tribulations of hermitic life, such as her regular attempts to defend her garden from moles. \nEarlier this year, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. \"The possibility of death is always there,\" she said, her head shaved bare following chemotherapy. \nDue to her presence online, followers started a campaign to raise money for other cancer sufferers and social media helped her find support. She said this proved how valuable a tool the Internet is for those living alone. \nBut her diagnosis has not changed her need for isolation. \n\"It was interesting when I got cancer because you make a bucket list and my bucket list was to spend my life as a hermit,\" she said.
