The search took place for a total of six days, and was officially suspended on Wednesday October 7, 2015 at sundown.\nScott Buschman, Rear Admiral Commander at Coast Guard Seventh District said: “I have come to a very difficult decision to suspend the search for the crew of the El Faro at sunset tonight.\n“My deepest condolences go to the families, loved ones, and friends of the El Faro crew. US Coast Guard, US Navy, US Air Force, and the Tote Maritime tug crews searched day and night, sometimes in perilous conditions with the hope of finding survivors in this tragic loss.”\nCommunication was lost on Thursday morning after the Coast Guard received a satellite notification from the crew stating that the ship had lost power.\nAnthony Chiarello, President and CEO of Tote Maritime, said: “It is with heavy hearts this afternoon that we learn the Coast Guard has suspended their search for survivors.\n“Our focus has been on supporting and caring for the family members, loved ones, and friends of those aboard the El Faro. The Coast Guard’s announcement will not change the support that TOTE extends to those affected by this tragic event: though the search may be over, their grief, and ours, is not. We will continue to focus our attention on the families and loved ones.”\nThere were believed to be around 28 US citizens and five polish nationals aboard the cargo ship before it collided with Hurricane Joaquin, causing the ship to sink.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:50:28.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
