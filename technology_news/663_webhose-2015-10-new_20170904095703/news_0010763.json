Schools will also have the opportunity to advance through each phase of the contest: State Finalists – Five schools from each state and the District will be chosen as State Finalists, and all 255 schools will receive two Samsung Galaxy Tab® – a total prize package of nearly $800. State Finalists will be announced in November 2015. State Winners – One school from each state will be named a State Winner and all 51 winners will receive approximately $20,000 in Samsung technology.
