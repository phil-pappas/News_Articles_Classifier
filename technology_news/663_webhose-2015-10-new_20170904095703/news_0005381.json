He described a rate rise by year's end as plausible.\nMr Lacker's interview with the television channel came as the outlook for US central bank policy has fallen into flux. Officials held off on raising key rates off the current near-zero level at their mid-September meeting in a bid to take stock of how worrisome international events might affect an otherwise healthy US economic outlook.\nMr Lacker dissented against the decision of his colleagues then and said the time had arrived to raise rates. Since that gathering, a number of Fed officials have continued to argue in favour of raising rates this year, but most agree that path is contingent on how the economy performs.\nGiven the Fed's current concerns, most observers are looking to its December policy meeting as a potential time to act, with the coming October gathering unlikely to result in a change in rates.\nBut even as regional Fed bank bosses have been arguing in favour of rate increases, several Washington-based governors have muddied the waters considerably over recent days.\nIn a speech on Monday, Lael Brainard said uncertainties over the outlook due to global events are making it harder to know when rates might go up. On Tuesday, Daniel Tarullo said in a CNBC interview that \"right now my expectation is, given where I think the economy would go, I wouldn't expect it would be appropriate to raise rates\" this year.\nThe caution shown by Fed governors, especially Mr Tarullo, is particularly notable for the fact that these officials usually move in lockstep with the central bank's leader.\nFed chair Janet Yellen said late last month she still expected to boost rates this year, so central bank watchers are trying to glean from the shifting views of the two governors a sign of whether Ms Yellen is also now less supportive of a 2015 rate boost.\nRegional bank officials such as Mr Lacker believe the US economy has essentially met the Fed's goals for hiring and inflation, citing a jobless rate that is largely at the level where they expect it to stand in the longer run.\nWhile the Fed has fallen short of hitting its 2 per cent price target for more than three years and officials don't expect it to hit that level until 2018, a number of Fed officials blame weak price gains on temporary factors and are confident inflation will return to desired levels over time.\nMr Lacker said in the TV interview that he was confident the inflation rate would increase back to target over time. He also said an ebbing in the rate of hiring may have a very positive message, explaining \"it's unlikely there's any meaningful slack left in the labor market, and it's quite plausible the slowdown in the labour market reflects the increasing difficulty some firms are facing in finding qualified workers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:54:51.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
