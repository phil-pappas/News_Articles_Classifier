Individuals with locations suitable for various events can also upload their locations to the app for renting purposes. \nDirector of Data at Airtel Ghana, Jean Claude Domilongo stated in a statement released by the Smartphone Network, “We are excited to announce that E-Coach is the ultimate winner for the Airtel Ghana App Challenge for developing a truly unique and original App that will add value to the Ghanaian society as a whole.

E-coach will be leaving for Singapore on Sunday 18, October for a fully paid two day mentoring session to shape and prepare them towards the final global event to be held on 8th December.” The overall winner of the App challenge stands a chance of benefitting from an investment of USD 170,000 and a personal cash reward. “All finalists will also have the opportunity to market with the Singtel Group of operators, and our 560 million-strong customer base when the app is commercially-ready,” Jean Claude said.\nAccording to him, Airtel believes in the power of potential - that each and every one has in them the ability to realise their full potential which is why each of the 82 “Appsters” who participated in the intensely contested challenge would be assisted by the company to nurture their potentials to the fullest. “At Airtel, we believe in empowering people to realise their full potential – we create and provide the enabling environment for people to shine”.
