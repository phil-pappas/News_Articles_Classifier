SPET products allow researchers and clinicians to quickly and accurately enrich biologic samples for sensitive detection of a wide range of genomic markers including mutations, SNPs, indels, gene fusions, alternately spliced transcripts and copy number variants.\nThe new NuGEN-application, published on BaseSpace on September 30, provides an intuitive user interface for uploading sequence data. The application performs quality trimming and probe trimming on the parsed data – removing data derived from bases with low sequencing quality scores and aligning high quality data to the UCSC human reference genome.\n Subsequently, PCR duplicate reads created during the library amplification process are identified using a random N6 sequence, unique to the Ovation Target Enrichment System workflow positioned adjacent to the barcode index.\nOutput files from the Ovation Target Enrichment System Data Processing Application for BaseSpace include processed BAM files with PCR duplicates removed or marked, processed FASTQ files with duplicates removed, and UCSC bigWig tracks with duplicates removed for visualization using the UCSC human genome browser.\n For full details, visit http://www.nugen.com/content/ovation-target-enrichment-system-data-processing-application .\nNuGEN Technologies Inc. is a rapidly-growing, privately-held company providing innovative products and systems for the preparation of biologic samples for targeted genomic analysis. Founded in 2000 and based in San Carlos, CA, NuGEN has long been at the cutting edge of genomic technology, with accurate, cost-effective reagent kits for even the most challenging sample types. NuGEN products are used in more than 1000 leading life science institutes and in diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies in 40 countries.\nMedia Contacts:\nAnita Harris, Harris Communications Group , anita.m.harris at harriscom.com\nCarol Short, This email address is being protected from spambots.
