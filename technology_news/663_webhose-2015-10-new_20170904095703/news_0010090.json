Samson Oct 3, 2015 Over the years, the applications of precision nozzles have expanded to a bunch of industrial processes, with a range of fluid materials with different properties being used, from conductive adhesives, damning compound, and solder paste to thermal paste, under fills, and fluxes.Depending on the fluid properties, there are a number of options for dispensing equipment that can be used, ranging from manual syringes to high-volume automated dispensing systems. The ideal equipment depends on several factors, including labor/equipment cost, volume, type of material being dispensed, and precision requirements. It is also important to take into consideration how the equipment interacts with the material. In other words, the material and delivery system should be compatible to maximize equipment life and maintain fluid properties.Thermally conductive dispensable materialsThere are different thermal interface materials that can be used with precision nozzles, including:1. THERM-A-GAP GELS These thermal materials are high performance, dispensable, and fully cured. Their single-component, cross-linked framework allows for superior performance and long-term thermal stability with minimal closure forces.These Gels are largely conformable, providing low thermal resistance like greases. However, they are created in a way they can overcome the pump-out and dry-out concerns associated with grease.Their design also allows dispense in applications that need low compression forces and low thermal resistance for optimal thermal performance. This makes them ideal for filling gaps of variable thickness in a single application.Typical applications include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:03:11.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
