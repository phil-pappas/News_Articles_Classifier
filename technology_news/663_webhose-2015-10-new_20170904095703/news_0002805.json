From designs and prototypes to solutions, the Korean marine sector, which is worth US$85 billion to South Korea, is looking at this innovation in four key ways:\n1) Enabling data-driven operational efficiency \nCreating software that enables data-driven decision-making in fleet and operational planning by collecting and making sense of the massive flow of data relating to the condition of individual components from multiple networks is essential.\nThis is because data can be used to spot patterns that might indicate the need for alterations to duty cycles that could improve the efficiency of the fleet, therefore maximising revenues.\nDigital technologies can also help reduce fuel consumption, lowering the risk of potential restrictions on sea routes.\n2) Faster and better services \nCurrently, few vessel operators have access to sufficient qualified engineers to be able to deploy experts in every system aboard every vessel. Thanks to strong security systems and processes, the industry can now provide remote access to experts safely and quickly.\nCrucially, the remote telemetry data can make it faster to resolve problems and support preventative maintenance techniques as I mentioned earlier.\n3) Accelerating design innovation \nOne of the tools used to design and enhance ship performance is GE’s Vessel Performance Analyzer (VesPA). It provides real-time comparisons of the performance of different electrical configurations, enabling GE to design and configure optimal power, propulsion and electrical solutions to match customers’ specific requirements.\nThis approach to ship design is vital for demonstrating that Korean shipyards can meet the exacting and evolving requirements of vessel operators in light of the changing market conditions.\n4) Transforming shipyards into “brilliant factories” \nAdvanced manufacturing combines software and analytics, new production processes and materials, and new technologies to improve efficiency on the factory floor, including through better linkages and coordination with supply chains and distribution channels.\nThese technologies have the potential to transform every Korean shipyard. Yard equipment and software will talk to each other over the internet in real time, share information, and inform or make automated decisions that will help ensure world-class quality, whilst avoiding costly plant shutdowns. Supply chains, distribution networks, and servicing units are digitally connected, reducing cycle time and improving quality in the existing shipyards.\nVP of GE Marine Tim Schweikert said: “As unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and increasing environmental concerns continue to weigh down on the industry, it’s crucial that we build ‘greener’ and ‘smarter’ ships.\n“GE has a 20 year history of being a partner to the Korean marine sector. Most recently, we’ve worked jointly with Hyundai Heavy Industries to develop world’s first gas turbine-powered 174,000 m3 LNG carrier, and have delivered our 100TH induction motor in conjunction with DSME.\n“The next step for us is to help Korean shipbuilders to achieve digital excellence; something we believe is set to become a powerful differentiator in the future marine sector. By working together we will continue to support Korea’s global leadership position and the vital importance that the industry has for the country’s economy.”\nInsight: How Smart Ships talk to Smart Containers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:40:13.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
