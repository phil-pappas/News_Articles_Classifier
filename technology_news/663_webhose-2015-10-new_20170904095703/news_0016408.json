Eventually, measurements from the probe will become unreliable and will have to be replaced. In a new guide , METTLER TOLEDO Process Analytics explains how using ISM technology can increase pH sensor lifetime by more than 100%. Analog sensors are calibrated and cleaned at the process, and due to the necessity of rapidly restoring a measurement point these activities are usually conducted quickly. This often means that a sensor is not cleaned sufficiently. More importantly, because the sensor is swiftly returned to service the sensor's diaphragm does not have time to revive its functionality. METTLER TOLEDO's ISM technology is a digital platform in which pH sensors retain their own calibration data. This means that they can be calibrated away from the process in any convenient location. When a sensor at a measurement point requires cleaning or calibration it can be quickly replaced with a sensor that has already been maintained. In a lab or workshop, time can be spent adequately cleaning the failing sensor and then, using METTLER TOLEDO's iSense PC software, accurately calibrating the sensor. Once this is done the sensor can be stored correctly in a KCl solution, which gives the sensor's diaphragm sufficient time to revive. This process of rotating sensors in and out of service extends the lifetime of the probes, and drastically minimizes the workload on maintenance personnel, who will spend far less time at measurement points. The illustrated guide clearly shows all the steps required.
