The handset will start shipping on October 22. – AFP/Relaxnews pic, October 13, 2015. Google's new 5.2-inch display smartphone will be going on sale before the end of the month. \nUnveiled at a special event at the start of October, the Nexus 5X is built by LG and packs a host of flagship internal components, including a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with laser focus and a monster octa-core processor into a very affordable form. \nDespite boasting a fingerprint sensor, the very latest version of Android – Marshmallow – and a fast-charging battery, the 32GB version will retail for just US$379 (RM1,580) from the Google Play Store while the 64GB version costs US$429. \nThe handset will be available initially in a choice of white or black but a mint green version is also expected to go on sale before the holiday season gets into full swing. – AFP/Relaxnews, October 13,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:23:24.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
