In fact, I'd go as far as saying that the ZenWatch 2 is the nicest looking Android Wear watch out there right now - and that's coming from someone who doesn't really like square-faced watched.\nAs is becoming customary across the range of smartwatch offerings, the ZenWatch 2 comes in two sizes: 45mm and 49mm. No, neither is \"small\", and unless you're a real chunky watch lover the 45mm will be plenty. Also, it's not entirely square as the edges are nicely rounded off, making it damn more sightly than the original LG G Watch, which was so square that I'm sure you could have taken someone's eye out with its corners.\nThe Apple Watch is probably the most comparable smartwatch in terms of design, then, with the Zenwatch 2 just a smidge thicker. But pick it up and you'll notice that it doesn't feel quite as beautifully crafted in the hand, while the back is actually plastic. However the price is significantly lower at 149 Euros (about £110/$168) for the smaller option and 169 Euros (about £125/$190) for the larger one.\nAsus has kept much of the watch the same, including the AMOLED screen. One other big change it has made is the physical button on the side, though that's all it is - this isn't like the Apple Watch's digital crown. All you'll be using it for is turning the display on or going back to the watch face if you're in an application.\nThere are also no biometric sensors on the ZenWatch 2 (there is a pedometer) but considering the half-hearted (badoom tish) fitness features on most smartwatches right now, that might not be such a bad thing.\nIf the ZenWatch 2 has a USP, it's customisation. Three case colours - silver, gunmetal, rose gold - 18 strap options, and a truckload of possible combinations. Smartwatch makers have quickly caught onto the fact that wearables need to be more personal than a smartphone.\nFeatures The ZenWatch 2 runs Google's Android Wear, but Asus is also loading it with a bunch of ZenWatch-exclusive watchfaces. We scrolled through a few of them, which ranged from the more classic clock look to slightly more zany styles. They won't all be to your taste, but the sheer range puts Apple's meagre offering to shame.\nAsus's personal touches run deeper than watchfaces, though. The ZenWatch 2 also comes with direct watch-to-watch communication feature called ZenWatch Message, which lets you send emojis and doodles to friend.\nIt also features its own smart assistant app that aims to give you a bit more timely information - but we weren't able to try it in our demo.\nThis seems like a bit of a snub at Google Now, and I'm not sure why Asus has done it. At first I thought it might be because the ZenWatch 2 will be one of the first Android Wear watches to be iOS compatible, but then Motorola told me that its new Moto 360 will offer Google Now on the iPhone - perhaps Asus thinks its personal assistant is just... better?\nAs for battery life, you'll get around two days on average from the ZenWatch 2, but with low power settings you should be able to eek out a little more.\nEarly verdict All of this, when you consider the price, makes for one of the most enticing smartwatches around right now. The ZenWatch 2 has launched and you can pick one up from the Google Play Store with other locations coming soon.\nAll we can say right now is that Asus has hit a good sweet spot between design and price here, along with a focus on customisation which might help the ZenWatch 2 stand out from the many Android Wear watches currently hitting the market.\nIFA coverage brought to you by the new Xperia™ Z5 from Sony\nIFA coverage brought to you by the new Xperia™ Z5 from Sony\nWhat is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.
