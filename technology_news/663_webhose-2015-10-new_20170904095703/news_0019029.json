Extensive interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline systems traverse Cameron Parish, giving us access to both conventional and unconventional shale gas on a firm or spot price basis.\" \nThe facility, which is expected to create over 250 permanent jobs, needs to obtain approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the company said. \nConstruction of the project is expected to begin in mid-2017.
