Audi said customers could do the same on its www.audi.de site.\nVW said the search tool is being integrated into national sites worldwide and will be available on those sites shortly. Audi said the function will be extended worldwide over national Audi sites in the coming week.\nCustomers can also go to dealers to check on their vehicles using the serial number. Volkswagen and its brands say they will present a technical fix to authorities in October.\nThe company has said that 11 million diesel vehicles from several of its 12 brands had engines fitted with software that can help them cheat through emissions tests. Those include 5 million Volkswagen passenger cars; 2.1 million Audis; 1.8 million Volkswagen commercial vehicles; 1.2 million Skodas; and 700,000 vehicles made by Spain-based SEAT.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
