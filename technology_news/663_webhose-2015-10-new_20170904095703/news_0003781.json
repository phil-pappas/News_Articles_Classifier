The chip card technology encrypts a customer’s account information, improving security and fraud protection. \nThe workshop in Marengo covered compliance issues along with an overview on the merchant’s responsibilities and liabilities associated with accepting chip card purchases. \n“Protecting our customers is a top priority at Prairie Community Bank,” President and CEO Dianna Torman said in the release. “By implementing this technology, our customers are even safer when making debit card purchases.” \nBusinesses had an Oct. 1 deadline to convert card reader systems and equipment to accommodate the new chip technology, but the conversion has been slow with many transactions still being made on cards with magnetic strips, according to the Associated Press. \nTo learn more about the chip card technology, interested residents can visit Prairie Community Bank locations in Marengo and Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:04:33.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
