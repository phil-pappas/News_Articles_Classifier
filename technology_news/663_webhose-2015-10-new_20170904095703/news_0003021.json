By Rachel Lerman Seattle Times business reporter \nWashington state startups raised $327.2 million in the third quarter of 2015, a 9.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association’s MoneyTree report being released Friday. \nThat number varies a bit from the Dow Jones VentureSource report released Thursday, which reported that Washington state companies raised $374.6 million in the third quarter. The discrepancies are mostly because of the ways the two agencies gather the financial data and the timing of funding announcements. \nThe MoneyTree report shows a similar trend to other reports from the quarter — funding was down a bit from the second quarter, but financing of the region’s companies remains strong. \nThe 35 deals reported in the third quarter is especially good news for the region, said Stephen Sommerville, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Seattle.
