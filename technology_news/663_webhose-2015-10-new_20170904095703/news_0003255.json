The Smart Mall is a virtual supermarket service. It is an innovative shopping channel for shoppers to virtually interact with their chosen stores or products and make purchases instantly. \n\nA pilot Smart Mall will be opened at the Mall of the Emirates metro station. Visitors to GITEX Technology Week 2015 can experience a live demonstration of the virtual supermarket at Etisalat's stand (Za'beel Hall). \n\nThe new Smart Mall from Etisalat will offer customers an immersive purchasing experience, allowing end-users to digitally interact with stores and explore products in an innovative 3D enabled format. Buyers can choose products through a simple and intuitive graphical interface and move selected items to a virtual checkout basket. They can then complete the transaction by using a secure mobile payment method, mCashier, which is an EMV certified payment solution. Etisalat's mCashier allows merchants to accept credit and debit card payments directly on the mobile phones. It is a simple-to-use, intuitive and highly secure, on-the-go service. The stores will deliver shopped items to customers directly.\n\nSalvador Anglada, Chief Business Officer at Etisalat, said, \"Enormous possibilities have been generated by the Internet and digital technology over the past few decades and digital innovations are set to shape future living in the UAE as much as it is worldwide. \n\n\"At Etisalat, we are keen to define future service models with the focus on digital services, powered by our fast and reliable fixed and mobile networks. The Smart Mall is an initiative in that direction. It integrates the physical world with the digital one and we are excited to partner with RTA to bring this virtual mall to residents and visitors in the UAE\", added Anglada.\n\nFor the pilot Smart Mall at Mall of the Emirate metro station, Etisalat has partnered with trolley.ae, an online grocery shopping service in Dubai. \n\nAbout Etisalat \nEtisalat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:50:52.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
