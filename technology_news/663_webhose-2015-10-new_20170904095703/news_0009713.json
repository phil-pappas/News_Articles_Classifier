Whether or not he wanted the police to arrest him, they shouldn’t have done so https://t.co/LtOFAAmVxK\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 Dawkins also tweeted this YouTube video called “Ahmed Mohamed Clock is a FRAUD”, in which the creator suggests Ahmed brought the clock into his school, Macarthur High School, to create an “alarmed reaction”.\n“This man seems to know what he’s talking about,” Dawkins added.\nThe British-born writer stuck to his guns as other Twitter users objected to his comments, adding: “Assembling clock from bought components is fine. Taking clock out of its case to make it look as if he built it is not fine. Which is true?\n“Yes, there are other reasons why a boy might take a clock out of its casing & pretend he’d made it. Trying to impress teachers, for instance.”\n@I_Love_Atheism Because he disassembled & reassembled a clock (which is fine) & then claimed it was his \"invention\" (which is fraud).\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 @HarryStopes I don&apos;t know. Possibly wanted to be arrested? Police played into his hands? Anyway, now invited to White House, crowdfunded etc\n— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 When asked why he was so annoyed, Dawkins replied: “Because he disassembled & reassembled a clock (which is fine) & then claimed it was his “invention” (which is fraud).”\nBut Dawkins eventually backed down, saying he was sorry if he went “a bit over the top in my passion for truth”.\nAcclaimed author Richard Dawkins.

It made me feel like I was a criminal,” Ahmed said after his release.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["https://t.co/LtOFAAmVxK", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEmSwJTqpgY", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/010e176304ed8043ba94936e25404ec3", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/366686b539b559f61996661fc233ac6f", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a8bbe1ab90a69576463acacabd23ce87", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645555802636464129", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fm.wsj.net%2Fvideo%2F20150917%2F091715clock%2F091715clock_1280x720.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://news-whistleout.s3.amazonaws.com/News_Deals_300px.html", "https://twitter.com/HarryStopes", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645534680033423360", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/645519286082138112", "https://twitter.com/I_Love_Atheism", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-22T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:24:18.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
