It also provides a secure way to access those apps and enables companies to control which corporate data can be shared with these apps.* On research conducted by IBM, they were able to find out that about one-third of employees at Fortune 1000 companies were sharing and uploading corporate data on third-party cloud applications. This often happens without the knowledge of their employer and silently puts the enterprises' data at risk.* Another aspect that IBM noted is there is a growing trend of choosing convenience over security.* IBM is working together with Box and other popular app providers to make them safe for work. IBM's new technology aims to secure external apps, and also to monitor the risks of these apps being breached.* Cloud Security Enforcer looks to extend users' control, visibility, security and governance inherent to their hybrid cloud environments.* IBM's study also revealed that one out of four employees link cloud apps to their corporate log-in information and passwords, leaving gaps where hackers can access company networks.* Caleb Barlow, VP of mobile management and security at IBM, said they've taken a different, innovative approach to shadow IT than any company had yet taken before. They want to help corporate IT teams become enablers.* IBM is trying to allow companies to take advantage of third-party cloud apps in terms of convenience and productivity for employees, but also adding a layer of protection for the company.* Cloud Security Enforcer is here to help organizations reduce the challenges of shadow IT, defend the company against attacks on unsafe cloud app usage, and also allow productivity and efficiency from employees using the apps they like.
