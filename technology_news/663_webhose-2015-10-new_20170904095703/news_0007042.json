The solution will enable INTECH's credit unions to provide its members with the ability to simply and securely use their Android mobile devices to purchase goods and services in stores. \nThe Digital Payments Guardian gives financial institutions the ability to deliver secure, convenient, consumer controlled, digital payment services to customers through their existing digital banking channels. The solution uses the existing payment infrastructure, leverages the trust related to payments that consumers already place in the credit unions and positions those institutions to directly control the payments relationships they have with members. \nINTECH will white label the Prairie Cloudware technology allowing credit unions to offer members a mobile wallet that carries the institution’s brand. The initial deployment of the Digital Payments Guardian for INTECH will offer an Android mobile wallet with a Visa card. The solution can be extended to include additional payment cards and sources as well. The move into the mobile wallet space supports INTECH’s mission of delivering a wide range of innovative technologies to its credit union clients that attracts, retains and deepens relationships with their members. \n“This is an exciting time in the payments industry, as payment methods are evolving to match consumers’ increasing digital lifestyle,” said Tim Erwin, president of INTECH. “Through Prairie Cloudware’s Digital Payments Guardian, our credit unions will be able to provide their members with a seamless mobile wallet that delivers a simple ‘tap and pay’ experience across 700,000 point of sale sites nationwide. This not only facilitates a better member experience, but also enables the credit unions to have control over the process and data associated with the member’s payment practices.” \n“Consumers want to put their money in a protected place they can trust,” said Doug Parr, chief revenue officer of Prairie Cloudware. “That’s why for digital payments to be adopted broadly, it is imperative that financial institutions play a direct role in offering, delivering and supporting the services required to sustain them. Through INTECH’s adoption of the Digital Payments Guardian , their credit unions will have the opportunity to offer members a level of confidence, accessibility and control over their digital payment options that cannot be found with third-parties operating outside the banking industry.” \nAbout INTECH \nINTECH provides core account processing services along with branch, online and mobile banking support exclusively to their approximately 50 customers within the credit union sector.
