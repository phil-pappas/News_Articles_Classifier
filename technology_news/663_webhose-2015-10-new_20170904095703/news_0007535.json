Covering the costs means every penny raised will go directly towards the charity's funds; last year that totalled over Â£1,000 in donations.\nOxford, UK (PRWEB UK) 26 October 2015\nThe Oxford Business Network has adopted Oxfordshire-based SpecialEffect as its supported charity for its 2015 Christmas Charity Breakfast , which will take place on Friday 4th December 7.45-10.00am, with Olympic gold medal winner Tim Foster OBE as guest speaker.\nThere will also be the chance to try some of the life-changing eye control technology that the charity uses to help people with disabilities. Other activities will include a business card raffle to win some fantastic prizes, not to mention the opportunity to find out more about the 2016 Twin Town challenge , where teams sign up to join a four-day rally driving from Witney to its twin town Le Touquet and home again, with twelve amusing challenges en route.\nSpecialEffect works tirelessly to put fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with disabilities by providing technology to help them play video games. The concept sounds simple but the effect on the quality of people's lives is almost beyond measure.\nBy using technology ranging from modified joypads to eye-control, SpecialEffect is finding a way for people to play to the very best of their abilities.\nBut it's not just for fun. By levelling the playing field, SpecialEffect bring families and friends together and has a profoundly positive impact on therapy, confidence and rehabilitation.\nNeil comments: \" Shawcity are delighted to sponsor this unique business networking event but, most importantly, we're so pleased to have more opportunities to support the life-changing work of SpecialEffect with this event and our involvement in the 2016 Twin Town Challenge.\"\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040321.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13040321.htm", "http://www.shawcity.co.uk/", "http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/specialeffect-news/hear-tim-foster-obe-on-oxford-on-4-december", "http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/", "http://www.twintown16.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:36:32.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
