The Vitamix 780 boasts the advanced, high-performance blending the company is known for, now enhanced with capacitive touchscreen controls. \nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151007/275097 \nModern and sophisticated, the machine's scratch-resistant, hardened-glass touch screen cleans with a single swipe. It is designed with an appealing vertical orientation of controls, engineered for ease of use and walk-away convenience. \nThe Vitamix 780 makes blending intuitive, creating entire recipes with a single touch. The machine features five pre-programmed settings for Smoothies, Frozen Desserts, Hot Soups, Puree, as well as a Cleaning Cycle. Users can watch the machine as it cycles from one speed to the next on the vertical controls as programs run. An automatic shut-off at the end of each cycle takes the guesswork out of blending speeds and times, to ensure consistent results. \n\"We are excited to offer the new Vitamix 780 exclusively this holiday season through Williams-Sonoma,\" said Vitamix CEO Jodi Berg. \"The 780 is our first fully capacitive touch machine, making it easier than ever for consumers to incorporate more whole foods into their diets easily and deliciously.\" \n\"Vitamix is a long-time, key partner to Williams-Sonoma and the 780 is truly a groundbreaking introduction,\" Williams-Sonoma President Janet Hayes added. \"The touchscreen feature of the machine is unprecedented for the company, and by launching the Vitamix 780, Williams-Sonoma continues to maintain its status as a leading source of exclusive products for our customers.\" \nPowerful and versatile, the Vitamix 780 is also equipped with a Variable Speed Control that adjusts from low to high with the swipe of a thumb to process hearty ingredients, like leafy greens, frozen fruits and crunchy vegetables. A fully variable Pulse action can be used alone and in tandem with the pre-programmed settings or Variable Speed Control to effortlessly create a variety of textures. The tamper helps blend thick or frozen mixtures with perfect results every time. \n\"Vitamix is changing the way people blend with a single touch, making everyday preparation of delicious, healthy meals simple and enjoyable,\" said Karen Haefling, vice president of marketing, Vitamix. \"With intuitive touch controls and the superior features of every Vitamix machine, the Vitamix 780 is the epitome of the ultimate high-performance blender.\" \nThe Vitamix 780 has a compact and modern design that fits under most kitchen cabinets, keeping it readily accessible on the counter for daily use. It delivers quality blends and takes the place of several appliances, freeing up valuable counter space. \nThe low profile 64-ounce, BPA-free container includes a hardened stainless steel blade and wider base for finer blending. Enhanced airflow management, similar to Vitamix commercial blenders, dramatically reduces noise, offering quieter blending. This feature also improves motor cooling for longer, more robust processing of even the toughest foods. \nThe Vitamix 780 has a suggested retail price of $699.95, and includes a cookbook and a full seven-year warranty. It is available in a premium, easy-to-clean black finish exclusively at Williams-Sonoma and vitamix.com. \nAbout Vitamix The Vitamix family of companies is privately held and family-owned and -operated.
