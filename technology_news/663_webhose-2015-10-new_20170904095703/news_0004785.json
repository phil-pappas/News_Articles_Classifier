That code could infect the computers of users who simply visited a site that featured a tainted ad. Once infected, users’ computers would freeze up and deliver an ultimatum: pay somewhere between $300 and $500, usually in the virtual currency bitcoin, or lose all data hosted on the machine.\nBy targeting obituaries, the attackers had seemingly set their sights on seniors.\nOlder people are more likely to surf the Web with outdated browsers, less likely to update that software, and often aren’t sufficiently tech-savvy to back up their machines, said Nick Biasini , a Cisco threat researcher in Austin, Texas, who monitors the specific digital tool, the so-called Angler Exploit Kit , used in this attack.\n“Exploit kits in general are typically targeting people that are using Internet Explorer, and you are targeting obituaries, you are targeting elderly people that are prone to be using that as their default browser,” said Biasini.\nAs many as 90,000 people per day viewed these malicious ads; roughly 40 percent were infected with some kind of malicious software, said Cisco researchers. About half the ads appeared on obituary pages. \nIt’s unclear when this specific campaign began. Criminals have been using Angler since 2013.\nCisco’s Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group attempted to track down the fraudsters by analyzing a vast amount of data from Cisco devices used by Web hosting companies. Those companies give Cisco permission to monitor their traffic for attackers.\nAccording to Cisco’s math, a single criminal syndicate may have generated $30 million in annual revenue from ransomware alone. That number is at best a guess, though, as it assumes a steady amount of criminal traffic a month over the course of a year, not to mention portions of the attack that may have evaded Cisco’s view and the volatility of the bitcoin market, among other factors.\nThe investigation uncovered servers hosting the exploit kit in Dallas. Craig Williams , the Talos team’s senior technical leader, immediately reached out.\n“They were basically completely shocked, they didn’t know who we were,” he said, adding that this particular Web hosting company, Limestone Networks, was getting ripped off by these thieves, who were using stolen credit card numbers to pay for their services. \n“They were the victims here.” \nWilliams added that Limestone was losing around $10,000 a month in fraudulent charges to this group.\nWith the help of Level 3 Threat Research Labs and OpenDNS, Cisco followed the attack to other servers in the Netherlands. \nAt one point, Williams said a researcher spoke to a Web administrator who insisted, because of Dutch privacy laws, that he couldn’t search a suspect’s rented servers without that person’s permission. \n“They reached out to the (criminals) and the threat actor basically said: ‘Don’t worry, everything is fine.’”\nThat’s where the trail went cold. \n“Unfortunately, when you look at the care they have taken to cover their tracks it’s impossible to have a really good idea of who was doing this,” Williams said of the gangs involved. \nIn publishing all of its research, Cisco hopes that law enforcement, specifically those in Europe that it contacted ahead of time, will follow up on its investigation. \nSean Sposito is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
