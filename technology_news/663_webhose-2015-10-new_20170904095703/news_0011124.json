October 2, 2015 GREENSBORO, N.C. – Although the fall season is bringing colder weather, the PestPartners 365 Program is just starting to warm up. Between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, 2015, qualifying purchases of Syngenta Professional Pest Management (PPM) products will count towards the 2016 PestPartners 365 Early Order Period (Jan. 1 – April 30, 2016). Instead of four months of qualification time, pest management professionals (PMPs) now have even more time to reach the minimum qualifying rebate needed to participate in this unique yearlong savings program. “The PestPartners 365 program is an innovative way for PMPs to maximize their buying power,” says Pat Willenbrock, head of marketing, Professional Pest Management, for Syngenta in North America. “By offering extra time to work toward 2016 program qualification, PMPs who were just below the minimum qualification needed last year have a better chance of becoming a member in 2016. And, PMPs who qualified in 2015 have more time to achieve a higher rebate level for next year.” Current PestPartners 365 Program members will continue to earn 2015 rebates on qualifying purchases made between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, 2015. In addition, qualifying purchases made during this time will count toward members’ program qualification in 2016. PMPs who did not participate in the 2015 program can take advantage of the fall offer to start working toward the minimum qualifying rebate needed for program participation in 2016. As part of the fall offer, Syngenta is also announcing extended payment terms for the following products: •Demand CS insecticide Master Shipper (24 1-quart bottles in a case) •Demand CS + Archer insect growth regulator Multipak •Tandem insecticide 2-quart bottle PMPs will have until July 6, 2016 to submit payment for any purchases of these three product offerings, made between October 1 and December 31, 2015. “We understand the importance of product rebates that go beyond a monthly or seasonal offering,” says Gregg Wisniewski, insecticide brand manager, Professional Pest Management, for Syngenta in North America. “With the PestPartners 365 Program fall offer, yearlong savings can become a better reality for more PMPs and their businesses.” For information about the PestPartners 365 Program and Syngenta Professional Pest Management, visit www.PestPartners365.com or contact the Syngenta Customer Center at 1-866-SYNGENT(A) (796-4368).
