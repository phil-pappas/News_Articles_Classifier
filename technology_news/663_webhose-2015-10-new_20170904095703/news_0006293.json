Their joint discussion, entitled, “Machine Monitoring and Data Collection for Maintenance Optimization,” will walk manufacturers through the process of feeding rich streams of data from smart machine monitors into a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for monitoring and reporting, all using today’s cloud technologies. FABTECH is North America’s largest metal forming, fabricating, welding and finishing event.\nScytec is the producer of DataXchange, a cloud-based manufacturing process control, data collection, and machine monitoring system. Colorado-based Scytec reports that clients experience productivity increases of 10% on average.\nThe data collected by DataXchange can be synced in real-time with modern CMMS, like Smartware Group’s Bigfoot , to assist manufacturers with aggregating and analyzing data for better asset management – and improved performance for machinery, equipment and building systems.\n“A well-designed CMMS already gives maintenance professionals a significant advantage in terms of improving their operations to save on corrective maintenance, labor costs, and to increase machine longevity,” Lachance said. “And when ‘meter reading’ or smart assets are directly tied to CMMS, preventive maintenance can rise to a whole new level with predictive maintenance . With this linkage in place, CMMS can provide instant access to live data from equipment, building systems and production lines.”\nFor example, CMMS can create a PM calendar alert to generate a work order for routine maintenance on an Air Handling Unit (AHU) every four weeks, as recommended by the manufacturer. But suppose that same maintenance protocol could be followed once every 500 operating hours, rather than every four weeks.\nUnless the AHU is running 24/7, those 500 hours of usage could stretch well beyond four weeks. When the CMMS receives meter readings directly from the AHU, it tracks the hours run and does not produce a work order until the unit actually nears 500 hours in operation. This marriage between smart machine data and the CMMS results in savings on parts and labor costs because it helps eliminate excess maintenance labor and parts spent on the AHU.\nWhen data flows instantaneously from machine monitoring systems to a CMMS, it also becomes easier for the CMMS to identify when a malfunction is a false alarm. At the same time, the CMMS automatically captures true alarm events and triggers work orders for corrective action.\nA CMMS can also set different variables for meter readings or other machine-produced data. In addition to “hours run,” it could check for “pressure,” “temperature,” “widgets produced,” and other indicators that alert the maintenance team to check on machinery operating outside of acceptable tolerance levels. The team can then act on that data, making adjustments as necessary to prevent equipment from breaking down or production lines from stopping.\n“Maintenance professionals need to recognize how much power they have at their fingertips when machine monitoring data is directly connected to CMMS,” Davids said. “The synergy between a smart machine and a CMMS creates a win-win situation for everyone who taps into this formidable combination of technologies.”\nLachance and Davids will present their talk as part of the “Modernizing Maintenance and Inspection” track (Session F85) at FABTECH 2015 on Wednesday, November 11, 2015, at 11:10 a.m. at McCormick Place, Chicago, IL. Smartware Group will spotlight its Bigfoot CMMS on the trade show floor in Exhibit Booth #C1522.\nFor registration and further information about FABTECH 2015, visit http://www.fabtechexpo.com .\nAbout Scytec Consulting, Inc.\nScytec Consulting, Inc., founded in 2001 and headquartered in Greenwood Village, CO, is a leader in providing shop floor machine monitoring and control systems for the manufacturing industry.\nScytec’s DataXchange is a cloud and on-premise machine monitoring and data collection system that utilizes MTConnect, and Fanuc FOCAS, and hardware methods to collect from both the latest machines and legacy equipment.
