Well, that is a fallacy,\" she said in the text of a speech to be delivered at the Foreign Policy Association in New York.\n\"Yes, U.S. companies are often involved when we investigate the digital industry. But you will also see many Japanese firms in our car-part cartel cases,\" she said.\nShe said data on cartel fines and mergers also showed no geographic bias.\nThe European Commission is now studying Google's response to antitrust charges of favouring its Google Shopping service over rivals. It is also investigating the company's popular Android operating system for smartphones.\nAmazon is in the EU's crosshairs for a Luxembourg tax deal and Starbucks for a Dutch tax arrangement.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Adrian Croft)\n- Reuters\nEmail More", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=#&title=&summary=&source="], "published": "2015-10-02T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:23:44.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
