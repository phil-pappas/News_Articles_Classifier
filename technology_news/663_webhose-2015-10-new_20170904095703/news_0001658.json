It provides a human-machine interface that will enable enhanced operation of its high-definition imaging functions. \nPart of Sagem's Series 30, the system uses a non-penetrating technology for the submarine pressure hulls, in addition to its compact design and multi-sensor architecture, meeting the Swedish navy's requirements. \nThe company has already delivered the optronic surveillance masts to the Scorp√®ne-class submarines built by French shipyard DCNS. \"The system uses a non-penetrating technology for the submarine pressure hulls.\" \nIn June, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration signed contracts worth Skr7.6bn ($919.01m) with Saab to deliver two new Type A26 submarines. \nThe shipyard started the construction of the first submarine last month. \nPowered by conventional diesel-electric propulsion machinery, the new A26 will be capable of operating in all oceans and across a broad spectrum of conflict environments. \nThe new submarines will feature the Kockums Stirlingair-independent propulsion (AIP) system, which allows the submarine to be stealthy and difficult to detect. \nThe delivery of the new submarines is expected to commence in 2022 and will be completed in 2024.
