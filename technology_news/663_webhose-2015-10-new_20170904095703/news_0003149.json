This online certificate course prepares students to use both the ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets, earn the Certified Professional Coder (CPC) and Certified Coding Associate (CCA) industry credentials and successfully enter the medical coding career field.\n“Over our 15 years of offering medical coding education, we have developed significant industry and employer relationships that allow us to understand the trends within coding and billing and, most importantly, employer needs,” said Career Step Vice President of Academics Jerolyn Robertson. “Our new program addresses the evolving demands of the medical coding field while also placing our graduates in the unique position of being qualified for positions that historically required more experience. By including ICD-10-PCS training in our course, we help meet the staffing and education needs of our corporate clients while also setting our students up for success.”\nCareer Step’s new Professional Medical Coding and Billing with Applied PCS program offers 640 hours of curriculum designed to prepare students with no previous healthcare experience to successfully start careers in medical coding and billing. Students will learn how to code with the HCPCS, CPT, ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS code sets as well as the medical terminology, anatomy and physiology, and pharmacology necessary to be able to assign codes.\nIn a departure from what is being done by many other entry-level coding certificate programs, the new Career Step course includes ICD-10-PCS training. These codes are used primarily, though not exclusively, to code more complex inpatient procedures, which means Career Step graduates will be qualified for more advanced coding positions.\n“The ICD-10-PCS code set is new to everyone with the industry-wide implementation of ICD-10 that took effect October 1,” said Career Step President and CEO Steve Tober. “We developed comprehensive PCS training for our corporate clients to prepare their employees for the ICD-10 transition. Given this training and the demand of our corporate clients, we feel it made sense for the same rigorous content should be offered in our student curriculum. We believe the additional PCS training will help our students stand out in the job market.”\nCareer Step has offered online medical coding training since 2000. The company is currently the training provider for some of the largest and most respected names in healthcare and its medical coding and billing students report passing rates of the national industry certification exams that are nearly 20 percentage points higher than the national average.\nFor more information on Career Step’s new Professional Medical Coding and Billing with Applied PCS program, please visit CareerStep.com/medical-coding-billing-career or call 1-800-411-7073.
