Enters the $250 Billion IT-Dotcom Sphere EdTech.Now to bring global education visionaries under one roof The induction of INS Kochi, India’s latest naval warship, has significantly strengthened the Indian Navy’s capabilities in discharging her duties of safe-guarding national maritime interests. The Kolkata-class (Project 15A) guided missile destroyer, that was commissioned last week at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai, is vastly superior and has major advancements in weapons and sensors. The warship is designed by the navy’s in-house organisation, Directorate of Naval Design, and constructed by Mazagon Dock Ship Builders.\nAdmiral RK Dhowan said that commissioning of INS Kochi is a milestone in the self-reliance programme of the navy. He stated that the indigenisation of platforms, weapons, sensors and equipment, through public as well as private sectors, will continue to remain a focus area of the Indian Navy.\nWith the involvement of 500 plus small and medium enterprises, major indigenous components on board INS Kochi are: 90% on float, 60% plus on move and 40% in fight. Among the major indigenised systems include the electronic warfare suite, foldable hanger doors, helo traversing system and the ship’s stabilisers.\nINS Kochi is the second ship of the Kolkata-class (Project 15A), the contract for three ships of Kolkata class was signed as a follow-on of the legendary Delhi-class destroyers, which were commissioned\ninto the navy more than a decade ago. “The finish of the INS Kochi is good as any foreign ship,” defence minister Manohar Parrikar said.\nINS Kochi incorporates new design concepts for improved survivability, stealth, sea-keeping and manoeuvrability. It has a combined gas-and-gas (COGAG) propulsion system, comprising four powerful reversible gas turbines; and can attain speeds in excess of 30 knots.\nINS Kochi is packed with sophisticated weapons and sensors including the vertically launched long range surface-to-air missiles and MF-STAR multi-function active phased array radar. The ship is equipped with the advanced supersonic and long range BrahMos surface to surface missiles as well.\nThe 76 mm Super Rapid Gun Mount and AK 630 CIWS can take on air and surface targets. The entire anti-submarine weapon and sensor suite fitted on-board, consisting of indigenous rocket launchers, indigenous twin-tube torpedo launchers and a bow-mounted new generation Humsa Sonar are also fine examples of India’s indigenous efforts in the field of underwater warfare.\nINS Kochi can be truly classified as a ‘network of networks’ as it is equipped with sophisticated digital networks, such as asynchronous transfer mode based integrated ship data network, combat management system, automatic power management system and auxiliary control system.\n 05, 2015 12:18 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:52:09.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
