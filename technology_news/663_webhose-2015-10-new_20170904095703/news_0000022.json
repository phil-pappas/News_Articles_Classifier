( Y-J Cai, X-X Yang, and X-J Wu) \nOur species first appeared in East Africa about 200,000 years ago, then spread to other parts of the world, but the timing and location of these migrations has been unclear. \nUniversity College London paleoanthropologist Maria Martinon-Torres said our species made it to southern China tens of thousands of years before colonizing Europe perhaps because of the entrenched presence of our hardy cousins, the Neanderthals, in Europe and the harsh, cold European climate. \n\"This finding suggests that Homo sapiens is present in Asia much earlier than the classic, recent 'Out of Africa' hypothesis was suggesting: 50,000 years ago,\" Martinon-Torres said. \nLiu said the teeth are about twice as old as the earliest evidence for modern humans in Europe. \n\"We hope our Daoxian human fossil discovery will make people understand that East Asia is one of the key areas for the study of the origin and evolution of modern humans,\" Liu said. Neanderthals may have been barrier in Europe \nMartinon-Torres said some migrations out of Africa have been labeled \"failed dispersals.\" Fossils from Israeli caves indicate modern humans about 90,000 years ago reached \"the gates of Europe,\" Martinon-Torres said, but \"never managed to enter.\" \nIt may have been hard to take over land Neanderthals had occupied for hundreds of thousands of years, Martinon-Torres said. \n\"In addition, it is logical to think that dispersals towards the east were likely environmentally easier than moving towards the north, given the cold winters of Europe,\" Martinon-Torres said. \nPaleoanthropologist Xiujie Wu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology said the 47 teeth came from at least 13 individuals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:22:06.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
