Tom Vice will continue to lead the Aerospace Systems sector.\nLoren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Northrop was following the lead of other weapons makers that have also changed their business structure to reflect the Pentagon's increased focus on integrated solutions that meld cyber, electronic warfare and space.\n\"The Pentagon does not want a series of stovepiped missions. It wants integrated solutions,\" he said.\nThompson said Flach had long been seen as the leading internal candidate to replace Chief Executive Wes Bush, who was relatively young and could move to other jobs, perhaps outside the defense sector.\n\"He's made huge strides in terms of improving the company's stock performance,\" he said.\nNorthrop last had a COO in 2009 when Bush served in the role before being named to succeed then-CEO Ron Sugar.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal ; Editing by Tom Brown )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:25:46.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
