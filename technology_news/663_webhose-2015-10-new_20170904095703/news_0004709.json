Our observation is that the UK government is just ignoring Hong Kong for the business deals,\" Wong said. \nThe teenager, who is studying public administration at the Open University of Hong Kong, added that many people in Hong Kong saw the British government as \"really passive\". \nThe semi-autonomous city was returned to China by Britain in 1997 and is ruled under a \"one country, two systems\" deal which allows it greater freedoms than seen on the mainland. \nBut activists fear its high degree of autonomy is being eroded, a concern echoed by Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee in a report published in March. \n- 'Democracy is eroding' - \nLast year's mass protests in Hong Kong erupted after Beijing said candidates for the city's next leader must be vetted by a loyalist committee ahead of a public vote. \nThe electoral plan has since been voted down by pro-democracy lawmakers who were unhappy with the restrictions, leaving the territory with its existing system where the leader is chosen by a pro-Beijing panel. \nActivists were critical of Britain's failure to speak out against China's plans for the 2017 vote, which they said breached the handover agreement. \nAnd Wong questioned whether Britain could trust China after what he said were broken promises over its former colony. \nThe student leader still faces charges relating to the protests and fears he could be sent to prison next year. \nHe said that while he recognised the need for international leaders such as Cameron and Xi to hold talks, Hong Kong needed help from Cameron and the British people. \n\"I'm not saying that the British can't have any dialogue with China's government. For the prime minister and president to have dialogue is responsible but the problem is, democracy is eroding in Hong Kong,\" Wong said. \n\"I just hope the British government and the British people can stand up for democracy because so many people in China are silenced and cannot stand up.\" \nAs for Xi, he added: \"With ignorance of human rights, he will face more protests.\" .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:22:44.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
