We've got a real chance of revolutionising medical science.\"\nThe charity had asked leading artists and designers like Ian Callum, the director of design at carmaker Jaguar, to decorate the works. British graphic artist Darren Baker was among them.\n\"The concept there is to show humanity coming together and with that we can create a force for good and help fight diseases and help humanity as a whole,\" he says.\nAnother design, created by British clothing company Ted Baker, covered the helix with a cascade of pearlescent buttons. Many of the sculptures explored the links between art and science.\n\"The ideas is to create something that makes you think about art, that makes you think about science, or about maths,\" says Pilar Enrich, who had her own DNA sequenced as part of her research for the project.\nDNA sculptures to fund research\nSource: Al Jazeera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:21:30.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
