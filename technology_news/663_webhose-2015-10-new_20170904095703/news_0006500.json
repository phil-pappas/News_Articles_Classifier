The unusual circumstances aside, the isolation of the anti-malarial substance, artemisinin, like most scientific discoveries, resulted from a huge amount of trial and error, Tu recalled in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"Before I joined the team, lots of work was done but nothing was found,\" said Tu, who had been trained in both Western and traditional Chinese medicine and joined the secret group, Project 523, in 1969. Attempts at extraction using hot water and ethanol were unsuccessful, but Tu drew inspiration from the fourth century pharmacist Ge Hong, who — in a short line of text — suggested soaking a handful of wormwood in water and then drinking the juice to treat malaria. Tu brought the plant into the project, discovered the low-temperature method for extraction, conducted the first human trial, and was involved in determining its molecular structure, Su said of their findings after reviewing files, including classified documents. »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:33:30.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
