(OTC-BB: CHCR) (\"Advanzeon\") announced today that it has retained Washington Capital, LLC, a leading Florida -based communications firm, to lead Advanzeon's and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pharmacy Value Management Solutions, Inc.'s (collectively, the \"Company\"), Investor Relations and Financial Communications program. The agreement is effective immediately. \nMr. Tim Murray , Washington Capital's President, stated, \"Advanzeon is a very exciting company that we believe has excellent growth potential. We look forward to working with their senior management and staff. Each of the Company's senior management team has impressive business backgrounds, and their approach to providing affordable medical services to their target markets is cutting edge. They have focused their efforts on integrating three major healthcare growth fields; sleep apnea, behavioral health and pharmacy management, with a marked emphasis on sleep apnea. They have thus far achieved significant contract success, have developed a national network of sleep apnea specialists and have a number of additional commercial and labor agreements in the negotiation phase. Their team has thus positioned the Company to capture significant market share in each of these major areas. I believe Washington Capital is extremely well positioned to help the Company in their growth efforts.\" \n\"Washington Capital was formed with over thirty years of experience. Our primary focus is to work with growth companies to assist them in navigating the ever-changing and challenging world of company finance and growth. We have a well-organized network of relationships that work hand-in-hand to cover all aspects of successful growth management; from business strategy, marketing and advertising, executive management, finance, legal and accounting, and capital procurement. We have worked with over 100 public and private companies during this time covering a broad range of industries,\" Mr. Murray concluded. \nJerry Smith , the Company's Chief Operating Officer, stated, \"We are flattered that Washington Capital has taken us on as a client and agreed to work with us as our Investment Relations and Financial Communications agency. We met with them several times and fully explained the overall concept of how the Company integrates its sleep apnea, behavioral health and pharmacy management programs; the growth potential that we perceive for the Company and the existing contractual and business relationships we have, thus far, established. We believe that Washington Capital would not have taken on the responsibility as our agency if they were not convinced that the Company's perspective of its place in the healthcare universe was well founded, well directed and capable of achieving the success envisioned. We are confident that we will be able to produce the results projected to Washington Capital and that they will equally be able to produce for the Company the desired market identity in both the Company's commercial market and its investor relations market.\" \nAbout Advanzeon Solutions, Inc.Established in 1969, Advanzeon provides sleep apnea programs, behavioral health, substance abuse and pharmacy management services for employers, Taft-Hartley health and welfare Funds, and managed care companies throughout the United States.
