The platform is powered by myVPL, INC. a boutique, Los Angeles-based tech company. privytime provides a secure, mobile device-compatible, personal communications platform focusing on individual privacy. The privy-Message service, called \"myPM2\" for private multimedia messages, also has a double delete feature allowing users to remove sent messages from both parties' (the sender's and recipient's) mailboxes any time after it is sent. The privy-Phone provides a web-browser-based video phone service with text messaging using a secured WebRTC application. \"It's great to be sharing privytime with those who may be interested in a new place to go online to communicate securely without being surprised that small subscription fees for service upgrades are par for the course,\" said myVPL, INC. founder Derek Boisse.\nThe platform is ad-free, and configured to block search engines and web bots from crawling and indexing pages. The platform doesn't use Analytics so users don't have to opt out. It's an easy-to-use private network without distractions allowing one to focus on creating and viewing vibrant user content.\nprivytime's social networking aspect has a boutique feel and is geared for establishing a smaller, more personal network. Users get a basic profile page for a bio and a few photos, plus a Privy Selfie Video, and users can choose to mark their profiles visible to friends only, or locked from view by anyone. Friends can be added only if one knows the other's username and can view their profile; however user names are not searchable. To generate attention, one must post content on the community privy-Wall, or comment on a user's profile.\nWith a subscription purchase multimedia features are added and users can include photos, file attachments and Privy Selfie Videos with a seamlessly embedded video player inside their myPM2 messages, and also add pics in their Wall posts plus a video in the user's profile. A purchase is not required to use the services at this time, as new users can still access basic features.\nThe privy-Wall is a place to post and share one's priviness with others. If one is privy to something cool or unique, or has an update, tip or trick, then it is shared here. Any post can be marked private for friends only, and won't appear on the community wall.\n\"privytime is available now with the aim to grow slowly while the platform expands and evolves,\" he said. \"All of our services are designed to work in just a web browser making it easy to get started.\" Boisse promises that myVPL will always do its best to ensure that privytime maintains its privacy and integrity with a clear Terms of Service. https://privytime.com", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9wcml2eXRpbWUuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:55:09.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
