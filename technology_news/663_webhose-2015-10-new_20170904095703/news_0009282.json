In short a complete IT department or IT department enhancement all at a small extra cost to clients above the cost of the products subscribed too and often as a significant savings to internally staffing the function.

Additional, local support of all the Microsoft products can be delivered by SADA at a small extra cost to the customer above the cost of the Office 365 stack. SADA has US based experts supporting the offering, so clients will no longer have to deal with the off-shore – call back support, a point of dissatisfaction with many Microsoft users. Local support allows Telnet Connect to deliver true value add for their solutions and services.\nSo what exactly do Telecom Agents do? Telecom agents ( http://www.telnetconnect.com/service-area.html ) act just like independent insurance agents. They are experts at their industry but don’t work for any one provider. The benefits of using an independent agent are the same in both industries: they can sell more than one providers solutions so they get to cherry pick the best solutions at the best price, they are unbiased advisors who don’t have quotas to meet and their services are generally free to the client as the service providers/carriers pay their fees.\nThe results are impressive. When companies use an agent, such as Telnet Connect, they get much better value, saving as much as 20 or 30% on their telecom expenses. Companies using an agent can often increase their capabilities while seeing their costs go down. The quality of the providers and their solutions are all state of the art. It’s a little known secret that all providers, including the big names such as AT&T, Time Warner, Comcast and now Microsoft, all augment their sales forces with Independent Telecom Agents. So just about anything the big boys have to offer, a telecom agent can get you, generally at a savings over the direct agent.\n\"We are very excited to be adding the Microsoft suite of products plus SADA support to our lineup of offerings” said Mel Levine, President and Founder of Telnet Connect. “We get requests for productivity and collaboration tools all the time and we can now meet yet another need of our clients.”\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nTelnet Connect was founded in 2009 and has helped companies from local entrepreneurs, mid-sized regional to national non-profits save thousands on their telecom solutions ( http://www.telnetconnect.com/georgia/ ) while building new capabilities for their businesses.
