All with flies,\" he explained \nHe has even created a computer game where flies develop from eggs and spawn against time and parasites. To play the game visit https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/74443210 \nTo adapt resources to teachers' needs, Prokop and Sanjai supervised two PhD students, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, who worked as teaching assistants in two Manchester schools \nThe students then developed biology sample lessons in close collaboration with the teachers which can be downloaded from the droso4schools website \nThe lessons continue to be used in the two schools: Loretto college and Trinity Church of England High school. \nProfessor Prokop added: \"Flies have all the ingredients to convey conceptual understanding of biology as well as the thrill and relevance of science as a subject and future career perspective.\" \nSurita Lawes, Head of Faculty at Loreto Sixth Form College, who is also a biology teacher, said: \"By studying mutations in Drosophila , our students have been exploring how alcohol and human culture affects our genetic make-up. It's an excellent way for teachers to meet the challenge of revising many areas of the new linear syllabus using a topic designed to spark an interest.\" \nTof Apampa, a student at Trinity Church of England High School said: \" \"It was great having the PhD student working with us. We learnt about what we can study at university and how fruit flys can help scientists explain how the human body works. \n\"Having the flies in the classroom was good fun. It was so clear to see how the old flies were less mobile then the young ones. \n\"We then learnt how this can help us understand aging in humans. It also showed in a really clear way how using a large sample size is important when we are looking for patterns in scientific data.\" \nMore information: If you want know how and why fruit flies became so important for biology research, Prokop and Patel have even created two very entertaining educational YouTube videos. \nFor more information visit www.flyfacility.ls.manchester.ac.uk/forthepublic/ \nTo download the teaching packs and support information for teachers, visit the droso4schools website: droso4schools.wordpress.com \nAll school- resources including computer game and YouTube videos are explained and summarised on this blog: poppi62.wordpress.com/2015/08/28/school-flies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:19:02.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
