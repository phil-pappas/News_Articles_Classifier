Amazon Web Services is by far the most widely used cloud solution, representing more than twice the market share of every other cloud service combined. \nThe annual SaaS Survey is used to identify the operational and financial trends that benchmark success among SaaS companies. Findings cut across virtually every aspect of SaaS operations, from go-to-market selling strategies and customer retention rates, to operational management and margin structures. More than 300 senior executives from SaaS companies around the world participated this year. Survey results are available at http://www.pacific-crest.com/2015-saas-survey . \nSurvey results also show that the industry has seen steady growth during the last two years and continued growth is anticipated in 2015. The median revenue growth in 2014 among respondents was 44 percent, up from 37 percent in 2013. Survey respondents also project a 46 percent median revenue growth in 2015. \nAnother set of key findings reveal that the best performing SaaS companies are making greater use of so-called \"land and expand\" selling strategies, in which they focus on growing revenue by up-selling existing customers over multiple years. \nSpecifically, the survey finds that: -- Companies showing the most success with \"land-and-expand\" strategies are growing much faster than their peers. -- The cost of adding new revenue from existing customers is a small fraction (24 percent) of the cost to add revenue from new customers. \n\"A lot has been written about the transformation of enterprise software to SaaS,\" said David Spitz , Managing Director, Software & Security at Pacific Crest Securities , and primary author of the survey. \"While this transition has provided a number of benefits to SaaS companies and their customers, it has also forced people to completely reinvent how they manage their businesses. With our annual SaaS Survey, we are providing invaluable tools to help teams better understand what successful software companies look like and the underlying trends that are driving performance in today's markets.\" \nAdded David Skok , VC at Matrix Partners , author of the SaaS-focused blog forentrepreneurs.com , and active supporter of the survey for the past four years: \"We work with hundreds of SaaS companies who rely on this survey for critical insights. Because of the upfront sales and marketing costs and the delayed revenue collection inherent to most SaaS models, there can be a deep cash flow trough in these companies' early years. Consequently, it's imperative that the industry be able to benchmark their core metrics to know if they're on track.\" \nAbout the Pacific Crest Private SaaS Company Survey The Pacific Crest Private SaaS Company Survey is one of the leading reference materials on financial and operating benchmarks for the SaaS sector.
