These investments will bolster the company’s expansion into China while supporting strict country and regional data residency requirements. “We’ve seen more than 75 percent year-over-year growth and expect this to translate into our biggest holiday season ever,” said Phil Steffora, CSO and vice president of operations at ThreatMetrix. “As a result, we’ve made significant investments in people, processes and infrastructure to meet this demand. As a global company with data centers now on three continents, supporting some of the world’s leading businesses, we are well positioned to deliver real-time backup and failover capabilities and address region-specific data residency requirements.”\nThreatMetrix continues to expand its global data center footprint to proactively serve the demands of global marquis customers. According to Accenture and AliResearch, by 2020 global e-commerce is expected to grow to $3.5 trillion, of which $1 trillion will be driven by cross-border transactions. With 350 million e-commerce shoppers today, China is expected to account for 50 percent of global consumer digital sales and a proportional share of cross-border e-commerce demand, according to Forrester.\n“We’ve seen significant growth in transactions through our network as consumers move seamlessly across devices to access products, services, and content,” said Steffora. “We anticipate especially strong growth in China as we onboard some of the world’s premier businesses. When it comes to cybercrime, a regional perspective is insufficient. ThreatMetrix delivers a true global perspective, enabling our customers to leverage global shared intelligence to authenticate their users’ true digital identities.”\nThreatMetrix Resources\nShare this news on Twitter: Scaling to 200M+ transactions daily, @ThreatMetrix expands global data center capacity: https://goo.gl/3LWdxK Share this news on Twitter: New @ThreatMetrix data center supports company’s rapid expansion into #China https://goo.gl/3LWdxK Press Release: ThreatMetrix Announces Speaker Lineup for Cybercrime Prevention Summit 2015 Video: ThreatMetrix® Digital Identity Network\nAbout ThreatMetrix\nThreatMetrix®, The Digital Identity Company™, is the market-leading cloud solution for authenticating digital personas and transactions on the Internet.
