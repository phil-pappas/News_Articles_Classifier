The technology combines MPLS and Internet optimization to maximize utilization of all networks, and can reduce bandwidth requirements by up to 97%. For Microsoft SharePoint, Riverbed's solutions can deliver optimization and visibility across users, network, apps and infrastructure in order to better manage user experience and performance. The collaboration between the vendors has meant that features such as the acceleration of links between offices, partners and customers are available out-of-the-box.\n\n\"One of the big challenges facing IT teams today is that it costs 15x more to fix bugs found in production systems than it costs to fix bugs found during development and testing. Application visibility and diagnostics help IT fix bugs sooner and deliver releases on time. Riverbed SteelCentral„ AppInternals can help you see what parts of the code are running slowly, monitor user experience, and verify whether your cloud servers are performing at capacity,\" said Taj ElKhayat, Regional Vice President, Middle East and Africa at Riverbed Technology.\n\nToday's hybrid enterprises includes infrastructure and applications in traditional on-premise environments in parallel with Solution as a Service (SaaS) application offerings like Office 365, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms like Azure. A key theme therefore for Riverbed at the upcoming edition of GITEX is helping customers leverage the power of its solution for Azure - a process that has been simplified by making Riverbed SteelHead CX subscriptions available on the Microsoft Azure marketplace. \"Riverbed customers can do this with their existing licenses and it is an easy and efficient way to scale deployments in less time and effort,\" said Michael Mansour, Head of Apps and Innovation, Microsoft Gulf.\n\nDelivering applications using Azure allows developers to rapidly build, test, deploy and scale up new applications in real world environments. To ensure quality and increase release velocity, organizations need to identify and resolve bugs and performance problems early in the application lifecycle. Application Performance Monitoring (APM) products like Riverbed SteelCentral AppInternals give IT and business stakeholders performance visibility and enable them to share insights and collaborate to ensure fast release cycles while ensuring quality.\n\n\"For IT professionals leading Office 365, SharePoint or Azure initiatives, Riverbed provides the visibility, optimization, and control needed to ensure superior application performance that drives outstanding business performance,\" said Mansour. \"By partnering with Microsoft, Riverbed enables IT teams to optimize Office 365 and SaaS delivery, assure SharePoint performance, and develop and deliver applications on Azure.\"\n\n\"We have strategically aligned ourselves with the right partner in order to jointly offer a very attractive value proposition to attendees,\" said Taj of Riverbed's participation at GITEX. \"The interactions with customers and partners through the five days will be key to developing and maintaining strong relationships and I believe that our presence will reiterate our commitment to the region.\"\n\nAttendees can meet technical and sales professionals from both Microsoft and Riverbed at Microsoft's stand B7-10 which is in Hall 7 of the exhibition. \n\nAbout Riverbed \nRiverbed, at more than 1 billion in annual revenue, is the leader in Application Performance Infrastructure, delivering the most complete platform for the hybrid enterprise to ensure applications perform as expected, data is always available when needed, and performance issues can be proactively detected and resolved before impacting business performance.
