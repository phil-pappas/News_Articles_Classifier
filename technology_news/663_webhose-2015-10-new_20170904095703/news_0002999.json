They can only be used on private property with the permission of the property owner. \nEarlier this year the devices received widespread attention when a pilgrim was filmed using one to perform circumambulation around the Kaaba, prompting debate on whether it was permissible in Islam.\ntsubaihi@thenational.ae", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:35:05.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
