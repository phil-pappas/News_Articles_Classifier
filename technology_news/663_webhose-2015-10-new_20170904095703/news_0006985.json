Models from across the range have been delivered to various countries. \nThe most sought-after LHM model in Latin America over the past five years – type LHM 600 – is still in high demand. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Terminal 4 SA invested in an LHM 600 which is based on a special design: an elongated tower extension ensures that the position of the tower cabin is higher than 37 metres. \nLiebherr states its developed new advantages on its machines without compromising safety or operational parameters such as lifting capacity and travelling speed. In total, the delivery marks the seventh LHM for Terminal 4 SA and its third LHM 600. \nRead a Technical Paper from Liebherr on how the company is building new equipment for new demands \nTwo more units of this type are going to be delivered to the South American Pacific coast in the upcoming months. Puerto Lirquén in Chile is expanding its Liebherr mobile harbour crane fleet with their seventh and eighth unit. \nA new LHM 550 also started operation for Termaco in Fortaleza, Brazil this summer. It is the first Liebherr mobile harbour crane for the Brazilian company. Equipped with a 54 metres boom, the LHM 550 will mainly be used for highly efficient container handling. \nA newly built port in the Caribbean is the first Liebherr mobile harbour crane customer in Haiti. In June 2015, Port Lafito received its first mobile harbour cranes, opting for two LHM 420s, which provide hoisting and lowering speeds of up to 120 metres per minute. \nIn 2016, Liebherr is going to deliver the world’s largest mobile harbour crane to Montecon, Uruguay. \nThree LHM 420s have been handling containers in Guatemala since 2014.
