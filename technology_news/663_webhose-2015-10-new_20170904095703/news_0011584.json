(NASDAQ:IDCC), a mobile technology research and development company, today announced that they have demonstrated interoperability between a Radisys end-to-end LTE network, including the CellEngine™ eNodeB and Evolved Packet Core, with InterDigital’s oneMPOWER Platform. The success of this integration and interoperability showcases that the networking technologies supporting Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) composed of disparate LTE and Wi-Fi networks are ready for network deployment. \nThe Internet of Things is projected to reach 25 billion devices by 2020, which will only increase today’s ever-growing mobile data traffic. By embracing both LTE and Wi-Fi as complementary technologies in a converged HetNet solution, mobile operators will be able to meet the bandwidth needs of subscribers, but will require policy-driven control of access assets and interoperability across the network. At the IoT Korea International 2015 exhibition, Radisys and InterDigital successfully connected Radisys’ 3GPP-compliant TOTALeNodeB™ small cell integrated solution, along with Radisys’ Core Network Emulator (CNE) software, with InterDigital’s oneMPOWER Platform that is oneM2M Release 1 compliant. Radisys’ Professional Services team delivered the software engineering and integration expertise to enable the successful interoperability of LTE and Wi-Fi for the joint solution. \n“The HetNet revolution can only become a reality with the successful convergence of networks to manage the data traffic explosion,” said Dr. Byung K. Yi, executive vice president, InterDigital Labs, and chief technology officer of InterDigital. “Our oneMPOWER Platform is well positioned to support the growing Internet of Things. With Radisys’ CellEngine TOTALeNodeB software, along with Radisys’ Professional Services expertise to add an Evolved Packet Core emulator and integrated with InterDigital’s oneMPOWER Platform, we’ve demonstrated the ability of HetNets to address the mobile broadband and interoperability requirements for Internet of Things deployments.” \n“Radisys is supporting numerous LTE deployments around the world, including more than 80 LTE small cell wins with our CellEngine TOTALeNodeB small cell software,” said Tom McQuade, general manager, CellEngine and Trillium Software, Radisys. “Critical to our success has been the support of our Professional Services team to help configure and integrate our software products at customers alongside our partners’ complementary networking technologies. This successful interoperability demonstration with InterDigital is not only a win for our CellEngine software products, but for our Professional Services team as well.” \nInterop Demonstration at IoT Week \nThe end-to-end demonstration will be showcased at IoT Korea International Conference in Seoul, Korea, October 26-30, 2015. The demo scenario includes 3GPP Release 12 compliant Radisys’ Trillium LTE CNE and CellEngine™ TOTALeNodeB™ LTE small cell software with certain feature modifications by InterDigital along with Google Nexus 5 handsets. \nAbout Radisys’ Professional Services \nRadisys’ Professional Services team helps customers accelerate their time to market and revenue generation by partnering with them to transform from their current infrastructure to a virtualized infrastructure and to accelerate deployments in the cloud.
