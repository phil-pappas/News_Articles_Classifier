Drucker • 10/08/15 10:11 PM She said DARPA has created a biological technologies office, whose work includes synthetic biology to \"nip infectious disease in the bud.\"\n\"One major area of investment is neurotechnology. The challenges that our wounded warriors face coming back from theater was a major inspiration for our neurotechnology portfolio.\"\n\"Some of that work for example was about revolutionizing prosthetics, and creating a much more agile, adept prosthetic arm, but also understanding signaling from the motor cortex. What are the motor signals that I'm sending to move my arm, and can we pick those signals up and in fact translate those codes into motions for this prosthetic arm.\"\nOne day, Prabhakar promised, humans would jump at the chance to use the technology. \"As that mystery of the brain gets unravelled, the power of what we're going to be able to do to restore function, and in the future also to enhance function, I think that we as human beings will not be able to resist what it's going to do for us,\" she concluded.\nShe also responded to an allegation made by a journalist, who reported last month that sources had told her the Pentagon implanted some returning wounded soldiers with \"chips inside the tissue of the brain.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Rock bottom? Things could get worse for House GOP \"There has been a misunderstanding over how we got our majority,\" says a well-connected GOP strategist.\nBy Byron York • 10/08/15 7:02 PM \"We're not actually planting chips in soldiers' brains,\" Prabhakar said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:54:44.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
