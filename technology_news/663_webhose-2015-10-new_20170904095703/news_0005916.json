Excerpts: ET Now: Brokerages are divided on TCS' results, but you have seen 30% growth in order book your best ever. Doesn't it speak volumes about TCS' performance? Isn't that a clear indication of business momentum? N Chandrasekaran: Yes, I think so. But I also understand why people try to read into every bit of detail and ask doubtful questions.Going by our track record over the last several years, I think we have consistently delivered. But it is also true that there has been expectation mismatch for about 4-5 quarters now, especially in revenue growth in dollar terms. That is what gets people worked up in terms of estimates.There was softness in some areas even when TCS was firing on all cylinders. These glitches definitely add up. It may be a small miss from a quarterly perspective, but when such gaps build up in small amounts over multiple quarters, some mismatch is sure to happen.But otherwise if you see, it has been a good quarter for us. We have accelerated from Q1, which we had started with 3.5% growth. It is good when you start with 3.5% and eventually reach 3.9%.One also has to take into account the fact that Q3 and Q4 of last fiscal were not very good for us especially in dollar terms as we faced a cross-currency headwind. To climb up from there is usually difficult. So, overall we are happy with our latest numbers.we are satisfied with the deal wins, 4.9% volume growth and a very good order book. Also, from the point of view of earning from deals, it has been an excellent. There are no lumpy one-off deals anywhere. That makes it interesting. ET Now: Can we safely assume that the handover from Q2 to Q3 is extremely encouraging? N Chandrasekaran: Yes, but the usual headwinds will be there in Q3 too. I hope that the furloughs that we normally have do not expand. So far, we have had no indication that furloughs will be any different from the earlier years. We will have a good grip on it only after November 15. I hope that it stays like before. ET Now: Digital is now 13% of your total business. At a time when you can shop 24x7 and bank on Sundays, will IT's historical seasonality be a thing of the past now because of this technology refresh? N Chandrasekaran: Probably not. For that to happen, our business models will have to change a bit. The typical contracts we have in terms of time, material and fixed price will have to change.We are now getting a lot of intellectual property-based contracts be it licensing, platforms and services. The incremental revenue from these new models will have to increase for that to materialise.Once that comes through, we will be able to buck the seasonality trend. And we really need to do that, because we cannot keep on having the uncertainty of this kind. But it will require us to gain scale in some new areas. We are currently building on those business models. ET Now: TCS has historically emerged stronger and a better company from every technology refresh. Will this digital shift make TCS a bigger and better company both in terms of market share as well as margins? N Chandrasekaran: I would wholly agree with you. I believe that the possibility is there. TCS has been making significant investments in talent development, automation, building IP and building our own digital learning platforms. We are also setting up collaboration centres and new business models.Going forward, it will give us a significant opportunity to deliver. The rest, time will tell. ET Now: 3-4 quarters ago, there were many problems TCS faced such as the energy vertical, volatility, the telecom vertical and LATAM. Currently there are only two problems. Isn't that great news? N Chandrasekaran: The energy vertical is likely to remain under stress for some time. We do not have a big pipeline in that vertical.But having said that, it is a smaller portion of our revenue. Though we have had 5% plus growth this quarter, I do not expect such kind of growth to sustain. Apart from that, I believe that we well make a comeback in Latin America. In terms of all the other verticals, I feel good about where we are.Manufacturing still has the Japan impact. Once Japan Japan starts to grow, you will no longer see that softness there. I am not very bullish on the telecom growth rate, but I do not see it as a trouble spot. It will be okay; it will come up with a moderate performance. ET Now: TCS has managed to grow despite a non-conducive global environment. Given that the economic scenario is improving, will TCS be even stronger now? N Chandrasekaran: I believe there will be companies who we will engage with and help transform into the new technological footprint. We will also partner with companies that already are established digital players. These are the two types of opportunities out there.This is going to happen with every market and every industry. In fact, my own message to myself is that we will be doing much better than the US and Europe. ET Now: Why then was your growth rate for Q2 in Europe and in US was not in line with the historical averages? N Chandrasekaran: We have done better. Actually, you have to look at the acceleration part. You cannot really take one particular quarter and make a simple comparison with the preceding one. My point is, things are okay as long as there is acceleration.Having said that, you would like it to accelerate faster. I think this opportunity will build up as companies start to spend more. I believe companies in the digital space will spend more as we go into the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:51:11.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
