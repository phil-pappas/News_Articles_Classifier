This technology implementation marks a significant improvement over previous wired data offloading processes. The telemetry includes data from thermal imaging tire cameras, which is used to improve speed, efficiency and vehicle safety. \nSharing this data via Wi-Fi over the 5 GHz spectrum is designed to enable much faster data transfer of large vehicle diagnostics files and prevent frequent trips to the garage to offload data, which previously required a plug-in connection from the car to computers in the garage. Data is now transferred via high-speed wireless in the pitlane. This advancement allows the Mercedes racecar to make better use of limited practice sessions and spend more time testing the configuration of the vehicle, providing the team with a distinct competitive advantage. \n\"This is the first in a number of projects between Qualcomm Technologies and the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team and we're excited to unveil this at the Grand Prix in Austin this weekend,\" said Derek Aberle, president of Qualcomm Incorporated. \"Through this project, we have learned new ways to use Wi-Fi in the automotive environment. Innovation in motorsport often drives the advancements seen in the consumer auto industry, and we believe this technology, as well as other advanced wireless technologies, has the potential to shape future developments in Dedicated Short Range Communications, Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communications. These types of technologies will lead to increased driver safety and provide important data pertaining to the vehicle's journey.\" \nThe system deployed by the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team and Qualcomm Technologies, is comprised of several Qualcomm速 Snapdragon(TM) 805 processors with Qualcomm速 VIVE(TM) 802.11ac Wi-Fi, along with multiple access points, one in the pit lane and one in the garage, to improve the speed of connectivity and data transfer. Qualcomm Technologies will continue to advance this solution throughout the 2016 race season and beyond, with potential system architecture changes and planned migration to 802.11ad Wi-Fi solutions over 60 GHz spectrum to bring further improvements to the speed and efficiency of data transfer. \n\"Qualcomm Technologies' focus on innovation in wireless technologies and their long-standing reputation as a trusted advisor and technical resource in the automotive industry, together with the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team's record of embracing technical advances makes this a great collaboration,\" said Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport. \"This is a tangible example of how our partners' technologies are making a valued contribution to our successes on track.\" \nThis solution is the first project as part of a collaboration that Qualcomm Technologies first announced with the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team in March 2015 to develop new connected car technologies to enhance the team's on-track performance. Qualcomm Technologies' vision for the automotive industry involves the creation of an entirely new landscape for communication, convenience, energy efficiency, infotainment and safety by utilizing an array of advanced mobile technologies that work together as seamlessly as our mobile devices. The company is involved in more than 40 connected car programs with more than 15 OEMs globally and has been powering in-car connectivity for more than a decade, including nearly a decade of telematics programs with Daimler. Additionally, Qualcomm Technologies continues to gain traction in infotainment with the Qualcomm速 Snapdragon(TM) 602A processor. \nAbout Qualcomm Incorporated \nQualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) is a world leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies.
