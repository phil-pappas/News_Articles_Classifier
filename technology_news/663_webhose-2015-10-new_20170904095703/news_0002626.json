Dr. Terrence Keaney presented a paper titled \"Understanding the Male Perspective on Office-Based Aesthetic Procedures: Awareness, Motivating Factors, and Barriers\" and Dr. Jared Jagdeo presented a paper titled \"Facial Treatment Preferences in Aesthetically-Oriented Men\" at open sessions on Saturday, October 17. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150612/222796LOGO \nThere is increasing interest in facial aesthetic treatments among men; yet, there is a lack of data describing male attitudes toward age-related changes to their facial features and associated preferences for prioritizing treatment. The Men's Maximum Difference study explores men's awareness and attitudes towards age-related facial changes, office-based facial aesthetic procedures as well as their motivations and deterrents to undergoing these procedures. \nThe study surveyed 600 injectable-naive, but aesthetically-oriented men between the ages of 30 and 65. Respondents indicated on a six-point scale how bothered they were by the appearance of 16 facial features. Subjects were also asked if they currently have an aesthetic healthcare provider (dermatologist or plastic surgeon), what signs of facial aging they would be comfortable speaking with their physician about and what aesthetic procedures they have heard of or tried. The participants were also asked to identify their reasons why they would or would not consider an injectable treatment. \nThe Maximum Difference Scaling System was used to explore the following: which facial features were most likely to be prioritized for treatment, the correlation between the facial features that bothered them and the areas of treatment preference and age-related differences in treatment preference categorized in five-year age cohorts. \n43% of respondents currently see a dermatologist and 4% see a plastic surgeon, with 64% of those having seen their provider within the last year. Most men in the survey were open to talking to their physician about facial wrinkles, hair loss/balding and their periorbital area. However, they responded as being unlikely to talk about a red complexion, acne scarring or broken capillaries on the face. \nAmong respondents, crow's feet and tear troughs were rated as the most likely to be treated first (each had 80% of first preferences) followed by forehead lines (74%) double chin (70%), glabellar lines (60%), oral commissures (55%), and chin (51%). In comparison, the features rated as the least likely to be treated first were thinning eyelashes (14%), lip volume (15%), and perioral lines (23%). The most bothersome features were tear troughs, double chin, crow's feet lines and forehead lines respectively. There was a strong correlation between the facial areas that bothered respondents most and the areas of treatment priority. \nAdditionally, the awareness of facial aesthetic procedures among men varied, ranging from high awareness (>90%) for plastic surgery, liposuction and hair transplant surgery to lower awareness (39%) for dermal fillers. The trial rate for all procedures was low (2% - 6%). The primary motivators for considering a facial aesthetic injectable were to \"look good for my age\" (70%) and to \"look more youthful\" (51%). Other reasons were cited less than 20% of the time, and these trends were consistent between older and younger respondents. The main barriers to undergoing injectable treatments in the next two years include concerns of cost (42%), concerned they won't look natural (41%), side effects and safety (46%), injecting a foreign substance into their body (45%) and thinking they did not need it yet (47%). \nAbout Allergan Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN ), headquartered in Dublin, Ireland , is a unique, global pharmaceutical company and a leader in a new industry model â€“ Growth Pharma.
