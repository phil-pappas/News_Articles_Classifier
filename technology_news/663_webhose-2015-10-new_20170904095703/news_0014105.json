LELO Reveals Sales Insights To Celebrate New Revolutionary “Come-Hither” Prostate Massager\nStockholm/San Jose\nWith the launch today of LELO’s new LOKI Wave , a revolutionary type of prostate massager with a ‘come hither’ motion, LELO has revealed which countries around the world buy the most male anal pleasure products .\nIn September LELO brought HUGO , BRUNO and LOKI to the market after years of research and development, sparking a much-needed conversation about prostate massage, sharing its benefits as well as shattering what many people consider to be the last sexual taboo. Now the newest addition to the prostate range, the LOKI Wave, is heralded as the most innovative prostate massager on the market and a flagship male sex toy.\nSteve Thomson, Director of Marketing at LELO said: “After releasing INA Wave, the first sex toy to feature WaveMotion technology, and the fastest selling product ever in LELO history, we received calls from all around the world to turn our expertise to doing the same thing for male pleasure. We know that prostate massage can offer mind-blowing orgasms and we realized our WaveMotion technology would offer a unique take on this.\n“Anal sex is a hot topic right now, not just for women. Men are finally understanding that the key to more intense male orgasms is via the prostate. When we revealed our line of prostate massagers earlier this year we could not have prepared for the amount of interest, not just from men and couples all around the world, but also from the global media too. The last sexual taboo is prostate orgasms, and we are very happy to say, it looks like this taboo is well on its way to being broken.”\nThe world is now ready for the LOKI WAVE, the next generation of the male orgasm.\nThanks to its pioneering WaveMotion technology, the all new LOKI Wave is the ultimate pleasure product for men, able to curl back and forth in a beckoning, come-hither motion to offer a completely new sensation in prostate massage. With two perfectly placed motors for simultaneous prostate and perineum massage, it’s a combination that guarantees a life-changing orgasmic experience.\nTo date, sales of LELO’s prostate range have soared at an unprecedented rate. Far exceeding expectations, it will become the fastest selling collection of male LELO products ever.\nBut which US cities buy the most prostate massagers? Which countries are open to using prostate massagers? And more importantly who is buying them?\nNYC tops the US sales table accounting for 27% of prostate massager sales, but the most sales per capita were actually in Miami, with over 50 year-olds purchasing the most. In contrast in Las Vegas 70% of sales were by under 35’s, and by both men and women.\nLA men are 3 times less likely to own a prostate massager than men in NYC, while men in San Francisco are 7 times more likely to own a prostate massager than their neighbors in LA. Over in Salt Lake City women made up 66% of sales, while in Chicago the vast majority of sales were by men.\nNew Yorkers researched the most before purchase, vising lelo.com on average 3 times before purchase, while Washington residents, ranked 2nd for sales per capita, typically bought on the first visit. The folks in Houston also showed a lot of interest in researching prostate massage, vising LELO’s prostate massage articles more than any other city.\nPeople living in UK are more likely to buy prostate massagers than those in the US, while people in Australia are curious but have yet to take the plunge (traffic from Australia to lelo.com’s prostate massage articles tend to stay on the page and read more than any other country, but their rate of purchase is noticeably low). And in Spain, women buy more prostate massagers than men, suggesting heterosexual couples are now much more confident in prostate play.\nIn Italy, the older you are the more likely you are to purchase a prostate product, suggesting Italians understand the health benefits better than most, while in France the younger generations are more curious.\nThe Germans rank third in the world for prostate products per capita and interestingly the vast majority are bought by men (it tends to be more even generally). And speaking of sales per capita, prostate massage products are just as popular in Russia as they are in the USA. Moving from Russia into Asia, we see a decrease in sales per captia, with China and Japan filling the last two spots in our top ten countries by total global sales.\nIt’s also interesting to note many of these cities are found in the most sexually-satisfied countries in the world, as reveled by LELO’s Global Sex Survey .\nFor more information visit http://www.lelo.com/loki-wave and https://www.lelo.com/prostate-massagers\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037150.htm\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.lelo.com/blog/surprising-prostate-stats-led-loki-wave/", "https://www.lelo.com/prostate-massagers", "https://www.lelo.com/loki-wave", "http://www.lelo.com/hugo", "https://www.lelo.com/blog/lelo-world-cup-sex/", "http://www.lelo.com/loki-wave", "http://www.lelo.com/bruno", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13037150.htm", "http://www.lelo.com/Loki"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:37:57.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
