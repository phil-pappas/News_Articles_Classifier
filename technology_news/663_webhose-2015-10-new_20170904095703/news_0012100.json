Professional practice is more than competence in the art and science of any profession — it is very much concerned with attitude, responsibility and accountability, without which there can be no professional practice.\nWe live in a world run by technology — from the mobile phones we use to communicate with each other or the apps we use for our music, entertainment and shopping, to the banking systems we use to make transactions and yes, even the cars we drive — all rely on software.\nThat software must be trustworthy. In order to engage fully with technology and truly reap its benefits, consumers must feel confident that these systems will enhance their lives and not subject them to risks or put them in harm’s way.\nConsumers’ trust was breached when VW fitted emission-cheating software to its diesel vehicles. According to news reports, those cars were found to generate nitrogen oxide pollutants up to 40 times higher than the US standard, suggesting real potential for health issues among drivers and commuters. In fact, a New York Times report estimated that between 40 and 106 people probably died in the US as a result of exposure to the increased NOx pollutants.\nICT professionals are expected to operate ethically and to hold the best interests of consumers at the centre of what they do. This is fundamental to being a professional.\nRegardless of where they work, professionals must also be willing to challenge or even report any order from management that risks the safety of their organisation’s customers or staff. DieselGate is as much an indictment of the software industry as it is of the VW executives who issued the order for the software to be installed.\nWhile I understand that companies must make a profit, ICT professionals should not be required to compromise their integrity or professional standards in order for that to happen.\nOne of the many benefits of modern technology is that when a company is found to have acted unethically, news travels very fast and, as VW has learned to its cost, there’s nowhere left to hide. While I regret the potential impacts of this scandal on VW’s staff, the vast majority of whom I am sure do their jobs very well, DieselGate offers a clear warning for any company that thinks it’s okay to cheat the rules or its customers.\nMy challenge to any ICT professional is to maintain your ethical standards at the highest level, not only for yourself, but for those around you. I would like to think that at least some of those working at VW questioned the approach being dictated by management, although I have no way of knowing if that’s true.\nHowever, if more of us speak out against wrongdoing and hold the line for ethical conduct and professional practice, then that’s a good thing for the entire ICT industry. Not only would it build our reputation as reliable, responsible and trustworthy, but it would also achieve the admirable outcome of raising the standard of professionalism and practice in ICT over time.\nI hope you are inspired to express your support for ethical and professional practice by joining your professional society in this aim.\nBrenda Aynsley OAM is president of the ACS, principal consultant with ICT management firm, Oz Business Partners, and chair of IFIP’s IP3 International Professional Practice Partnership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:25.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
