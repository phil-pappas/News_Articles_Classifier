More and more businesses of all industries are on the threshold of a digital revolution, looking for efficient and integrated solutions to optimize their corporate processes. One of the key technologies in the intended fusion of automation and digitalization known as Industry 4.0 is RFID. However this intelligent and sustainable technology is still rarely used to its full potential.\nOne of the leading providers of RFID on the market is iDTRONIC. For more than 12 years, the company has produced and developed high-quality hardware and components for the automation of processes. For embedding RFID in existing systems and products, integration-friendly and powerful hard- and software is indispensable. With their embedded RFID readers, modules and antennas, iDTRONIC offers exceptional efficient and flexible solutions, which have been proven successful internationally in application areas such as terminals, handheld computers, access control and identification.\nThe product range includes suitable solutions for all RFID frequencies and standards. More than 50 different antennas designs for 125 kHz, 13.56 MHz as well as global UHF 865 – 928 MHz are offered. Possible applications range from short range identification in difficult environments to vehicle identification with long range antennas. Embedded readers and modules are available with all common interfaces like TTL, RS232 / RS485, Ethernet and USB. All RFID ISO standards and chip types are supported. iDTRONIC also offers special solutions such as RFID modules with 3.3-volt connection for battery operation.\nBesides its standards products, the German-based company is a reliable technological partner for customer-specific and individual RFID hardware. Customer projects are supported and followed from the very start, including precise objective, conception and ultimately the technical realization using RFID. A professional development team then provides tailor-made embedded products for the specific application. Thanks to cost-effective planning and production as well as short implementation time, the company also minimizes time to market of its customers to a large extent.\nThe entire range of embedded RFID products can be individualized further. Data output and responding behavior, as well as design and used firmware may be altered to fit the demands of a client. Even complex antenna designs with infrared sensors or LEDs can be realized individually. RFID transponders already in use with interested parties can also be tuned to iDTRONIC’s readers and antennas to reach maximum reading range and power. This guarantees full compatibility with existing applications and saves additional costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:52:49.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
