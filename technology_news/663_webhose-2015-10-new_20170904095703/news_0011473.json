The sensing suite will combine for the first time low-THz-radar and video imagery. The research team involves the University of Birmingham, Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh. There will also be a strong involvement from a major automobile manufacturer. \nAs part of this team, a four-year Research Associate Position in Radar Signal Processing is available in the Institute for Digital Communications at the University of Edinburgh to work under the direction of Professor Bernard Mulgrew. Topics that will be addressed by this Research Associate include: forward-looking synthetic aperture imaging formation; 2D and 3D SAR imaging; feature extraction/classification for innovative/experimental radar imaging systems; training the radar signal processing using video sequences. \nCandidates should hold (or be about to receive) a PhD in electrical engineering, computer science, or a related numerate discipline. A strong competence in radar signal processing research is required as well as good communication skills and the ability to work in a team. The position will start early 2016. \nThe post is fixed term for 4 years, with a probation period of one year. \nInformal enquiries to Prof Bernard Mulgrew ( B.Mulgrew@ed.ac.uk ) \nClosing Date: 18 November 2015 at 5pm GMT \nFor further particulars and to apply for this post please click on the 'apply' button below Share this job", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:14:25.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
