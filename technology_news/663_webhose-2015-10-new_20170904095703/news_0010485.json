Pioneering strategic business users can now drive their talent performance by using 10Rule's patented cloud performance capabilities to sustainably replicate the top 10% performance levels that drive greater bottom line results - via measuring, benching, hiring and developing talent. 10Rule速 (HCPS) is a simple plug-in (API) capable of changing HR into a productivity improvement center. \n\"The CloudMills partnership brings a high level of quality, rigor, and speed to the integrations our clients need to enable workforce intelligence,\" explains Bob Morlot, CSO of 10Rule. \"It also keeps our technical resources focused on Human Capital performance predictive analytics rather than creating interfaces each time for client HCM systems.\" \nWhile many of the cloud-based vendors offer robust application program interfaces (APIs), the time and skill set required to build and maintain the integrations can put an excess load on a client's already stretched IT department. \n10Rule's (HCPS) Human Capital Performance solutions platform transforms Cloud HCM Data into hyper driven Workforce Performance intelligence. It can automate and integrate talent productivity measurement with best practice employee development solutions. CloudMills API capabilities become a quintessential source for plugging in 10Rule's performance solutions that can integrate into a client's HCM platform. \n\"It is exciting to see a company like 10Rule taking steps beyond the competition and actually assisting clients in setting their data free\", Dianna Sheppard, CEO of CloudMills said. \"Too often, companies simply hand their clients an API and 'hope' they get the automation and synchronization done. That's the lie of APIs; it's like handing someone a menu with no kitchen to prepare, cook and serve it. 10Rule gets that and solves it. \nAbout CloudMills CloudMills is a service delivery solution focused solely on Human Capital Management.
