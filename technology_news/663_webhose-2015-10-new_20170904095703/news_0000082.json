These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by management and are believed to be reasonable, though inherently uncertain and difficult to predict. Actual results and experience could differ materially from the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: substantial sales to U.S. government entities, which are subject to the government's budgetary constraints; customer concentration risks; fluctuations in the buying patterns and sizes of customer orders from one quarter to the next; increased competition causing SGI to sell products or services at lower margins than expected; lengthy acceptance cycles of SGI's products by certain customers and their effects on SGI's revenue and liquidity; development or product delivery delays, delays in obtaining necessary components from suppliers or delays in customer acceptance once products are delivered; the addition of new customers or loss of existing customers; unexpected changes in the price for, and the availability of, components from SGI's suppliers; SGI's ability to enhance its products with new and better designs and functionality; actions taken by competitors, such as new product announcements or introductions or changes in pricing; market acceptance of newer products; and risks related to SGI's term loan. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in more detail in SGI's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and are available at the SEC's web site at http://www.sec.gov . Forward-looking statements are made based on information available to the company on the date of this press release. The company assumes no obligation to update the information in this press release. \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nThis press release includes a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Non-GAAP basic net loss per share is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and management exercises judgment in determining which items should be excluded in the calculation of this non-GAAP measure. In addition, this non-GAAP measure may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. While we believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that non-GAAP measures are valuable in evaluating the company's operating performance and analyzing our business operations. Management may exclude the following items from one or more of non-GAAP measures: (1) share-based compensation; (2) amortization and impairment of intangible assets; (3) restructuring and severance charges; (4) excess and obsolete inventory write-offs; (5) gains or losses on investments; and (6) other non-recurring costs. A reconciliation estimate between GAAP and non-GAAP preliminary financial results is provided in this press release. The preliminary adjustments made should not be construed as an inference that all such adjustments or costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this information as well as the preliminary estimated GAAP financial results that are disclosed in this release and SGI's SEC filings. \nÂ© 2015 Silicon Graphics International Corp.
