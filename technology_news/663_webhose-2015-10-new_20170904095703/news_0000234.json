Growing worldwide prevalence of cancer and other diseases with epigenetic modification base is expected to drive market growth during the forecast period. \n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150105/723757 ) \nDiagnostic companies are coming up with new products such as antibodies specific for the detection of modifications and new upgraded kits for easy and efficient detection of biomarkers. This is expected to attract pharmaceutical companies to collaborate for the development of therapeutic drugs. \nBrowse full research report with TOC on \"Epigenetics Market Analysis by Product (Reagents, Kits, Instruments, Enzymes, Services), By Technology (DNA Methylation, Histone Methylation, Histone Acetylation, Large Noncoding RNA, MicroRNA Modification, Chromatin Structures) By Application (Oncology, Non-Oncology, Solid Tumors, Liquid Tumors, Inflammatory Diseases, Metabolic Diseases, Infectious Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases) And Segment Forecasts To 2022\" at: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/epigenetics-market \nPresence of pipeline drugs and their expected commercialization is anticipated to boost penetration rates over the forecast period. For instance, Ramucirumab (Cyramza) by Eli Lilly and Company was approved by the FDA for use in combination with Folfiri for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. \nTechnology advancements in the field of epigenetics especially pertaining to the detection of methylation markers related to cancer development is expected to improve usage rates during the forecast period. For instance, Epi proLung BL Reflex Assay by Epigenomics helps in the diagnosis of lung cancer by determining methylation of SHOX2 biomarker gene. \nFurther key findings from the report suggest: Epigenetic reagents was the largest market valued at over USD 1.2 billion in 2014 owing to the increasing amount of R&D investments and high consumption rates. Kits are expected to gain rapid growth in demand due to the increasing need of rapid and accurate detection techniques. DNA methylation was the largest technology segment accounting for over 47.0% revenue in 2014. The introduction of technological advancement such as Methylation Sensitive PCR (MSP) and rapid adoption of these products to improve diagnostics efficiency are some factors attributing for its largest share. Oncology was the largest application market, with revenue valued at over USD 2.75 billion. Growing prevalence of cancer with epigenetic modification base and strong product pipeline are some factors attributing to its market position. Non oncology segment is anticipated to register the fastest growth of over 20.0% during the forecast period. The segment is dominated by metabolic diseases owing to, the growing base of population suffering from diabetes and organ failure and increasing prevalence of sedentary lifestyle. North America was observed to be the largest regional epigenetics market accounting for over 38.0% of the overall revenue, due to factors such as the increasing cancer prevalence, increasing amount of funding for R&D, growing collaborations between large pharmaceutical firms for development of improved therapeutics, high patient awareness levels. The Asia Pacific market is estimated to witness lucrative growth over the forecast period owing to, the presence of large prevalence of target diseases and high unmet medical needs Some key players of the epigenetics market include Illumina, Abcam, Diagenode, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merck, Zymo research, Qiagen, CellCentric Ltd, Chroma Therapeutics Ltd, Eisai Co. Ltd, Novartis International AG, Oncolys Biopharma Inc., Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Valirx Plc and Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Extensive R&D initiatives aimed at the development of novel drugs and the presence of strong product pipeline is expected to further boost market growth over the forecast period. \nGrand View Research has segmented the global epigenetics market on the basis of product, technology, application and region: Epigenetics Product Outlook (Revenue, USD Million, 2015 - 2022) Reagents", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:25:12.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
