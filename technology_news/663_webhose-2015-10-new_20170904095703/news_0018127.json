Playtech, however, did not say what the issues were.\nPlaytech, which counts Betfair Group Plc, William Hill Plc and Paddy Power Plc as its licensees, agreed to buy online derivatives broker Ava Trade in July to strengthen its position in the forex trading market.\nIsle of Man-based Playtech is still awaiting regulatory approval for its acquisition of forex trading platform owner Plus500 that it had agreed to buy for 460 million pounds in June.\nBoth the AVA Trade and Plus500 deals had been expected to be completed by the end of September.\nShares in Playtech were trading marginally lower at 804.5 pence in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.\n(Reporting by Aastha Agnihotri in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:32:16.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
