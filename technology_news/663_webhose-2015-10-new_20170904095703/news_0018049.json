Tanks and drones can also be seen, along with large hangars that North 38 said could be housing rocket launchers or weaponry.\n\"The ballistic missile launchers and long-range self-propelled guns that are the stars of North Korean military parades are not identifiable, they may be under the large temporary shelter,\" the website said.\n\"Alternatively they could arrive a day or two before the parade as sometimes has happened in the past.\"\nThe grounds are 1.5 square kilometres (0.6 square miles) and include a replica of Kim Il Sung Square, named after North Korea's founding father, where the actual parade will take place Saturday, 38 North said.\n\"Throughout the facility numerous groups of troops are seen assembling and moving in formation around the practice track, passing before the replica reviewing stand,\" according to the site.\nNorth Korea has been primped and primed ahead of the lavish parade, with statues of former leaders erected throughout the country.\nIn the frenzy leading up to the event, the capital has been plastered with posters and banners extolling the party's achievements.\nPreparations for the anniversary celebrations began in May when tents were erected at the former airbase and troops and equipment were shipped in.\nThere has been speculation in recent weeks that North Korea could mark the day with a satellite rocket launch and, in the following weeks, a fourth nuclear test.\nBut despite numerous hints from Pyongyang to the contrary, satellite images and South Korean intelligence have uncovered no tangible signs that a rocket launch is imminent.\nIn addition to promoting national pride, mass military parades have in the past emphasised loyalty to the supreme leader, Kim Jong-Un, who is almost certain to preside over Saturday's affair.\nSuch events are one of the rare occasions when foreign press are allowed in the country, though their movements are largely restricted.
