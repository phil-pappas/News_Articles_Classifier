A near-field communication chip beneath the dial lets the device function in a way similar to a bank card.\nTalking about why the watch was being sold in China first, Hayek said that while Swatch always considered its home territory of Switzerland first, “my God, it takes months and months and years” to do something new with Swiss banks.\nThe introduction of the watch comes as Swiss watchmakers have struggled with a shrinking Chinese market since the country’s government started discouraging exuberant spending among officials in late 2012. With the Apple Watch on sale for as little as $349, traditional watchmakers are adding electronic functions to their own products.\nGame Not Over “It is important for Swatch to have its own version of the ‘smartwatch’, as Apple and other technology companies seek to build beachheads on the left wrist,” Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in a note on Wednesday. “This is one game for Swatch in a match which is clearly not over.”\nThe product adds to the competition faced by Apple and Samsung’s smartwatches, which have payment capabilities but aren’t linked in to the Unionpay network. Wearable devices could top $32.2 billion in sales by 2019, up from $18.9 billion last year, estimates researcher IHS, whose forecast includes devices like hearing aids.\nWatch-Straps Cie. Financiere Richemont SA offers intelligent watch-straps under the Montblanc brand for 350 euros ($399) each, while LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has said it will introduce a $1,400 TAG Heuer smartwatch later this year. Apple is also looking to add a touch of luxury to its smartwatch, evidenced by its collaboration with Hermes to make bands for the Apple Watch.\nSwatch has decades of experience developing technology that might go into a smartwatch, such as long-lasting batteries so thin they’re bendable. The company’s Tissot brand has made watches with touch-screens since 1999 that now offer an altimeter, a compass, and sensors to record a diver’s descent.\nChina’s mobile payment transactions jumped 134 percent to 22.6 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in 2014, according to the central bank. UnionPay, once the nation’s monopolized payment network, faces rising competition from third-party payment service providers including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., while foreign firms such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. are also eyeing the Chinese market.\n(An earlier version of this story corrected the location of the briefing.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:52:26.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
