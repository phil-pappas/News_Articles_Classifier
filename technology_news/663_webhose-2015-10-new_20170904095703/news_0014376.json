The 111 low- or no-cost, lower-division general education online courses were submitted by a group of non-accredited course providers , including StraighterLine, chosen to participate in the Alternative Credit Project. Forty colleges, universities and systems are taking part in the project and have agreed to grant credit for a large number of these courses, which include disciplines such as business, critical thinking and writing, foreign language, humanities, mathematics and natural and physical sciences.\nClick here to see the list of the courses offered by StraighterLine.\nSays Burck Smith, StraighterLine’s founder and CEO, “Without the infrastructure of a college, nontraditional providers like StraighterLine are able to offer online college courses that are more affordable than the same courses offered by colleges. As the fastest growing, independent provider of academic credit, StraighterLine is pleased to play a major role in the ACP project.”\n“This is an important step for an initiative that already has significantly increased our body of knowledge about the most effective ways to increase the number of Americans able to earn a college degree or credential by using education, training and life experiences gained outside a formal classroom,” said ACE President Molly Corbett Broad.\n“Nontraditional students who often are balancing multiple family and career demands now know where they can turn to take courses that will help them reduce the time and expense required to gain a postsecondary degree or credential at a number of outstanding institutions,” said Deborah Seymour, ACE assistant vice president for education attainment and innovation.\nACE will be collecting anonymized data from participating institutions regarding the number of credits each institution accepts through this project as well as progress and success rates of students who transfer in consortium-approved courses.\nThe project is made possible by a $1.89 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\nAbout ACE\nFounded in 1918, ACE is the major coordinating body for all the nation's higher education institutions, representing more than 1,600 college and university presidents and related associations.
