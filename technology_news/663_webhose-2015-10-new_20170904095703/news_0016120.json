Check out NCSA's informative \"Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity in Your Business\" infographic: http://ncsam.info/1MNuPQg . \n\"Many SMBs seem to have a false sense of security, forgetting that hackers are more interested in the sensitivity of stolen data than just the size of the business,\" said Michael Kaiser, executive director of NCSA. \"Building a culture of cybersecurity is the best line of defense for all businesses. SMBs should first identify their most valuable assets, put measures in place to protect them, be able to recognize if an incident has occurred and know how they would respond and recover from an attack. Employees play a critical role in protecting business, and educating them about how to use the networks more securely is essential.\" \nGetting employees on board is crucial to keeping your business safe, particularly when they are outside the office. With a new CompTIA study showing that more than six in 10 employees use company-issued mobile devices to work from home, on the road, or for personal activities, it is increasingly important to secure the digital bridge between work and home. Moreover, 94 percent of employees say they connect their laptop or mobile devices to unsecured Wifi networks, putting data at greater risk. SMBs can ensure that employees use safe online practices by teaching them to protect all devices connected to the Internet. For tips on keeping mobile devices safe visit http://ncsam.info/1N9jCwq \nSimplifying Cybersecurity for SMBs - A Five-Step Approach In collaboration with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), NCSA is developing a five-step approach to improve small and midsized business security and protect sensitive customer and employee data. Translating the DHS-recommended National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework and the Federal Trade Commission's \"Start with Security\" guidelines, this accessible approach provides business owners with a concrete, customizable cybersecurity roadmap. BBB and the NCSA have developed informational programs and materials that businesses can use during NCSAM and throughout the year. For SMB resources visit www.bbb.org . \n\"Larger enterprises are beefing up their security, leaving often underprepared, under-resourced SMBs squarely in the sights of cybercriminals,\" said Bill Fanelli, chief security officer of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. \"With the NIST-based, five-step approach, we are able to empower SMBs with actionable resources and the know-how that will arm them with the tools to proactively protect their business' crown jewels - from intellectual property and customer info to financial data. We are pleased to drive this effort in collaboration with NCSA. Business and consumer groups can request a speaker by contacting their local BBB office.\" \nThe World's Largest Social Network Kicks Off Fifth Annual 'Hacktober' Facebook takes a proactive approach to security, including how it creates and retains a security-conscious culture. Its annual month-long initiative, Hacktober, reinforces formal training with contests, events, and simulated hacks to remind all employees that good security requires vigilance. Facebook is also sharing what it's learned with other organizations that want to build similar programs on its Facebook Security Page . For starters, awareness programs should help employees feel comfortable discussing security and raising potential concerns, build relationships with appropriate security teams, and have fun instead of feel alarmed. \nUpcoming Events and SMB Resources -- #2Factor Tuesday, October 6 in Washington, D.C.: NCSA and the FIDO Alliance will host the first-ever #2FactorTuesday at Google to raise international awareness for two-factor authentication as a means of enhancing the security of online accounts.
