They also are not guaranteeing the quality or authenticity of an item. \nPolice say they want to have a site where people can be safe when completing online purchases. \nThey say the lobby and parking lot are under 24-hour camera surveillance and officers are usually nearby. \nPolice departments nationwide have set up \"safe zones\" to decrease violence related to online purchases.
