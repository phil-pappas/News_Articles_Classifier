Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected revenue of $14.83 billion.\nThe Santa Clara, Calif., company's biggest business remains chips that power PCs, a sector that continued to struggle in the latest quarter, with IDC and rival Gartner both reporting that shipments declined in the period and received little help from the release of Microsoft Corp.'s new Windows 10 operating system.\nBuyers also may be putting off purchases until the arrival of PCs built with Skylake, a long-awaited overhaul of Intel's flagship Core line of microprocessors, which aren't expected to reach many consumers until later this fall.\nOverall, Intel reported a profit of $3.11 billion, or 64 cents a share, down from $3.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue decreased slightly to $14.47 billion from $14.55 billion.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of 59 cents and revenue of $14.22 billion. The semiconductor giant in July projected revenue of $14.3 billion, plus or minus $500 million.\nGross margin fell to 63% from 65%.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com\n 13, 2015 16:23 ET (20:23 ", "external_links": ["http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Checked.gif", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/sm-share-en.gif", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "http://im.mstar.com/Im/Mbr/Form_PremCheckbox_Unchecked.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:08:45.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
