As a leading full-service provider of audio-visual resources specializing in the rental, sale, design and installation of lighting, sound and video systems for corporate, educational, retail and museum markets, the new division expands the company’s scope to offer clients streamlined access to conceptual development and creative content design capabilities for their increasingly complex live event productions. For almost 30 years, Riverview has worked with both event producers and directly with end-user clients to mount increasingly complex live event productions involving state-of-the-art technologies such as 3D projection mapping and 4K projection for today’s most influential brands, including Facebook, Cisco, GE, Nikon and Columbia Sportswear. For the past eight years, Riverview has delivered technical production expertise for Google I/O, its global yearly Developers Conference in San Francisco.

Our dedicated Creative Services division streamlines the process of producing innovative live events for clients that need to leverage the full palette of our service offerings, whether for a global sales summit, product launch, developers conference or trade show booth.”\nThe new Creative Services division is led by Franco Berardi, Riverview’s award-winning Director of Design Services, and features the talents of Johnathan Regnier, Riverview’s Sr. Creative Manager, who previously served as a Corporate Event Manager for Apple, Inc.\n“The Creative Services division offers clients a more efficient approach to integrating their existing marketing strategy into a live event production, which is increasingly taking a ‘theme-park’ approach with every part of the event – from the entrance and reception areas to the break-out rooms, hallways and main stage – branded with the overall concept,” Berardi says. “Our reputation for a deep understanding of technology, flawless execution and artistic excellence are competitive assets that deliver powerful audience experiences.”\n‘Stryking’ Example Of Great Work:\nWith the new Creative Services division, Riverview will be able to partner with clients to develop overall event concepts and execute them across numerous platforms, including on-screen graphics, digital signage, web/mobile apps, print material and speaker scripts.\nOne recent example of a company that benefited from the full scope of Riverview’s service offerings is the neurovascular division of medical device manufacturer, Stryker. For the company’s recent global sales conference in Prague, Riverview worked with the client to develop the event theme, “The Fire Within,” then mounted the complex production and created numerous design elements that reinforced the concept onsite and online. Additionally, Riverview handled speaker script development, rehearsal and overall presentation coaching.\nFor additional information about the new Riverview Systems Group Creative Services division, click here .\nAbout Riverview Systems:\nSince 1987, Silicon Valley-based Riverview Systems Group, Inc., has been providing the world’s leading brands with the technical and production design expertise to successfully produce engaging and innovative live events The award-winning, full-service provider of audio-visual resources specializes in the rental, sale, design, installation and implementation of lighting, sound and video systems for corporate, retail, museum and educational markets.\nRecognizing that creative delivery of digital media is the new frontier of event staging today, Riverview offers a comprehensive array of technical and creative services, as well as an extensive inventory of state-of-the-art, well-maintained equipment including cutting-edge wide-screen projection, media server delivery, and LED display technology.
