It can pick up signals as far as 60 miles away. (Photo: Terk)\n7 CONNECT 51 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Cutting the cord isn’t always easy. There can be many considerations.\nThose looking to cut the cord often have lots of questions about how to go about it. We tapped into some experts to help answer some recent queries that landed in the Cutting the Cord in-box:\nQ: I have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Roku and DirecTV. I also have a flat pancake antenna. I just want my local stations and to ditch my pay-TV service. Is it better to just get basic cable with the other providers?\nA: Those who live close enough to their local broadcast stations can use an over-the-air digital-TV antenna to receive local live networks such as ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox. And many local broadcasters offer sub-channels of unique content such as local news, sports and weather and foreign language programs, says Ian Geise, senior vice president for RCA/Terk Antennas.\nThese signals \"are uncompressed, which means you will get the best possible HD picture, even better than cable or satellite,\" he says. To see a full list of channels available to you with an antenna, go to rcaantennas.net or TVFool.com and type in your ZIP code.\nSome indoor and outdoor antennas can pick up the signals of stations more than 50 miles away, says Phil Swann, editor and publisher of TVPredictions.com . However, tall buildings, trees, mountains and other obstacles can block signals, he says, so the only true test is to install an antenna and see what you can pick up.\nIf you live too far out of town, free TV through an antenna may not be a realistic option, says Chris Brantner, who runs the CutCableToday website . If that's the case, unfortunately cord cutting might not be a good fit, he says, especially if high-speed Internet isn't offered by a provider.\nAs for basic cable, remember that the prices generally look pretty good up front, Brantner says. However, be aware that when the promotional price ends, they'll likely jack your bill up, and you'll be stuck until your contract is up, he says.\nSwann notes that Sony's new PlayStation Vue streaming service offers local channels in seven markets: Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, L.A., Philadelphia, Miami and New York. Plans start at $49; you need a PlayStation 3 or PS4 to watch Vue.\nQ: What can I use for a DVR to record?\nTV antenna maker Channel Master makes the DVR+ digital video recorder ($249 or $399 with 1 terabyte hard drive) that connects to your broadband network, your TV and an over-the-air antenna. (See my 2014 story on the product.) The thin, sleek recorder integrates your favorite apps such as Netflix and Hulu into a programming guide with any local TV channels. It has two tuners, so you can record one program and watch another.\nThe newest TiVo Bolt DVR comes in 500-gigabyte ($299) and 1-terabyte ($399) models to record video and incorporates streaming apps, too. Another option is the Tablo (starts at $197) set-top box, which lets you connect a hard drive to record local TV signals and has apps for watching on your TV and portable devices. \"Tablo is my DVR of choice,\" Brantner says.\nThe Tablo DVR connects to your over-the-air antenna and lets you watch and record local TV broadcasts at home and on portable devices. (Photo: Tablo)\nQ: The only thing really keeping me from cutting the cord is football. Typically I'll DVR my home team and watch later without commercials the same day. Is there a way to make that happen?\nA: There are many ways beyond traditional pay-TV service to watch your local NFL team and many other teams, Swann says. An antenna could receive signals of your local Fox, NBC and CBS stations, which broadcast your local team's games — and college football games, too. And you can connect one of the DVRs mentioned above.\nCBS has a streaming service for most local CBS affiliates but the NFL games are not included yet (that might change next season), Swann says. There's also CBS College Sports Live , which features online games from 75 schools. Plans start at $9.95 a month.\nVerizon Wireless customers can watch live streams of their local NFL teams for free on mobile devices with the NFL Mobile app . You can also see the games played on Thursday, Sunday and Monday nights. And college sports on Verizon's new go90 free, ad-supported mobile video service includes content from CBS, ESPN, the ACC Digital Network and Campus Insiders.\nA screen shot of the NFL Mobile app on a tablet.

Finally, you may even be able to subscribe online to DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket (starting at about $150 for the season), if you can prove you are unable to receive DirecTV's satellite signals with a dish.\n\"Cutting the Cord\" is a regular column covering Net TV and ways to get it.
