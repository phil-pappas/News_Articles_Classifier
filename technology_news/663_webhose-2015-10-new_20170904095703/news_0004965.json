Police vans were arriving and at least nine were parked inside the Parliamentary precinct. Among them were also units from the Western Cape Public Order Police (POP), Southern Cape rural POP and the flying squad.\n\"Eleven police vans, engines idling, are lined up outside Parliament. A small group from Right2Know are writing posters on the pavement. A handful of policeman are milling around. The visitor's centre is shut.\"\nThe demonstrations were sparked last week by Wits University students, who blockaded the entrance to the Johannesburg university's campus after the institution indicated it would raise fees by 10.5% for 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:14:41.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
