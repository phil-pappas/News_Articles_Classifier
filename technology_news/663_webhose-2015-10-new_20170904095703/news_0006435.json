Thomas Frith, who is presenting the winner’s award at EuroTalk’s Junior Language Challenge later this week, enjoyed learning German and thinks Mandarin is a great language.\nLondon (PRWEB UK) 15 October 2015\n“Languages are really important,” says 12-year-old Thomas. “They’re fun, they stretch your mind and let you talk to other people, which I feel is polite, rather than expecting everyone else to learn English. I think languages should be taught properly from an earlier age and children should get the chance to learn as many as they like.”\nThomas’s mother Deborah added, “Thomas has always enjoyed picking up other languages – we went on holiday to France when he was two, and before I knew it, he was ordering and paying for his own ice lollies!\"\n“Young children are capable of achieving great things when given opportunities, and a challenge like the JLC provides them with the means.”\nChildren as young as six have been learning Portuguese, Mandarin and Arabic as part of the annual Junior Language Challenge using games in EuroTalk ’s unique online software.\nRichard Howeson, EuroTalk’s chairman and founder of the Junior Language Challenge (JLC) says learning languages is fun and improves lives: “We believe every child should discover that joy of learning languages and I believe passionately that it helps them to develop other skills and to make friends. I’m so excited that Thomas, a Child Genius, shares this belief and will be presenting the awards on the day.”\nThis year’s competition for children aged 10 and under started in March and saw over 1,100 children representing 60 primary schools across the UK taking part with 33 finalists.\nIt culminates on Friday at Language Show Live , London Olympia, where 33 pupils will battle it out for the crown and a chance to win a trip to Africa to see how onebillion – the charity that benefits from the entry fees - is teaching children with similar software.\nBackground\nFor more details, contact Liz Dyer, EuroTalk Marketing Manager on 0207 371 7711 or liz@eurotalk.com.
