Whether a business is in need of remaining compliant with federal or state regulations, or simply needs to connect securely with clients, CustomerConnect can help.\nCustomerConnect comes in the form of a customizable HTML widget that is placed directly on a business’ website. From here, it acts as a secure communication portal; clients have the ability to compose messages with attachments, selecting one of the business’ recipients, and sending securely. The message is then protected both in transit and at rest, reaching the selected recipient within a matter of seconds, as the message is transported via NeoCertified’s secure environment (which is housed in an SSAE 16 Type II Certified Datacenter). This will ensure that all messages and attachments remain safe and compliant at all times.\nCustomerConnect also enhances the user experience, making secure communication a simple, seamless process that is accessible from any and all internet-connected devices.\nUsers can even place a link to CustomerConnect in their standard email footer, which would allow recipients to respond securely. And with up to six customizable recipient location fields, clients will be able to securely communicate with the respective specified departments of their choosing within a given business.\nFeel free to try CustomerConnect today at NeoCertified.com , or sign up for a complimentary trial version.\nNEOCERTIFIED SECURE EMAIL was co-founded by CEO Peter J.
