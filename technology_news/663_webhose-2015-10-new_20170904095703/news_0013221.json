We thought that A8 would be the end of story. Now out comes the Galaxy A9 which was just leaked a couple of days ago. - Advertisement - \nAt a glance, you would have the preconception that the Galaxy A9 would be superior to the Galaxy A8 in all ways right? Well, that is partially true to a certain extent. In summary, the Galaxy A8 has a 5.7-inch Full HD screen, Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset, Octa-core processor made up of Quad-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics, 2GB RAM and 16MP-5MP camera – all wrapped in beautiful metal and Samsung’s thinnest model ever at just 5.9mm thin. It is also currently on sale for approximately $499 USD that is still at an affordable price range for this kind of specs. \nThe Galaxy A9 might not be the thinnest and might not be as large as the Galaxy A8 though. As of now, we have to wait for further confirmation from the South Korean manufacturer on its body size and weight. \nBut what we do know is that the Galaxy A9 is expected to be released only in December 2015. And it will be sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen that displays 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density that makes for some nice viewing. It should have some form of protection, perhaps Gorilla Glass 4? \nPerformance-wise, according to the leak - the Galaxy A9 will be equipped with the Qualcomm MSM8976 Snapdragon 620 chipset, an Octa-core comprising Quad-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A72 & Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 510 graphics and 3GB RAM. - Advertisement - \nAs for the camera department, it is set to be using Samsung’s top-of-the-line 16 Megapixel primary camera which can be found on Galaxy S6/S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 5. That should be good news indeed. Then there should be the 5 Megapixel secondary camera to cater for all your selfies and video calls. \nIn terms of storage, the Galaxy A9 will be getting a rather generous 32GB of internal storage. And if that’s not enough, you can add in a maximum of 128GB of space via its microSD slot. \nAnother thing that is uncertain at this point of time, is on its battery. The Galaxy A8 has a non-removable Li-Ion 3050 mAh battery, so you would expect that the Galaxy A9 should have more or less around that size. \nOne thing for certain, and very good news for everyone is that; even though it might be running on Android Lollipop 5.1.1 for the time being – it will be getting the update to the latest Marshmallow 6.0. That’s awesome news indeed. - Advertisement - \nWith the way that things are going, we might see the end of the Samsung Galaxy A lineup with the release of the Galaxy A9. It marks the beginning and the end of the metal series from Samsung, a bold move by them in the first place. Ending it with a high is just the way you would have wanted it, until the next reboot comes along; and I’m pretty sure it will come very soon. \nLarge 5.5-inch screen (although not as large as the 5.7-inch Galaxy A8), metal body that oozes premium look and feel, packed with performance that is better than the Galaxy A8, camera that is as good as the flagship Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy Note 5, and the promise of an update to the latest Android Marshmallow OS; makes it a very irresistible proposition. \nThe Samsung Galaxy A9 is expected to be available only in December 2015, and the price is yet to be confirmed for now. It will be available in Pearl White, Midnight Black and Champagne Gold.
