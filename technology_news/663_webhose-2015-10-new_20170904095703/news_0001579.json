Due to the lack of a national eye bank facility and lack of donors corneal transplantation in Qatar relies on tissue brought from other countries. Being sensitive one cell layer must survive handling and a long journey to make the surgery a success but the cells cannot be seen and assessed without this special microscope. \n\nThe possibility of decaying tissues due to faulty harvesting from the donor inappropriate storage and handling and travel delays may expose the delicate cell layers to adverse circumstances. \n\nThis will reduce the number of properly functioning cells necessary for a successful transplant procedure. If poor quality material is used an unsuccessful surgery due to primary graft failure (example — the transplant does not work properly and the cornea is opaque instead of being clear) results. “Primary graft failure makes the patient suffer psychologically and physically and necessitates an immediate second surgery” says Professor Alexander Bialasiewicz Head of the Ophthalmology Department at Al-Ahli Hospital.
