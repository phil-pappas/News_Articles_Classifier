It makes XP look good. So, continue to take away Win7/8.1's market share, Windows 10, make XP shine brighter next month! \n(Btw, the second Win 8.1 entry, shouldn't it be Win 8.0?) Martin Brinkmann October 1, 2015 at 6:24 pm # \nYou are right, the second entry should be Windows 8.0 and not Windows 8.1. Sorry for that. jimp October 1, 2015 at 7:56 pm # \nI am VERY surprised that Windows XP is in second place, with 12% of the market. That is about double Windows 10. I was thinking about dropping support for XP. But now -- probably not. Reply Teddy Ficile October 1, 2015 at 8:10 pm # \nSurprised as well, surprised even more to read a share increase of XP! How can the market get more XPs ? Tom Hawack October 1, 2015 at 9:40 pm # \nProbably Win95 users who have upgraded :=) Martin Brinkmann October 1, 2015 at 9:42 pm # \nThese numbers are not official and I suspect them to fluctuate quite a bit (e.g. total number of unique devices tracked). It is likely that smaller fluctuations are not necessarily indicative of a trend. Nebulus October 1, 2015 at 11:34 pm # \n@Tom Hawack: They were actually Win10 users who have upgraded! :)) Pants October 2, 2015 at 5:35 am # \n@Teddy +0.07 is statistically meaningless and well within any margin of error \n@jimp - if you exclude govt/business/enterprise machines running legacy software (and if you discount all those hanging on to an old old old pc because its all they have/can afford), then the number will drop significantly. When I meet any new clients running XP, I tell them its time to move on, ditch it - the OS is 16 years old, hasn't been supported by MS for 2(?) years, and any machine that came with it is probably at least 6+ years old. If they moan about legacy software then a) there's always an XP virtual machine and b) maybe they need to change software because the situation won't fix itself and will have to be sorted out sooner or later. \nXP needs to die (as does Vista, IMO). Then again ... 12% XP users .. hmmm ... hacker's delight Teddy Ficile October 1, 2015 at 8:08 pm # \nI have no idea of Windows 10's future. I don't believe the developer will draw back the browser's data collecting systems and if this now notorious aspect of Windows 10 has anything to do with September's slowing down growth then it might be a serious obstacle to a wider enthusiastic adoption by the users. Also, Windows 10 as it is presented is a browser crafted for auto-upgrading rather than being followed by its successor which means that if it fails big problems may arise for Microsoft, leaving as such a slight hope to have, if applicable, if not a U-turn at least a curve in the inquisitive aspects of the browser. This is how I see it right now but, frankly, this is pure speculation. Reply Pants October 2, 2015 at 5:38 am # \nlulzwut? ... Windows 10 is not a browser - I do not think that word means what you think it means Nebulus October 1, 2015 at 9:22 pm # \nXP for the Win! :) Leandro October 1, 2015 at 10:07 pm # \nI guess Windows 10 figures are based on brand new PCs sales shipping with the new OS. Reply Tom Hawack October 2, 2015 at 12:09 am # \nWhile enjoying a break between tea and music I was wondering about how to explain so much controversy nowadays when it comes to software and perhaps proportional to the software's importance : an OS, oh my! \nAm I off-topic? If so please pardon me. \nI don't recall all the fuss be it legitimate controversy regarding the latest Microsoft OS. From Windows 3 up to 7 announced new OSs have never endured the very tough vox populi we observe with Windows 10. Vista and 8 have had their lot of criticism but that was once the OS trully anchored in the users' experience, not so quickly and strongly as with the 10 ... \nSo is it that we, users, are on the trend of requiring more and more quality and accepting less and less in return, or is it that we are slowly diving in an era of decline when it comes to quality, honesty, what was once qualified as \"good stuff\"?

Womble October 2, 2015 at 5:12 am # \nSip ... Why wait 'til the evening. Mike J. October 2, 2015 at 12:11 am # \nJust a guess, but there are a lot of pirated copies of XP floating around. MS doesn't support it anymore, but they don't seem to be stopping people from using it either--except maybe by sneaking 10 onto their systems. Win 7 is still available from places like Staples, New Egg, and Tiger Direct here in the U.S.. You have at pay about a $50 premium for it. Reply Tom Hawack October 2, 2015 at 12:39 am # \nLike Cuba with its automobiles of the fifties maybe tomorrow's Web will include zones equipped with old, very old OSs. The core of computers is becoming for an increasing number of techies as easy to manipulate as a transistor radio back in the sixties so why not imagine populations no longer thrilled by the latest technology but rather by making, tweaking their own home-made/repaired systems? After all what else than the name of the OS remains on a machine so heavily tweaked that it has become de facto a system of its own? Officially reported as an XP but maybe much more than that under the hood... who knows how our civilization will deal will the digital era? Mike J. October 2, 2015 at 1:57 am # \nAren't folks who can do such usually in the Linux camp?? Not arguing, just asking. And old cars that can't be hacked into making it run into an oak tree might become popular in the near future.
