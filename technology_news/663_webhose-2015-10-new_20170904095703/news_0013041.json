Morgan analyst Rod Hall predicts Apple will sell 24 million new Apple TV units next year, accounting for more than three per cent of Apple’s yearly earnings.\nOutside the bottom line, analysts believe opening up apps on the Apple TV could do for set-top boxes what its App Store did for smartphones.\nJackdaw Research chief analyst Jan Dawson says the Apple TV had enormous potential to bring mobile gaming to the console market.\n“It’s going to bring casual gaming that we do on our phones into the living room, making it a more social experience but on a bigger screen,” he says. “That’s a big deal in it’s own right.”\nDawson says the two leading players in the console market — Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation — shouldn’t be worried Apple will claim their turf overnight.\n“They are not going to lose hardcore gamers to this. This device doesn’t have the same power,” he says.\n“Nintendo certainly should be worried because this is much more in that casual gaming category. It will probably shave some points off the Xbox and PlayStation marketshare but it’s a much bigger threat to Nintendo.”\nNew box ...

Taking the game to the new platform allowed the game to evolve.\n“For the developers, it’s going to be great,” Sum says. “The new remote, you’ve got great touch controls there. For our game, it worked really well. There’s going to be a lot of interesting things\nyou can do with it.”\nRod Chester travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Apple.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ecae1b683450e545f3e0f2a8a04e845b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7e348d480a7abad18008ec7db8ae00c8", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ae8a1215fd62741c4dc89afb86915731", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2Fw5dXRodzqF0JDBAcz2EoCC_rRNC15epY%2Fpromo266372581&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6c6127c0f4f9a12a4cd82a51448afa44", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-22T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:26:01.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
