Powered by EDUonGo, a cloud-based eLearning platform, Ucodemy used EDUonGo’s LTI feature to combine Scratch, a popular visual programming language, with their learning management system.\nIn addition to providing the same free activities found at Scratch.com, such as interactive stories, games and animations, Itch also integrates ready-to-go lessons inside the Scratch user interface. Teachers also have the option of creating their own coding courses.\nBecause of the program's single unified experience, students are able to bypass the inconvenience of managing multiple browser windows.\n“Itch is a resource that provides all of the features of the Scratch coding program but without the hassles of the open Internet,” says Jason Rukman, Principal at Ucodemy.\nBy providing each teacher a private workspace, students’ projects can be shared instantaneously with their classmates and teachers. The secure social network also makes it easy for teachers to manage student projects without the clutter or noise of millions of other users.\n“Itch gives my students and I reliable access to the tools found in Scratch as well as video tutorials,” says Cheryl Steenson, teacher at Secondary Academy for Success in Washington State. “Itch helped me incorporate coding into my English class, where students can tell creative, interactive and meaningful stories while learning a real life skill.”\nCurrently, Itch is offering a limited number of free teacher accounts.
