Similar to the early gaming consoles, virtual reality is an emerging and expensive industry to thrive in. It burst into the broader public consciousness in late 2014, when Facebook acquired the leading virtual reality headset company, Oculus Rift, for a whopping $2 billion.\nVirtual reality revolution Rather than create a competing hardware product, 8i is focusing on developing the software that produces the experiences viewed on the headsets or screens.\n\"There has been a lot of talk all through the media, radio, television and film about what is the next step in the evolution of media,\" Mr Gasking said.\nAshton Kutcher has backed the funding round describing it as an entirely new entertainment medium. Michael Clayton-Jones \"But virtual reality isn't a step, it's a complete revolution beyond the two-dimensional screen.\"\nVirtual reality software allows people to don a headset or use a screen and move through their environment, directly controlling where they look and how they move rather than taking in the point-of-view defined a the director.\nFounders Fund partner Scott Nolan, who will join the board, told the Financial Times they were searching for the next breakthrough technology when they met the 8i team.\nExpansion plans Congrats to @8iReality on closing this round of funding. Get ready for an entirely new entertainment medium\nâ€” ashton kutcher (@aplusk) October 14, 2015 The funding will allow the young company to continue to grow. It already straddles two headquarters: an engineering hub in Wellington New Zealand that builds and manages the digital platform as well as a sales office in San Francisco.\nThe $US13.5 million raised will go towards developing both teams but also launching a studio in Los Angeles' Culver City near Hollywood that works with music, film and entertainment producers to create the content to be explored on the platform.\n\"The biggest challenge for us is now harder than ever: narrowing down which opportunities to do in what order,\" Mr Gasking said.\n\"Everyone wants to do this. Once someone puts one of the headsets on, you know how huge and different the future is and a long list of stuff to [do] with it just unrolls in your head. Now with the funding, the struggle to narrow down our focus to what we can do in a timely way is even tougher.\"\nAlso tough will be the competition. Most major movie studios and development houses have their own divisions working on similar projects or have backed fledgling companies similar to 8i.\nBut Mr Gasking is confident 8i will survive the early heats to emerge as a leader in the field.\n\"We're staying rigorously focused on enabling the best videos, the highest quality experience we can, because that's ultimately what will win the day.\"\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story described Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as being involved in the company.
