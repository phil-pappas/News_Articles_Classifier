Get ready for the chorus, “Sixty per cent of Canadians voted against the Liberals.”\nThis time is different, though: Justin Trudeau announced early in the campaign this would be the last first-past-the-post federal election in Canada. Can’t wait!\nBy the way, under the German system (mixed member proportional), excellent but just-defeated MPs like Megan Leslie and Peter Stoffer would still be in Parliament. Worth looking at?\nGlenn Walton, Halifax\nAfter the toxic years of George W. Bush, the Obama Democrats wasted their filibuster-proof majority. Justin Trudeau’s Liberals must do better with their new progressive majority. A new voting system of ranked ballots must be a priority: It will guarantee that candidates get majority support, will reject the cronyism of party lists, and will help ensure that the toxic years of Stephen Harper never happen again.\nDerek Smith, Toronto\nAbout that Senate\nThis election opened a great opportunity for our new PM to set the tone for the future. Highly regarded parliamentarians were defeated in this election. I heard descriptors like smart, hard-working, dedicated, etc. coming from experienced observers. So it would seem that we have a long list of experienced and qualified Canadians to fill those empty Senate seats.\nIt has long been said that the path to a better Senate is the appointment of better Senators.\nIt might not sit totally well with Liberals to have the PM nominate NDP and Conservative pols, but this would certainly gain points with the nation, and put the theory to the test.\nBrian Williams, Belleville, Ont.\nAsk Elizabeth May\nAs the best of parliamentarians, Elizabeth May as Speaker of the House could help re-establish the historical supremacy and relevance of that body with her abundant intelligence, knowledge and common sense. One can hope.\nBill McAndrew, Ottawa\nThe first, and globally important, task for the new federal government is to clean up the Augean Stable left after 10 years of shameful inaction on climate change policies by the Harper government. A brilliant move by Justin Trudeau would be to ask Elizabeth May to become environment minister and lead the Paris delegation. That would be a note of thanks to all the Canadians who voted strategically (i.e. NDPers and Greens) and let the Liberals win the first-past-the-post lottery.\nAnthony Friend, Ottawa\nAmong the lessons\nAmong the lessons learned by the Conservatives on Monday night, one should be first and foremost: It’s time to recruit Ben Mulroney.\nCharles Caldwell, Saskatoon\nMr. Harper’s wins\nI write this as a lifelong Liberal: For all the negatives, Stephen Harper had some big accomplishments that were not possible under a Liberal leader, and needed an outsider to achieve:\n1) He brought Quebec back into the fold, by giving the Québécois a federalist option that was not sponsorship-scandal related. Once that door was opened, it paved the way for Quebec to seriously re-engage with the rest of the country, and consider voting for other options than the Bloc;\n2) He opened Canada to trade across the Pacific and with Europe, taking us past having only one real trading partner;\n3) He gave autonomy back to the provinces. I don’t wish to see a return to the days of fighting between provincial leaders on how to fleece the federal government over health-care dollars;\n4) Perhaps most important, he brought the West back into the government. People forget that there was a real sense that the West might form a separatist movement (some argue it did, in the name of the Reform Party).\nIt was time for Mr. Harper to go, but a lot of his bad work can be undone; one hopes the good things he did are valued by the new government, for they helped unify the nation in a way that I did not know growing up here.\nKia Forooghi, Mississauga\nWhile I am a native Albertan and a Conservative by nature, I’d like to wish Justin Trudeau and the Liberals heartfelt congratulations. They ran a great campaign and soundly won the right to govern.\nThe Liberals executed the Jack Layton playbook to a T (Remember Orange Crush? Likeable, charismatic guy with a positive message); Mr. Trudeau deserves a lot of credit for rebuilding the party and running a positive campaign.\nFor the Conservatives, the election wasn’t as bad is it may seem on the surface. Considering Stephen Harper’s general lack of likeability (let’s face it, he’s never been a popular guy), abrasive style, diversionary tactics and brutally negative campaign, it’s surprising the party held on to as many seats as it did. Even as a “natural” Conservative, I can’t say I’m sorry to see his time end.\nI am most interested in seeing if the Liberals can enact positive change without throwing the oil industry under the bus (as Justin Trudeau’s father did with the national energy program – yes, I still remember those very dark days in Alberta).\nOn the Conservative side, I’m interested in seeing how the party moves forward with a full understanding that relying solely on negativity and fiscal policy will get you nowhere with Canadians: That’s just not who we are.\nA final note on Mr. Harper: He did (for the most part) manage to reunite the right, and weed out some (if not most) of the party’s extreme right-wing elements.\nFor that, and his service to Canada, he deserves at least some respect and thanks.\nBrad Radu, Calgary\nStephen Harper is a political mastermind. First he united the right, now he has united the left.\nThomas von Ledebur, Regina\nJust wondering\nCan we finally return to the rightful title of the “Government of Canada” rather than the “Harper Government”?\nMike Binette, Toronto\nOne wonders what Stephen Harper will do now. He’s never held a private-sector job. I would say that he is just not ready.\nDavid Chalmers, Toronto\nJustin Trudeau deserves congratulations on his party’s victory, but really, couldn’t our newly minted PM (or his speechwriters) have found a more suitable source for an inspirational Quote: than Abraham Lincoln? I’d be willing to bet that somewhere in his own father’s writings there would be something just as appropriate to the occasion as the overused “better angels of our nature.”\nJohn Reardon, Toronto\nPursuant to The Globe’s endorsement of the Conservative Party, I have a plate of crow for the members of your editorial board. To whom should I send it?\nM.
