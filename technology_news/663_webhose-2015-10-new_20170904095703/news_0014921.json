By surveying both current and potential users in the marketplace, the study documents the key perceptions, practices, challenges and success factors in data lake deployment and usage. “As Hadoop adoption in the enterprise continues to grow, so does commitment to the data lake strategy,” remarked Thomas Hogan, publisher of Unisphere Research and Database Trends and Applications. “Although the industry has lacked a well-understood definition of the data lake, clear use cases and best practices are emerging. This study validates that the data lake is a viable strategy that is being used at a growing number of organizations today.”\n“The data lake strategy is a significant strategic part of IT, and while we’re still at the early stages of data lake adoption there is a need to help companies demystify what the data lake is and its value,” said Lindy Ryan, Research Director of Radiant Advisors. “A data lake strategy does not rewrite established information management principles – it’s the next generation for modern data architectures. This survey report will help companies see where they relate to the current state of the industry, and how they compare to their peers in facing key adoption challenges.”\nThis Unisphere Research report was sponsored by industry-leaders Attunity, Hortonworks, Teradata and HP Security.\nTo download a complimentary copy, click here .\nAbout Unisphere\nUnisphere Research, a division of Information Today, Inc.
