Toyota's concept vehicle 'Kikai', pictured in Tokyo \nToyota's FCV Plus similarly functions as a power source for homes and communities as the auto giant aims to turn fuel cell vehicles from \"eco-cars into energy-cars\", it said. \nThe firm's hybrid gasoline-electric offerings, including the Prius, have sold more than eight million units since their launch in 1997. \nBut a limited driving range and lack of refuelling stations have hampered development of fuel-cell and all-electric cars, which environmentalists say could play a vital role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and slowing global warming. \nAgain this year, most US-based automakers, which have not attended the Tokyo Motor Show since before the global financial crisis, are staying away, a reflection of their puny presence in the Japanese market. \nForeign carmakers have long complained that they were effectively shut out of Japan through tariffs and other barriers, although luxury brands tend to enjoy success in the world's number three auto market after China and the United States. \nAmong the overseas automakers attending are BMW, Peugeot Citroen, Porsche, Jaguar and crisis-hit Volkswagen, which is embroiled in one of the biggest scandals in the history of the automobile sector. \nThe German auto giant has admitted it had fitted 11 million of its vehicles with software designed to cheat official checks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:53:43.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
