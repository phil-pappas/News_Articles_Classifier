Watching protesters shouting judgment and hate based on what they call religion is horrible. Is that loving God? Is that loving your neighbor as yourself?”\nYoung, a “progressive theological thinker and a feminist,” also accuses religious groups of fueling the so-called war on women. She says, “Women are being attacked at a moral level by the radical Religious Right. They’ve hijacked the political discussion. This event is an opportunity for progressive religious leaders to stop the silence. We need to be in the conversation.”\nYoung has plans to bless other abortion facilities in the state.\nBishop of the United Methodist Church Gregory Palmer appointed Young to be the executive director of the Ohio Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice . The coalition runs an “all-options” counseling hotline for women facing crisis pregnancies. Young said, “It breaks my heart to know women are sitting in pews across the country feeling shamed, believing that they’re cursed for making this decision. That’s a question I get a lot on the phone, ‘Am I going to hell?’ When God instead is there to support women through it all.”\nGod is there to support women through their abortions murders?\nOnly if your “god” is Satan.\nH/t MomOfIV\nSee also:\nNew Orleans Presbyterian Church holds rally to celebrate abortion Kansas Episcopal Church celebrates 42 years of abortion with fundraiser for Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood abortionist sings about Jesus as he kills unborn Woman who provided 65,000 abortions calls killing of unborn a ‘sacrament’ and a ‘blessing’ Planned Parenthood says God doesn’t think abortion is wrong ~Éowyn", "external_links": ["http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fellowshipoftheminds.com&#038;blog=11081320&#038;post=123761&#038;subd=fellowshipofminds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/10/08/united-methodist-minister-abortion-clinic-shows-a-reverence-for-life-by-killing-babies/", "http://www.preterm.org/", "http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/bless", "https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/laura-young-and-other-female-ministers.jpg?w=500&#038;h=450", "http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/04/10/la-presbyterian-church-holds-rally-to-celebrate-abortion/", "https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/united-methodist-bishop-gregory-palmer.jpg?w=500", "http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/01/09/kansas-episcopal-church-celebrates-42-years-of-abortion-with-fundraiser-for-planned-parenthood/", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com//feed/https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/united-methodist-bishop-gregory-palmer.jpg", "http://www.ohiorcrc.org/wp/", "http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/05/31/planned-parenthood-says-god-doesnt-think-abortion-is-wrong/", "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/10/12/united-methodist-and-episcopalian-church-clergy-lead-prayer-rally-to-bless-abortion-clinic/", "http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/01/03/planned-parenthood-abortionist-sings-about-jesus-as-he-kills-unborn/", "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/07/01/autopsy-report-shows-abortion-clinics-negligence-killed-woman-in-late-term-abortion/", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com//feed/https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/laura-young-and-other-female-ministers.jpg", "http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/12/28/woman-who-provided-65k-abortions-calls-killing-of-unborn-a-sacrament-and-blessing/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/123761/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/123761/"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:16:58.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
