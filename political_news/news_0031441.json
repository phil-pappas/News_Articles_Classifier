(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\nAssociated Press Oct. 6, 2015 | 4:46 p.m. EDT + More By CATHERINE LUCEY, Associated Press\nDAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) â€” Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton says she'll offer a plan next week to deal with \"Wall Street abuses.\"\nCampaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, Clinton said her proposal would \"rein in the too-big-to-fail banks and other institutions.\"\nClinton has maintained strong ties to Wall Street from her time as a New York senator. But her chief rival for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pushed hard against the big financial institutions, and he's co-sponsored a bill to restore the law that once separated commercial and investment banking, known as Glass-Steagall.\n\"If you only reinstate Glass-Steagall you don't go after all these other institutions,\" Clinton said when asked if she would try to bring the law back.\n\"What I'm proposing is that we go after the risk. If they are too big to manage, that's a risk and they should not continue.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
