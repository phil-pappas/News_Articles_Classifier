Over the weekend while campaigning in New Hampshire, Ohio governor and callous Republican John Kasich promoted his plan to slash Social Security. If any current or future benefit recipient does not like it, they have to get over it because Kasich is on a mission and he could not care less whether or not the elderly are adversely affected by his entitlement reforms. I'm a good grrrl, I am. Posts: 913 These guys are so evil. I love the first two paragraphs of the article: A person who is callous is someone showing insensitive and cruel disregard for others, and a sane human being would certainly consider a hardened-criminal callous. Unless one has been comatose for the past six years, a sane human being would also likely consider that Republicans are innately callous human beings based on their barbaric and cruel political agendas; particularly towards other Americans. It would be futile to search for any Republican legislation, policy, or crusade over the past six years that did not focus on taking something away from the American people whether it is robbing women of their right to choose their own reproductive health, stealing food from hungry children in poverty, or denying retirees their pensions. Now, a Republican aspiring to be the party’s presidential nominee has shown his, and the party’s, callousness by telling an elderly person he wants to slash their Social Security retirement benefits and they will just “have to get over it.” ....

Yeah, America needs more jokers like this who hate Americans. I'll be listening to all of the Democratic candidates, in all of campaigns to see who is focusing on this issue. It's time to turn the rhetoric around on Social Security, take it away from the Republicans, and actually act on eliminating the cap on earnings once and for all, putting to rest any future rhetoric of cutting benefits, raising the retirement age, again, and in any way allow the future Kasichs of the world to attack Social Security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:40:27.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
