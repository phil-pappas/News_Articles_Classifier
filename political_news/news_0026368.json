Primary underground utilities and dozens of new trees are in place. Workers are installing molded concrete benches and planter retaining walls that will form sleek arcs from the ground. \nJeremy Paris, of the Group Plan Commission, says the renovation should be completed by July. \nThe cost rose from $32 million to $37 million. Some of the increase is a contingency in case work must be accelerated to compensate for bad weather or problems. \nInformation from: The Plain Dealer, http://www.cleveland.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:04:56.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
