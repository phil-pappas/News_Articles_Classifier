(It may also have been a cheap shot, if there are such things in Memphis politics.)\nRegardless, Herenton earned the platform by winning election five times as mayor. And when he said the recently defeated A C Wharton “failed dismally” in proving his capability as mayor, was “incompetent” and was “a blatant liar” as it related to the Deidre Malone contract flap, well, we had to pay attention.\nRead about it here . Watch the 11-minute WREG-TV segment here .\nIt was interesting to hear Herenton volunteer two different claims: One was that “some of Jim’s folks” sought him out for his endorsement, and another was an implication that Wharton made a last-minute play for his endorsement. Herenton’s wording wasn’t exactly clear on that point -- “he reached out to me” -- but that’s the implication with which we're left.\nAnd Herenton did not vote, he said.\nWhat’s the fallout from this? Well, nothing, really. The election was last week. In many ways, it’s just a slab of red meat thrown into the cages of the political echo chamber in this town, with no real lasting significance.\nSure is interesting to parse in the meantime.\nThe Firsties! All this week on First Word, we’ll be giving out the Firsties, our way-too-silly awards on the things that really mattered this campaign season -- you know, who had the best-looking yard sign, and things like that.\nToday, we give out the award for best television ad. Cue awkward 30 seconds with two celebrities reading poor jokes off a TelePrompTer, and now we’re ready for the nominees:\nJIM STRICKLAND, for “Friday Night Lights.”\nPHILIP SPINOSA, for “What Can Philip Spinosa Do For Memphis?”\nHAROLD COLLINS, for “The Truth”\nJIM STRICKLAND, for “Change is on the Way.”\nAnd the winner of the Firstie for best ad: Philip Spinosa, for “What Can Philip Spinosa Do For Memphis?”\nJudge’s comments: This wasn’t easy. The Strickland ads were probably the most effective; “Change is on the Way” was convincing on Strickland-as-mayor and “Friday Night Lights” was an effective idea. For pure over-the-top production value, Collins' “The Truth” delivered.\nBut I went with Spinosa here for the fun concept, and fully knowing that the “Thanks, Mister Spinosa” kid will doubtless be on the ballot in 2045.\nIn transition: As Stricklandia prepares to inherit the seventh floor of City Hall in two and a half months, look for the announcement of a transition team any day now. And be on the lookout for Ryan Poe ’s reporting on said transition in the coming weeks.\nStrickland is scheduled to drop in to The CA later this morning, where we’ll record a podcast interview that should be up in the early afternoon hours. Stay tuned.\nSunday analysis: Now what? It’s the question Strickland asked in jest as his victory party ended Thursday night, and it’s the question he and a new-look Memphis City Council has in mind as New Year’s Day approaches. I wrote a Sunday analysis piece looking ahead at the things they’ll encounter in the coming years, putting on my explaining hat particularly on the financial side.\nDem-bate: The Democratic presidential candidates will debate Tuesday night, and there’s a Hillary Clinton campaign event planned to watch it: It starts at 6:30 p.m. at 902 S. Cooper.\nOn today’s agenda: The County Commission meets today, and you can view its agenda here .\nA caucus turns its lonely eyes to you: So what if Rep. Paul Ryan says “no thanks” to the chorus of House Republicans wanting him to be the next Speaker? Well, Politico mentions two Tennessee possibilities : Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black .\n Ted Evanoff ’s Sunday column examines the mayoral election results . … The Shelby County Election Commission is looking into what happened with Thursday’s slow release of results. … Jeb Bush tailgated in Knoxville Saturday. … Ben Carson is coming to Franklin .\nBy no means least: Our thoughts are with the family of Memphis police officer Terence Olridge today. Our crime & justice coverage team will be working today to find out more about what happened.\n ", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*134/1009_malo_election_mayor1.JPG", "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/09/presidential-candidate-carson-returning-to-williamson/73657122/", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis", "https://affiliates.eblastengine.com/Javascript/Widgets.js?v=8", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/house-gop-backup-plan-speaker-options-214618", "http://www.tennessean.com/picture-gallery/news/politics/2015/10/10/jeb-bush-holds-a-rally-before-the-tennessee-vs-georgia-game/73731410/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jp-nmlwF0A8", "http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://agendapub.shelbycountytn.gov/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=1168&doctype=AGENDA", "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/spacer.gif", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZiJRM61B74", "http://wreg.com/2015/10/10/former-mayor-willie-herenton-discusses-mayors-race/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/--o8gx9c20Q", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIY_Qg5n_pc"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:41:09.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
