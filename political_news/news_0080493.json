Noriega to resign as head of the armed forces. The following year, the U.S. invaded Panama to overthrow Noriega's military regime and prosecute him on drug charges.\nAfter he was deposed, Delvalle went into exile in the U.S. The cause of his death was not publicly announced, though he reportedly suffered from heart problems.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:27:05.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
