The deals, worth more than $3.2 billion , were granted by programs that are facially accessible to both small and large companies.\nThat is the key finding of Shortchanging Small Business , a study released today by Good Jobs First, at: www.goodjobsfirst.org/shortchanging . It was funded by the Surdna Foundation and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. All findings and policy conclusions are solely those of Good Jobs First.\n\"State economic development spending is profoundly biased against small, local and entrepreneurial businesses,\" said Greg LeRoy , executive director of Good Jobs First and lead author of the study. \"Our findings definitively confirm what many small businesspeople have long believed.\"\nThe 14 states where the awards were analyzed are Florida , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Missouri , North Carolina , New Mexico , Nevada , New York , Pennsylvania , Vermont , Virginia and Wisconsin .\nThe slight variation in the degree of big-business dominance among the states (80 to 96 percent of the dollars) is meaningless, since the programs and states vary. The key finding is how consistently the programs grossly favor big businesses.\nThe study, based on a close examination of the recipient companies, designates businesses as large or small based on their employment size as well as their total number of establishments and whether they are locally or independently owned.\n\"As a policy solution, we do not recommend simply reallocating deals and dollars,\" said LeRoy. \"These tax-break deals often mean little to small businesses. Instead, states should reform their incentive rules by tightening eligibility to exclude large recipients. The resulting savings could better fund public goods that benefit all employers and help small businesses with the persistent credit crunch.\"\nShort of excluding big businesses, the report recommends states spend much less on large companies by using safeguards such as dollar caps per deal, dollar caps per job, and dollar caps per company.\nContact Greg LeRoy 202-232-1616 x 211 or goodjobs@goodjobsfirst.org\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-despite-states-pro-small-business-rhetoric-big-businesses-get-dominant-share-of-economic-development-dollars-300162835.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/shortchanging", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC33121&Transmission_Id=201510201000PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC33121&DateId=20151020", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/study-despite-states-pro-small-business-rhetoric-big-businesses-get-dominant-share-of-economic-development-dollars-300162835.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:19:07.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
