George Prexler , A Boy Scout leader, helped him on the union path. Buric enjoyed working wood, but he found that “installing was my calling.’’\nFor most of his work life he worked installing, generally as the job foreman. He did that until he retired in 2005.\nPrexler taught paddling and took the Scouts to the Boundary Waters, back when it was being formed.\nSo building his own canoe came naturally to Buric.\nAn overhead view of Ed Buric’s hand-built canoe.\nCredit: Dale Bowman\nHe used 1/4 x 3/4-inch cedar strips over a form. He made forms from wood leftover from a job at Bell Federal Savings in Chicago. The hull strips are northern white cedar from Maine, which he had shipped via UPS. Except for one strip, a darker mahogany one. That first strip came from a job on an office building in Naperville.\nHe used a router to make each strip in bead and cove. He left one knot in, on the left stern.\n“That is the wood,’’ he said. “I love wood. Think of what God did with wood.’’\nThe thwarts are tiger-striped maple. He used diamond-head bolts on them, once an Old Town Canoe signature. Buric got his bolts from Ralph Frese at Chicagoland Canoe Base.\n“I bought a lot of things from Ralph,’’ said Buric, who had a good relationship with the Hall-of-Famer.\nIn 1957, Buric paddled in Frese’s first Des Plaines River Marathon and came in second with his partner.\nBuric said, “Ralph said, `Light equals fragile.’ ‘’\nSo Buric’s canoe weighed 65 pounds. It is 16 feet long by 36 inches wide.\nOne deck of Ed Buric’s hand-built wooden canoe.\nCredit: Dale Bowman\nThe seat slats are ash, as are the gunnels. Hickory is the one tree native to only North America, so there is a strip of hickory in the middle of birdseye maple in the back deck.\nHe used urea rosin glue made from a powder. He squeezed the glue from an old ketchup bottle into the cove part before the bead was fit in. After it dried, the squeezed out glue was sanded down.\nThen he covered it with fiberglass. There is the one regret that he has about Bonnie–named for his wife. He built it in his garage and in March, the epoxy rosin turned color inside.\nThe canoe was tested on Tampier Lake. The first trip was on the Turtle River off the Flambeau in northern Wisconsin.\n“I can’t tell you the feeling of pride you get when you use something you built with your hands,’’ Buric said. “That is why I am a carpenter.’’\nEd Buric hand-built this 16-foot wooden canoe in his garage in Darien nearly 30 years ago.\nCredit: Dale Bowman", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15straightview.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15deck.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15deck-337x600.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15inside.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15straightview-337x600.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/edburic10-22-15inside-600x337.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:53:15.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
