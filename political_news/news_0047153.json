Jeb Bush outlines his energy policy during a visit to Rice Energy, an oil and gas company based in Canonsburg, Pa. Bush’s challenge in the first half of the year was daunting yet simple.

As another fundraising period ends, what now constitutes success for Bush isn’t as clear cut. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
