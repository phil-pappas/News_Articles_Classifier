President Mahama said during the State of the Nation address in January 2013 in Parliament that, ‘...I shall work to ensure that every household in this country will soon enjoy uninterrupted water and power supply’. \n“At the IEA Presidential Debate in Tamale in 2012, he promised that load shedding would be a thing of the past. The President's promises include solving the unemployment crisis, improving education and related infrastructure and stemming down corruption. Mr. Mahama's Administration promised to build 50 new community schools by September 1, 2015. President Mahama has not delivered on these promises,” he lamented. \nDr. Nduom hinted that the 2016 campaign of the PPP, which has already started, will be based on the successful track record of the leadership of the party and the strength of the policies that they propose to implement- stewardship, education, healthcare and jobs. \n“No insults, no mud throwing...just the facts,” he concluded. \nThe National Committee of the PPP says the party will hold its 2015 National Convention on Saturday October 31, 2015 in Takoradi in the Western Region,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:54:22.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
