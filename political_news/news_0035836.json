And no matter how “amiable” and “personable” and “affable” Ben Carson is supposed to be, he is still a wolf. Some find his utter cluelessness on the major issues of the day charming and refreshing. It would be far less so if he were to become president of the United States.\nWhy even worry about that? Because he is in a virtual tie for first place with Donald Trump in a bid to become the presidential nominee of the Republican Party in 2016.\nIf the GOP gold standard this presidential cycle is finding outsiders who have no experience in government, Carson looks like he is 24 carat.\nHe is not some pol who has wasted his time learning about domestic policy, foreign policy, economic policy or pretty much any policy. He was a successful brain surgeon, which has led some to speculate that for every brain he operated on, he gave up a small piece of his own.\nHe is the master of the irresponsible, sometimes bigoted, statement. He “would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” And should a Muslim try to become president, Carson has this warning: “You have to reject the tenets of Islam. Yes, you have to.”\nSiriusXM host Karen Hunter helped Ben Carson prep for debates By Hadas Gold\nCarson also has stated that had Jews in Germany armed themselves, they might have prevented or at least mitigated the Holocaust.\nDoes Carson know that Jews were only 0.75 percent of the German population in 1933, when Hitler came to power, and could not possibly have fought an armed struggle against the SA, the SS, the Wehrmacht, and those civilians who became Hitler’s “willing executioners”? I doubt it. And I doubt he cares. He is not a details kind of guy. He is big picture.\nThose nine people murdered at Umpqua Community College in Oregon this month? Carson says they should have just rushed the guy. “Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,” Carson said bravely. “I would say, ‘Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can’t get us all.’”\nThough there is some evidence, however, Carson would not have risked his life at all, preferring instead to risk the life of others.\n“I have had a gun held on me, when I was at a Popeye’s [in Baltimore],” Carson told Karen Hunter on SiriusXM Radio recently. “Guy comes in and puts the gun in my ribs and I just said, ‘I believe you want the guy behind the counter.’ ”\nToo bad all those Jews in Germany couldn’t have found a guy behind the counter.\nYet Carson is an amiable man. A personable man. An affable man.\nBesides, Trump is still beating him by a few points.\nThough it should be remembered that Trump gained popularity through hateful comments. He attacked Mexicans as rapists. He attacked American POWs in Vietnam. He has repeatedly attacked women, calling some “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.”\nBoom! Wham! Zowie! Trump zooms to the top of the polls and stays there.\nHere is Chris Wallace after interviewing Trump on Sunday. “All of us dismissed Trump early on,” Wallace said. “A summer fling, momentary amusement. As I watch that interview and I heard what he had to say about the country, and about trade, and about losing, and just the sheer force of his personality, I am beginning to believe he could be elected president of the United States.”\nRNC breaks record with fundraising haul By Nick Gass\nSo they are breaking out the Kool-Aid at Fox. And they want us to drink it. But I think I will take a pass.\nThere is a reason Trump and Carson command nearly half of the Republican vote, and it has nothing to do with quiet charm or force of personality.\nThe Republican Party has peddled xenophobia, misogyny and willful ignorance year after year. So it is not surprising that it has come up with xenophobic, misogynistic and willfully ignorant candidates. Nor is it surprising that these candidates have risen to the top.\nBut I don’t think the rest of America is going to follow them. I don’t think we are that kind of country.\nThe Republicans have lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections.\nThey now appear determined to make it six out of seven.\nRoger Simon is Politico’s chief political columnist.\nFollow @politicoroger <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politicoroger"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:12:08.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
