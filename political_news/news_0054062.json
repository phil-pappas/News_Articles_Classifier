He was a maintenance worker at an indoor shooting range and cared for his son in lead-contaminated clothing after returning from work.\nIn other cases, children were most likely exposed to lead via lead dust contamination—carried home from the shooting rage—in family vehicles.\nThe other cases evaluated by the researchers involved a firearms instructor, salesman, shop owner, and two US veterans. All had elevated levels of lead not attributed to any other source of lead. “Every one of them practiced target shooting, or were around others who shot guns , most commonly in indoor firing ranges,” says Carrie A. Redlich, the clinic director.\n[Lead paint may still lurk on the porch]\nWhile the cause of the rise is not known, it is probably due to a combination of state educational outreach, an increased awareness of the risks of lead exposure from shooting, and increased exposure, notes Redlich.\nYoung children are particularly vulnerable to contact with even low levels of lead, which is associated with increased risk for neurologic, cardiovascular, renal, and reproductive health problems.\n“This is a completely preventable problem from a public health point of view,” says Redlich. Lead-free ammunition is one solution being explored by the US Army, for example, and the state of California is implementing a ban on lead ammunition for all hunting.\nAdditionally, clinicians should inquire about the use of guns in patients found to have elevated lead levels and consider testing family members, especially children, the authors note.\nThe findings appear in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine .\nSource: Yale University\nThe post Do cars and clothes bring lead exposure home? appeared first on Futurity .", "external_links": ["http://news.yale.edu/2015/10/19/research-news-rise-lead-exposure-linked-firearms", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000000553", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/162/503_1170x669_857284627_555x317.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:23:46.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
