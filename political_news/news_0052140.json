She is being questioned. Police say they could recover traces of blood although Kavita had washed the garment to remove the stains.\nFrom the outset, police have believed it was an inside job. Sources say two female family members came under the scanner on the third day of investigation â€” one of them allegedly planned the crime and the other could be a witness to the gruesome act. Two occult practitioners from Asoknagar in North 24-Parganas have been summoned to New Town for questioning because the family members under suspicion had consulted them more than once. Sources said an arrest is likely soon.\nKavita and Preeti's grandmother Arati Naskar are being questioned intensively, said an officer. Arati was brought to the police station early Friday morning and shown some pieces of evidence. \"We are moving patiently but are certain that they know a lot about the murder. They were present in the house during the incident,\" said an officer. Police suspect Preeti was killed near the prayer room of the house on Mahalaya (Monday). Her body was found on the terrace of her uncle Shankar's (Kavita's husband) house on Wednesday. Two fingers of her left hand had been hacked off before she was gagged to death, say police.\nAccording to investigators, they have enough circumstantial evidence to get a conviction. Forensic experts found bloodstains on a saree and innerwear in Shankar's house. A search of the house yielded a piece of red cloth that was used to gag the child. It's commonly used to wrap deities but also used in ritual sacrifices, say investigators. A gunny bag, of the same brand used to stuff Preeti's body in, has been seized. Repeated searches of the rooms of the four other tenants haven't revealed anything suspicious.\nThe motive, however, remains a mystery. \"Arati and a few other family members did not like the child's mother, Vrihaspati. Some family members thought she wasn't educated enough. They also disliked her because she didn't bring any dowry. Besides, she didn't believe in occult practices, unlike some other family members. They believed Vrihaspati was 'unlucky' as she was giving birth to daughters (Preeti was the second daughter),\" said a police source.\nHowever, investigators are yet to find out how this alleged dislike towards Preeti's mother suddenly escalated into the child's murder. Police started suspecting two women of the family after family members and acquaintances were questioned a second time on Thursday. Considering the sensitivity of the case, Bidhannagar commissioner Jawed Shamim, DC Kankar Prasad Barui and ADCP Shivani Tiwari led the questioning. The interrogation that had ended at 1am on Wednesday was picked up again early Thursday morning. By Friday, a pattern had emerged from the apparently disconnected clues, say sources.
