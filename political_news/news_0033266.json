Johnson had been endorsed by the Republican and Conservative parties. \nSiano, a former lawyer for the Administration for Children's Services, now works both criminal and civil cases as a solo practitioner. \nHe is a native of The Bronx who graduated from New York University and St. John's University School of Law . \n\"The people of The Bronx deserve someone of Robert Siano's experience and character,\" Bronx County Republican Party Chairman John Greaney said in a statement. \n\"Mr. Siano's long history of fighting for children and others in need will be a breath of fresh air for all Bronxites.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:44:41.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
