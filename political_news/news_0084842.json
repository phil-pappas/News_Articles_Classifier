Conde defeated Diallo in a 2010 election marked by clashes between their supporters along ethnic lines. Similar clashes this week killed at least three people and injured some 50.\nGuinea endured decades of corrupt dictatorship after its independence from France in 1958.\nMany analysts believe the vote will eventually head to a second round that could see Conde face off against Diallo yet again.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
