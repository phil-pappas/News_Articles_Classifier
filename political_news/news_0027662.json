Photo: Bill Kostroun/Corbis\nThe last we left him, tiny ball of burning fire Bruno Mars was reportedly being asked to perform at the 50th Super Bowl halftime show in 2016, a well-deserved honor for an exciting performer and musician. Today, we've learned that the very same man (née Peter Gene Hernandez) has signed on with NBC to produce a family comedy pilot for television. Congratulations to Mr. Mars-Hernandez. What an exciting year it has been for you.\nAccording to Time , \" Empire executive producer/Imagine co-founder Brian Grazer is among the EPs on the single-camera project, as is Mars, whose music likely will be used in some capacity.\" Great. Truly, if anyone deserves it, it is multitalented showman, songwriter, and dancer Bruno Mars — you'd be hard-pressed to find one person who doesn't agree that he is friggin' great!\nBut has anyone taken a skrrt -pause to ask why Bruno Mars has not announced a tour this year? Or a new album, hm? \"Uptown Funk\" was the biggest earworm of both 2014 and 2015, and that video — that pink suit! damn — was so mesmerizing. His subsequent TV performances would put a smile on your face even if moments before you had lost a limb to a hungry tiger shark who learned how to walk on land. It's been three years since Mars's last record, and his comments on his upcoming third record, were ( rudely ) that he'll keep working on it \"until it's done.\" Speaking of done, until you make some new music and/or deliver me an NYC tour date so I can awkwardly get down to \"Uptown Funk,\" we're also done, bub. Let's go. No more shenanigans.", "external_links": ["http://deadspin.com/reports-bruno-mars-invited-to-perform-at-super-bowl-ha-1729538582", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQN8bWqL2KE", "http://time.com/4068001/bruno-mars-nbc-produce/"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:04:00.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
