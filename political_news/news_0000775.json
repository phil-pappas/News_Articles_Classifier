Paul Ryan decides to run for speaker. The short answer on Ryan so far from members of the House Freedom Caucus is that they’re not quite sold. So, the roughly 40 caucus members are standing by their endorsement of Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida for speaker — for now.\n“We've endorsed Webster, and we plan on sticking with him through the House floor. If someone else gets in, we'll have to have a discussion as a group, but we've endorsed Webster,” said Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.).\nThat’s because many conservatives disagree with the former vice presidential nominee's position on immigration and his role in the bipartisan Ryan-Murray budget deal.\nHouse Freedom Caucus members continue to insist the decision on the next speaker is less about the person than how the House operates under a future regime. They want floor votes on more of their legislative proposals — even if they’re destined to fail— and less punishment for members who buck leadership.\nRepublicans mull 'Plan C' for speaker By Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nFrom their perspective, the latest speaker election is yet another example of how Republican leaders aren’t playing fair. When McCarthy announced he wouldn’t run for speaker, Speaker John Boehner abruptly ended the meeting even though Webster and Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz were still contenders — yet another perceived slight to conservatives, members said.\nRep. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus, argued that if Webster had been the one to bow out, the elections would have continued.\n“I do think it’s a perfect example of the perception being that rules don’t apply the same way to everybody,” Mulvaney said. “If Daniel Webster had dropped out before that meeting, you could be dammed sure that election would have gone on.”\nHe added, “That’s not right. The rules have to be the same for everybody.”\nDuring a closed-door meeting this week, Freedom Caucus leaders urged the 40-member group not to get distracted by the flurry of candidates who may enter the speaker’s race since Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy unexpectedly dropped out.\nNone of the most prominent members of the group, including its chairman, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, are preparing a run. They recognize there isn’t enough support to elect a hard-line member of the Republican Conference and that their best bet to influence the outcome is stopping a candidate they disapprove of from getting 218 votes on the House floor.\nAnd, right now, it’s not clear they would rally behind Ryan.\nCongress\nThe 14 days the House went to hell By Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan\nRyan’s office has repeatedly said he is not running for speaker, but the former vice presidential candidate is under intense pressure from Republican leaders to step forward, given that he is widely believed to be the only lawmaker who could comfortably amass 218 votes.\nBut conservatives strongly disagree with Ryan’s position on immigration and his role in crafting the bipartisan 2013 Ryan-Murray budget deal. He’s been criticized by the far right for being a staunch proponent of immigration reform and his work with Democrats to find a compromise to address the growing number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S.\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) called the situation “fluid.” He said Freedom Caucus members were staying focused on their crusade to get any speaker candidate to promise to overhaul how the House operates. They want proportional representation on the influential Steering and Policy Committee and greater say for committee members on who the conference elects as chairman of House panels.\nThe committee passed on backing McCarthy when the California Republican was still vying for speaker. Members said that was because McCarthy hadn’t yet convinced the Freedom Caucus he would follow through on promises to change House procedures.\n“For us, we want a conference that empowers the rank and file ... this is a fluid situation,” Meadows said. “Nobody anticipated that we’d be where we are right now. I think the best thing to say is that we are behind [Webster] right now.”\nThe push from conservatives to return to regular order hasn’t eased since McCarthy bowed out from the race. They insist Ryan would be required to make the same pledges on empowering committees and ending punishments that any other candidate would.\nAnd Webster said on Friday that he wouldn’t exit the race even if Ryan joins the fray.\n“I want to show the Congress that this is the way we should be running our Congress,” Webster said on CNN. “We need to have a member, bottom-up process. All these things that are now being talked about as reform is something I started off with. Until there is a commitment to do that I’m going to stay in the race.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:32:25.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
