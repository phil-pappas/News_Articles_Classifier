He still remains on the board of directors of ADCS.

To do this we need the best people working for us. \n“The challenges faced in public services, between now and end of the decade also mean that it is essential that we have a strong successor to take forward the county council’s ambition to be a modern business providing public services.” Promoted Stories John Coughlan set to be named as new county council chief executive next week Sorry, an error occurred.
