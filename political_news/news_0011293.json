Congress passed the trade restriction in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo resulted in worries about global energy shortages.\nOpponents of lifting the ban say it would harm jobs and potentially strand billions of dollars in upgrades that are being made at oil refineries to process vast quantities of light oil produced by the fracking boom. Other opponents say it would increase environmental damage from widespread oil drilling.\nThe White House has threatened to veto a bill passed by the House of Representatives to lift the ban, saying Congress should work on ways to slow climate change. President Barack Obama also does not support an effort to lift the ban in the Senate, which is struggling to find enough Democratic support to pass a bill.\nMurkowski also asked Pritzker to provide an \"anticipated time frame\" for final action on the swaps if none have been finalized.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Frances Kerry )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:22:24.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
