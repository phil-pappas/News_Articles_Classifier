Promoted stories \nThere will be bans on radical preachers posting material online. Internet firms are to work more closely with police to stop extremist material being disseminated. \nAnyone with a conviction or civil order for terrorist or extremist activity will also be automatically barred from working with children and vulnerable people. \nThe Prime Minister, who over the weekend announced an extra £5 million would be ploughed into moderate Muslim groups and charities this year, is to reiterate his view that defeating Islamist extremism is the \"struggle of our generation\". \n\"It is one of the biggest social problems we need to overcome,\" he will declare. “We know that extremism is really a symptom; ideology is the root cause but the stakes are rising and that demands a new approach. So we have a choice; do we choose to turn a blind eye or do we choose to get out there and make the case for our British values? \n\"The Government's new Counter-Extremism Strategy is a clear signal of the choice we have made to take on this poisonous ideology with resolve, determination and the goal of building a greater Britain.” \nHe will add: \"A key part of this new approach is going further to protect children and vulnerable people from the risk of radicalisation by empowering parents and public institutions with all the advice, tools and practical support they need.\" \nIt is thought Mr Cameron will pledge to act on a review of sharia courts and declare that all new arrivals to the country should respect \"British values\". \nIn a foreword to the strategy, Home Secretary Theresa May defines these as \"democracy, free speech, mutual respect and opportunity for all\". Share article \nAndy Burnham, her Labour Shadow, described extremism as the “greatest challenge of our age” and said it was right for the Prime Minister to focus on it. \n\"For our part, we will always support measures that are reasonable, proportionate and evidence-based. But we have a job to ensure that, in this difficult area, the Government gets the balance right and doesn't go beyond that,” he said.
