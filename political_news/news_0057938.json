For the past eight-plus decades, dozens of presidents, first ladies and Cabinet members have often turned to Tiny Jewel Box , the venerable Connecticut Avenue jewelry store that will soon expand into an adjacent space once occupied by Burberry. In early December, Tiny Jewel Box will open its larger location and with it a micro-museum of its most prominent items, the KGB File has learned, either in replicate, or via photograph exhibit.\nThe display area will highlight the downtown store’s history, showcasing gifts its artisans have made, including the leather journal and engraved silver pen Michelle Obama handed to Laura Bush as the Bushes departed the White House and the Obamas moved in on Inauguration Day 2009. At the time, Mrs. Bush had begun to write her memoir.\nWhen John Kerry travels abroad, he makes sure someone on his team typically brings along a 6-inch scalloped pewter tray, made by Tiny Jewel Box and engraved with Kerry’s signature, as a gift for foreign dignitaries, because who wouldn’t want that? When the Obamas went to England in 2011 to pay a visit to Queen Elizabeth , they gave her a vintage American-made brooch from 1950 — with 14-karat yellow gold, diamonds and moss agate — from Tiny Jewel Box’s substantial vintage jewelry collection. Not too shabby.\nGeorge W. Bush commissioned a “box of favorite Georges” for his father, George H.W. Bush, on one of his birthdays. | Courtesy Tiny Jewel Box\nOccasionally, gifts from presidents are more personal, like the \"box of favorite Georges\" George W. Bush commissioned for his father, George H.W. Bush , on one of his birthdays. The box features a picture of father and son on the top lid, and on the inside, a photo of 41. On the side panels are pictures of all of the elder Bush’s favorite men named “George,” including the obvious — George Washington, King George III, George Patton, George Will — and the not-so-obvious — George Jetson, George Foreman, George Steinbrenner, George Strai t .\nThere will be brooches on display as well, including those Made leine Albright purchased for her permanent collection, which ended up becoming the storyline for her 2009 book, \"Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat’s Jewel Box.\"\nMore recently, Tiny Jewel Box partnered with Detroit-based hipster gear company Shinola to customize watches for the White House, which were presented by President Obama to leaders who attended the African Leadership Summit last year. The backs of the watches and their boxes were engraved with the presidential seal.\nTiny Jewel Box partnered with Detroit-based hipster gear company Shinola to customize watches for the White House, which were presented by President Barack Obama to leaders who attended the African Leadership Summit last year. | Courtesy Tiny Jewel Box\nAs for specifics of how each gift comes to be, Tiny Jewel Box shares little due to the delicate nature of its VIP clientele. Typically, however, someone from the relevant protocol office, along with whatever committee members are selected to make such decisions, consults with Tiny Jewel Box’s owners, Jim Rosenheim and his son, Matthew Rosenheim (who have no knowledge of who vets the final choice). The store also won’t comment on pricing, citing the privacy of their clients. \"We follow the idea of creating unique products that reflect our store motto: 'If it's not special, it's not here’. We have served all three branches of the federal government at the highest levels,” said Jim Rosenheim.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:28:58.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
