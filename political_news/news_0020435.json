Advertisement More by this Author \nCoalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) leaders Friday told the Jubilee government to resign, saying it had failed to run the economy. \nCoalition co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka and 15 Opposition legislators said Kenyans were “fed up” with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. \nMr Musyoka said in civilised countries, President Kenyatta ought to have resigned following Thursday’s admission by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich of a cash crunch. \nSpeaking at the burial of Mzee Dennis Odongo Odula, the father-in-law of Nyali MP Awiti Bolo and his Machakos counterpart MP Patrick Makau, Mr Musyoka claimed failure to pay teachers had resulted in suicides and broken families. \n“President Kenyatta and his deputy have failed Kenyans and the sooner they resign, the better for Kenyans,” the former vice president said. \nEarlier, ODM legislators including Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang’, County Women MP Gladys Wanga, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma and Homa Bay Town MP Peter Kaluma said the Opposition will never be divided. \n“Jubilee is trying day and night to split the coalition but we are happy that the relationship is intact, “said Mr Kaluma. \nMPs Ben Momanyi, Michael Kisoyi Munyao, Stephen Mule and Richard Makenda said the Jubilee government should not be allowed to complete its first term. \n“We cannot allow Jubilee to stay in power up to 2017. Let us find ways of sending the President and his deputy home,” said Mr Momanyi. \nTREAD CAREFULLY Dr Otuoma said it was absurd for Mr Rotich to announce there was no money just three months after reading an ambitious Sh2 trillion budget. \nHe said Jubilee was preoccupying itself with ICC matters at the expense of Kenyans and the economy. \nMr Otuoma said no amount of talk by Jubilee on who fixed who at the ICC will sway Kenyans. “Everybody knows the truth. Mr William Ruto himself knows the people who fixed him,” he said. \nThe MPs accused the government of promoting criminal activities in the country. \n“This is the only government in the whole world where a legislator like Moses Kuria can confess to coaching ICC witnesses and still walks scot-free,” said the Funyula MP. \nThe ODM and Wiper MPs urged the Jubilee government to tread carefully lest they start another fire in the country. \nThey pledged to rally voters in their regions to register for the 2017 elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:05:21.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
