DID IT CHANGE THE RACE? WE'LL ASK OUR ROUND TABLE. AND PULITZER PRIZE WINNER ON HIS NEW BOOK ABOUT DETROIT. TODAY IS SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18TH, 2015. AND THIS IS FLASH POINT. WELCOME TO FLASH POINT. YES, TODAY IS OCTOBER 18TH AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT WAS THIS DAY IN 1963 THAT THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THAT THE 1968 OLYMPIC GAMES WERE BEING AWARDED TO MEXICO CITY. YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT THE CITY THAT CAME IN SECOND FOR THAT OLYMPIAD WAS DETROIT AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING EXERCISE, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD DETROIT WON THOSE GAMES? WITH A WOULD THE BEEN, WOULD IT HAVE CHANGED ANYTHING? THAT'S A QUESTION IN A NEW BOOK CALLED \"ONCE IN A GREAT CITY\", WRITTEN BY PULITZER PRIZE WINNER DAVID MARRIST AND HE'LL TALK ABOUT MANY THINGS IN 1963 THAT SET DETROIT ON ITS COURSE. POLITICS, MUCH HIGHER RATINGS AS THE DEMOCRATS GOT THEIR TURN ON THE STAGE AND FILING IN ON BOTH PARTIES AND THIS IS A FOCUSED AFFAIR AND HELPS WHEN YOU'VE GOT HALF AS MANY CANDIDATES ON THE STAGE. THE SIGNATURE MOMENT WAS BERNIE SANDERS' DEFENSE OF THE FRONTRUNNERS AND THEY'VE HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAILS. THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE FRONT RUNNER WAS THAT AND PERHAPS MORE SO. IS IT THAT SIMPLE? MANY WHO WATCHED SEEMED TO BELIEVE THAT SANDERS ACTUALLY WON THE NIGHT AND WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO WASN'T THERE? THIS MORNING, THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR TURN TO TALK ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT STANDARD BEARER THIS MORNING ON FLASH POINT. ? ALL RIGHT. LET'S DIG IN. A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE CONVENED A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS, AND THEY HAD A WHITE HOUSE RUN. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IT'S SEEMED TO MANY A FOREGONE CONCLUSION, BUT IS IT? LET'S CHECK IN ON THE OTHER SIDE. BRANDON JESSUP. AND DEBBIE DINGELL AND CONGRESS WOMAN, YOUR TAKE AWAY. ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING, I MENTIONED THE RATINGS AND YOU ADD UP THE RATINGS FOR THE DEBATES. WE HAVE AN ENGAGED ELECTORATE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAID LARGER THAN EXPECTED. I THINK THAT PEOPLE-- I CERTAINLY EXPECT-- OKAY. I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE DIALED IN AND I THINK IT'S GREAT. I LIKE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE-- NOT IN THE FUNNY WAY THAT YOU'RE SAYING. I THINK THAT DEMOCRACY IS BETTER OFF WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE RAH PARTICIPATING IN IT. IF IT'S TAKING DONALD TRUMPS AND CRAZY REPUBLICAN FIELD TO ENGAGE AND GET ATTENTION, THAT'S OKAY WITH ME. THAT'S OKAY. AS LONG AS THEY STAY ENGAGED NEXT YEAR WHEN WE REALLY NEED THEM. PORTIA, WE HAVE HE A-- TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU'VE ENJOYED THE DONALD TRUMP SHOW AND HOPING THAT THE REPUBLICANS PICK SOMEBODY THAT THE DEMOCRATS PERHAPS SEE AS BEATABLE. I THINK SOME ARE SAYING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER, THERE SEEMS TO BE A NARRATIVE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT PARTICULARLY ELECTABLE. DESPITE THAT MANY SEE HER AS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. CAN SHE WIN GIVEN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH INDEPENDENTS TO WIN? I THINK SHE CAN WIN. IF SHE'S A NOMINEE, I THINK SHE CAN WIN. LOOKING AT WHAT'S ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. I THINK THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS THE BEST OUT THERE. BERNIE SANDERS HAS GIVEN DEMOCRATS SOMETHING TO LISTEN TO AND CONSIDERING OTHER SIDES AND PULLS US MORE TO THE LEFT THAN WE'RE TYPICALLY COMFORTABLE WITH GOING, BUT IT OPENS UP A DISCUSSION AMONGST DEMOCRATS AND I THINK WHAT YOU SAW THE OTHER NIGHT DURING THE DEBATE WAS ADULTS HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ISSUES AND IT WAS RESPECTFUL. IT WAS ADULT, IT WAS JUST NOT THE CARNIVAL SHOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN WHEN YOU WATCHED THE REPUBLICAN DEBATES. SO, YOU KNOW, I CAN APPRECIATE THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHO WERE AT THE TABLE AND WHO HAD REAL CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK BERNIE SANDERS SAID THAT WHEN HE SAID, WE'RE SICK OF TALKING ABOUT E-MAILS, AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID. SENATOR JOHNSON, THATS WITH A THE GREAT LINE OF THE NIGHT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE E-MAILS, NOT ONLY CAPITOL HILL AS THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE CONTINUING, BUT RUNNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR WHATEVER DIVIDES CANDIDATES AT THE TOP. AMERICA IS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE HOPE IT GOES RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT THEM TAKING A LOOK AT THE FIELD AND FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, IT'S BEGINNING TO SHAPE UP. ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE, I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE ROBUST OF A DEBATE. IN TERMS OF THE WHAT THE OFFERINGS ARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE. I'D LOVE FOR JOE BIDEN TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE I THINK IT GIVES US SOMETHING TO REALLY SCORE ONE ANOTHER SO WHEN WE GET DOWNSTREAM, WE'RE IN SHAPE FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY CONTENTIOUS AND UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE NOVEMBER 16 ELECTION AND WE'VE GOT TO BE READY FOR IT. INTERESTING. YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE WE ARE? AND EXCELLENT DEBATE, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIG DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE FIVE CANDIDATES THAT WERE PRESENTED ON TUESDAY. MY FIRST QUESTION WAS, WHERE IS THE DIVERSITY, WHERE IS THE COLOR. YOU HAVE TO LOOK OVER AT THE REPUBLICANS. ABSOLUTELY. YOU LOOK AT EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND I MYSELF. APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF POLITICS AND I COULDN'T FIND A PERSON OF COLOR THAT FELT THEY COULD BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND HEY, I'LL BE 35 NEXT YEAR AND MAYBE I SHOULD RUN IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE WE DOING AS DEMOCRATS TO RAISE UP THE NEXT GENERATION? AND THAT'S A QUESTION THAT ME AND MY FATHER HAD WHEN WE HAD THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND SEEING MAYBE THE SECOND TERM OF THAT AND MY QUESTION TO HIM, WAS THAT, WELL, WHERE ARE THOSE DEMOCRATS THAT HAD THE GAINS OF BILL CLINTON, WHETHER IT WAS IN WAGES OR LIFE STYLE AND THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE TO TAKE THOSE JOBS 20 YEARS LATER? THEY'RE NOT THERE, THEY'RE INCARCERATED OR HAVE FELONIES, BARRING THEM FROM THE 30, 32 HOUR JOBS AND PART OF THE ECONOMY. YOU'RE BRINGING UP AN INTERESTING POINT. ADOLF SAYS A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THE DEMOCRATS TAKE THE BLACK VOTE FOR GRANTED. I WOULDN'T THINK THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A STRONG ENOUGH CAUCUS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AFRICAN-AMERICAN PARTY AND FOR THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE AS AFRICAN-AMERICANS. WE HAVE THE SOCIAL, I'M SORRY, SOCIAL BARRIERS WITH THE CITY, A 65 YEAR, CLIMATE CHANGE AROUND AMERICA'S INNER CITIES. LOOK AT BALTIMORE AND DETROIT AND ST. LOUIS AND SEE THE SAME PROBLEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THOSE IN ALMOST 65 YEARS, REALLY, WHERE THE POLITICAL STRENGTH FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO POWER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN SIPHONED OFF, WHETHER THROUGH POLITICS OR ECONOMICS. AND HE'S RIGHT. YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT? HE'S RIGHT. I MEAN, ACROSS AMERICA, BLACKS, PEOPLE WHO ARE BROWN, PEOPLE WHO ARE TYPICALLY IN THE CITIES THAT ARE ULTRA DEMOCRATS BY DEFAULT. WE COULD NEVER BE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE LOOK WHAT'S LAYING OUT THERE. IT'S POINTED OUT THAT BLACK AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE CONSERVATIVE-LEANING SOCIALLY THAN THEY'RE EVER GIVEN CREDIT FOR AND YET THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HAY OUT OF THAT. WE WOULD NEVER GO CRAZY NOW. WE WOULD NEVER DO THAT, BUT IN ALL HONESTY, YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT. WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FIELD, THERE'S KNOW THE THAT SPLASH OF COLOR THAT HAS UNITED US OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THAT'S LED US OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND SAW SOME OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS COUNTRY EVER FACE AND CERTAINLY, THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS PRESIDENT DEAL WITH, WE TAKE A PAGE OUT OF THAT BOOK. WHERE IS SHIRLEY-- I'M GOING TO SAY TO YOU, AT LEAST YOU'VE HAD AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WE'VE YET TO SEE A WOMAN AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I THINK IT SHOULD BE SAID AND THAT BRANDON BRINGS UP AN EXCELLENT POINT. AMERICA DOES BETTER WHEN WE HAVE TO FORCE ISSUES OF RACE INTO THE MAINSTREAM AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. I CAN DO BETTER WHEN WE SQUEEZE A COMMERCIAL IN. DETROIT - \nSunday morning's episode of Flashpoint began with a recap of the democratic debate from last week. Four democratic representatives joined the show to talk about what the debate taught us about the presidential race. \n\"I think people are dialed in,\" Rep. Debbie Dingell said of the large audience that tuned into the democratic debate. \"I like the fact that people are paying attention to Donald Trump...I think democracy is better off when people are participating in it. \nShe said that even if it takes Trump and the crazy republican field to engage people, it's good for the country. \nPortia Roberson, of the Detroit Division of Ethics and Civil Rights, said that she does think Hillary Clinton can win and that she is the best candidate out there. She said Bernie Sanders, though a little more to the left than many are comfortable with, is also a candidate to be considered by democrats. \n\"I wasn't the carnival show you see when you watch the republicans debate,\" Roberson said. She said the democratic debate had a more respectful nature. \nState Sen. Bert Johnson said that the field is beginning to shape up. He wants a more robust debate at the democratic table and hopes that Joe Biden will get involved in the election. \n\"My first question was, 'where's the diversity, where's the color?'\" said Brandon Jessup, CEO of Michigan Forward Urban Affairs Group. He said it's important to have a person of color that could be the president of the United States because it makes the entire community feel more involved in the election process. \nYou can watch the full conversation in the video posted above. \nThe roundtable discussion continued in the second segment with a conversation about how African Americans view the race. \nRoberson said African Americans \"aren't going to go crazy\" and that Ben Carson won't last in the race. \n\"Nobody in their right mind should support Ben Carson for President of the United States,\" Roberson said. \nDingell said Clinton was the winner of the debate last week and showed that she's strong and she can punch back. She said Clinton showed she's going to fight back and show her full knowledge of the issues. \n\"I think Bernie Sanders did a good job, but the fact of the matter is he also showed he's a socialist,\" Dingell said. \"And nobody is going to elect a socialist President of the United States.\" \nJessup said Sanders represents the very strong left side of the party. He talked about how his stance is affected by the wealth gap in the United States. He said the country needs to get back to sharing the wealth. \nThe banking industry has had its run of presidents, according to Johnson, and suggested that change might be good for the country. He said you have to \"cut the head off of the dragon to make those kinds of things stop.\" \nClick on the video below to watch the second half of the democratic conversation. \nIn the final segment, David Maraniss joined Devin Scillian to talk about his new book, \"Once in a Great City: A Detroit Story.\" \nMaraniss said Detroit got its hooks in him during his childhood and talked about some of the special memories that he made in the city. \nHis book centers mostly around 1963, the year Maraniss called \"a luminescent time\" in Detroit's history and also a turning point. He said the auto industry was booming and the city was in a good place overall, but he could see the structural failures even then. \nMaraniss said many of the common problems that hit many cities were exaggerated in Detroit, talking about some of the factors that hurt Detroit in the late 60s. \nThe full conversation with Maraniss is posted below. \nCopyright 2015 by ClickOnDetroit.com.
