And by virtue of China’s huge population and tradition of alcohol-fueled banquet celebrations, baijiu has become the world’s biggest-selling style of booze, generating $23 billion in sales annually.\nBut as much as the Chinese love their baijiu, sales have started to slow, stemming from a government crackdown on corruption and waste that has put a curb on lavish state functions and on presenting bottles to public officials. That is prompting baijiu producers to consider new markets, say spirits industry insiders.\nIt's the most popular liquor in the world, but it has been described it as 'liquid razor blades.'

Not only is it home to a sizable Asian population that is already familiar with baijiu, it is also one of the focal points of the craft-cocktail movement. Daring mixologists throughout the city are forever in search of the next “it” spirit that can transform their drinks and drive patrons to their bars.\nThose patrons are starting to make their way to Lumos NYC, a five-month-old Greenwich Village watering hole that touts itself as the city’s first “baijiu bar.” It features the spirit in a variety of cocktails, priced starting at $15, from the autumn-inspired Falling South to the almost milkshake-like Sesame Colada. Additional offerings include house-infused baijius—in $12 shots or shareable $90 9-ounce bottles—in such flavors as prune, fig and Szechuan pepper.\nLumos isn’t the only nightspot that has hopped on the baijiu bandwagon. Many trendy or Asian-themed bars and restaurants have put at least one baijiu-based cocktail on their drink list.\nOn the Upper West Side, RedFarm, a restaurant that brings a modern twist to Chinese cuisine, offers a Marco Polo cocktail that mixes baijiu with cherry tomatoes, basil and vinegar, among other ingredients. On the Lower East Side, Fung Tu, a restaurant with a similar approach, serves a Baijiu Bijou, a play on the classic Bijou cocktail.\nAnd in Brooklyn’s Carroll Gardens, the JakeWalk, a craft cocktail bar, recently added Shaolin Land, a complex drink that combines baijiu with other exotic spirits, including an Italian myrtle berry liqueur, as part of a fall menu revamp.\n“It is quite a ride,” says bar manager Jesse Taylor of the oddball $13 cocktail, noting it was a surprising best-seller on a recent weekend. Like other mixologists, Mr. Taylor says he is trying to find ways to build on baijiu’s bold strengths, but make the spirit more palatable—something that can be achieved within the context of a cocktail.\nFor those who prefer their baijiu straight, some bartenders are happy to oblige. Orson Salicetti, Lumos’s co-founder and chief mixologist, charges $32 for a 1-ounce pour of Kweichow Moutai, a high-end baijiu that might be considered the Chinese equivalent of Johnnie Walker Blue, the Scotch that routinely goes for $200 a bottle.\nENLARGE The Asian Pear is a cocktail offered at Lumos that contains HKB Baijiu, Asian pear, Maraschino liqueur, sage and lime. Photo: Mark Abramson for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Salicetti says he has plenty of customers who are willing to pay for a pour, though less-expensive baijius are on the menu. The veteran bartender describes his burgeoning base as a mix of young professionals, artists and spirits geeks, with a large concentration of Chinese-Americans who are eager to embrace their heritage but in a more style-conscious manner. Lumos’s darkish décor might be described as part vintage Shanghai opium den and part jazz club.\nIn case patrons forget the baijiu connection, there is always the distinctive scent of the spirit—a bit mushroom-y, as Mr. Salicetti describes it—wafting throughout the bar. “It is a very aromatic spirit,” he says.\nUltimately, what happens with baijiu in the Big Apple may be about more than cocktails. The spirit seems to tap into a certain hipster ethos, say fans.\nIt is old yet strangely new. And it is popular yet not quite for everyone. In other words, it may be the perfect New York party sip, says artist Bradley Theodore, who is a regular at Lumos. The fact it packs a big boozy punch doesn’t hurt, either, Mr. Theodore adds.\n“I think it will become the Asian tequila,” he says.\nWrite to Charles Passy at cpassy@marketwatch.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS187_NYBAIJ_P_20151011184152.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS187_NYBAIJ_M_20151011184152.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:35:12.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
