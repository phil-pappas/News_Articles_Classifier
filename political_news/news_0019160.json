The Defendants deny that the allegations will be proven at trial.\nTHE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS PURSUED\nThe claims being pursued on behalf of the Class are claims for damages and compensation for losses suffered as a result of Canadian Solar misrepresenting, implicitly or explicitly, that its financial results were prepared and presented in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles in certain documents it released between May 26, 2009 to the close of trading on June 1, 2010 and certain public oral statements made by Canadian Solar in respect of those documents during the same period of time. The Defendants dispute all of the claims asserted, and no Court has yet ruled on the merits of the claims.\nThe claims of all Class Members are being pursued through the statutory oppression remedy. In addition, certain claims are being pursued on behalf of the Misrepresentation Class Members through common law misrepresentation and the secondary market civil liability provisions of the Ontario Securities Act .\nThe Securities Act provisions permit a person who acquires a company's security after a misrepresentation has been made in a company's public disclosure to recover damages without proof of reliance on the misrepresentation, subject to certain defences which may be asserted in this case.\nThe Securities Act claims are subject to liability limits that limit the amount of compensation that can be recovered from defendants in all actions asserting similar claims. Although the total amount of damages suffered by Class Members is not known at this stage, it is possible that total potential damages in this case may exceed the statutory liability limits.\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO DO ANYTHING IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CLASS ACTION\nClass Members who want to participate in the Class Action are automatically included and need not do anything at this time.\nAs a Class Member, you will not be required to pay any costs in the event that the Class Action is unsuccessful.\nYOU MUST OPT OUT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE BOUND BY THE OUTCOME OF THE CLASS ACTION\nClass Members who wish to pursue their own action or do not want to be bound by the outcome of the Class Action must opt-out of the Class Action.\nPersons who opt out of the Class Action will not be entitled to participate in the distribution of any settlement or judgment obtained in the Class Action, or assert claims at the individual issues stage of the Class Action.\nIf you wish to pursue other claims against the Defendants relating to the matters at issue in the Class Action, you should immediately seek independent legal advice. If you do not exclude yourself from participating in this Class Action, all of your claims relating to the subject matter of this litigation will be determined by the result obtained in the Class Action, whether by settlement or judgment.\nPlease see \"Additional Information\" for directions to obtain further detail on the scope of the Class Action and the claims that will be advanced against the Defendants.\nClass Members who do not want to participate in the Class Action must opt out.
