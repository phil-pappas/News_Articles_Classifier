Subhash Reddy of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday dismissed three civil revision petitions by Sujana Universal Industries Ltd, owned by Union minister Sujana Chowdary. Sujana Industries and its subsidiary Hestia Holdings Ltd. have moved two revision pleas against the orders of the lower court of the city in upholding a decree passed by the High Court in UK in favour of the Mauritius Commercial Bank. The Mauritius bankâ€™s claims that Hestia Holdings availed loan from it and Sujana Industries stood as a guarantor for the loan. In the third revision Sujana Industries challenged an order of the lower court in the city in directing the company for discloser of its assets, movable as well as immovable, including its bank accounts. The judge dismissed the three pleas on the ground of lacking merit for revision.
