Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. is going against her party’s leadership to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan. Ayotte, in an interview with the Portsmouth Herald Monday, said her support of the initiative is “very focused on protecting New Hampshire’s environment.” She stressed she’s been looking at the plan, which was originally released by the EPA in August, “for months.” The EPA released the final plan on Friday, which she said she supports despite opposition to it by GOP leadership. She stressed how she was working in her “bipartisan tradition of how can we work together on common sense solutions.” Gov. Maggie Hassan and U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. held a press conference in Concord on Monday talking about their support for the Clean Power Plan. Hassan is running against Ayotte in an attempt to win a U.S. Senate seat. The plan establishes “the first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants,” according to a release from Hassan and Shaheen and establishes “state specific targets for carbon emissions reductions.” Hassan in a prepared statement said she and Shaheen understand that “a healthy environment and economic development go hand in hand, and that’s why addressing air quality and climate change is an economic imperative for our state.” Shaheen stated that climate change “poses a significant threat to New Hampshire’s environment and its economy.” “The Granite State is doing its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we need a formal standard to make sure our country move forward together,” Shaheen said. The New Hampshire Democratic Party issued a press release Monday which quoted Hassan saying Ayotte has sided with “corporate special interests over New Hampshire’s environment.” Hassan also said, according to the state party release, that Ayotte “had fought to protect tax breaks for oil companies and voted to block the EPA from moving forward with regulations to reduce carbon emissions.” Ayotte on Monday called Hassan’s comments “typical political talking points.” “I’m actually coming forward and taking a position,” Ayotte said. “My focus in on protecting New Hampshire’s environment.” Ayotte’s communications director, Liz Johnson, responded to the Democrat party statement on Monday. “It’s disappointing that instead of trying to work across the aisle, New Hampshire Democrats are launching partisan attacks that ignore Kelly Ayotte’s strong record of independent leadership to protect our environment, which included repeatedly crossing party lines to vote in support of clean air and water, and helping lead bipartisan efforts to boost energy efficiency and renew the Land and Water Conservation Fund,” Johnson said. On the contention by the Democratic Party that Ayotte voted to block the EPA from moving forward to reduce greenhouse emissions, Johnson stated Ayotte had wanted the opportunity for Congress to lead on climate change. When it didn’t, she supported the Clean Power Plan, Johnson said. Ayotte’s office also released a quote from former U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. In it, Gregg said, “Kelly has always taken a common sense approach to do what’s right for New Hampshire, and she has a strong record in the Senate when it comes to protecting our extraordinary environment.” Gregg continued, “Her support for the Clean Power Plan reflects her independent leadership and her steadfast commitment to advancing New Hampshire’s tradition of responsible environmental stewardship.” On other energy related issues, Ayotte said the city of Portsmouth’s opposition to the expansion of Sea-3’s propane storage and distribution facility in Newington is an “issue that has to be addressed at the state and local levels.” Ayotte did point to her support of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and said she has worked with Shaheen on the issue. She also stated she has supported efforts to increase “energy efficiency” for both residential and commercial buildings. Ayotte responded to statements made recently by Hassan saying Ayotte wants to defund Planned Parenthood and comparing her with fellow Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. “(U.S. Sen.) Ted Cruz and Sen. Ayotte both want to defund Planned Parenthood,” Hassan told the Portsmouth Herald. “They just would go about it a different way. Their positions are just the same.” Hassan went on to say Ayotte has been “against allowing women to make their own health-care decisions well before this most recent debate came up.” Ayotte voted in August to direct funding away from Planned Parenthood. However, Ayotte publicly criticized Cruz's efforts, saying she opposed his method to defund Planned Parenthood because it risked a government shutdown. Hassan also said women need access to Planned Parenthood “to plan their futures and support their families.” Ayotte on Monday said Hassan’s comments were part of what she described as a “negative campaign.” “In terms of women’s health issues I’ve been working very strongly on these issues,” Ayotte said. She pointed to the bipartisan legislation she has introduced with U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, D-Md., the Protect Access to Lifesaving Screenings (PALS) Act. The bill would protect access to annual mammogram screenings for women aged 40 to 74 by placing a two-year moratorium on draft breast cancer screening recommendations from the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF that would undermine access to mammography for 22 million women between the ages of 40-49, Ayotte said. “Women's access to preventive mammograms must not be impeded, discouraged, or eliminated,” Ayotte said last week. “Mammograms are essential for early detection of breast cancer and offer women their very best chance at survival and a higher quality of life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:52:12.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
