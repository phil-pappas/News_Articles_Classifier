Left President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro asked for a change at the international geopolitical and economic system, saying that the UN goals in the 2030 Agenda would be unreachable without “systemic economic transformation”.\n“If we want to progress with all of these goals and targets that we have traced out, undoubtedly we have to ask ourselves of another economic and social model,” Maduro told the UN General Assembly on 29 September. The left President asked from the UN to create a world that rejects every kind of hegemony, the use of force, and military and economic domination. Maduro also praised US President Barack Obama for his “courage” to re-establish political ties between the US and the Cuba.\nMaduro also said that “it is only peace that can ensure that we will achieve the 2030 Agenda, which is indeed a very lofty and optimistic programme.” The new UN framework, “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” composed of 17 goals and 169 targets to wipe out poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate over the next 15 years.\nMaduro against IMF and World Bank\nThe socialist leader said he supports the new Sustainable Development Goals initiatives, but he insisted that poverty will never be eradicated as long as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) continue to control economies around the world.\n“The IMF and the World Bank have imposed on our countries, they make development impossible and they stand in the way of achieving these desirable goals that we’re setting ourselves for 2030. We need a total change of this neoliberal systems that is represented by the IMF and the world bank,” the left President said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:46:10.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
