She made a paperwork error that foiled her bid for re-election and disqualified her from running as a write-in .\nThat mistake left the seat wide open.\nThree write-in candidates quickly jumped into the void: Cera, Roger Gilkerson and Robin L. Bush. Bush is Armentrout’s sister.\nCera recounted her experience on the campaign trail to The Dispatch on Monday. On Tuesday morning, Armentrout told a reporter that the notion that her sister was running as essentially a placeholder was “ridiculous.”\n“I’m running her to get her elected because she shares my philosophies,” Armentrout said.\nBut later that morning, Armentrout called back.\n“You’ve given me an idea,” she said. “I’m thinking, yeah, that’s what I’m going to do.”\nThat idea is that Bush could win election and then step down, leaving the township’s two remaining trustees to fill the seat. Armentrout’s hope is that they pick her.\nNeither Carl Reardon nor John Coneglio, the other trustees, returned calls or emails seeking comment.\n“Hey, if it can be done ... I have unfinished business there,” Armentrout said.\nCera said she thinks Armentrout’s plan was in place long before Tuesday, “or I wouldn’t have had this voter suggest it to me in the manner that she did.”\nBut she said that if the maneuver is legal, which it appears to be — neither the Franklin County Board of Elections nor the Ohio secretary of state’s office had an opinion on it — it’s fair.\nEven if some people don’t like it.\n“The voters that I’m talking to are not that amused by that scenario,” Cera said. “It feels a little off to them.”\nlkurtzman@dispatch.com \n@LoriKurtzman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:13:19.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
