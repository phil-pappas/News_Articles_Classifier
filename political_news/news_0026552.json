Restricted access to foreign currency has caused the country’s reserves to decline to dangerously low levels. \nMost observers expect President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner to hand over power on December 10 without the economy suffering another big financial shock. But her successor may not be so lucky. More Mexico teachers demonstrate over reform \nHow bad is it? \nPretty bad. At the root of the problem is a ballooning fiscal deficit, now about 7-8 per cent of national output, which is being financed by printing money. It should be no surprise, therefore, that Argentina has one of the highest inflation rates in the world. It reached about 30 per cent last year but has since fallen thanks to stalled economic growth. \nIt does not help that Argentina cannot borrow abroad because of a continuing creditor dispute. Strict capital controls were introduced in 2011 that led to a massively overvalued official exchange rate — and a plummeting black market rate — while foreign reserves have been in steady decline ever since. Net reserves will end the year below $10bn. Few dispute that this situation is unsustainable. \nWhat are the candidates going to do? \nFaced with an economic time bomb, even Daniel Scioli , the government-backed candidate, has admitted that reforms are necessary — although he insists that any changes must be “gradual” and that there will be no “adjustment”. But he has been vague about what he will actually do, in part because he needs to toe the government line and thus keep Ms Fernández and her supporters on side until the elections. \nNevertheless, his economic advisers admit in private that it will be important to reach a swift deal with the “holdout” creditors so Argentina can access international finance to plug the deficit. That is all the more important for Mr Scioli because he says he will not remove capital controls quickly or devalue the currency, defending the central bank’s management of the exchange rate. \nHe pledges to bring inflation down to single-digits during his term and is emphatic about the importance of attracting foreign investment, hoping for some $30bn a year. He promises businesses that they will be “profitable” but he has been non-committal on what he would do about quotas and export taxes. \nAnd the other guy? \nMauricio Macri, the market darling, is billing himself as the turnround candidate, although he has attempted to assuage fears that he will implement “shock treatment”. Nevertheless, committed to free and open markets, he wants to normalise Argentina’s economic relations with the rest of the world, especially in trade and finance, which also involves resolving the dispute with the holdout creditors. Central to this idea is restoring credibility and independence to Argentina’s institutions, especially the judiciary, the central bank and the discredited statistics institute. \nArgentina poll promises another Peronist incarnation \nThree candidates take up populist banner in contest to lead country out of economic quagmire \nRead more \nMr Macri argues that there is plenty of room to bring down the fiscal deficit without an adjustment simply by making spending more efficient — although this would involve reviewing costly subsidies. But he has pledged to remove capital controls immediately, and to let the currency float freely, which it is hoped will lead to big inward flows of investment. He would also ask Alejandro Vanoli, the central bank president, to resign. \nTo stimulate more investment, Mr Macri has also promised to abolish quotas and taxes on exports, although not entirely on soya exports, which are the most profitable. His advisers also reckon they can bring inflation down to 4 per cent in the first two years of his presidency. \nWill these plans work? \nThe big difference between Mr Scioli and Mr Macri is the speed at which they would attack the economy’s problems. Most economists agree on the problems themselves, and what needs to be done about them. \nBut with Mr Scioli, the danger is that he will move too slowly, held back by those resistant to change and loyal to Ms Fernández, as well as his own fear of the political risks involved. If so, the market could end up forcing an adjustment on him. \nWith Mr Macri, on the other hand, there is a risk that he could move too fast — especially in removing capital controls, which may not automatically lead to it “raining dollars” as Mr Macri hopes.
