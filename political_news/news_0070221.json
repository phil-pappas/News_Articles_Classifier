John Campbell, who runs the NATO-led force remaining in Afghanistan, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that he recommended revamping the U.S. plan for leaving as few as 1,000 troops beyond 2016 in light of renewed Taliban fighting, al Qaeda presence and Islamic State gains there.\n  Media fail: Sloppy reporting takes a bite out of Rand Paul LGBT comments made by the Kentucky senator were mischaracterized on social media by excluding context.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/14/15 6:00 PM \"As a result, I've put forward recommendations to adjust this new environment while addressing our core missions: train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces and conduct counter-terrorism operations to protect the homeland,\" Campbell told the committee on Oct. 6.\nThe White House had said a review has been underway for months and that Obama's decision would be based on the country's national security needs.\n\"[T]here continues to be a terror threat emanating from Afghanistan,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday. \"It's not on the same scale of … pre-9/11, but it's still a risk that we do not take lightly.\n\"And it is important for, in the mind of the president, for the United States to preserve our counter-terrorism capabilities inside of Afghanistan — both because of the impact that would have on the stability of the central government in Afghanistan, but also because of the impact that would have on the core national security interests of the United States,\" he said.\nRather than a small presence in the capital, the troops will be divided among Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad and Kandahar, officials said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Roger Stone: Only Trump and Cruz have the guts to challenge Clinton \"It's really not hard to take points that came out of ... focus groups and go out and spit them out.\"\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/15/15 12:01 AM The review began in March after Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the country's No. 2 leader, visited Washington, the official said. Officials also stressed that no one event, such as the loss of Kunduz, tipped the scales toward leaving more troops behind.\nLeaving behind an embassy-only presence would have cost $10 billion annually, according to the administration officials.
