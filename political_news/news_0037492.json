Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Misa Han Labor shadow trade minister Penny Wong has called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to \"demonstrate he's not Tony Abbott\" and negotiate with Labor on the labour-market testing requirements of the China free trade agreement.\nMs Wong said Labor will propose \"complementary safeguards\" next week consistent with the free-trade agreement to address concerns around labour-market testing.\n\"They will be non-discriminatory and now will be the time for Malcolm Turnbull to demonstrate he's not Tony Abbott and that he's prepared to have a conversation based on facts with the opposition,\" Ms Wong told ABC.\n\"They won't require renegotiation of the agreement and instead of the approach the government's previously taken – for example, Tony Abbott used to hurl insults at anyone who raised concerns – I would encourage Malcolm to do what we know Malcolm can do, to be sensible and to negotiate with the opposition.\"\nAs The Australian Financial Review reported on Wednesday, the political deadlock over the China free-trade deal could be broken , with Labor shifting its position to require labour-market testing across all free-trade agreements, instead of specifically targeting the China free-trade deal.\nTrade minister Andrew Robb said he is prepared to consider Labor's proposal as long as it is not discriminatory against China and does not alter the fundamental principles of the free-trade agreement.\n\"We've said all along that we are happy to talk about anything but we're not going to discriminate against China and we're not going to change the fundamentals in any way,\" Mr Robb told Sky News.\nThe legislation on the China free-trade deal has already been introduced to the House of Representatives, and the committee inquiring into the FTA will hand down its report a week early on Monday, the same day Parliament resumes.\n Clinton 'desperately trying to differentiate herself' Meanwhile, Mr Robb has said the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement will be approved by the US Congress despite Hillary Clinton's disapproval.\nMr Robb, who sealed the historic trade deal on Monday, has said the TPP will help Australia diversify into the services industry as it transitions out of resource-based economy and the Democratic frontrunner's about-turn position on the trade deal will not stop it from passing through the US Congress.\n\"I've looked at her comments and she is desperately trying to differentiate herself from some of the other candidates. Her nomination is not certain and she has got to get through the nomination process,\" Mr Robb said.\n\"But I think, in the end, this deal is so significant that no matter who's in government I think this will get through.\"\nOn Thursday, presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton said she does not support the trade deal , despite previously championing the deal as Secretary of State.\nAgriculture Minister and federal National MP Barnaby Joyce said he was pleased with the trade deal even though Australia missed out on the sugar quota target . Last week, Queensland Coalition MPs threatened to cross the floor over the raw sugar deal.\n\"The reason why we missed out is the US is beholden to the sugar lobby.\n\"It's this or nothing. We've got an exceptional deal on beef and we've got a very good deal on dairy,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-10-11T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:56:10.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
