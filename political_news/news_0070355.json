The article features a q TO SEND ANOTHER EMAIL CLOSE share In a recent AdAge article , writer Jack Kneff discussed the blurred lines between content marketing and advertising. The article features a quote from Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer, Marc Pritchard : “(He) described the term ‘content marketing’ as ‘overused and under-defined,’ saying he'd prefer to just call it all advertising, based on the Latin root ‘advert,’ which is to ‘turn people toward’ your product. ‘That's what we do,’ Mr. Pritchard said. ‘It's just now the beauty is you have so many ways to express that.’” The “many ways of content marketing” that Mr. Pritchard refers to are any form of content that a business can produce to engage with their target audience. Stuff like blog posts, infographics, videos, and podcasts. None of these would count on their own as “advertisements.” But, those barriers can get tricky when a business promotes their branded content through advertising. Q: Why would a business advertise their own content? \nIsn't content marketing supposed to generate its own revenue? For many businesses, it still does . \nBut, for other businesses, their content marketing has become less effective in 2015. In the most recent survey by Content Marketing Institute, called B2B Content Marketing 2016: Benchmarks, Budgets, and Trends – North America , they found that \" Only 30% of B2B marketers say their organizations are effective at content marketing, down from 38% last year.\" \nAnother finding was: \"Over the last six years, B2B marketers have consistently cited website traffic as their most often used metric. This year,however, we also asked them to rate metrics by importance. The most important metrics are sales lead quality (87%), sales(84%), and higher conversion rates (82%).\" \nWhile web traffic was not rated the most important metric, web traffic is still the most important ingredient to any form of digital marketing campaign. And, as we at Streetwise Studio have seen first hand and heard from other marketers, 2015 has been a rough year for organic traffic. \nThere have been three trends in 2015 that have been hurting overall content marketing traffic : 1. Facebook’s News Feed Update that manually decreased the amount of organic impressions brands can get through their Facebook Pages 2. Google’s “Mobilegeddon” update that drastically changed mobile search and favored mobile-friendly websites over others 3. The continued rise of smartphone adoption and dedicated apps replacing time spent “surfing the web” Besides those trends, there is one simple thing that is causing the most difficulty for content marketers: too much content marketing. For example, check out the first Google search page for “too much content marketing” and you will find 9 articles about how overcrowded the limited space of branded content is. Don’t ask me which article to actually read, I didn’t read them all...nobody has time to read 9 blog articles on such a specific subject! \nThat’s bad news for any business that wants consumers to read their blog articles, because it is always difficult to create content that stands out. For any one company blog that is focusing on a “niche” subject, there’s always going to be a baker’s dozen similar companies writing similar blog posts. They’ll also probably be using the same Shutterstock images...

Building up a reliable audience for any type of content takes hard work, a lot of time, and a bit of luck. Sometimes it just makes sense to buy an audience. For any business that wants to buy an audience for their content, here are: 5 types of advertising networks for promoting content: 1. Promoting Content Through Paid Search Advertising \nLike Walt Mossberg said in his recent AdAge column , search advertisements have the benefit of “immediate context.” By targeting ultra-specific search terms, you can reach consumers with your content at the exact point that they need it. Let’s say you run a pool table repair company, and you have a blog post on “How To Re-Felt A Pool Table.” You could set up a campaign on Google’s Adwords network to target users who have entered search terms like “How to get wine stain off pool table,” and chances are, you’ll be reaching potential customers who have ruined their pool table and need the services of a pool table repair company. \nThe cost of paid search advertising varies heavily, depending on how specific your keyword targeting is and how many competitors are bidding on those same keywords. Some campaigns can be as high as $20 per click, but since it is driven by context, the conversion rate once a user has clicked through to your site should be higher than with other networks. \nThe major disadvantage to paid search advertising is its complexity. Creating an effective PPC campaign means doing a lot of research into your content and your competitors. To get started with promoting content through paid search, I recommend this QuickSprout guide . 2. Promoting Content Through Native Advertising \nLike \"content marketing,\" the term \"native advertising\" is blurry around the edges and is used to refer to many different things. When I think about “native advertising” for content promotion, I think about the on-site module-based advertising widgets available through Outbrain , Taboola , and Yahoo Gemini . If you check out this Entrepreneur article on “Best Content Marketing Tools” (without Adblock), you will notice an AdBlade widget titled “From Around The Web.” Every site that has a native advertising widget treats it differently, but most of the time these ad units are made to blend in with the site’s editorial content. \nThe main advantage of these native advertising is the cost. Large networks like Outbrain, who claim to serve 200 billion impressions per month, can afford to have low CPM rates. It costs about half as much to reach the same amount of people through these native advertising networks then through social media advertising networks. \nThe main disadvantage to native advertising, I believe, is the “brand association” effect using an ad network like these can have on your brand. Networks like Outbrain and Taboola have a bad reputation in the publishing industry, and some call them a major problem . If there is an overall negative opinion of these networks, then any brands using these networks to drive visitors to their content will share a bit that negative opinion. \nWhatever your opinion is about these networks, you have to admit that an ad unit like this gives little room for your brand to stand out: \nAnother disadvantage of native advertising is limited targeting options . You actually have to make a special request to Outbrain for geo-targeting . The advertising networks with the most convenient and most complex targeting capabilities are: 3. Promoting Content Through Social Media Advertising \nUnlike the native advertising networks mentioned before, your company’s brand gets the most attention in social media advertising. On networks like Facebook Ads , Twitter ads , and Linked Ads , it is your own official social media account that is “promoting” or “sponsoring” your content. Your advertisements show up in users' regular news feed, and users can interact with the ad units just like all other content being shared in their feed. This is what I see as the major advantage for promoting content through social media advertising; the positive effect it has on brand recall and exposure. As an added benefit, using advertising options like promoted posts on Facebook will help your Facebook Page earn more likes, bolstering the organic reach you can get with regular unpaid posts. That turns social media advertising into a sort of investment strategy to build up your “social equity.” According to the B2B Content Marketing 2016 Study , \"Promoted Posts\" were the second most effective method of advertising: Even with the popularity of social media networks, though, there is one form of web communication that remains the most valuable to businesses: 4. Promoting Content Through Email Advertising In 2015 and and 2016, email has been and will be the most pervasive form of communication in the business world. There three methods for businesses to promote their content through paid email advertising: They can grow their own newsletter through paid lead generation, sponsor a publisher’s newsletter, or buy programmatic advertising in email clients like Gmail and Microsoft Outlook . The major advantage to promoting content through email advertising is simple: you are collecting emails, which is the most valuable customer data. With emails, businesses can directly target individual consumers across multiple networks, as well as use email data to generate “lookalike audiences,” which are an approximation of all the similar traits of the business’ ideal consumers. Especially in B2B industries, collecting email data from your content’s audience will generate the most long-term value out of content marketing. However, the major disadvantage to promoting content through email advertising is the relatively high cost of reach. Plus, email leads generated through paid advertising might not be as valuable as leads generated through organic referrals. 5. Promoting Content Through Custom Publishing The final option for businesses to promote their content is something I’m going to call “custom publishing,” but it is also called “brand publishing” and “sponsored content.” For examples of what I’m talking about, you can check out Adweek’s Brandshare , Inc’s Branded Content , Reddit’s new Upvoted Sponsored section , and Streetwise Studio’s Custom Content . The setup varies from publisher to publisher, but things usually go like this: A business applies to join the publisher’s platform, once they’ve joined they can publish content directly on the publisher’s site, and the content is promoted on the publisher’s site and through the publisher’s social networks. Some publishers also help or fully produce content for these brand partners, which is why I think the major advantage of custom content is the quality of the content and the methods of distribution. Publishers know what their audience responds to, so they can help brands with reaching their audience in the most engaging way. Also, as pointed out in “Why Content Marketing Is Like Green Energy,” location matters. When your business’ content lives on a publisher’s site, one that your ideal consumers read regularly, then your content has the best chance of reaching those ideal consumers. Custom publishing is the most expensive option for promoting content, and it is not “self-serve” like the other options. It is probably the best option for any business that is in the beginning of their content marketing strategy and needs help with production and distribution. For the businesses that have the bandwidth for promoting their content on their own, they are left with 4 separate methods, each with dozens of networks to choose from. To help sort through that mess and find the best network to promote your content, here is: How You Can Find The Best Advertising Network To Promote Your Content Marketing The image at the top this article is a classic sightseeing telescope, which I think serves as a good analogy for finding and testing different advertising networks, because: there’s a lot to look at, it costs a bit of money to keep looking, and you have limited time so you have to make everything count. Let me try and explain that better: There’s a lot to look at For evaluating the performance of any advertising campaign, there's several factors at play: The “cost of reach,” or CPM, or how much it costs to reach a specific amount of people, The “cost per click,” or CPC, or how much it costs to drive a single user to your website or content, The “cost per action,” or CPA, or how much it costs to complete a significant goal (i.e. sale), And the “return on investment,” or ROI, or how much revenue the advertising has generated. What should also be kept in mind when comparing advertising networks is the effect it has from a branding perspective. As David Ogilvy said : \"Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image.\" Also, every advertisement should be thought of as a reduction from the marketing budget, because: It costs a bit of money You'll never know how well an advertising network will work for you until you run a test campaign and evaluate the results. There are some networks that will give you a small amount of free credit when you sign up, but chances are, you will have to spend \"a bit\" of money to get actionable results from a test campaign. That's why it's important to: Make everything count Since testing new advertising networks costs money, and you don’t want to spend any more than you have to, you have to be certain that you are tracking every piece of data that you can. It’s easy to keep track of how much money you spend and how many people were driven to your website, since the networks will do that for you. But you also need to track what those visitors do once they get to your content. Let me be a bit more specific: How To Set Up A Test To Compare Advertising Networks Let’s say that you want to promote your content on social media, and you’re interested in the Facebook Ads and Twitter Ads networks. To find which is “better,” or which one gives you the best return-on-investment, you need to run a test campaign on each network that promotes the same piece of content with relatively the same targeting options. The goal is to eliminate all differences between the two campaigns besides the networks themselves. \nYou will need to set these two things up before you're ready to run the test campaigns: 1. A web analytics service (like Google Analytics ) running on your website or content 2. UTM codes for each test campaign on each network, which will segment traffic coming from those campaigns (here’s how to use UTM codes ) Having these set up will allow you to see how the users coming from these advertising networks act once they're on your site. You might find that one network is more expensive when measuring the relative cost to drive users to your site, but those users are more engaged and complete more actions (email signups, for instance) than users coming through a cheaper advertising network. \nAfter you have the analytics tracking set up, you’re ready to create the test campaigns on each network. It’s important that you are promoting the same piece of content with the same headline and image, using as close to the same targeting options as possible. Here’s what two similar Facebook and Twitter ads for this article would look like: \nBesides how they look, you also want the ads' targeting and budgeting to match. Both Facebook and Twitter have interest-based targeting, so you could match targeting with \"Business & Industry\" or \"Technology.\" It's good to keep the targeting general for test campaigns anyway, since it will bring CPM prices down and earn you more actionable data for what you're spending. \nExactly how much money you have to spend on these test campaigns, as well as how long you need to let them run depends on what key metric you want to use when comparing the two. If you just want know to which network has a lower cost-per-click, or relative cost of sending people to your website, you should only have to run test campaigns like this for around $25 over a few hours. \nIf you have a more complex key metric, like \"qualified leads,\" then you might need to run these test campaigns for a few hundred dollars over a few weeks, or until you've generated a substantial amount of qualified leads from each network and can compare the relative costs. \nIf you have any questions about setting up test campaigns, or want help with finding the best advertising network for promoting your content, you can reach out to us at Streetwise Studio or me directly at @KyleSGibson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:15:03.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
