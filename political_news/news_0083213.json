If the UK total, which is 20,000 over five years, is 4,000 in a year, we are talking about the possibility this year of a quarter of all refugees in the UK being housed in Scotland. Surely the rest of the United Kingdom would not wish to be left in a position where not as much is being done.\"\nHe added that he was asking that the UK Government \"should not close its mind to doing more, regardless of its politics, regardless those things that divide us we share as human beings a responsibility to refugees not just in camps in Jordan and Lebanon, but wee boys and girls and mums and dads in Greece, in Italy, in Austria, in Hungary, in Germany, in Sweden.\"\nShare article Mr Robertson, who is half German, also drew on his family history, telling MPs: \"In 1945, 1946, 1947, the UK even accepted those who had been enemy aliens as refugees. I have much to be personally grateful for that as my mother was amongst those refugees.\"\nThe International Development Secretary Justine Greening told him that her government was working hard to make sure \"we can cope with the people who are coming over and provide the kind of support that I know very personally they will need\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-10T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:12:26.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
