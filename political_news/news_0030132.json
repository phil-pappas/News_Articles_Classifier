One woman's surprising sense of smell has prompted a research initiative to detect Parkinson's disease early.\nBy Samantha Costa Oct. 23, 2015 | 3:40 p.m. EDT + More Cookies smell delicious. Dirty socks do not. That is certain. But what does Parkinson's disease smell like?\n\"His smell changed and it seemed difficult to describe. It wasn't all of a sudden. It was very subtle – a musky smell,\" Joy Milne of Perth in Australia, who got a whiff of her late husband's new scent six years prior to his death from the disease, told BBC Scotland News .\nWhen she told scientists and met people with the same heightened sense of smell at the charity Parkinson's UK, the researchers took it seriously.\nDr. Tilo Kunath​, a Parkinson's disease fellow at the school of biological sciences at Edinburgh University in the United Kingdom, moved forward with testing her ability.\nThey initially recruited six people with Parkinson's and six without. The research team had the participants wear a T-shirt for a day and return them bagged. The goal was to have Milne sniff-out the disease. And she did.\n\"Her accuracy was 11 out of 12. We were quite impressed,\" Kunath told BBC. \"She got the six Parkinson's but then she was adamant one of the 'control' subjects had Parkinson's.\"\nIt turns out, the control participant was indeed diagnosed with the disease eight months later.\n\"So Joy wasn't correct for 11 out of 12, she was actually 12 out of 12 correct at that time,\" Kunath said. \"That really impressed us, and we had to dig further into this phenomenon.\"\nThe researchers are currently looking for a scientific explanation as to why people with early forms of Parkinson's disease produce a particular odor. They aim to recruit about 200 people with and without the disease for the study, which will be carried out by researchers at Manchester, Edinburgh and London.\nLiving With Lewy Body Dementia\nDo You Have Parkinson’s Disease or a Parkinsonism?\nTAGS: Parkinson's disease research diseases brain health", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-34583642?SThisFB", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Stinks&summary=Can%20it%20be%20that%20simple%3F&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Stinks", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZehcdp%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Stinks"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:02:22.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
