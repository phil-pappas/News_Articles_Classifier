Biden said in the interview those previous accounts didn't capture the whole story.\nRead More 13 photos: The death of Osama bin Laden 13 photos: The death of Osama bin Laden Vice President Joe Biden, left, President Barack Obama, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, second from right, watch the mission to capture Osama bin Laden from the Situation Room in the White House on May 1, 2011.

Hide Caption 13 of 13 RELATED: Biden: My talk with Beau about running was no 'Hollywood moment'\nHe said he avoided giving a \"go\" or \"don't go\" opinion in a meeting of Obama's top advisers ahead of the raid, but later told Obama to \"follow your instincts\" in a private conversation at the White House.\nLast week Biden told an audience that he did counsel Obama to go forward with the raid during that one-on-one session.\n\"As we walked out of the room and walked upstairs, I said, I told him my opinion that I thought he should go but to follow his own instinct,\" he said on October 20.\nBiden made those remarks as he was still deciding whether to mount a presidential bid. He said the next day he was sitting the 2016 race out.\nIn the CBS interview, Biden said a full accounting of his role in the bin Laden decision-making had never been aired before last week, leading to accusations he had altered his story.\n\"Everything I said was completely accurate,\" he said. \"I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story.\"\nHe said he hadn't disclosed his private advice to Obama to avoid any appearance he was boasting.\n\"Barack Obama made that decision knowing if it was wrong, his career was over. I wanted the public to know this is a man with a backbone of steel,\" he said. \"That's why I said it. And had I said, but, by the way, when I went up privately I told him to go, it would look like I was self-aggrandizing.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081520-13-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080124-02-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080709-06-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080619-05-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081424-12-osama-death-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080924-08-osama-death-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080709-06-osama-death-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080709-06-osama-death-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080709-06-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081520-13-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080404-04-osama-death-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080924-08-osama-death-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081103-09-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080924-08-osama-death-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080404-04-osama-death-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081424-12-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081327-11-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080709-06-osama-death-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080404-04-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081424-12-osama-death-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080232-03-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080807-07-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080124-02-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080807-07-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080924-08-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080404-04-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081424-12-osama-death-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081424-12-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080924-08-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081327-11-osama-death-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080619-05-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080404-04-osama-death-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501081103-09-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501131220-10-osama-death-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080232-03-osama-death-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080124-02-osama-death-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080124-02-osama-death-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501075930-01-osama-death-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130501080124-02-osama-death-hp-video.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:24:25.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
