Clinton picked up 49 percent, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drew 29 percent and Vice President Joe Biden, who has not announced whether he will run, took in just 15 percent. The numbers would appear to suggest that the former secretary of state is the only candidate who benefited from last week's Las Vegas debate. It's a decrease of 6 points from last month for Sanders.\nClinton drew similar results from national CNN/ORC and Monmouth University surveys released Monday.\nWithout Biden, Clinton's lead over Sanders grew to 58 percent to 33 percent, 10 points wider than last month's poll in the same question.\nOn whether Biden should run, a plurality of 38 percent said that they would prefer that he not run, while 30 percent wanted to see him run and 31 percent had no opinion one way or the other. Clinton led Biden among non-white voters, 50 percent to 25 percent.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 15-18, surveying 400 voters who said they were likely to vote in the Democratic primary. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-widens-lead-in-primary-race-wsj-poll-shows-1445335201"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:49:55.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
