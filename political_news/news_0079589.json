It was the kind of balancing act that is likely to become routine for the president if Joe Biden enters the presidential contest against front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nObama defended Clinton from a reporter's suggestion that her proposals might be \"half-baked,\" insisting that she knows what she's talking about even though she has suggested a different approach to the Syrian conflict.\n“Hillary Clinton is not half-baked in terms of her approach to these problems,'' Obama said. ``She was obviously my secretary of state but I also think that there’s a difference between running for president and being president.''\nThere's more Obama can do on gun control, advocates say By Sarah Wheaton\n“If and when she’s president then she’ll make those judgments. She’s been there enough that she knows these are tough calls,” Obama said. “I think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you’re sitting in the seat that I’m sitting in in the situation room things look a little bit different – because she’s been right there, next to me.”\nBut when asked if it was too late for Vice President Joe Biden to jump into the race, Obama remained positive about his right-hand man but non-specific.\n“I love Joe Biden and he’s got his own decision to make and I’ll leave it at that,” he said. “In the meantime, he’s doing a great job as vice president and has been really helpful on a whole bunch of issues.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:32:07.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
