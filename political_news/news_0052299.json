Occasion: The New Epoch party. Attendance: PM, frontbench, assorted staff. Time: Midnight.\nPM: Collaborators, allies, confreres. Compatriots all. I bid you God speed on our shared enterprise. Salutations! Onwards to destiny!\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: \"God speed on our shared enterprise. Salutations!\" Photo: Andrew Meares\nBarnaby Joyce: What's he talking about?\nAdvertisement Julie Bishop (whispering): He doesn't want to mention Team Australia. He's slipped into his Roman period.\nBarnaby: Hey, Malcolm, you got something cold and wet around here? I'm dry as a dead dingo's….\nHello Barnaby. Photo: Andrew Meares\nPM: Barnabus. How good of you to join us. Big day plotting against poor dear Warren? Red? Dry white? Sparkling perhaps? The Veuve's nicely chilled.\nChristopher Pyne: I spied a fruity little number lurking back there. One of those, thanks. Two, actually.\nBarnaby: I just want a beer!\nPM: Little, umm, unimaginative, Barnabus. Exciting new era, all that ...\nPeter Dutton: Tony had slabs of the stuff!\nPM: Mention that name in here again, Dutton, and you'll be drinking hemlock. On Nauru. Good God! Briggs, get down off that table! It's a Louis Quinze original!\nJamie Briggs: Whoops. Sorry, Malcolm. Seems to have collapsed a bit. Oooowwww. Bloody splinters up me ….\nThe Butler: Beg your pardon, your excellency. There's a person at the door, demanding entry.\nPM: What? Who? Ahhh, Bronwyn, welcome to my humble soiree.\nBronwyn Bishop: Thank you, Malcolm. My invitation seems to have been misplaced..\nPM: Oh, dear, I'm sure it was delivered. A canape? Devil on horseback?\nBronwyn: Get me a whisky sour and a pickled onion. Ohhh, Malcolm, I see you've got a statue of David installed. Big, isn't he?\nPM: An early version by Michelangelo. Flawless, of course. Lay in the depths of a flooded quarry outside Firenze from 1498 till I arranged its rescue in 2013. Nicely offsets those lesser Elgin marbles I picked up during a Thucydides lecture tour in Athens. Please Bronwyn, don't hang your coat ...\nBronwyn: Oh, dear. Poor David. Chipped a little bit off his little bit. Not so flawless now. Wouldn't want any more of that, would we? If you were to whisper generously, say, about that nice position in Rome, I might be able to replace it.\nPM: Hmmm. Bloody hell! Brandis! Fifield! Get away from those marbles.\nMitch Fifield: He started it. Just 'cos I got the arts and he didn't. Nyah nyah, poor old Bookshelf George.\nGeorge Brandis (crash-tackles Fifield): Upstart. Philistine. (The lesser Elgin marbles topple, shattering into numerous pieces).\nSilence descends, followed a rush towards the drinks table. Bottles of Grange, most from the great year of 1990, with a sprinkling of Max Schubert's rare 1951 experimental vintage - go flying. The carpet is drenched, assuming a deep, complex hue, imparting a scent suggestive of leather, prunes, tobacco, cedar, coffee and aged detestations.\nBarnaby: Bloody ripper party, this, Malcolm.\nJamie Briggs (his shirt discarded, a splinter crafted in the year 1743 by artisans living in the village bordering the Palace of Versailles protruding from his thigh): This is better than the old days, Malcolm. A few of us could begin to like you, y'know. Could you order me a wheelchair? I'll tell the journos I got gored by a bull on the way to question time.\nPM: But what will I tell the cleaners?\nPyne: Just lock 'em out. Worked for Tony and Peta, begging your pardon. I know! Let's have a toga party next time.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:49:22.460+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
