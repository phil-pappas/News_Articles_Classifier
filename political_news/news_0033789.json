The surprise should be that there haven't been more such atrocities.\"\nHe has publicly backed Mr Corbyn's opposition to the renewal of the UK's nuclear deterrent, saying the Trident missiles were \"neither independently, plausibly nor legally usable in any conceivable 21st-century conflict, but are instead an exorbitantly expensive hi-tech make-work scheme and status symbol for British officials\".\nMr Danczuk told The Sun: \"This is a totally bizarre appointment of a man more likely to become the story rather than control our party's message.\"\nIn a pointed response to a Twitter post calling reports of Mr Milne's appointment \"insane\", Mr Quote: : \"Yes, am sure this can't be true. Just right wing papers making mischief.\"\n\"We finally have Tory MPs squirming over the vote on tax credit cuts and we unleash more process barminess to divert attention. So fed up,\" he went on.\n\"This is not some middle class columnista parlour game, it is people's lives who are being wrecked by the Tories. They deserve better.\nShare article \"And now think it is probably in everyone's interests that I turn my phone off for the evening. Including mine,\" he concluded.\nMr Corbyn wrote on Twitter: \"Delighted to welcome Seamus Milne to the team! Thanks Seamus!\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:35:08.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
