The Senate vote on Wednesday was 70-27. If Mr. Obama vetoes the bill, it would be only the fifth time a president has vetoed a defense authorization bill in the past half-century. The House passed it last week, 269-151. There were enough Democratic votes to sustain a presidential veto. Mr. Obama said he would veto the bill because while it contains all the money he requested, it increase defense spending by padding a war-fighting account with an extra $38 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:54:34.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
