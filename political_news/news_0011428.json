John Kitzhaber — who was tarnished but not yet brought low by a blooming influence-peddling scandal — retired state Rep. Dennis Richardson is contemplating a political comeback in 2016. \nBut he's setting his sights slightly lower. Richardson won't try to take on Gov. Kate Brown for the right to fill the rest of Kitzhaber's fourth term. \nInstead, in a brief interview Thursday with The Oregonian/OregonLive, Richardson confirmed persistent whispers he's thinking of joining next year's Republican primary for secretary of state. \n\"I'm considering it,\" he said. \"But I haven't made any decision that I'm ready to announce.\" \nRichardson's entry, though later in the election cycle, nonetheless would add more gas to what's already shaping up as next year's hottest-burning statewide race. \nThree leading Democrats , all champion fundraisers, have now filed for the May 16 election: former House Majority Leader Val Hoyle, Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian and Sen. Richard Devlin, who wields influence as one of the Legislature's two budget writers. \nAnother Republican, Lane County Commissioner Sid Leiken, has also declared and begun raising money. But Richardson, observers say, is better-known and could call on the same statewide campaign apparatus that helped him get within six percentage points of Kitzhaber last fall. \nRichardson was also an early champion of the influence-peddling allegations that ultimately led Kitzhaber to resign in February, just months after his re-election. \nThe 66-year-old attorney from Central Point, in southern Oregon, is known for being collegial and humble , and in step with Republican Party stances on economic policy. \nBut he also shares conservative stances on social issues, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Richardson answered concerns about those positions in last year's governor's race by pledging \"the people have spoken on social issues and I'm okay with that.\" \nSo far, in a race for secretary of state, Richardson said he's looking at the office's role as Oregon's chief auditor. He said he's \"not happy\" with how well state agencies — such as the Department of Energy, lately facing questions about the sale of tax credits — have been investigated. \nHe said he's still talking to confidants and others about his plans and that he realizes his window to decide is shrinking. He said he'll announce \"sooner rather than later.\" \n\"Sid Leiken has already declared,\" he said. \"I don't want people to be hanging.\" \n— Denis C.
