(Julie Jacobson/Associated Press) October 1 at 5:07 PM Donald Trump gave the best speech of his political career this week [“ A lot for conservatives to like in Trump tax plan ,” news, Sept. 29]. It was very strong and full of ideas and facts. He didn’t beat around the bush (no pun intended). His speech discussed how a Trump administration would fix the economy, reduce tax rates and decrease unemployment.\nI found nothing but truth in what Mr. Trump said. He looked the part, spoke the part and acted the part of a president. If Mr. Trump continues to look like a president and act like a president, then he probably will become the president. Presenting the image is just as important as presenting the man.\nJohn Lemandri , Williamsburg, Va.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:33:16.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
