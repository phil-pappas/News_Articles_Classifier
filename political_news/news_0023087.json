On Wednesday, she chose the hard place.

(Video via Hillary for America ) \nIn a statement, Clinton said: \"I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific. ... But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it.\" \nClinton's new stance does have one plus: She won't have to defend the TPP during the first Democratic primary debate Oct. 13. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:27:11.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
