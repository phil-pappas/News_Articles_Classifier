Yoav Mordechai, told the Palestinian leadership that \"it is not too late to stop the deterioration [of the security situation].\"\nMordechai condemned the incitement that is fueling the spate of terrorism attacks, saying that the \"word is more harmful than the sword.\"\nHe referred to the 15-year-old Palestinian teenager who attempted to stab Israelis near Yizhar, saying, \"When she was asked who sent her, she replied: 'No one.' Palestinian youths are being fed incitement and are subject to deceitful brainwashing regarding events on the Temple Mount,\" he said.\nHe also accused Hamas of exploiting the violence to undermine the stability of the Palestinian Authority. There has been no change in the status quo on the Temple Mount, and there will be no change.\nThe IDF is safeguarding daily life in the West Bank he said, and is \"distinguishing between the [Palestinian] people and terrorism.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:46:17.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
