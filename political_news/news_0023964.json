The headline cocktail on the new fall menu at Tornado Steakhouse is a singular concoction called the Barrel Rider. Served on ice, it’s an aromatic — and unlikely — blend of Knickerbocker Barrel-Aged Gin, High West Double Rye and Yzaguirre Rojo Vermouth topped with a dash of Angostura bitters. Let’s dissect this beast one ingredient at a time. \nAging gin has taken off in the last few years, with time in barrels adding spice and richness to the already bright and herbaceous flavor. While not all attempts are successful (or worth the price), New Holland’s Knickerbocker is at the top of the class. It’s beautifully balanced with a lot of juniper and spice. \nThe oaky complexity of Knickerbocker stands up to the High West Double Rye, a smooth whiskey with a lot of character and great aroma (think old saloon). \nToss these unlikely partners in with the Yzaguirre vermouth and you have a treat. This Spanish aromatized wine sits for 12 months in oak, but still has a lot of stewed fruit notes to bring the whole cocktail together. It’s a sipper to linger over, the swirling wood and spice notes melding as the ice slowly melts.
