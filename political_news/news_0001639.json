(AP) - New Jersey's six legislative fundraising committees have brought in much less compared to the last time the Assembly was at the top of the ticket, according to an analysis released Monday by the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.\nThe Democratic and Republican state parties and their legislative committees have brought in $3.9 million and spent $3.6 million through September ahead of the Nov. 3 election.\nThe committees had brought in $5.7 million and spent nearly $4.8 million at this time in 1999. That's about a 50 percent decrease adjusting for inflation.\nELEC Executive Director Jeff Brindle said that tight contribution limits on state contractors adopted since 2005, federal campaign finance reforms, and the rise of independent groups have contributed to the decrease.\nThe outside groups had poured $5.4 million into the state's general election through September, with much of it coming from labor organizations. ELEC said last week that that's triple what the groups spent in 2011, the last non-gubernatorial election.\nELEC has proposed adjusting limits for inflation, allowing contractors to make larger contributions and making independent groups follow the same disclosure laws.\n\"Many independent special interest groups disclose little or nothing about their fundraising activities,\" Brindle said. \"So the public would be better informed if the flow of contributions can be shifted back to the traditional party committees. Political parties and legislative leadership PACs are closely regulated, more accountable and follow all disclosure rules and contribution limits.\"\nAccording to Monday's analysis, the Republican State Committee, Senate Republican Majority and Assembly Republican Victory committee brought in $2 million and spent about $1.78 million.\nThe Democratic State Committee, Senate Democratic Majority and Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee had brought in $1.85 million and spent $1.8 million.\nAll 80 Assembly seats are up for grabs this year, but only a handful are considered competitive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:56:03.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
