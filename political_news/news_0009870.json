And they will have the right to spread these hours over the summer holidays as well as term time.”\nShe said carers allowance would increase to the same level as Job Seekers Allowance.\nMs Sturgeon said that’s a commitment that will benefit carers to the tune of £600 a year.”\nMS Sturgeon also attacked Labour and said her high hopes for new UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn were being dashed.\nShe said on austerity and Trident she hoped the parties would have worked together.\nHowever she said: “I don’t mind admitting I had high hopes when Jeremy Corbyn was elected.\n“I don’t agree with him on everything and I didn’t expect to convert him to the cause of independence, not immediately anyway.\n“But I did hope he would change Labour.”\nShe said so far it looked like Labour was changing him.\nShe said SNP pressure persuaded him to change Labour policy over George Osborne’s fiscal charter.\nShe Labour’s position on Trident made it unfit t to govern.\nMs Sturgeon said: “Labour will have to decide which side it is on because I know what side we are on.\n“The renewal of Trident is unjustified. It is unaffordable. It is immoral.”\nThe First Minister ended with a plea for the voters to trust her ahead of the Holyrood elections in May next year.\nShare article She said: “To the people of Scotland I ask this. Trust us, trust me, to always do the best for you, for your family and for your community.\n“And trust the SNP to always be stronger for Scotland.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:02:44.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
