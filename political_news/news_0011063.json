I don’t know how old the Earth is. It says [in the Bible], ‘In the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth’ – and then there’s a period there. You don’t know how much time has elapsed.” \nDr. Carson said there is an element of hubris involved in denying God’s ability to create adaptive organisms at a microbial level. \n“He’s God. If he wanted to create an Earth that was billions of years old he could do it. [Creationists] can’t do it. How come they’re always trying to put themselves in the same category as God?” the Republican candidate said, the Blaze reported Wednesday. \nPaul Marshall, Lela Gilbert and Nina Shea have collaborated to create “Persecuted: The Global Assault on Christians,” which confirms that groups like Pew Research, Newsweek and The Economist also identify Christians as “the world’s most widely persecuted religious group.” \nConfusion from Carson’s belief on the subject seems to stem from a Time magazine interview he gave Oct. 1. \n“There was a speech you gave in 2011 in which you seemed to imply that Darwin’s evolutionary theory was inspired by Satan. Can you clarify that?” Time asked. \n“Well you wouldn’t understand it, no one would understand it unless they believe that there were forces of good and forces of evil. If you don’t believe that, then that would be a nonsensical statement to you,” Dr. Carson replied. “I would believe that the forces of evil would be looking for a way to make people believe there was no God. I believe in micro-evolution. I believe in natural selection. But I have a different take on it. The evolutionists they say there, that’s proof that the theory of evolution is true. I say that’s proof of an intelligent and caring God who gave His creatures the ability to adapt to their environment so He wouldn’t have to start over every 50 years.” \nNoted Creationist Ken Ham, CEO of Answers in Genesis, has said Christians should not believe Earth is billions of years old because it would paradoxically make God His own enemy. \n“If God used evolution to create, then He used a process of millions of years of death, disease, bloodshed and suffering to create life,” Ham wrote on May 30 on the Answers in Genesis website. “He then looked over millions of years of death, bloodshed, suffering, disease, and animal carnivory and called it ‘very good.’ The God who calls death ‘the last enemy’ (1 Corinthians 15:26) and will eventually destroy it in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14) would not call death and suffering ‘very good.’” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:08:45.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
