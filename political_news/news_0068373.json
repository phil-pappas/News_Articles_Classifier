She’s jumping on the third rail of American politics and giving it one of these:\nFirst she said religion needs to change. Now she’s going after the guns those bitter clingers love so much. Philip Rucker, WaPo:\nIn her standard stump speech, Hillary Rodham Clinton talks about fighting income inequality, celebrating court rulings on gay marriage and health care, and, since the Emanuel AME Church massacre, toughening the nation’s gun laws…\n“I’m going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better,” Clinton said Tuesday in Iowa City.\nA few days earlier, she said in Hanover, N.H.: “We have to take on the gun lobby. . . . This is a controversial issue. I am well aware of that. But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about it.”\nPlease do, Hillary. You should start by promising to ban this:\nAnd this:\nAnd this:\nAll those guns, endangering the life of the President of the United States. How do we allow this to continue?\nPromise to make the White House a gun-free zone, Hillary. Ban the Secret Service.\nUnless you don’t really believe what you’re saying.\nTags: Hillary Clinton , Treacher Share TOP Hide Comments Show comments Loading, please wait...
