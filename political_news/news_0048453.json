The collaboration is part of Leesa's One-Earth program, which aims to make a positive contribution to the environment. The One-Earth initiative runs alongside Leesa's One-Ten and One-Community programs as part of the company's overall social impact strategy.\n\"We're grateful to Leesa for becoming a steward of our nation's forests,\" said Matt Harris , Arbor Day Foundation chief executive. \"Our forests are part of the long and important legacy of the people and the land of our country. Thanks to Leesa's long term commitment, thousands of trees will be planted to help clean the air, protect water resources, and restore habitat and beauty to forests that have suffered devastation.\"\nLeesa will plant its first trees in Pike National Forest in Colorado this fall and will continue scaling up each year. This unique environmental program, which has its roots firmly in Leesa's overall culture, is a small step the company is taking to reduce its own carbon footprint and better the environment. The Arbor Day Foundation selects the forests in the greatest need of support and collaborates with Leesa to plant the trees.\n\"At Leesa, we don't do things simply because they're trendy or will drive more mattress sales,\" said Leesa co-founder and chief executive officer, David Wolfe . \"We do things because we care. We're fortunate to be able to support the causes we're passionate about. We love the idea of planting trees, because – just like sleep – trees renew life every day.\"\nIn recent years, wildfires, disease and drought have destroyed millions of acres of trees across the country, and the One-Earth initiative provides timely support to improve and restore the habitat for endangered and at-risk species. The program will also facilitate the natural process of providing clean water for communities in need and secure a future seed source for devastated forests where natural regeneration will not occur.\nThe Leesa One-Earth program is part of the company's overall efforts to support a thriving planet for future generations. Besides reducing carbon in the atmosphere and providing oxygen-rich air through the One-Earth program, Leesa donates one mattress for every 10 sold through its One-Ten program and contributes to local causes through its One-Community arm.\nAbout Leesa\nBased in Virginia Beach, VA , Leesa is a direct-to-consumer online luxury mattress company that offers 100% American-made mattresses delivered directly to consumers' doors.\nFrom its start, Leesa has measured its own success not just by the bottom line, but by the company's overall social impact. In addition to the One-Earth tree-planting program, Leesa's One-Ten program will facilitate the donation of more than 3,000 mattresses this year.\nLeesa offers a 100-night risk-free trial, free shipping, and no-hassle returns. The company currently ships free to all 50 states and the UK.
