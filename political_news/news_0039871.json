The teacher, who the letter says is also a pastor of a local church, allegedly told a joke, \"Atheists are throwing a fit because they don't have their own day. They do have their own day; it's called April Fools' Day, because you are a fool if you don't believe in God.\" The joke could have been better. Humor works when the mind makes it funny. If you explain the joke, you kill the laugh. The joke should have ended after \"April Fools' Day.\" But that's hardly even a comic misdemeanor. And it isn't worth firing a teacher over. But that's what the American Humanist Association wants the school district to threaten the teacher with if the behavior continues. Wow, and folks thought Common Core was bad.
