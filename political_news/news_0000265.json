He is the author of \" The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society \" and co-editor of a new book, \" Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care .\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) If Paul Ryan was watching the Benghazi hearings, he got a good taste of what he is going to be in for if he is elected as speaker of the House. The Republicans on the committee were out for some political blood. Although they didn't really have much material to work with, scrambling to turn emails from Sidney Blumenthal into the new Watergate, that didn't stop the Republicans on the committee. The new generation of Republicans are aggressive, vocal and refuse to back down from their positions. And now some House Republicans are threatening that they won't raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats in Congress and the White House agree to massive cuts in key social programs, including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Even though Ryan has been able to obtain supermajority support from the House Freedom Caucus, there is little doubt that the party's right wing will be causing problems in the near future. It is extraordinarily difficult to stop a coalition that claims 40 members out of the GOP's 247-member majority at a time when there is an absence of regular cooperation between Republicans and Democrats.

Hide Caption 24 of 24 The Freedom Caucus isn't shy about proclaiming its influence. \"We want to make sure he understands that this is not about crowning a king,\" warned Congressman Raul Labrador of Idaho. What options will be available for Ryan to change the dynamics that frustrated John Boehner? The easiest would be to concede by giving the Freedom Caucus what it wants even if the outcome is total gridlock on Capitol Hill. But given the need to reach agreement on certain basic issues such as raising the debt ceiling, this wouldn't last long. Paul Ryan will face 'monumental obstacles' as speaker So how could the reign of the Freedom Caucus come to an end? What scenarios would result in their finally losing clout within the Republican conference? Electoral disaster could be a recipe for their fall, but that would require Ryan to stand by and watch his own party fail. This would resemble something like the 1964 model of politics when Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater's shift to the right proved disastrous for the GOP. After voters soundly rejected Goldwater, re-electing Lyndon Johnson by a huge landslide and voting for a Congress with massive Democratic majorities, many Republicans were not willing to stomach extreme conservatism for some time to come. Moderates regained their standing and for over a decade would play an important role in party decisions.
