That could be both helpful and scary. The increasing capabilities of smartphone digital assistants such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana could lead to privacy issues.\nBy Tom Risen Oct. 23, 2015 | 6:17 p.m. EDT + More Google, Microsoft and Apple are racing to transform smartphones into personal assistants that could one day be intelligent enough to make decisions for their users – but the iPhone maker is uniquely concerned about the privacy costs people would pay for this convenience.\nGoogle Now , for instance, can suggest reminders for people's daily lives and prompt them with information they need based on their routines and buying habits, sending messages that the flight they booked is delayed or that their favorite business is about to close. Google's voice-activated search app is also being taught to recognize images and sounds to help people with tasks like organizing photos or translating a foreign language, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during an earnings webcast on Thursday.\nRELATED\nApple's Siri May End Voicemail, Add Privacy Concerns \"Machine learning and artificial intelligence are a priority for us,\" Pichai said of the company's investments in making devices into intelligent assistants.\nMicrosoft's Cortana digital assistant also uses the processing power of the cloud to help people with their online tasks, prompting users with information about business associates listed in their Outlook calendar appointments through a partnership with LinkedIn. The Cortana platform is also a bonus for sports fans: In the past six weeks, it has predicted the winning team ahead of 62 percent of NFL games, Business Insider reports.\nApple CEO Tim Cook, however, has voiced privacy concerns about the emerging use of phone assistants, according to Buzzfeed. Apple is keeping data collected by its voice-activated Siri service stored locally on the iPhone, rather than uploading it to a company server, Cook said.\nThis is rare, as devices from smartphones to televisions upload user data to the cloud for analysis by companies. Digital assistants can find patterns among their users more rapidly if connected with the processing power of cloud servers, though such methods potentially enable companies to better profile their customers.\nThose concerns may be moot anyway, since tech giants already have numerous ways to collect information about people's lives, says Bruce Schneier, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society.\n\"In the scheme of things, you already have a cellphone – that's the greatest surveillance tool ever built,\" he says. \"Google makes money on your information. Apple makes money selling you hardware. That's a fundamental difference that allows Apple to think more about privacy.\"\nApple's privacy-focused approach comes at a cost, as storing data locally can make Siri operate more slowly than its cloud-fueled competitors. However, new purchases made by Apple could make Siri more efficient: The company reportedly has recently bought the U.K.-based Perceptio, which runs artificial intelligence programs on phones without connecting to a cloud server. Forbes reports Apple also has acquired VocalIQ, another British startup focused on improving conversations between people and their voice-controlled apps.\nRELATED\nWhy Pepsi Is Launching a Smartphone in China Improving the ability of Siri and other assistants to recognize what their humans are saying is the next big thing that will bring digital assistants mainstream and unlock new ways for them to be involved in users' daily lives, says Tuong Huy Nguyen, a principal research analyst at market analysis firm Gartner.\n\"The goal is for the machine I am talking to to recognize what I want from it, regardless of what language, cadence or accent I speak with,\" he says.\nThe search engines and smartphones of companies give digital assistants plenty of information, but machines are not yet smart enough to ease our convenience by making decisions on their own, Nguyen says. The goal is for devices to eventually know their users well enough to make decisions like ordering a pizza after a user spends an hour in traffic but before she realizes she's hungry, he explains.\n\"I don't think all the pieces for this intelligence have come together yet for the industry as a whole,\" Nguyen says.\nIndeed, an ad for the Google voice-search app at the beginning of Google's earnings webcast on Thursday featured Pichai speaking about the possibilities of an intelligent digital assistant.\n\"It's important to remember that we have a long way to go,\" Pichai said of the voice-controlled app. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg.\"\nTAGS: technology Google Apple Inc.
