Officials say she defrauded more than 40 immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America from 2008 to 2011. \nSingh reportedly charged some families up to $36,000, claiming she had a contact in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who could provide immigrants with legal status in the United States. Officials say no such contact existed. \nUnder a plea agreement, Singh will pay restitution of nearly $223,000. She will be sentenced in January. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:44:49.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
