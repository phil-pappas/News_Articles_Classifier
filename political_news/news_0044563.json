This is the panel’s fourth public hearing. \nWhen does it start? \nThe hearing starts at 10 a.m. ET Thursday in the Longworth House Office Building. \nHow long will it last? \nBuckle up — it’s going to be a daylong affair. Each of the 12 members of the committee will have 10 minutes to ask questions, alternating between Republican and Democratic lawmakers, with multiple rounds of questioning for each member. \nWhere is it airing? \nThe hearing will air in its entirety live on C-SPAN3. The C-SPAN.org livestream can be accessed here . And, of course, you’ll be able to follow the action on any of the cable news channels. \nCan anyone attend it? \nThere’s limited public access to the hearing ; the public will be granted entry to fill available seats in the general seating after 9:30 a.m. ET and after break periods during the day when seats become available. \nWhat kinds of questions is Clinton going to be asked? \nThe panel is investigating events before, during and after the Benghazi attacks, but Gowdy has said that most of the questions Clinton will face Thursday will likely focus on decisions made before the attacks. Topics could include rejected security requests, who was advising Clinton on Libya policy, and what Clinton did with that advice. \nAs for Clinton’s use of a private email server, the issue that has swirled over her presidential campaign, Gowdy has said he’s only interested in how it relates to Benghazi and Libya. The committee has faced scrutiny in recent days that its true mission has been to undermine Clinton’s presidential campaign. \nContributing: Mary Troyan Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1RY4DUT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:39:24.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
