Jeff Weiner Contact Reporter Fox 35: Paul Paulson vets charity lists cell phone as suicide line \nThe website for Orlando mayoral candidate Paul Paulson's veterans charity, Help the Vets, lists his personal cell phone as a suicide hotline, according to a report by Orlando Sentinel news partner Fox 35 . \nThe same mobile phone number is identified on the charity's website as a \"24 hour veterans suicide referral hotline,\" and on the Paulson campaign's site as his \"personal cell phone,\" the report noted. \n\"I get called at two in the morning, three in the morning on occasion, once or twice a month it happens, and those are people in need,\" Paulson told Fox 35. \"People that may be intoxicated and drunk, they need somebody to talk to [and] we try and deal with them as they are.\" \nBy comparison, a United Way representative told Fox 35 that its suicide line is staffed by at least two people at all times, with no less than 80 hours of training. Paulson defended his own qualifications. \n\"I also have a B.A. in psychology with an emphasis on counseling,\" he said. \"I went to graduate school and studied psychology back in the '70s and I’ve kept up on what’s going on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:28:08.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
