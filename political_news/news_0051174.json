Courtesy of ABC News 24.\nPT0M58S 620 349 Comment: 25 days - that's how long it's taken Labor to switch to class warfare Who else has money in tax havens? Labor questioned about super The caiman, which can also be spelt cayman, is a relative of crocodiles and alligators.\nIt is possible Labor, in its current dilemma about how to tackle the new Prime Minister, thought this was a beast that would rip Malcolm Turnbull to shreds if loosed upon him.\nMalcolm Turnbull has pledged a plebiscite to resolve debate over same-sex marriage, despite a push within Parliament for MPs to have a free vote. Photo: Andrew Meares\nIn fact, though the caiman is capable of such unpleasantness, it is generally a shy creature that feeds on fish and insects, and rarely uses its fangs on large prey like a Turnbull.\nAdvertisement The Labor Party, you understand, has discovered the Caymans. Though caimans, or caymans, are native to South and Central America, they don't inhabit the Cayman Islands, which, though in the general vicinity, are out in the Caribbean, a bit south of Cuba.\nIt's all very confusing.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time on Thursday. Photo: Andrew Meares\nWhat the Labor Party has discovered, however, is that Malcolm Turnbull isn't afraid of the Caymans, and he hasn't been torn to shreds by the word, however it is spelt.\nThe Labor opposition on Thursday spent the best part of a second day's question time trying to place Mr Turnbull's substantial wealth on the Cayman Islands and to suggest there was something very fishy about it, for, as everyone knows, the Cayman Islands are one of the world's sunniest tax havens.\nSnap: the new Prime Minister was a tax dodger. Blood in the water, surely.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten during question time on Thursday. Photo: Andrew Meares\nAnd for the second day, Mr Turnbull happily peered into the jaws of these toothless questions and confirmed that, yes indeed, some of his and wife Lucy's managed funds resided in the Caymans. Just like, say, the funds of just about every Australian who has a superannuation fund.\nAnd yes, he had been quite deliberate about ensuring his millions weren't invested in Australian funds because most of them bought, say, Telstra shares. He had, after all, spent some years as the Communications Minister, and he didn't want the potential for conflict of interest claims to be levelled when he was making decisions about, say, Telstra.\nFunds based in the US usually had two arms, he explained patiently, one of which involved a home in the Caymans or some other tax haven so their investors - a lot of whom were nationals of other countries - didn't have to pay the 15 per cent withholding tax that would otherwise be payable to the US.\nThe Liberal Party's turnaround in political fortunes under new leader Malcolm Turnbull has the party on the offensive. Photo: Andrew Meares\nHe and Lucy, thus, got the full return on their investments, and they paid the full Australian tax on them without enriching America's coffers first. Everyone was a winner, and he hadn't dodged his country's tax at all.\nAbout this point, you'd imagine, the Labor inquisitors might have figured they had loosed a dead crocodile on Mr Turnbull.\nHe'd managed to explain his financial affairs and given a lecture on how international investing worked.\nBut Labor, having persuaded itself early that all this talk about the Cayman Islands was worthwhile because it painted the new prime minister as a rich silvertail - something that everyone has known for quite some time, without apparent harm to his popularity - kept right on, asking essentially the same questions and getting essentially the same answers.\nAnd so ended Malcolm Turnbull's first week in parliamentary question time as the new Australian Prime Minister. Not a tooth mark on him, and the Opposition floundering in deepening water.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:59:47.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
