Green said despite long conversations with Barton on the bill, \"I rise in opposition\" to it.\nGreen argued for a change to the legislation that would not lift the ban, but would improve the existing process at the Commerce Department for approving exports. He said the problem with the bill is it eliminates all safeguards that ensure oil exports do not harm consumers and the economy in the event of a national crisis. He also said the bill does not track where the oil is going once exported, and was concerned it would help U.S. opponents at the expense of its allies.\n  Conservatives hold out option of vacating Boehner's chair The motion to remove him could be \"brought at any time if things get too nefarious,\" said Thomas Massie.\nBy Barbara Boland • 10/09/15 12:43 PM \"We need a policy that makes sense for the next 40 years,\" Green said.\nBarton immediately responded by opposing Green's suggestions as the wrong course. \"As much as I respect my good friend from Houston ...
