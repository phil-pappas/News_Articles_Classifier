(Ariel Schalit/Associated Press) October 21 at 5:21 PM The Oct. 17 editorial “ Fanning the flames ” ignored Israel’s real and continued provocations in al-Aqsa Mosque. Palestinians, including in East Jerusalem under Israeli occupation, not “jurisdiction,” have warned all along of the consequences for everyone if Israel does not cease and desist.\nThe editorial projected impartiality in the beginning but then blamed Palestinians, not Israel. It seemed to exonerate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing government and blamed Palestinian leadership and the U.S. administration for the escalation of violence and lack of a political solution.\nIn 1996, Mr. Netanyahu’s plans to dig a tunnel under al-Aqsa triggered a bloody confrontation that lasted two days and killed 64 Palestinians and wounded an estimated 1,600. Many believe Israel wants to change the status quo on the holy compound and divide it as it divided the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Israel has allowed Jewish extremists to enter the compound. Israeli parliamentarians and cabinet ministers, to score political points at home, jumped on the wagon under the watchful eyes of the Israeli police. Israel could have stopped these provocations.\nContinuing to justify Israeli actions and blaming Palestinians will not serve the interests of peace and the prospects of a political solution. Furthermore, failing to address the root causes for Palestinian despair and frustration, and ignoring the direct connection between the Israeli occupation and the deterioration in living conditions in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Palestinian territories is a very dangerous miscalculation.\nCaroline Katba , Washington\nThe writer is media officer for the General Delegation of the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United States.", "external_links": ["http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2014/02/remembering-ibrahimi-mosque-ma-2014223105915230233.html", "http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=80:the-clashes-of-september-1996-documented-investigation-and-analysis-summary-of-findings&catid=132:press-releases-from-other-years-99-04"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:23:04.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
