Now, you can find important resources and real-time information about construction, transit, events, and more – all on one easy-to-use online hub,” Mayor de Blasio said. “It’s easier than ever for New Yorkers to engage with their communities at the touch of a button.” \nThe websites, created through a public-private partnership between the Mayor’s Office and local technology startup and 2014 BigApps winner Vizalytics, are slated to provide community residents with real-time vital data feed, including transit alerts, 311 service requests, construction and traffic alerts, emergency notifications, event permits and other data — all of which will be displayed on a neighborhood map so users can see the exact location for each activity. \n“For the first time, New Yorkers—from any neighborhood in the five boroughs—can access essential community information from dozens of sources on one site, Chief Technology Officer for the City of New York Minerva Tantoco said. “Even in the current beta form, the neighborhood sites are an incredibly cool resource—but with New Yorkers’ participation and feedback, they have the potential to become even more valuable tools for community engagement.” \nThe sites also include lookup tools for polling places, public officials, schools, libraries, parks, resources for tenant protections, greenmarkets, and restaurant grades. The neighborhoods.nyc hubs are also available in 13 languages and are available on your mobile device. \nDuring the 90-day beta launch, neighborhood organizations and local development corporations can apply to license the domain for their local area. In addition, qualified organizations can become administrators of their community’s site, with the ability to customize the template to add content and tools. This feature will allow the neighborhood sites to reflect the needs and interests of the community, as local businesses and organizations will also be able to embed components of the site onto their own websites. \nSpeaker Melissa Mark-Viverito commented, saying the New York City Council is “committed to bringing technology to New Yorkers and closing the digital divide.” \n“Neighborhoods.nyc will help New Yorkers digitally connect with their neighborhoods, and I thank the de Blasio administration for their shared efforts to create and promote innovative technological solutions that will help move our City forward,” she added.
