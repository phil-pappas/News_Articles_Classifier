The Dow industrial average climbed 320 points Thursday thanks in part to a series of strong third quarter earnings reports.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 22, 2015 | 6:05 p.m. EDT + More The Dow industrial average ended the day up more than 320 points after a handful of unexpectedly strong earnings reports, low jobless claims and further dovishness out of the European Central Bank bolstered investor confidence.\nStocks were off to a strong start Thursday morning after European markets jumped on news from the ECB that the central bank was likely to maintain and potentially even broaden its quantitative easing efforts, which are designed to help stimulate Europe's currently lackluster economy. In light of underwhelming economic indicators like inflation and consumer confidence, bank president Mario Draghi on Thursday showed no signs of cutting those efforts off anytime soon.\n\"Given continued high structural unemployment and low potential output growth in the euro area, the ongoing cyclical recovery should be supported by effective structural policies,\" Draghi said in a statement Thursday, calling for a continued environment of \"accommodative monetary policy\" that will hopefully jump-start European consumption and spending.\nSee Photos\nThe Economics of Underwear Sales, Haircuts and Other Bizarre Indicators Analysts weren't necessarily expecting additional quantitative easing at this particular meeting, but few expected Draghi to take his foot off the pedal either, especially because the effects of a slowing Chinese economy haven't fully trickled through Europe just yet. The ECB will revisit the issue when its officials meet again in December.\n\"The ECB kept the door wide open to the possibility of ramping up its quantitative easing program. But a major development saw the ECB open the door anew to further interest rate cuts,\" Howard Archer, chief European and U.K. economist at IHS Economics, wrote in a research note Thursday. \"We believe the ECB could very well deliver on more quantitative easing in December.\"\nInvestors responded positively to news that such accommodative monetary policy would remain for at least a few months longer. The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed more than 2.1 percent Thursday following Draghi's announcement, and Germany's DAX index was up nearly 2.5 percent.\nThat positive investor sentiment spread over to the U.S. later in the day, as the Dow closed up nearly 1.9 percent. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, meanwhile, each climbed nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's close.\nRELATED\nAsk an Economist: What Happens if Congress Doesn't Raise the Debt Ceiling? But that's not to say Thursday's strong market performance wasn't at least partially American-made. Initial U.S. jobless claims clocked in at just 259,000 last week, shy of the 265,000 analysts were expecting. Although the week's total ultimately ticked up 3,000 from the week before and snapped two straight weeks of gains, the four-week moving average reached its lowest point since Dec. 15, 1973.\nThe low unemployment filings carry additional significance because they fell during the Labor Department's so-called survey week. The week that includes the 12th day of every month is prominently featured in the government's monthly unemployment rate calculations, so last week's claims figure is likely to keep the unemployment rate from climbing much in October.\nBut it was perhaps McDonald's first positive quarter of sales at established U.S. restaurants in two years that was most important in driving markets higher Thursday. Global sales were ultimately up 4 percent at such locations during July, August and September, and net income climbed 23 percent year over year.\n\"I am encouraged by our operating performance for the quarter, with positive comparable sales across all segments, including the U.S., as well as sales recovery in China following the prior year supplier issue,\" Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's president and CEO, said in a statement Thursday morning.\nRELATED\nChina Syndrome Dampens Third Quarter Earnings McDonald's recently announced all-day breakfast menu could extend its positive sales momentum into the fourth quarter, which will wrap up a year of sweeping changes for the fast food giant. Investors' initial response to the earnings was decidedly bullish; McDonald's stock ended the day up more than 8.1 percent after hitting record valuation in mid-day trading.\nBut McDonald's wasn't alone in what ended up being a particularly strong day for corporate earnings. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group posted net sales of $1.63 billion, up 3 percent year over year and ahead of analysts' $1.6 billion expectations. Its stock subsequently climbed more than 5.6 percent from Wednesday's close.\nDow Chemical Co. also delivered operating earnings per share of 82 cents, which was nearly 19 percent more than analysts expected. The company's sales were ultimately down 16 percent year over year, but its stock ended the day up more than 5.1 percent, thanks in large part to the company's unexpectedly solid returns.\nAnd Capital One Financial's net revenue climbed 4 percent to $5.9 billion in the third quarter, causing its stock to shoot up in after-hours trading. Capital One withheld its earnings report until after the market closed Thursday, but its stock was up nearly 5.7 percent after trading desks formally closed for the day. The positive report is expected to help Friday's trading start on the right foot.\nTAGS: business stock market Dow Jones Industrial Average unemployment economy", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Dow%20Balloons%20320%20Points%20Thursday%20Thanks%20to%20Earnings%2C%20ECB", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Dow%20Balloons%20320%20Points%20Thursday%20Thanks%20to%20Earnings%2C%20ECB", "http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EGDAXI", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is151022.en.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Dow%20Balloons%20320%20Points%20Thursday%20Thanks%20to%20Earnings%2C%20ECB&summary=A%20host%20of%20indicators%20and%20earnings%20at%20home%20and%20abroad%20had%20markets%20soaring%20Thursday.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.stoxx.com/index-details?symbol=SXXP", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZega2j%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:35:30.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
