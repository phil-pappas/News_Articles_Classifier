Chandrasekhar Rao on Thursday gave enough indications that he has set his eyes on winning the forthcoming byelections and GHMC polls.\nAmong the steps that would be taken to ensure victory for the party included the long-awaited strengthening of the party and filling up of nominated posts.\nTemple, market, library, RTC, hospital and other committees would be filled before and after Dasara. He would also launch the much-touted two-bedroom housing scheme for the poor on Dasara day.\nThe CM has also decided to constitute the politburo, with limited numbers, and asked party leaders to suggest the members for the party’s highest decision making body. He also plans to set up the 42-member district party committees.\nMr Rao revealed his plans at a two-hour TRS Legislature Party meeting attended by ministers, MLAs, MLCs, MPs and other senior leaders, at the Telangana Bhavan. He asked ministers and legislators to ensure early completion of projects like the Water Grid, Mission Kakatiya etc, and oversee implementation of welfare schemes.\nHe brushed aside the Opposition allegations against his government on farmer suicides. He also directed party leaders to oversee distribution of relief for farmers and the kin of those who committed suicide.\n“We are just 15 months old and have done a lot. Those who were in power for ages, who had neglected Telangana, now have the audacity to blame the TRS government. You have to expose them,” he said.\nAsking party leaders to gear up for the Warangal Lok Sabha and Narayankhed Assembly bypolls, Mr Rao said a survey has revealed that TRS has a 67 per cent chance of winning Warangal and 52 per cent in Narayankhed.\n“The precedence is that the seat is normally given to the family of the sitting member who had passed away, but Kista Reddy’s family is undecided,” Mr Rao reportedly said.\nStates: Telangana South Telangana K Chandrasekhar Rao Also Read Thiruvananthapuram: No takers for low-paying survey Ashwin dented Lokayukta image: Prosecutor N Chandrababu Naidu ‘embarrasses’ Ram Gopal Varma Fake documents flood RTO", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kcr_9_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_6_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kcr_9_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_6_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151009/nation-current-affairs/article/k-chandrasekhar-rao-puts-party-poll-mode"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:46:07.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
