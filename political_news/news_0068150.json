But Putin has cast Assad's government as the best defense against Islamic State militants, a group the U.S. is also working to defeat.\nTrump also suggested that Assad, who has used barrel bombs and chemical weapons against civilians, was preferable to other potential options.\n\"Personally, I've been looking at the different players and I've been watching Assad, Trump said, \" ... and I'm looking at Assad and saying maybe he's better than the kind of people that we're supposed to be backing because we don't even know who we're backing. We have no idea.\"\nObama and Putin have a tense relationship that was on full display as the pair met at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\nTrump has long predicted that he would get along well with Putin and declared Monday that, \"Putin is a nicer person than I am.\" He repeated his criticism that Putin is the better leader when compared with Obama.\n\"I will tell you that, in terms of leadership, he's getting an 'A' and our president is not doing so well,\" he said. \"They did not look good together.\"\nIt was Trump's first appearance on Fox since he announced last week that he'd be boycotting the network for \"the foreseeable future\" because of what he deemed unfair treatment.\nThe boycott lasted less than a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:50:31.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
