He says troops are continuing search and clear operations, suspecting that some insurgents remain in the city.\nThe Taliban stormed Kunduz on Sept. 28 and held the city for three days before being driven back. Exact numbers of dead and wounded are unclear, but believed to be in the hundreds.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
