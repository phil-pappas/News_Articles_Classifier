Journalists are no exception.\nSayyad was injured as a result of being beaten by Israeli security forces outside the compound last week. \"We went there to cover the events,\" he recalled, \"but they wouldn't actually allow us to go in the compound.\"\n\"We were filming and doing interviews with the mourabitat,\" he said, referring to a group of Palestinian women who have been banned by Israeli authorities from entering the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\nAlthough there were no clashes taking place at the time, heavily-armed police arrived and began to argue with the women, he said. \"They were yelling, but then they started to hit the women. Two of them came over and attacked me... they started hitting me.\"\n\"As they hit me, they were cursing at me and threatening me,\" he added.\nAfter being hit for between 10 and 15 minutes, Sayyad says, he was able to break free from the officers and get away without being arrested. Upon arriving home, he found that his back was badly bruised.\n\"I recognise the soldiers - they see us there all the time. I'm certain they know we are journalists,\" he said. \"We had our cameras and microphones only. There were no clashes at the time. There's no reason to attack us.\"\nRELATED: Palestinian targeted by a 'surge' in settler violence\nExplaining that there has been a \"clear escalation of attacks against journalists,\" Rimawi said that Israeli\nSettler violence against Palestinians 'not an isolated case' forces target journalists in order to silence them.\n\"Israel doesn't want them to report on Israeli attacks - including by the settlers - against Palestinians,\" he said, \"and [Israel] doesn't want the media to cover the protests and show them to the world.\"\nAmong those injured by Israeli forces in the last week was al-Mayadeen correspondent Hana Mahameed. While covering unrest in East Jerusalem on Sunday, Mahameed was shot in the face with a stun grenade as she reported live on television.\nDuring video of the incident, Mahameed - who was wearing a flak jacket that identified her as press - is reporting as youth clash with Israeli soldiers. The sound of the stun grenade being fired is followed by it striking the reporter's face who screamed as she fell to the ground.\nAlthough she sustained severe burns across most of her face, Mahameed's head was wrapped with bandages and she was back on air the same day.\nAnother journalist, Ahmad Hassan, was hospitalised last Friday after an Israeli soldier shot him in the leg with live ammunition while he covered protests in Kafr Qaddum, a town in the northern West Bank.", "external_links": ["http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=768039", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fmxztKlQR0"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:40:48.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
