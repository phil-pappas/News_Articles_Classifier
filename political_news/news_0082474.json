I've made historic concessions on liquor reform. I've even reduced my request from March 3rd on expenditures by almost a billion dollars. So I have made a lot of compromises of offers. And what have I gotten in return? Nothing,\" Wolf said. \nThe Pennsylvania Republican party issued a statement reacting to Wolf’s comments. It read, in part, that the governor would rather be on the campaign trail then at the negotiation tale. \nRepublican lawmakers have objected to the governor’s call for a multi-billion dollar increase in taxes.
