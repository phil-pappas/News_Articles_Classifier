The statistics are especially striking for girls: 48 percent reported deleting their ex's number from their phone, 38 percent untag and delete couples photos, 37 percent have blocked an ex on social media, and 30 percent have blocked an ex from texts.\nThe reasons why are wide-ranging. Some teens recognize that social media makes it much harder to get over someone, so they unfollow as a mature, self-preserving tactic. Others do it out of spite, or out of respect for their new partner, Pew reports.\nAnd some do it because they understand that once you break up, your social media past and future cease to matter.
