But with the GOP nomination on the line, the battle between the two Floridians is starting to come to the surface.\nDuring an interview with Sean Hannity Monday, Rubio continued to speak highly of Bush, but only before telling the host that the Republicans need to \"turn the page as a party\" on the leaders of the past, a not-so-thinly veiled jab at his 2016 competitor.\n\"It's not about him,\" Rubio said of Bush. \"I'm not running against him or anybody else in this field. I'm running for president, and I honestly thing we need to turn the page as a party. We can't just keep electing the same people with the same ideas.

And that is why I am running for president.\"\nThe comments come a day after an Associated Press story examined the tension between the two camps — with Bush's team hitting Rubio for being inexperienced like then-Sen.

On the opposite end, Rubio continues to level shots his GOP counterpart, as he does Hillary Clinton, for a push in generational change.\nTop Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:28.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
