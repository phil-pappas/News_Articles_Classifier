The ISA backtracked a day later and is hoping that new visas can be reissued in time for the championships, which start next Monday in the Muslim Sultanate.\nMeanwhile, the 470 Class world championships get underway in Haifa on Monday. Israel’s men’s and women’s teams are both targeting Olympic qualification in Haifa.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:20:56.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
