For most people that’s a thing of the past with insecure and irregular work, long hours, and low pay becoming the norm. \n\"Work is supposed to give you the freedom to live well. That means getting a decent day’s pay for a decent day’s work and having a life outside of your job. \n\"Unfortunately many people now find their jobs get in the way of joining a sports team or volunteering in the community or even seeing their kids in the school production. \n\"Labour has always been the party of working people and their families. We are committed to eliminating zero-hour contracts and other unfair employment practices that put undue pressure on people who work. We will restore the rights National has stolen from working people and we are developing policies that will ensure the Future of Work delivers the lifestyle that working people deserve. \n\"Let’s make Labour Day something to really celebrate again,\" Iain Lees-Galloway says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:05:37.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
