Since the junta took over more than a year ago, it has been claiming that the Kingdom is in crisis and has deep-rooted problems that can only be resolved with major reform. So, obviously, I've been watching the junta's measures to restore peace and order as well as introduce reforms with much interest. Shortly after ousting the previous elected government, the junta declared its road map, an interim charter to facilitate the process, as well as key mechanisms to accomplish its goals. It also established two key bodies - the National Reform Council (NRC) and the Constitution Drafting Committee (CDC). The first body's job was to analyse problems and synthesise solutions, while the second one had to take this output and design the constitution. Since the NRC held its first meeting late last year, the synergy between |the two bodies necessary to redesigning the country's structure and |future became obvious. The NRC's vice chairman became chair of the CDC, while the NRC nominated 20 of the 36 CDC members - steps that brought the two bodies even closer. The NRC was obliged to submit all its reports to the CDC, which it could use in its constitutional structure. The two bodies kept working side by side until the draft charter was voted upon on September 6. The NRC spent its first few months gauging people's views before using the feedback in its reform work and finally handing it over to the CDC. Though some insist that the NRC's work had not been completed, it still managed to come up with one of the most comprehensive reviews Thailand has ever experienced. The NRC developed as many as 37 reform agenda, plus eight development and 14 special reform agenda - covering nearly all the critical malaise this country suffers. Subsequently, several NRC proposals were transformed into articles in the draft charter. However, at the end of the day, the NRC decided to vote down the draft charter due to some controversial points even though it was created based on its own inputs. This triggered a new round of charter drafting by two newly established bodies that have not the slightest of links. The National Reform Steering Assembly (NRSA) has been tasked with pursuing the NRC's reform plans, while the new CDC will write a charter under a new framework provided by the junta. Since the constitution will be the basis for the country's administration, the relationship between all parties in society as well as its future, writing it without these two bodies being closely related can raise questions about the new charter's credibility. After all, this CDC will be writing a charter based on the junta's framework, the points of which have not been explained so far. Perhaps this new team of drafters should consider the NRC's proposals and reform agenda. This is because basing the charter on a framework provided by a small group of people dominating the political scene will always be unacceptable, because as the mother of law, a constitution has to be thoroughly thought out. Also, one can't help but wonder when the people and their participation in the charter drafting process will be seriously considered by the junta and the CDC. Surely our next \"mother of law\" cannot just be based on the junta's so-called framework? 234 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:19:03.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
