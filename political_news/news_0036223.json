(Video via CNN ) \"Dream on. Dream on,\" sang Steven Tyler. (Video via Aerosmith ) Aerosmith filed a cease and desist letter against the presidential candidate to stop using the song \"Dream On\" at his rallies. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Steven Tyler's reps said using the song gives the \"false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid.\" This is really nothing new in political races, and nothing new to Trump either. He's been shut down multiple times. But in case you didn't know, Steven Tyler is now in the country music business. And there are a heap of country stars who support Trump. (Video via Dot Records ) County music stars fared pretty well on The Celebrity Apprentice. John Rich won season four and Trace Atkins won season six. (Video via NBC ) \"I'm glad to see Donald Trump step in. I mean he's the only guy who's going to say it like he says it,\" said John Rich on Fox 411. (Video via Fox ) Conservative rocker Ted Nugent who competed on the Celebrity Apprentice told WIBX's Keller in the Morning \"I'm a big fan of Donald Trump because I believe in bold, aggressive, unapologetic truth.\" Trump has also received support from country singer Larry Gatlin. So maybe he should just stick to playing his supporters' music. It might make things a little less awkward.
