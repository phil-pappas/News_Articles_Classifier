He claimed that more Americans have been killed in recent years in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups.\nThe new Domestic Terrorism Counsel will be the main point of contact for U.S. Attorney offices nationwide and will work to identify trends across cases, help shape strategy and analyze legal gaps that need to be closed.\nBy the latter the Obama administration seems to mean a specific legal gap between how the DOJ deals with “international” terrorists like Islamic State sympathizers and how it deals with “domestic terrorists.” In the case of IS sympathizers, they are routinely charged with providing material (financial) support to foreign terror groups. But, due to First Amendment concerns, there’s no comparable legal statute for “domestic terrorists” like Americans who aid white supremacist organizations.\nCarlin said, “To do that for a group here would mean , based on who the group is and what they’re doing, that the entire group is designated as the terrorist group.”\nIn other words, the DOJ is proposing that any and all Americans whom the Obama administration deems to be “racist” or “anti-government” would be designated as domestic terrorists.\nHow does the Obama administration define “racist” or “anti-government”?:\nIs it by behavior, and if so, what specific behaviors constitute “racist” or “anti-government”? Or is the Obama administration defining “racist” and “anti-government” not just by behavior, but also by speech and thought? — which appears to be the case, given the administration’s identification of the First Amendment, with its guarantee of freedom of speech, as a legal obstacle to going after “domestic terrorists.” Welcome to George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four .\nTo the liberals=Democrats=Progressives=socialists=commies who are applauding this chilling new notion of “domestic terrorists”:\nToday, “racist” and “anti-government” Americans are designated to be “domestic terrorists.” Tomorrow, the definition of “domestic terrorists” may well be expanded to include liberals.\nTo those Americans (and who knows how many illegal aliens) who had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012:\nMay the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits.\nSee also:\nDHS has a list of “hands off” terrorists who are allowed to enter the U.S. President Lucifer’s DHS Employee Calls for Genocide Against Whites ~Éowyn", "external_links": ["http://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/05/20/obama-administrations-dhs-has-a-list-of-hands-off-terrorists-allowed-to-enter-u-s/", "https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/assistant-attorney-general-john-carlin.jpg?w=500&h=444", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/dhs-employee-calls-for-genocide-against-whites/", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/278459e3f5c042f193f5329a740a51b1/justice-dept-name-coordinator-domestic-terror-cases", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=fellowshipoftheminds.com&blog=11081320&post=123961&subd=fellowshipofminds&ref=&feed=1", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com//feed/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/123961/", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com//feed/https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/assistant-attorney-general-john-carlin.jpg", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/2012/07/05/do-you-love-freedom-obamas-just-designated-you-a-terrorist/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com/123961/", "http://fellowshipofminds.wordpress.com//feed/https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/founding-fathers-were-domestic-terrorists.jpg", "https://fellowshipofminds.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/founding-fathers-were-domestic-terrorists.jpg?w=500&h=321"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:16.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
