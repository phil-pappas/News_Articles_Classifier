Jim Webb announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from the 2016 White House race, but said he was considering other options, a hint he may try again as an Independent.\n\"I'm stepping aside from the Democratic primary process,\" he said.\nHe said he would take a few weeks to talk to people as he decides how to proceed next.\n  1:12 PM The endorsement comes one week after the Democratic front-runner met with Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson in Washington, D.C. While no details came out of the meeting, the activist reported positive results. As the Black Lives Matter movement has inserted itself in the 2016 primary, all the candidates on the Democratic side, and a few in the GOP, have spoken with representatives of the movement in order to incorporate new policies into their platform. McKesson also recently met with socialist candidate Bernie Sanders, who is gaining on Clinton in the polls.\nDespite Sanders' broad appeal across the Democratic base, his support among African-American voters is low compared to Clinton's. These 50 mayoral endorsements add to Clinton's more than 100 congressional endorsements. The Democratic front-runner will roll out a criminal justice reform platform next week after her Benghazi Committee hearing this Thursday.\nTop Story Biden: 'I actually like Dick Cheney'   Hillary Clinton's skills working with others.\n  11:33 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:28:38.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
