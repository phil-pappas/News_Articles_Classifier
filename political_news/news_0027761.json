Bernie Sanders is wading into a labor dispute involving Verizon, urging the telecommunications giant to negotiate a fair contract for 39,000 members of the Communications Workers of America. \nThe Democratic presidential candidate joined Verizon workers at a demonstration outside a Verizon Wireless store. He says the company should re-hire a union official who says she was fired after organizing Verizon Wireless stores in Brooklyn. \nSanders is seeking labor support as Hillary Rodham Clinton has picked up endorsements from several major unions in recent weeks. \nSanders also met privately Monday with the New York-based SEIU 1199. The powerful local union is meeting with Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday, union officials say. \nThe national Service Employees International Union is considering whether to issue an endorsement in the presidential campaign. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
