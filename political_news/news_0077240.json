The FTLA had accused the PDRC of breaking the laws from November 23, 2013, to April 5 last year by shutting down government offices, blocking elections and pressuring democratically elected prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra to quit.Winyat said the Department of Special Investigation had sought the attorney-general's decision to indict 58 PDRC leaders and members on nine charges, but only four people had been indicted for sedition and violating election laws. The four people who are standing trial are Sonthiyan Chuenruthainaitham, Sakolthee Pattiyakul, former dean of the National Institute of Development Administration Sambat Thamrongthanyawong, and Seri Wongmontha. 326 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:52:59.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
