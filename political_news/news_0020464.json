The group will serve as a forum dedicated to discussing and educating fellow Members on issues relevant to the life sciences, such as funding biomedical research, supporting scientists and small life science companies, protecting innovation from infringement, and promoting STEM education,\" said Joe Panetta , president and CEO of Biocom.\nRepresentatives Peters and Lance represent two of the most significant districts relative to life science presence in the country and respectively serve on the House Judiciary Committee, with jurisdiction over intellectual property issues, and the House Energy & Commerce Committee, with jurisdiction over health care issues. Congressman Peters was Biocom's 2014 Legislator of the Year, while Congressman Lance will be the recipient of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey's (HINJ) Honorable Bob Franks Public Service Award later this month.\n\"The life sciences are driving innovative breakthroughs that are saving lives and changing the face of medicine in our country,\" said Congressman Peters. \"In San Diego, our life-sciences sector is a hub for high-quality job creation, helping to grow the region's economy and drawing talented individuals from across the country and the world to our communities. Washington, D.C. , is not the kind of atmosphere that generates tomorrow's solutions, and it is my hope that we can use this caucus to bring experts from across the country to D.C. as we work to make informed public policy decisions.\"\n\"The creation of a Congressional Life Science Caucus was long overdue and we are confident that Representatives Peters and Lance are utterly qualified to carry out the Caucus' goals and objectives. The two lawmakers have been champions on many important issues affecting our community. Biocom is grateful for Representatives Peters' and Lance's leadership and looks forward to working with them to advance health and quality of life at home and abroad,\" added Panetta.\nBiocom will be celebrating the creation of the Caucus at Biocom's annual Capitol Hill Reception on October 27 th in Washington, D.C. The event celebrates Southern California's life science community and gives thanks to Congressional leaders and their staff.
