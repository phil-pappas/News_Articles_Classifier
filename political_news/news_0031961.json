Lynn University Center , a project that begins the final phase of the school's Campus Master Plan .\nThe new building is made possible by a $15 million gift, the largest in university history, from Board of Trustees Chair Christine E. Lynn . Mrs. Lynn's commitment is a challenge grant that establishes the foundation for others to participate in this momentous project.\n\"The Christine E. Lynn University Center will stand at the heart of our campus and enhance the experience of students, employees and every person who visits,\" says Lynn President Kevin M. Ross . \"We are grateful for Mrs. Lynn's unparalleled generosity and the role she continues to play in our university's future.\"\nThe university center's design is the culmination of years of preparation, beginning with the development of the Lynn 2020 strategic plan in 2005, and the Campus Master Plan, developed with Gensler and approved by the board of trustees in 2009.\n\"Our approach is based on Lynn's core values as a vibrant, energetic campus,\" says Gensler Senior Associate Cliff Bollmann. \"The goal is to drive energy on campus and create a space where students want to be.\"\nThe building will encompass student essentials including Lynn's award-winning 24-hour dining, Hannifan Center for Career Connections, the Center for Learning Abroad, campus store, mailroom, coffee shop, student affairs offices, collaboration spaces and more. Its design includes a large \"living room\" for informal gatherings and presentations, with expansive glass windows that connect students outdoors with activity occurring inside.\nThe university center, collectively with future residential spaces including the recently announced Mary and Harold Perper Residence Hall , will bring together academics, housing and the overall student experience to drive engagement and create a gathering place for future generations. The project's crowning element will be a green space envisioned as a park dedicated to Mrs. Lynn.\nThe university center is expected to be completed in 2018.\nAbout Lynn University\nLynn University is an independent college based in Boca Raton, Florida .
