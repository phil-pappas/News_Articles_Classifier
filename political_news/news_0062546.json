Educators say the AZMerit test raises the bar, but right now they are working hard to lower students' - and parents' - expectations. \nThe State Board of Education revealed in August that most Arizona students failed the AZMerit tests . Those same students were accustomed to high marks on the watered-down and now-discarded AIMS standards. \nMORE : Most Arizona students flunked AZMerit tests \nIn the 2013-14 school year, for example, 62 percent of fourth graders passed the AIMS math test. This past school year, just 42 percent were either \"proficient\" or \"highly proficient\" on AZMerit. The scores get worse as grade levels rise. \nMesa Public Schools, the largest district in the state, has embarked on a massive communications campaign to explain the scores to parents before report cards are sent home, on Nov. 16. \nThe district has built a web page with information and videos in both English and Spanish. The site is being used by Mesa and smaller districts to explain the AZMerit scores to parents. \n\"Districts are working together and sharing information,\" said Helen Hollands, spokeswoman for Mesa Public Schools. \nWATCH : Mesa Public Schools' AZMerit explainer site \nHollands said the district was preparing for two kinds of reactions from parents whose child's score falls below AIMS levels. \nThe first: \"What can I do to help my child, and what are you doing to help my child?\" \nThe second anticipated reaction, Hollands said, is from the critics: \"I told you these tests weren't any good.\" \nOther states that have adopted Common Core standards have seen intense blowback from parents after test scores dropped. \nThe release date for individual students' test results varies across the Valley: \n-Deer Valley Unified School District plans the release between next Monday and Nov. 13. \n-Peoria schools say around Nov. 16 \n-East Valley school districts have agreed on a release date of Nov. 16 \n-Flagstaff Unified School District plans to send the results home before Thanksgiving break. \nFor some districts, there might be a reason for the later release date. Almost 30 districts in Maricopa County are seeking approval for borrowing or budget overrides at the ballot box Nov. 3. \nReleasing the AZMerit results before then might add a new layer of controversy to those elections. \nDiane Douglas, a bitter opponent of the new standards, will release statewide, districtwide and school-level results Nov. 30 164 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1S05Xqj TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:40:14.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
