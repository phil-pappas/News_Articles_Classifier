(David S. Holloway/For The Washington Post) October 12 at 5:02 PM Regarding the Oct. 5 front-page article “ Youth sports are down, and parental pressure is up ”:\nParents perhaps should be held accountable for the “elite” athlete culture that dominates youth sports, but another big contributor is taxpayers. The amount of money spent on public high school sports is unequaled by any other student activity. Whom do high school sports serve? The same athletes parents have molded through their pocketbooks, their time and their singular dedication to a sport. With high budgets and bright spotlights, our culture places high school sports teams on an unnatural pedestal.\nMy daughter is among the 30 percent of students still playing recreational sports after age 13 whom the article referenced. In high school, she will not likely make it past tryouts. She will compete with soccer players who have played three times a week, year-round, since they were 8 years old. To these players goes all the glamour surrounding athletics in high school.\nA high school culture in which as much emphasis was put on learning English as a second language, joining the debate team or participating in the arts would be a better use of our tax dollars and healthier for our children.\nAnnie Harold , Arlington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:32:22.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
