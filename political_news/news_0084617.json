Comments \nDouglas County Sheriff John Hanlin, who oversees law enforcement in the county where Thursday's Umpqua Community College shootings occurred, has made his support for gun rights clear in at least two instances. \nA month after the Sandy Hook and Clackamas Town Center shootings, Hanlin wrote to Vice President Joe Biden to ask him not to \"tamper with or attempt to amend\" the Second Amendment. He warned that he and his deputies would not enforce any law they regarded as unconstitutional. \n\"Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,\" he wrote in a later dated Jan. 15, 2013, and posted on the sheriff's office Facebook page at the time. \nAny effort to change the Second Amendment, he wrote, \"would be irresponsible and an indisputable insult to the American people.\" \nMore recently, Hanlin was among outspoken opponents of Senate Bill 941 , which extended gun background checks to all gun transfers in the state. Gov. Kate Brown signed the 2015 bill into law on May 11, and the law took effect Aug. 9. \nHanlin was among Oregon sheriffs who testified before legislators in April, arguing that the law would be impossible to enforce. \n\"This law is not going to protect citizens of Oregon in that it is going to keep guns out of the hands of criminals,\" Hamlin said. \"It will not do that.\" \nInstead, he said, it would turn law-abiding citizens into criminals. He also said his already-strapped department wouldn't have time to run down whether someone conducted a background check. \nHe urged lawmakers to reject the bill: \"It simply isn't going to work for us.\" \n-- Michelle Brence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:16:57.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
