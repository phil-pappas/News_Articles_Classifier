The letters warn drivers a collections agency will be used if their fines of up to $525 go unpaid.\nLouisiana State Police spokesman Lt. J.B. Slaton said the Office of Motor Vehicles will have staff on hand to answer calls until 8 p.m. on regular business days for as long as necessary to answer questions and help resolve outstanding cases.\nSlaton said callers have been experiencing long wait times and sometimes getting a call-back prompt as the agency handles an influx of calls this week. Longer hours should help remedy the problem, he said.\nHe encouraged concerned drivers to continue to call the office and emphasized debts will be canceled if drivers can provide the correct documentation to the state.\n\"The bottom line is communication and documentation is key when it comes to resolving this issue,\" Slaton said.\nOn Oct. 13, the Louisiana OMV sent some 1.2 million letters to drivers with lapsed insurance earlier this month. This is the first of three letters the state will send to drivers with outstanding debts. A second letter will be sent Nov. 13 and a third Dec. 13 unless drivers pay or otherwise resolve their debt.\nThe letters come as the department seeks to take advantage of a new provision of the law that allows state agencies to collect money through the two-year-old Office of Debt Recovery. The OMV seeks to collect $444 million in outstanding fines.\nThe letters have spurred widespread backlash among drivers who say the effort is a cash grab by the state. In a Thursday morning (Oct. 22) statement, Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon condemned the letters, which he said are \"an attempt by the Jindal administration to plug a hole in the state's budget.\"\nMany of those affected say they followed the law, but have letters that address car sales or transfers that happened years ago and for which precise documentation could be hard to track down. The oldest claim goes back to 1986.\nPhil Casper of Kentucky was confused when he found one of the letters in his mail Monday. Casper, a former Algiers resident, said he moved away from the New Orleans area in October 2007 to take a new job.\nCasper said he purchased a truck and auto insurance for it a month before leaving the state. Once he got to Kentucky, he switched to new coverage and got a license plate in that state. The new truck had a temporary paper tag from Louisiana, so Casper did not see the need to mail it back, he said.\nYears later, Louisiana is seeking payment for a lapse in insurance. Casper said he gets where the state is coming from. \"I don't blame them for trying to get their money back,\" he said.\nBut he said the 1.2 million letters for debts dating years back is overkill.\nState Police deny claims the letters were sent to help speed up pay increases for troopers, who like the OMV fall under the state Department of Public Safety.\nSlaton said the OMV had no way to collect debts for decades. The department is simply trying to get back on track with enforcement, he said.\n\"We're basically trying to play catch up. We have 1.2 million licenses flagged in the system that we're trying to get cleared or fines paid for these red flags,\" Slaton said. \"Once we get all this taken care of, we'll be acting more in a real-time fashion.\"\nFor now, the OMV is directing drivers to contact the department over phone.\nFind a full list of OMV phone numbers here .\nSlaton also recommended drivers go online to check the status of their driver's license. The site will let them know the exact vehicle the fine is related to and give drivers additional information.\nCheck the status of your drivers license on the OMV website here .\nSlaton said the state is \"willing to work with everyone.\"\n\"It's definitely going to be long hours over the coming days,\" Slaton said. \"We just ask for everyone's patience.\"\nAs for Casper, he has been able to track down documentation showing he had insurance during his move. He even had his old Louisiana driver's license number memorized, allowing him to get information from the OMV website. \"I'm one of those OCD people that remembers things like that,\" Casper said.\nOthers, he noted, probably are not as lucky.\n\"Just think, if you've moved and you don't know your license number. You're screwed,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://dpsweb.dps.louisiana.gov/OMV_Welcome.nsf/cd8c258638e5224286257247004ff1ee/d4ad7c737f8a13ec862575f400637bdf?OpenDocument", "https://expresslane.dps.louisiana.gov/ReinstatementInquiry/ReinstatementInquiry.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:02:16.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
