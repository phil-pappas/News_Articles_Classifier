Ballard sits on the SOC.\nHowever, leaked documents show that the appeal to ACAT has also been marred by infighting.\nDunworth had her work as ACAT co-convener suspended after an allegation was made about her having a conflict of interest.\nHer removal prompted co-convener Saunders to quit in protest at Dunworth’s treatment.\nIn their joint report to the party’s ruling Council, the duo firmly laid the blame for the ACAT chaos at Ballard’s door.\n“The initial call to suspend Moira was made by Mark Ballard who, as vice-convenor of one of the committees cited in the ACAT referral, was an interested party,” they wrote.\nThey continued: “This call for suspension raises concerns because it was an attempt by a senior officer of Standing Orders Committee (SOC) to influence the process of an ACAT appeal which included a complaint about SOC processes.\"\n“To summarise, the call for suspension was excessive, inappropriate and patronising of the ACAT panel.”\nThe pair added: “The motivation for this allegation of conflict of interest seems to be more based on factional interests than on what was in the best interests of the party.”\nDunworth and Saunders concluded: “Council might wish to advise Mark Ballard to consider his position on SOC, given his inappropriate interference with the ACAT complaint against that committee.”\nACAT ultimately rejected a number of the complaints about the selection process, but recommended random ordering of candidates on ballot papers.\nA Scottish Green Party spokesman said: \"All of the allegations raised are familiar and have been dealt with in the past or by a recent independently-selected internal tribunal. The allegations have been judged to be groundless.\nShare article \"It is deeply-disappointing that a small number of members have, after 6 months, still not accepted the results of a ballot which was fair and democratic and have instead chosen again to air their grievances in the press. However, the vast majority of party members remain focused on winning MSP seats in every region of Scotland in May 2016 and recording the best-ever Green result.\"\nBallard did not return calls.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-18T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:54:13.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
