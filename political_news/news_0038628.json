Kasich said the lack of familial and community support was the problem.\n\"Where was Dad? Where was brother or sister? Where was neighbor?\" he asked. \"I mean, folks, our marriages, too many of them, have eroded. The relationships with our neighbors -- whats happened to the neighborhood? You see, we're all really our neighbor's keeper and we all have a responsibility to live a life bigger than ourselves.\"\nThe Republican candidate also recalled the death of the mentally ill son of Creigh Deeds, who was the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia. Deeds' son attacked him with knife hours after he reportedly was released because no psychiatric bed was available.\nRead More \"Why didn't we have the beds? Is it because we run over people who we don't understand? But what are we doing to help one another?\" Kasich asked the crowd. \"Were spending a lot of our time wondering who's going to be president. And that's great. But the country was not built from the top down.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:46:17.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
