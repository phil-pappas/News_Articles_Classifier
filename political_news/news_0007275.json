Jaitley ji, this is exactly what we have been demanding in Delhi,\" Kejriwal tweeted. \nEarlier today, in unusually strong remarks over the Supreme Court's reasoning for striking down the NJAC Act, Jaitley said that Indian democracy cannot be a \"tyranny of the unelected\". \n\"The Indian democracy cannot be a tyranny of the unelected and if the elected are undermined, democracy itself would be in danger,\" he said in a Facebook post titled'The NJAC Judgement - An Alternative View?', which he termed as \"personal views\". \nThe AAP government and Lt Governor, who represents the Centre, have been locked in a bitter fight over several issues including control over the bureaucracy. \nThe Chief Minister has written a number of letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last few months seeking his intervention in allowing the Delhi government to function independently.
