The federal government has increasingly been working with contractors and private companies to combat this threat. \nNow, a $460 million contract from U.S. Cyber Command will send for outside experts to come handle a laundry list of cybersecurity jobs, 6,200 such digital soldiers in all, with broad implications for the federal world of cybersecurity. \nThis contract will start with improving what CYBERCOM calls \"cyber joint munitions effectiveness,\" basically a mix of private companies and members of the intelligence community working on new tools to fight off hackers and even hack them back. \nThe work done by the new employees could bring some major improvements to national cybersecurity though. After analyzing reports on how previous hackers have gotten into sensitive systems, they'll be working on developing new defenses to protect DoD smartphones holding classified data. \"Of course, bringing in outside expertise comes with its own issues.\" \nOf course, bringing in outside expertise comes with its own issues. The new workers won't be able to start right away because they need to be vetted in background checks. Even once they pass those reviews they will have to deal with a lot of rules for classified material and getting information piecemeal based on what the higher-ups think they need to know. That's a far cry from the often freewheeling, open-source world of some software development, but it's par for the course for anyone wanting to work in cybersecurity. with almost half a billion dollars set to be doled out, it's likely that local companies will see some of the cash \nIt's not all defensive work though. The contractors will work on offensive digital weapons to take down hackers. They'll perform cyber espionage as well, collating information from official reports and undisclosed sources to paint a clearer picture of the current cybersecurity situation and where threats may be coming from. \nBringing in outside sources makes a lot of sense for the government. After so many high-profile and frankly embarrassing hacks of major agencies like the Office of Personnel Management and even a section of the Pentagon, it's vital that the country have better defenses in place against digital attacks. \nAdditionally, what the contractors learn as part of working for the government could be applied to improve the cybersecurity of companies they may found or work for afterward (at least anything that isn't classified for some reason). Bringing talented, motivated programmers into the national system is therefore more than just about improving the government's cybersecurity, it will eventually help bring up the cybersecurity level of the whole country. \nThe local trickle-down effect will be important too: with almost half a billion dollars set to be doled out, it's likely that local companies will see some of the cash, or that new companies could be drawn to the region as part of their work with the federal government.
