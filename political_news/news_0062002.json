What is needed is political will and action,” said Chhoyang, highlighting the need for countries to come together to resolve the global issue. \nThe largest UN Climate Change Conference, COP21, will be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015. More than 40,000 delegates and world leaders from 194 countries will converge in Paris for this global climate change summit to achieve a strong legally binding universal agreement on climate change .” It is not a political or a religious issue but a question of a healthy planet, about the very survival of humanity,” said Dalai Lama . */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:21:45.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
