When I reach the check-out aisles, I suck in my breath, looking for a friendly cashier who wont purse her lips when I use my EBT card. I try to hurry. Are the people lining up behind me? Did I buy obvious kid foods? Does my organic milk mean Im not being thrifty enough with my government dollars? Does the ice cream seem extravagant? The cashier sighs loudly when a runner has to grab the right kind of juice for my coupon. As Im leaving, the older man behind me says, Youre welcome! At home I turn to some online social support. But on Facebook I find a shared post titled Todays Lesson in Irony. Apparently its been making the rounds, turning up on conservative politicians websites. Comparing National Park Service policy with federal food-assistance programs, it quotes NPS: The animals will grow dependent on handouts, and then they will never learn to take care of themselves. Heres more irony: As a writer and single mother who recently graduated from college while holding down two jobs, social media is one of the most important forms of affirmation in my life. It also is organizing hate against me for one of my most important forms of practical support, government assistance. And the hate I find online is far more direct and vitriolic than the sigh of a cashier or the occasional muttered remark from a stranger. They are, in fact, part of a broader trend: The Web and social networks have made many things more possible, including new ways to spread stigma and shame about being poor in America. If I have to get a drug test to go to work, then you should take a drug test to be on welfare! one friend wrote. And while Ive hidden or unfriended most people who post things like this, sometimes they got through, like a viral post from a letter to the editor of a Texas paper that read, Put me in charge of food stamps! No cash for Ding Dongs or Ho Ho's, just money for 50-pound bags of rice and beans, blocks of cheese and all the powdered milk you can haul away. If you want steak and frozen pizza, then get a job. . . . Once again, you have to link this attitude about the poor to the political cult of born again evangelism. Its book, called the NIV, has created a religion where god loves the rich and hates the poor (\"Christ was rich, he was given gold\") and hates the poor. These attacks on the poor were created from the pulpit to allow the withdrawal of money from social programs to support the MIC an tax cuts for the rich and to funnel more money into the religious cults to hide away to their hearts content. Yet, in the Christian bible, this attack on the poor is anti-Christ; the work of satan, because no one who is rich gets to heaven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:34:18.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
