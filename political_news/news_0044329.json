He was confident discussions would not divide his party, which includes several MPs who favour free trade. \nMr Little said if his party ends up having a scrap with other TPP parties, on issues such as restricting foreign ownership of New Zealand land, then it will do so. \n\"It would go to the TPP commission first, the interesting thing there of course is what would Australia say, or Malaysia, or Vietnam or countries that have the very sort of restriction that we intended to enact here in New Zealand? \n\"So we will have that argument because we know that not every TPP country would support challenging us about it.\" \nAsked if that includes pulling out of the TPP, Mr Little said his party would always reserve the right to do so. \n\"In the end you know every government's duty is to act in the best interests of its people, of its citizens and we will do that, and if it means that we would have to do things that would be in breach of the TPP, because we wouldn't walk out of it, we would do those things. \n\"If we have opportunities to renegotiate things that are less favourable to us, we will.\" \n- NZ Herald, additional reporting Newstalk ZB Â»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:39:04.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
