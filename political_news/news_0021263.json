As far as I knew, the general secretary of SNDP, Vellapally Natesan was a shrewd politician, even though everything come out of his mouth is pure idiocy. \nHowever I don’t consider myself to be the right person to comment on Mr Vellapally who once claimed he would shave off half of his mustache if Mr. K.C. Venugopal and Mr. P.C. Vishnudas win the election from Alapuzha and Chengannur constituencies respectively. What saddens me is the fact that he talked all this rubbish while occupying the chair which used to be once occupied by great visionaries like Kumaranashan and R. Shankar. Hearing of his shenanigans, I was immediately been reminded of my ‘spot fixings’ days in the bar on whether water or soda is better to have with liquor. \nMoving on, let’s get to what unfolded when I actually met Natesan Guru. He was alone at the reception hall. We spoke at length on a wide range of issues. Surprisingly, or should I say shockingly, that day I realised he had a very good rapport with all journalists from Kerala working in Delhi. \nAmong many other things, we spoke about how former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati, although coming from backward class, had now become one of the most respected women politician in India. “Hailing from an extremely backward class, she managed to win the battle of power with established systems in the country. Admitted that there are some scam cases against her,” I remember telling him. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:45:44.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
