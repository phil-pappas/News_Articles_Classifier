The Great Indian Diet tells us how nutritious your locally grown and sourced ingredients are, tailoring the perfect diet and touches upon various food categories and burn fat in the process amongst other health-related issues. Shilpa and Luke hope to shed light on several taboos associated with food, encourage the consumption of wholesome Indian food and look good without having to starve.\nThe book stays true to our Indian roots and will also include details of diet and fitness principles that Shilpa follows in her day to day routine.\nShilpa says, \"I live by the Great Indian Diet and it will open readers' eyes as to why Indian food is the best and most nutritious in the world. My aim with the book is to shun fad diets and food taboos. When we have everything here in India, why look outside for answers? The book will be launched on World Nutrition Day and I hope to encourage a healthier, fitter India.\"\nWhat was the idea behind the book? \"Everyone is looking to get fit and healthy but since there's too much info on the net (lots that you shouldn't go with) I decided to write this book with a nutritionist. For a healthier life a simpler approach not having to look for answers or foods, outside the country and without having to burn a hole in you're pocket. Over the last three years, my friends and my husband encouraged me to write seeing me experimenting with diets on people who needed help and saw how it changed their lives and appearance. Raj felt maybe people would take what I have to say seriously, especially in the health and fitness segment, as I \"practice \" what I preach. My inspiration would have to be my grandmother who made me fall in love with Indian cooking with her skills (who I've dedicated my book to) and my mom who always encouraged us to eat ghee and a wholesome Indian diet that is not overcooked. She taught me to value what we have in our country, as it suits us genetically too.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:06:19.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
