The only option to reverse that is to restore control of the legitimate government,” said a person briefed on the Kremlin’s thinking. “Anything that falls short of that is bound to fall apart once we stop bombing.” \nRussian officials have said 2,000 military personnel are to be deployed under the first phase of the Syria intervention, mainly to staff and protect Russia’s air base near Latakia from where the bombing missions are being flown. \nAccording to one there are contingency plans to scale up the operation, but “they have not been activated yet”. \nFor now, Moscow is keenly watching the progress of the Syrian army, and allied Shia militias supporting it, including Hizbollah. Russia has provided heavy air support to a large-scale ground offensive launched by them on Wednesday. So far, however, the regime has made few gains, and rebels claim to have destroyed as many as 18 of its tanks. \nAlthough the Russian government says it is in Syria to fight the Islamist militants Isis, the vast majority of its air strikes have targeted anti-regime groups that were threatening the territory controlled by Mr Assad. \nRussian analysts say the logic behind Moscow’s military involvement is to weaken anti-Assad rebels so that the US-led international coalition against Isis would have no choice but to back Mr Assad. \n“The other opposition groups are sucking up energy needed to fight Isis, and their territorial distribution in Syria is such that Assad needs to crush them before he can proceed to fight Isis, ” said Mr Khramchikhin. \nBut he said even providing air cover for Syrian armed forces and militias, as Russia began doing on Wednesday, is unlikely to be enough. \n“It will become visible in the next few days if that’s possible at all,” he said. \nMr Khramchikhin and other experts say that support from Syria’s other foreign patron, Iran, could help make up for the low morale among and depletion of Mr Assad’s troops, but lacked heavy artillery, tanks and armoured personnel carriers. \n“There is certainly no Plan B for a Russian ground operation,” said Igor Sutyagin, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “But this could become a necessity if things go wrong.” \nSuch fears have been fuelled in Moscow by signs that the Russian intervention may be unifying the fractious anti-Assad opposition. On Monday, 41 rebel groups, including Ahrar al-Sham and some groups belonging to the Free Syrian Army, called for an alliance against what they called the “Russian-Iranian alliance” occupying Syria. \nUS officials say Russia has already increased the size of its ground forces in Syria. \n“Reinforcements over the last week or so feature a battalion-size ground force,” Douglas Lute, the US ambassador to Nato, told reporters on Wednesday. He said the deployment was more than what was needed to defend Moscow’s Latakia air base.
