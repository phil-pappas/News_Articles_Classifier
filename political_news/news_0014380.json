The honor recognizes local organizations that dedicate significant resources to serve their communities through service activities that positively impact the lives of others.\n\"We are honored to accept this award on behalf of our amazing employees who put forth tremendous effort this year to give back to the communities where we live and work,\" said Reet Singh , CAO and co-founder of CNSI. \"We are thankful to CVC for recognizing our passionate workforce that strives to make Montgomery County a better place.\"\nCNSI recently formalized its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program iCare , the umbrella under which all of its community service efforts exist, officially integrating its long-held values into company culture. The program, which was engineered from the ground up, solicited input from employees who have a strong desire to help those around them.\nCNSI worked with its staff to identify three charitable focus areas: hunger, education, and children. To further express its newly formalized undertaking, CNSI created a mission statement. The purpose of the statement is to guide the community service charge moving forward and drive the same innovative spirit that guides our business, to ensure resources are invested in improving health, increasing opportunity and expanding education for those most in need.\n\"I am proud of how eager and willing our employees are to take action to help strengthen our Montgomery County ,\" added Singh. \"We are constantly driven to promote a workplace that values community service and will continue to invest resources to give back to the very community that we call home.\"\nCNSI's focus on CSR was distinguished last year, when the company celebrated its 20 th anniversary by partnering with various charitable organizations across each of its site locations to give back to the local communities where it operates. In 2015, CNSI increased its community service efforts, and with guidance and support from CVC, sponsored between three and 20 volunteers each month who directly support Montgomery County community non-profits.\nCNSI has nearly 1,000 employees, many of whom are in the Gaithersburg headquarter office, with plans to soon extend community service programs to all of its U.S. projects and sites, including Lansing, Mich. , Salt Lake City, Utah , Olympia, Wash. , and Los Alamos, N.M.\nAbout CNSI\nCNSI delivers a broad portfolio of information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions to a diverse base of federal, state and local government agencies, and commercial enterprises.
