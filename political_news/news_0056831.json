Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Nassim Khadem Over 8.5 million Australians have lodged their tax return so far this year and the Australian Taxation Office has issued 6.7 million refunds worth $19.3 billion.\nAssistant Commissioner Graham Whyte said Australians were becoming more comfortable lodging using the ATO's automated lodgement system for individuals wth relatively straight forward tax affairs, called myTax.\nThe Australian Taxation Office uses data reported to the ATO by third parties, such as employers and banks, to automatically pre-fill taxpayer information.\n\"The number of people using myTax in 2015 has increased by over 70 per cent from the same time last year, with almost 1.5 million Australians using our streamlined lodgment product,\" Mr Whyte said.\n\"For most taxpayers all they need to do is double-check the pre-filled information, enter any deductions and hit submit.\"\nHe said on average, each year the ATO contacted over 350,000 people with errors in their tax returns.\nCommon errors to avoid included supplying an incorrect Tax File Number or bank account details, spelling names incorrectly, providing year of birth rather than full date of birth, not completing the income test and/or spouse details, lodging duplicate returns for the same year, and incorrectly using the \"additional information\" schedule.\n\"Omitting income is the most common mistake we see,\" Mr Whyte said. \"It is important for taxpayers to report all their income, including pay from second jobs, foreign income, bank interest and any government payments.\"\n Almost 860,000 self-lodgers have submitted their tax return using e-tax, a decrease of 34 per cent from this time last year. \"This is to be expected, as we move more people over to myTax, slowly phasing out e-tax for retirement in 2016,\" Mr Whyte said.\nSome individuals and businesses have cited problems with online lodgements. If they have technical difficulties before the October 31 deadline, the ATO says wait a bit, and then try again.\n\"From time to time, as with many online services, when a lot of people are accessing the system there may be some delays,\" Mr Whyte said. \"Anyone experiencing continual issues with lodging online should call us on 13 28 61 and we will help resolve any problems.\"\nMr Whyte said the ATO had also released an online tool called myDeductions, so people who had already lodged, or were about to, could start planning for next year's tax return. Available via the ATO app, myDeductions allows taxpayers to capture expenses on the go.\n\"Whether lodging your return yourself or using a tax agent, often the most time-consuming part of the whole process is tracking down all the year's receipts to claim deductions,\" Mr Whyte said.\n\"Come next tax time those who use myDeductions will have the option of uploading their completed deductions data to the ATO. We will then use this information to pre-fill their 2015-16 myTax return.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@NassimKhadem"], "published": "2015-10-20T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:47:03.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
