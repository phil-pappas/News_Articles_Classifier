The United States is not among them.\nFor centuries, America has lagged in ensuring that people are able to spend time with their families when it's most needed. The time is long past to fully address our family and medical leave crisis.\nAs a 30-year-old, I am finding myself in what is termed as \"the sandwich generation\" -- raising children while also caring for aging or disabled parent(s). My mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when I was 12, and it has fallen upon me to care for her as the disease has progressed. I am also the mother of a 5-year-old boy.\nSadly, my story is not unique. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly half of adults in their 40s and 50s have a parent age 65 or older and are either raising a young child or financially supporting a grown child. And yet there's little help for this predicament.\nBut there is a potential remedy.\nThe Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, now pending in Congress, could provide relief for a lot of Americans. It would enable workers to take up to 12 weeks paid leave off in the case of a medical emergency, and would be funded through a small payroll contribution.\nThe Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act would help numerous Americans. But it's a Democrat-backed bill in a Republican-dominated legislative body. Our nation's regressive policies on paid leave will probably continue, leaving families stuck and our economy lagging.\nOur country is not adequately meeting the needs of modern families. And a new law will yield a great return on investment, for both families and employers. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act will change the game for so many who cannot afford to take time off from work.\nWe should commit ourselves to passing this act and making the United States number 178.\nAbout The Writer\nRaina J.
