'Stranger things have happened' Candidates leading some polls Chip Somodevilla Andrew Burton Getty Images Photos Chip Somodevilla Andrew Burton Getty Images \nDonald Trump isn't ruling out the possibility of putting Ben Carson on the 2016 ticket with him. Trump: Obama is getting ready to take your guns \nDonald Trump on Monday served up a fresh platter of red meat to a crowd of 5,600 supporters in this deep red part of South Carolina, including suggesting that President Barack Obama is planning to sign an executive order to \"take your guns away.\" \n\"You... Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \n\"Well I like him, he likes me. I mean, stranger things have happened,\" Trump told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" Tuesday. \"But it's too early to think about.\" \nTrump quipped on the possible outsider ticket Tuesday as a new CNN/ORC poll showed him and Carson dominating the Republican field with 27% and 22% support, respectively. No other Republican candidate has double-digit support nationwide, according to the latest poll results. \n\"Well, we've hit a chord. And we're not as different as people think,\" Trump told CNN about the poll results. \"You know we have a very good relationship. We're not as different as people think. But there is certainly a different style. You know, I have great assets and he has some great assets. But we are both resonating, there's no question about it.\" \nTrump has developed a reputation for battling with his Republican opponents --he escalated his feud with Jeb Bush this week, saying the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks proved that President George W. Bush failed to keep the U.S. safe. But Carson has been one opponent who has largely escaped Trump's hits. \nThe two even paired up last week for a successful push to limit CNBC's upcoming Republican debate to two hours. \nThe closest the two came to scrapping was after Carson questioned how genuine Trump was about his faith last month. But Carson quickly pulled back after Trump pounced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:48:05.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
