Susan Du Heavy foot traffic pouring off 1st Ave. formed a semi-orderly throng 12 lines wide and 50 people deep. Every step took us one closer to sporting glory.\nInside, the Minnesota Lynx were seconds from tip-off in Game Five of the WNBA Finals — and the quest for their third championship in five years.\nA new acquaintance waited in front of me. This was his first Lynx game.\nHere's this guy, husband of a successful businesswoman, with three daughters at elite colleges. And he can't bring himself to buy a ticket for Minnesota's only big-time team until a championship's on the line? For shame!\nHe wasn't alone in catching the gravy train. Nearly 19,000 people showed, a franchise record, and more than double that of a typical night.\nThe Lynx deserve better.\nWednesday's win continued a dominant run. The most brilliant gem in the crown is Maya Moore, an animated young leader who never learned to lose, and still refuses.\nMoore is the closest thing any American sport has seen since Magic Johnson's generation: a lovable champion who visibly enjoys playing the game she's mastered.\nYet most of Minnesota has met Moore's enthusiasm with a yawn. Average game attendance has hovered around 9,300 over the last couple years. That's a drop-off from its start in 1999, when an average of 10,500 Minnesotans watched a mediocre team miss the playoffs. League attendance also peaked back then, falling in a parallel drop-off.\nThe obvious and grim conclusion: We checked out women's pro ball when it was a novelty, but the more we've seen, the less interested we are in paying for it.\nInstead of widespread admiration, the Lynx have settled for individual attention. After Wednesday's win, they got a call from Barack Obama and a private concert from (rumored) hardcore baller and (confirmed) guitar god, Prince.\nThe Lynx also earned a public confession from a far lesser luminary: Me. Wednesday night was my first game, too.\nThe reason I skipped the dreadful first decade of women's basketball in Minnesota is the same reason I ignored the glorious years that followed. They're women.\nThe pace of the WNBA and some of its clumsier moments recalled the high school games I grew up watching. They spent too much time running down the court, not flying above it.\nI had been swept up in the spectacle of Michael, then Kobe, and now LeBron, terrifying opponents and attacking the basket, soaring and striking like a hawk fitted with a cobra's head.\nAfter Wednesday, I wanted a refund for my ill-placed adoration. I'll still watch that animal hunt, sure. But I can't identify with it, and I don't see much life in its eyes.\nJordan's Nike handlers wisely limit his media exposure, knowing his petty meanness will drive off consumers. Successors to the throne are hardly more likable. Kobe and Lebron's teammates tolerate their insatiable egos because it might mean championships, but both have few friends who are not on their payroll.\nI'm tired of being awed by awful people.\nWatching an NBA game is like being on the set of an action movie, and then realizing what kind of divas and douchebags that life creates. Watching the Lynx is like watching regular folks working, struggling, and trying to scratch out a living.\nMaybe they seem more like civilians because they get paid like them. For all her wins, Maya Moore's most unbelievable statistic is her salary. The best player in the league makes a reported $60,000 — less than what Lebron gets each paycheck. She and her teammates essentially work double shifts, playing in China, Turkey, and Poland during the \"offseason\" to make ends meet.\nI'm sorry, Maya. It's my fault. About 80 percent of the WNBA's loyal following comprises of women, particularly lesbians. The rest are mostly dads with daughters in tow.\nWhat's missing is people like me: The straight, 25-to-40 male, who's proven more inclined to deify LeBron from the cheap seats or stream reruns of middling sitcoms.\nNo more, Ms. Moore. On Wednesday, you won a third WNBA championship, and at least one more fan.\nI didn't go to Game Five to fulfill some sort of duty, a debt owed by the evolved modern man. I was there not as a guilt-ridden feminist, but as a fan of good basketball and character-driven drama. I found both.\nAs the clocked ticked down under 10 seconds, team talis-woman and badass Seimone Augustus wrapped Moore, equipped with an incandescent smile, in her heavily tattooed arms.\nAugustus jutted her chin in a \"this-is-our-house\" mean-mug, then covered her face when the horn sounded. And wept.\nNow 31, and hobbled by a bum knee, Augustus acknowledged in recent weeks that she's not sure how long this Lynx core can maintain its run. I woke up Thursday hoping there's still space on the bandwagon and a few miles left on the wheels.\nThe Lynx woke up Thursday as Minnesota's lone professional dynasty since the Minneapolis Lakers of the 1950s. Never heard of 'em? Ask your grandmother.\nBetter yet, take her: Season tickets are on sale now, but you can also just grab your date and your wallet, and head to the Target Center just before tip-off.\nSingle file, please, and no cutting. I'll see you in line.\nContact: Mike Mullen Follow: City Pages City Pages", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:32:46.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
