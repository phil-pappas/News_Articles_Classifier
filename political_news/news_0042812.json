And Mrs. Fiorina, whose political prospects have improved on the strength of strong performances in the Republican presidential debates, has found a benefactor of her own in Beverly Hills.\n Carly Fiorina’s ‘Super PAC’ Aids Her Campaign, in Plain Sight SEPT. 30, 2015 Liberal Feminists Ponder Friends, Foes and Carly Fiorina SEPT. 28, 2015 Carly Fiorina Builds Off Successful G.O.P.

SEPT. 16, 2015 Mr. Perenchio, 84 — who helped build Univision , the Spanish-language cable giant, produced hit television shows and once represented celebrities like Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John — is banking on Mrs. Fiorina as his latest rising star. He has already contributed nearly $1.6 million so far to a group supporting her, making him its biggest donor by far, and he has hosted at least three fund-raisers, records show.\nPhoto Mr. Perenchio, the former chief executive of Univision, has supported a number of Republican candidates over the years, including Mrs. Fiorina when she ran against Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010. Credit Nick Ut/Associated Press Mr. Perenchio’s support could prove a crucial lifeline for Mrs. Fiorina as she seeks to stay competitive against her much better-financed Republican rivals. Her campaign got off to a slow start raising money this spring, which left her many millions of dollars behind candidates like Jeb Bush and Ben Carson, but she and the super PAC supporting her, named Carly for America , are now looking to capitalize on her rise in some recent polls.\n“It’s a big plus for her to have Jerry in her corner,” said Karl Rove, a political adviser to former President George W. Bush, who helped found American Crossroads , a conservative group that has also received millions from Mr. Perenchio .\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “He is very generous guy who’s in a position to help her capitalize on what she started with her strong performance in the debates,” Mr. Rove said in a telephone interview.\nMrs. Fiorina’s friendship with Mr. Perenchio typifies the kind of close personal relationship that a number of candidates have developed with their biggest donors in the new era of campaign finance.\nA decade ago, the pair traveled in similar business and political circles in California as leaders of two major companies in the state — Mrs. Fiorina at Hewlett-Packard, the Silicon Valley computer maker, and Mr. Perenchio at Univision.\nBoth were big contributors to the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. And when Mrs. Fiorina decided to try her hand at politics herself two years later, by running against Senator Barbara Boxer in California, Mr. Perenchio hosted a fund-raiser for her.\nContinue reading the main story OPEN Graphic Graphic: Million-Dollar Donors in the 2016 Presidential Race Mrs. Fiorina was trounced in that race , but she won an important ally in Mr. Perenchio. He was impressed with her intellect and perseverance, and the two became close friends during the campaign, said Cassandra Vandenberg, a political adviser to Mr. Perenchio.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story When her name was floated late last year as a possible presidential candidate, Mr. Perenchio decided to support a Fiorina campaign even before she had officially announced her intentions. After the second Republican debate last month, in which Mrs. Fiorina was on the main stage instead of with the candidates polling in the lower tier, Mr. Perenchio unabashedly declared her the winner.\nMr. Perenchio, who rarely speaks to journalists, declined requests for an interview about his support for Mrs. Fiorina. (One of his “rules” of life, he once said, is to “stay out of the spotlight; it fades your suit.”)\nA Hollywood throwback, Mr. Perenchio built his fortune on somewhat offbeat ventures that others had shunned. He partnered with Norman Lear on 1970s sitcoms like “All in the Family,” and he promoted the classic 1971 match at Madison Square Garden between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. He netted about $1.1 billion from the sale of Univision and is ranked prominently on the annual Forbes lists of richest Americans .\nWhile he has shunned the public spotlight, he has become one of the biggest donors in the country to conservative causes and candidates, many of them at the local and state level — but never at the levels of presidential funding seen so far in this campaign.\nMr. Perenchio’s support of Mrs. Fiorina’s campaign can now be seen in the form of new advertisements hitting back against Donald J. Trump’s attacks on her looks and countering accusations that she mismanaged Hewlett-Packard as the chief executive there a decade ago. At campaign stops in South Carolina and elsewhere, the super PAC Mr. Perenchio has helped fund has become in many ways an extension of the campaign itself .\nContinue reading the main story First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race , the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\nMrs. Fiorina is not the only candidate with a billionaire benefactor capable of giving money to groups to help finance advertising, register voters and organize volunteers, tasks traditionally handled by the campaigns themselves.\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas has the two biggest donors, with the hedge fund investor Robert Mercer contributing $11.3 million to one of the groups supporting Mr. Cruz and Toby Neugebauer, who co-founded a private equity firm, contributing $10 million to another.\nNorman Braman, a Florida auto dealer, contributed $5 million to the group supporting his protégé and home state senator, Marco Rubio , while Jeb Bush and Hillary Rodham Clinton each have a slew of donors giving $1 million or more to their committees. Mr. Trump, a billionaire in his own right, has given his own campaign $1.8 million.\nBut big-money donors are no guarantee of success in the early slog of the presidential campaign, as both Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas have found out. Mr. Walker and Mr. Perry both had donors who gave at least $5 million apiece to super PACs supporting their candidacies but they withdrew from the race because of poor polling numbers and empty campaign war chests.\nMr. Perenchio is by far the biggest donor to Mrs. Fiorina’s super PAC, with his contributions totaling nearly half of the $3.5 million that the committee has taken in.\nThough the Fiorina campaign is hoping to build financial momentum after her rave reviews from the first two debates, it is unclear just how big a jump her fund-raising numbers will take and whether she can significantly close the money gap with her Republican rivals. Her campaign and the super PAC supporting her declined to release fund-raising figures — they must file a report to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15 — nor would they discuss Mr. Perenchio.\nKatie Hughes, a spokeswoman for the super PAC backing Mrs. Fiorina, said she was not concerned by the large financial advantage that the committees for Mr. Bush, Mr. Cruz and others have built over hers. “We’re very focused on a long-range strategy of building a first-rate ground operation,” she said.\nBut if Mrs. Fiorina’s campaign does ultimately founder, Mr. Perenchio appears to have a fallback position. He has already donated $100,000 to another super PAC — this one supporting Mr. Bush.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/01/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race-1438468879112/election-2016-campaign-money-race-1438468879112-thumbStandard.png", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/28/us/29CARLYweb/29CARLYweb-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/profile/a-jerrold-perenchio/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/16/us/elections/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418-thumbStandard-v3.png", "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-jerry-perenchio-facts-20141106-story.html", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/25/us/26CARLY-videostill/26CARLY-videostill-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/us/01carly-web1/01carly-web1-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/08/us/09FIORINAweb2/09FIORINAweb2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/21/us/21carly-web/21carly-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/31/us/elections/top-presidential-donors-campaign-money-1438395923867/top-presidential-donors-campaign-money-1438395923867-master180-v3.png", "http://www.americancrossroads.org/", "https://carlyforamerica.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/08/us/09FIORINAweb2/09FIORINAweb2-master315.jpg", "http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/25/us/24firstdraft-carly/24firstdraft-carly-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:06:02.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
