This sentence comes as a result of an investigation by the OSC's Joint Serious Offences Team (JSOT).\nThe conditional sentence includes strict house arrest for 18 months. Hughes will also be prohibited from trading in or acquiring securities and from acting as a director or officer of an issuer for the duration of his conditional sentence. Hughes will serve a further three years of probation following his conditional sentence. During his conditional sentence and probation, Hughes will pay $200 per month in restitution. The court separately issued a restitution order for $104,311.37 .\nIn April 2014 , JSOT launched an investigation into the activities of Hughes and his company Rivertree Financial Services Corporation. Hughes admitted that he agreed to manage investments for a client and then issued false monthly statements indicating the client's holdings were increasing in value when the client was actually losing money. Hughes' false statements exaggerated the value of the client's holdings by as much as 900%. The total loss suffered by Hughes' client was approximately CDN $126,000 .\nJSOT was established by the OSC as an enforcement partnership between the OSC, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Financial Crime program and the Ontario Provincial Police Anti-Rackets Branch. The primary objective of JSOT is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. This is accomplished through collaborative investigations of serious violations of the law using the provisions of the Securities Act or the Criminal Code.\nThe mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices and to foster fair and efficient capital markets and confidence in the capital markets.
