USFOR-A will work with those affected to determine appropriate payments. If necessary and appropriate, the administration will seek additional authority from the Congress,\" he said.' 9,659 Re: U.S. to make payments to families of Kunduz air strike victims: Pentagon My thoughts are what a ridiculous notion. Either you give money to all your innocent victims or you give it to none. What makes these innocent victims worthy of payouts but not the hundreds/thousands of other innocent 'collateral damage' victims? Simple....these victims are international doctors with a ton more clout then the nameless innocents killed before. Last edited by DA60; Today at 12:05 AM . All that I feel is the realness I'm faking.

Simple....these victims are international doctors with a ton more clout then the nameless innocents killed before. Additionally, I thought there was supposed to be a big investigation? Why not wait until it is finished before you start handing out cash? Why bother even having the investigation if you are practically admitting your guilt by giving out dough to the victims relatives? I am neither rep nor dem but this whole incident seems to have been handled incredibly unprofessionally. And, btw, if you are one of the hundreds/thousands of other innocent victims of American bombing gaffs...go get a lawyer and try and get some dough from the Pentagon while you still can. America just cannot stop making enemies and galactic mistakes. And I would not gloat were I a Republican. The Middle East would probably be a WHOLE lot better off had G.W. Dumb Dumb not decided to over throw Saddam and then appoint maybe the stupidest man possible (Paul why-don't-we-disband-the-Iraqi-military Bremer) to look after the place after Saddam was evicted. Both GW and Barack have messed up BIG TIME in that part of the world.
