(Photo: Rodney White/The Register) \nLater, he talks about his experience first campaigning in Iowa: \n\"It’s interesting, because we’re talking in Iowa; people always, I think, were surprised about me connecting with folks in small-town Iowa. And the reason I did was, first of all, I had the benefit that at the time nobody expected me to win. And so I wasn’t viewed through this prism of Fox News and conservative media, and making me scary. At the time, I didn’t seem scary, other than just having a funny name. I seemed young. Sometimes I look at my pictures from then and I say, I can’t believe anybody voted for me because I look like I’m twenty-five.\" \nRead the entire first part of the interview at NYBooks.com. The interview will be published in the Nov. 5 issue of The New York Review of Books.
