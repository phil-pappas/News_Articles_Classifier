There was no secret meeting, and the Pope had no idea who she was when he met her. Location: The Front Line. Posts: 187 Thanks for linking to that article. It has been stupid with this Kim crap. I linked to another article earlier today about the Pope also meeting with a very good friend for the past couple decades, who is also gay. He and his partner met with the Pope that same day as Davis, so it seemed odd to see this crazy talk about him supporting Davis's bigotry. Thank you so much for that article!

You can't trust anything that comes out of her lawyers mouth. The guy is a pathological liar. There is no doubt in my mind the Pope had no idea who she was, said nothing but hello, and moved on. There is also no doubt in my mind she was just part of a group invited by a conservative Bishop, at the behest of her lawyer to lend the appearance of the Pope supporting her position, which not only he doesn't, but as was stated in the article doesn't know anything about the matter, much less who she is, or in any way supports her position. From a more reliable source than politicususa: Quote: In an official statement this morning, Fr. Federico Lombardi, head of the Vatican press office downplayed Pope Francis’ meeting with Kim Davis.“Pope Francis met with several dozen persons who had been invited by the Nunciature to greet him as he prepared to leave Washington for New York City,” said Lombardi. “Such brief greetings occur on all papal visits and are due to the Pope’s characteristic kindness and availability.” [That does not mean he did not meet with Davis one on one. This is spin, it's not a lie but it's not the truth, either] “The only real audience granted by the Pope at the Nunciature was with one of his former students and his family,” Fr. Lombardi added. [So now we're down to parsing what a \"real\" audience is?] The Vatican explained that the “brief” meeting between the Pope and Davis has “continued to provoke comments and discussion” and thus offered his explanation “in order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.” [We're trying desperately to placate harsh criticism in the US media and probably among the gay lobby in the Vatican. So now the media knows that a little pressure works in rolling this Pope, as if they didn't know before. And don't tell me this is the Vatican press office going off like a loose cannon. In this most authoritarian of pontificates, nothing \"just happens.\"] Fr. Lombardi said, “The Pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects.” [Complex?!? She thinks sodomite marriage an offense against God and nature. She will have no part in it. Not hard to understand] News that the pope had secretly met with Davis during his trip to the U.S. broke on Tuesday evening, after her lawyer made the meeting public. Davis said that Francis had told her to \"stay strong,\" giving both her and her husband a rosary. \"Please pray for me,\" he requested In a new statement today, Davis' lawyer, Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel, disputed reports circulating in light of the Vatican's newest statement suggesting that Davis had simply met the pope as one in a line of people. \"There were no other people in the room,\" he said. \"This was a private meeting between Pope Francis and Kim and Joe Davis. This was not a meeting with other people in which Kim and Joe Davis were a part, but rather a private meeting with no other people in the room except Vatican security and personnel.\" Staver acknowledged that the pope \"was not weighing in on particular facts of a legal case,\" but added that \"his statements about religious freedom and his encouragement to Kim Davis to ‘stray strong’ during a private meeting reaffirm the human right to conscientious objection. This is a right for everyone.” Staver also said that the meeting was initiated by the Vatican, an apparent response to speculation that the meeting with the pope may have been arranged by a conservative bishop in the U.S., perhaps without the full knowledge of the Vatican or the pope about Davis' case [And now we get the spin of Fr. Tom Rosica] However, English-language spokesman for the Vatican, Fr. Thomas Rosica, placed the responsibility for the meeting in the hands of U.S. papal nuncio Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.“Who brought her in? The nuncio,” Father Rosica told the New York Times. “The Nunciature was able to bring in donors, benefactors.” Fr. Rosica added: \"“I would simply say: Her case is a very complex case. It’s got all kinds of intricacies. Was there an opportunity to brief the pope on this beforehand? I don’t think so. A list is given — these are the people you are going to meet.” Rosica responded to a question about whether the Vatican press office had been unaware of the pope's meeting with Davis, saying: \"No, but I think we may not have been aware of the full impact of the meeting. It is very difficult sometimes when you are looking at things in America from here.” [How about let your yes be yes and your no be no, Fr. Tom?] Seems as if Father Rosica reaffirms the meeting in his remarks. Indeed it does. It will be interesting to see if anyone recorded the meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:49:28.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
