Racial diversity. As a white mayor in a 63 percent African-American city, this spotlight will shine brightly. Strickland can ill afford to have a group of appointees on New Year’s Day that is wildly out of whack with the city's racial ratio.\n2. Gender diversity. Strickland often assailed A C Wharton on the campaign trail for a dearth of female directors, so it’s not as though Strickland can come out with the same ratio, at least not with a straight face.\n3. Backgrounds/new faces. A 50-year-old two-term City Council member wouldn’t seem to carry the banner for the “Memphis needs new blood” crowd, but Strickland could, in many ways. If his staff is full of names you haven’t heard before, it could turn heads of those whose assessment of Strickland is that he’s hardly an innovator. That would be especially true if Strickland plucked some high-profile hires from perceived big-time jobs or employers, or if any of his hires came straight out of left field.\n4. Competence. Oh yeah, that one. Remember all that Strickland busted up Wharton for his inability to get things done? Well, much of that falls to the people around you. It goes without saying that a mayor needs smart lieutenants with their heads on a swivel, but it must be re-stated given all the other boxes he has to check above.\nKeep an eye out: Deidre Malone turned to the Tri-State Defender to give a lengthy interview, so we’ll be clicking refresh over there today to see what she has to say.\nOur first look: Late Wednesday afternoon, the Shelby County Election Commission shared the document we’ve been waiting for: the precinct-by-precinct accounting of the city election. (Warning! The numbers are unofficial and unaudited, and the results have not yet been certified.)\nAmong other things, it will provide some clues about the geographic and racial voting breakdowns in the mayor’s race. I spent my night at the aforementioned dinner and really only got my hands dirty on the PDF late last night, so I’ll be hammering out an analysis through the day. But a few things stood out:\nThe nine highest-turnout precincts, percentage-wise, all went for Strickland, which is a pretty good recipe for success. The highest-turnout precinct was Second Baptist Church (05700), where 53.2 percent of voters showed up and 81.2 percent of the vote went to Strickland. Shady Grove Elementary School gave Strickland his best number, 82.8 percent. Forty-one of the city’s 119 precincts gave Strickland 50 percent or more of their vote totals. Strickland’s worst precinct, with 12.9 percent of the vote, was Christ Missionary Baptist Church on South Parkway. Wharton's precinct performance fell in a much tighter array. His best precinct was Glenview Community Center, where he got 40.8 percent of the vote. Other than the tiny-vote precincts, his worst was Memphis Jewish Home in Cordova, where he received 9.2 percent of the vote. Harold Collins ’ best precinct was a 40.2 percent showing at Manor Lake Elementary on Horn Lake Road. Collins was in single-digit percentage points in 35 precincts. The final precinct win tallies: Strickland 60, Collins 34, Wharton 20, Mike Williams 5. Obviously, there are more substantive takeaways that we’ll share later on in the day, but these were a few that I gleaned from the surface late last night.\nOh, and one other thing: Maybe turnout wasn’t as bad as we thought. The Election Commission lists our 100,687-vote turnout as 27.6 percent of registered voters -- not the nearly 25 percent as had earlier been reported. Why? The denominator changed. The Election Commission now lists 364,451 registered voters, not the 400,000-some-odd it did last week. I’ll try to find out which is reliable.\nWilder to Springer: Mary Wilder , the third-place finisher in the District 5 City Council race, is asking supporters to consider Dan Springer in that district’s runoff election.
