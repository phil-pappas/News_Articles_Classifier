Hillary Clinton solidifies her lead in Democratic race (Charlie Neibergall / Associated Press) \nMaybe it was the debate or maybe just the race snapping back to its natural pattern after an aberrant month or so, but whatever the reason, Hillary Rodham Clinton appears to be firmly back in the lead of the Democratic presidential fight. \nThe evidence comes from three new national polls. \nA Washington Post/ABC News poll has Clinton leading Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont by 54% to 23%, with Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't said whether he'll run, at 16%. That's a big shift from last month, when a Post/ABC survey put Clinton at 42%. \nSanders' support has not changed, but Biden's waned, the poll found. \nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal survey also showed Clinton widening her lead in the race. Clinton led Sanders, 49%-29%, with Biden at 15% in that poll. \nWithout Biden in the race, Clinton led Sanders, 58%-33%, in the NBC/WSJ poll. Unlike the Post/ABC survey, this one showed support for Sanders dropping compared with a predebate survey. \nA third poll, for Reuters by the Ipsos polling firm, showed a similarly large Clinton lead. And a poll this week by CNN showed Clinton, the former secretary of State, leading Sanders, 45%-29%, with Biden at 18%. \nThe polling figures are significant for a couple of reasons. They might contribute to deterring Biden from running. They also have calmed a jittery mood among prominent Clinton backers who, a month ago, were starting to panic over mediocre poll results. And they come as Clinton prepares for a showdown Thursday with Republicans on the House committee investigating the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Lindsey Graham finally hits 1%, will get to be in next debate (Jim Cole / Associated Press) \nIt doesn't really seem like that high a bar to get into a debate -- hit 1% support in any one of nine polls over a month -- but several of the men seeking the GOP presidential nomination have had trouble clearing it. \nThe 1% standard is the threshold for being in the early debate when the GOP candidates meet next week in Boulder, Colo. To get on the main stage, candidates must average 2.5% support -- a test that 10 appear to have met. \nFour candidates -- Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, former Gov. George Pataki of New York, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- were destined for the undercard, although they each scored below 1% in several surveys. \nUntil today, Graham was at risk of not making even that contest. Seven polls in a row showed him with less than 1%. \nBut when he appears at next week's debate, Graham can say, \"thanks, CNN.\" This morning, that network's survey showed him making the grade. A Washington Post/ABC poll, which will be the ninth of the surveys used to determine positions in the debate, will be released later this week. Fiorina fades, Trump, Carson maintain lead in GOP race (Sean Rayford / Getty Images) \nCarly Fiorina's moment in the sun in the race for the Republican presidential nomination appears to have faded quickly, new polls indicate. But Donald Trump and Ben Carson have solidified their positions atop the field. \nThe latest evidence comes from a CNN poll released this morning. Fiorina dropped to 4% support, down from 15% in a CNN poll last month. \nUntil she gained attention with strong performances in the first two GOP candidate debates, the former Hewlett-Packard executive was little known to most voters outside California, where she lost a Senate race in 2010. The debates sent her on a quick rise, but she fared poorly in the scrutiny of her record that followed and has ridden the down escalator almost as promptly. The CNN survey is among at least a half dozen recent public polls that have shown sharp drops in her support. \nNot that the rest of the GOP is doing a whole lot better. After Trump at 27% and Carson at 22%, the next tier of GOP candidates consists of the two Floridians in the race, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, at 8%. Several other candidates are bunched behind those two with 4% or 5% backing. \nA flurry of polls in the runup to next week's GOP debate in Colorado have each shown the same basic pattern, with a strong lead by Trump and Carson and the rest of the field grouped closely together with single-digit support. \nThe CNN poll was conducted Oct. 14-17 and has a margin of error for its Republican sample of +/- 4.5 percentage points.
