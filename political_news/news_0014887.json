Haq added that the Mission is “very concerned over what it calls the organized infiltration of several armed groups in Bangui and has condemned all attempts to destabilize Bangui.”\nThe UN official noted that, “unknown persons targeted MINUSCA on two occasions on Saturday,” although no casualties were recorded.”\nOn September 29, nearly 40 people died and approximately 30,000 forced to flee their homes in Bangui. Then UN refugee agency spokesman, Leo Dobbs, told reporters: “We fear that the violence that we’re seeing in Bangui is a return to the dark days of late 2013 and 2014, when thousands were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes.”\nOn 30 September, Foreign Minister of CAR, Samuel Rangba asked from UN Security Council to consider lifting restrictions on the training and equipping of his country’s military, and also called for a stronger MINUSCA mandate.\nRangba told at the UN General Assembly that the current violence in CAR “proves that peace and reconciliation are still tenuous and require strong support so the country will not once again fall into extended violence.”\nYesterday, Haq said that “MINUSCA is determined to continue to use all necessary means to protect civilians, strengthen State authority and support the political process.”\nRight now a transitional government, headed by President Catherine Samba-Panza, is in charge to lead the country to elections on October 18. The newly popular elected government will have to confront the difficult task to bring peace in CAR and put an end to the vicious intercommunal fighting between the Muslim Séléka group and the Christian anti-Balaka movement.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:48:42.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
