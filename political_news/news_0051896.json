But if Biden decides not to run, Sanders' lead over Clinton balloons to 48 percent to her 38 percent.\nThe results also show that Clinton could be in trouble when it comes to wooing Granite State voters to her side. Seven in 10 Sanders supporters say they've made a \"firm choice\" to vote for the Vermont senator, a 26 percent increase from the same poll in August. However, 40 percent of Clinton voters said they were firmly voting for her in August, a number which has now grown to 62 percent.\n  U.S. jet in Afghanistan hit by small-arms fire The F-16 was able to land safely after the incident on Oct. 13, said Capt.

These results are virtually unchanged since August.\nNew Hampshire's primary, which is the first in the nation, is set for Feb. 9.\nThe poll of 403 likely Democratic primary voters was conducted Oct. 14-17 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Texas cuts funding to Planned Parenthood Texas is the latest state to try to strip federal and state dollars from the women's health provider.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/19/15 1:06 PM Top Story Is the GOP really still a party?  \nBy W.
