Iran’s missile program, however, is relatively transparent, so it is remarkable that notable improvements in the range, accuracy and lethality of its arsenal have received far less attention than its nuclear ambitions, especially as these developments signal the missions Iran has in mind for its missiles. In particular, they suggest that unlike North Korea, Iran is in no rush to build an ICBM. Instead, it wants more capable missiles for use against Israel and the Gulf Arab states.Although Iran has long possessed a large number of missiles, the majority of them are too inaccurate for use against specific military targets. As a result, most analysts have looked at them as “terror weapons” best used against large, dense urban areas where accuracy is effectively irrelevant.
