All proceeds from the night will support HandReach in extending state-of-the-art burn care and rehabilitation to children injured by burns in the developing world.\nHeadlining the event will be world-renowned drummer Dan Caro , who at the age of two, survived such severe burns to most of his body that he wasn't expected to live. Called \"No-hand Dan,\" by some, Dan Caro grew to actualize his many talents and now tours as a professional drummer, sharing the stage with luminaries like Dr. Wayne Dyer and legendary guitarist Carlos Santana .\nThe stage at A Perfect Ten-Ten will also be graced by the noted fashion designer Linda Rowe Thomas , who will curate a fashion show featuring models from Burn Survivors of New England. Linda has designed for more than 20 years, and her elegant work has graced New York Fashion Week, the red carpets of the Golden Globes, BET, The ESPY's and led to accolades of all kinds. At age two, Linda survived a house fire which left her with facial scarring and without fingers on her left hand. What would be a handicap for many was a motivation for Linda, who always maintains impeccable quality with each stitch of her work.\nHandReach's fashion sponsor for the evening is 2nd Time Around, a curated, contemporary designer resale boutique with stores throughout New England. Lauren Holbrook , manager of 2nd Time Around's Newton Centre store says, \"We at 2TA are beyond excited to be partnering with HandReach, a wonderful organization that emulates one of our fundamental values â€“ a second chance, a fresh start. We couldn't be happier to be involved with an organization that shares the goal of empowering all people to look and feel their best!\"\nThe ticket price for the event is $55.00 in advance or $65.00 at the door.
