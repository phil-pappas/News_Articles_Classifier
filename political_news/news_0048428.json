They will be presented to Councillors before hearings start in the last week of October. If needed, the Council will also hold hearings in the first week of November. \nIn August the Council published its initial proposal, suggesting wide-spread changes to ward boundaries, and to the numbers of councillors and community boards. The proposed arrangements are to be decided before next year's local body elections, scheduled for 8 October 2016. \nAfter the hearings, the Council is due to make its final decision on Wednesday 18 November, which it will publish on Friday 20 November. \nIf there are any appeals or objections to the Council's final proposal, the Local Government Commission will hear them next year. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
