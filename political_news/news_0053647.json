There's no other explanation for it,\" he said. \"It's hurting small business, that's where it is principally targeted.\"\n Mr Louttit said the ATO reduction in the threshold at which it pursued small businesses that owed it debts, from $300,000 to around $30,000 was hitting small business hard.\n\"The phone runs off the hook when they come through, the economy is really struggling and I just don't know how they are going to turn it around,\" he said.â€‹\nPeter Marsden a partner, at accounting and consultancy firm RSM Bird Cameron, agreed the numbers reflected a more aggressive approach from the ATO, but he said this was not a negative thing.\nThe ATO was starting to call in a massive $35 billion in debts owed to it, which it should have been collecting some time ago, Mr Marsden said.\nOf that outstanding tax debt around $20 billion is owed by small and medium sized enterprises.\nMr Marsden agreed the problem had been government policy.\n\"It stems back to the global financial crisis and an unwillingness to wind-up trading businesses then, that's resulted in a large build of debt,\" he said.\nThe high number of winding-ups was likely to continue through Christmas and the new year.\n\"Whatever happens after that depends on any improvement in the economy,\" he said.\n\"Growth is stagnant so companies are finding it difficult to make positive decisions to generate profit.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:53:02.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
