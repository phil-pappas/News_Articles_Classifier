Clinton took 48 percent, while her closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, earned just 21 percent. Vice President Joe Biden, who is weighing a run but has not committed, sits at 17 percent. For Clinton, it's an increase from 42 percent in the same poll last month , and nearly back to the level of support she enjoyed in August.\nAsked whether they would throw their vote behind Biden if he chooses to run, 10 percent said doing so was very likely and 31 percent said it was somewhat likely.\nIf Biden were to decide against running, however, Clinton's advantage jumps to 57 percent, while Sanders picks up just 3 additional points, at 24 percent. The figures are similar to those released by CNN/ORC earlier Monday, which found that 56 percent of voters would go for Clinton if Biden stays out of the race.\nBiden leads the field in terms of net favorability (73 percent to 9 percent), while Clinton is close behind (77 percent to 18 percent). Sanders' net favorability is a solid 49 points, though 28 percent do not have an opinion of him.\nMore than half of Americans polled want stricter gun sale laws By Nick Gass\nThe findings also suggest a split among Democrats about the debate schedule, a point of contention even among top Democratic National Committee officials. About 44 percent said there are enough debates scheduled, while 37 percent said there are not. The next Democratic debate — the second of six scheduled before the primary season begins — is set for Nov. 14 in Des Moines, Iowa.\nThe poll was conducted by telephone from Oct. 15 to 18, surveying 340 registered voters who identified as Democratic or independents leaning toward the Democratic Party. The margin of error is plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.monmouth.edu/university/monmouth-university-poll-reports.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:28:07.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
