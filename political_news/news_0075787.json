Law enforcement agencies, researchers and media outlets use different criteria and starting points. Here are four examples the illustrate the difficulty of finding definitive numbers. \n996 — The Mass Shooting Tracker , started by anti-gun volunteers, says that covers every mass shooting from Jan. 1, 2013, to Oct. 7, 2015. They define mass shootings broadly, counting any incident in which four or more people were shot and include drug- and gang-related shootings. \n160 — The FBI released a report in 2014 tracking attacks by so-called \"active\" shooters from 2000 to 2013. The report ignores gang and drug shootings but otherwise sets no limit on deaths or injuries. \n151 — Stanford University tracks shootings in which three or more people were shot. It cautions that its list, dating to 1966 and pulled from online archives and media reports, may be incomplete. \n72 — Mother Jones magazine, which has tallied shootings since 1982, has one of the highest bars: It counts only shootings in which four or more people were killed and doesn't include shootings tied to drugs, gangs, robberies or domestic violence. \n-- Denis C.
