Data from the ARD represent a national accounting of persons who have died during the process of arrest, including homicides by law enforcement personnel and deaths attributed to suicide, intoxication, accidental injury, and natural causes.\nThis executive summary includes a technical review of the ARD program's methodology and an assessment of the program's coverage of all arrest-related deaths in the United States . It also provides key findings from the comparison of the ARD program to Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) maintained by the FBI. The coverage assessment matched law enforcement homicides captured by the ARD program to those found in the SHR, followed by a capture-recapture analysis to provide information on the scope and characteristics of cases eligible for inclusion in the ARD program that are captured in one or both of these data systems.\nTITLE: Assessment of Coverage in the Arrest-Related Deaths Program (NCJ 249099)\nAUTHORS: Duren Banks, Lance Couzens , and Michael Planty\nWHERE: http://www.bjs.gov\nThe Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Assistant Attorney General Karol V.
