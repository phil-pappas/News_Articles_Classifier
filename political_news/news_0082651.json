Our commitment to his legacy is SC Johnson's mission because our histories are so intertwined.\"\nSC Johnson's association with Frank Lloyd Wright dates back nearly 80 years. In 1936, third generation SC Johnson leader H.F. Johnson Jr. sought Wright. Designs were already in development for the company's new Administration Building, but Johnson wanted a new, more modern approach, even though ground had already been broken and construction was set to start when Wright was brought up as an alternative.\nThe relationship between Wright and Johnson helped define Wright's career as much as it helped to define the SC Johnson global headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin . The first building Wright designed for the Johnson company was the Administration Building, which opened in 1939, followed by the Research Tower, which opened in 1950.\nSC Johnson's Administration Building is the only Frank Lloyd Wright -designed office space still in use today and SC Johnson shares these treasures by offering free public tours of its global headquarters. Reservations are required and can be made at www.scjohnson.com/visit to see the Frank Lloyd Wright -designed Administration Building and Research Tower where iconic brands like Pledge®, Glade® and Raid® were created.\nAbout SC Johnson\nSC Johnson is a family company dedicated to innovative, high-quality products, excellence in the workplace and a long-term commitment to the environment and the communities in which it operates.
