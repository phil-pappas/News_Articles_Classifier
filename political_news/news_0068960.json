Ghanbari) more > By Ben Wolfgang - The Washington Times - Thursday, October 8, 2015 \nThe White House poked fun at House Republicans and mocked former Vice President Dick Cheney on Thursday, admitting that “we’re having a little fun with all of this” as GOP leaders scramble to find the next speaker of the House. \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, California Republican, unexpectedly dropped out of the speaker race Thursday, forcing the caucus to postpone its vote until the successor to Speaker John A. Boehner can be found. \nAdministration officials, while stressing that it’s important for Republicans to choose their next leader as soon as possible, admitted they’re enjoying the GOP’s state of confusion and misery. \nSEE ALSO: McCarthy abruptly withdraws candidacy for House speaker \n“We’re having a little fun with all of this,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. \nHe also took a jab at Mr. Cheney, who earlier Thursday endorsed Mr. McCarthy for speaker, hours before he quit the race. \n“Dick Cheney’s endorsement doesn’t mean as much as it used to,” Mr. Earnest said, smiling and laughing. “I’ve been waiting 45 minutes to use that line. Somebody throw me a bone up here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:57:16.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
