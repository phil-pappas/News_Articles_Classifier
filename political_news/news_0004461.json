With her husband driving, Jennifer plugged in her locally purchased VapCigs \"E-Hookah E-Cigarette Starter Kit\" charger. But as it was charging, the battery exploded, causing several pieces of hot metal shrapnel to disperse throughout the car. The blast ignited Ms. Ries' seat and dress, burning her buttocks and legs, and spilled corrosive materials into her lap. As a result of the accident, Ms. Ries sustained painful second degree burns on her legs, buttocks, and hand.\nMs. Ries's husband then took her to a nearby urgent care, where her wounds were dressed. She was referred to UC Irvine Regional Burn Center, where she obtained treatment for her burns and prescriptions for the pain. She was severely traumatized by the explosion, forever reliving the nightmare caused by the dangerous, defective product.\n\"This industry is unregulated and remains ripe for disaster. Sadly, the industry's carelessness struck Jennifer and changed her life forever,\" said attorney Gregory L. Bentley of Shernoff Bidart Echeverria Bentley LLP. \"We are thankful for the jury's verdict and hope it will jolt the industry to take steps to ensure and test that these products are safe for consumers before they are placed on the market.\"\nThe case is Jennifer Ries v.
