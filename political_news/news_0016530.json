Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (5) In the race for Salt Lake City Council District 2 — which encompasses Glendale, Poplar Grove and Fair Park — it's the old guard versus the young blood. Van Turner, who has spent a lifetime living, working and volunteering in the area, seeks the seat that he held for 12 years before losing it to Kyle LaMalfa four years ago. Turner owns and operates the Hook & Ladder cafe and Firehouse Floral. LaMalfa is not running for re-election. Facing off against Turner is Andrew Johnston, a social worker with Intermountain Healthcare and a six-year resident of the west side. He serves as chairman of the Poplar Grove Community Council. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs Turner said he would emphasize maintenance and improvements to Salt Lake City streets, sidewalks and parks. At the top of Johnston's list is a streamlining of city licensing and other processes to make way for new growth, which he said is ready to \"blossom.\" One of the big issues in District 2 is the proposed closure of the Glendale Golf Course. Turner is adamantly opposed to shutting the 160-acre course. Its proposed closure earlier this year prompted him to run for his old council seat. \"I want to keep golf on the west side,\" he said. \"The neighbors love it, but City Hall doesn't listen.\" He did not favor a proposed $150 million bond, a big chunk of which would have gone to transforming the course into a regional park. The money also would have gone to adding numerous bike and hiking trails around the city and to help spruce up the Jordan River riparian zone. But at the last minute, the council refused to put the bond on the ballot and promised to address the issues again in 2016. For now, Glendale remains a golf course. Meanwhile, the City Council closed the Jordan River Par 3 course and is slated to give Wingpointe back to the Salt Lake City Airport Authority that is looking to shut it down. Johnston said the decision to close some golf courses was a fiscally sound one. But he said he would prefer closing Rose Park Golf Course in Council District 1, rather than Glendale. The golf system must be self-sustaining, he said. Salt Lake City's golf program loses $1 million annually and has racked up about $25 million in deferred maintenance. Johnston is not opposed to a bond for recreation and open space, but he said this year is not the right time to put it before voters. In another big election issue, both men believe Salt Lake City needs more police officers on the street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:08:33.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
