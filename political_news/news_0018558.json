Last summer Ms. McGowan stirred a minor tempest when she called out Hollywood for its sexism, posting on Twitter casting notes she had been sent for an audition, which called for her character to wear a form-fitting, cleavage-baring tank top. Her post went viral — and there were consequences. “My agent fired me,” Ms. McGowan had said at the time. She received high-profile support from Jessica Chastain (in the form of congratulatory Twitter post); Megan Ellison, a film producer; and Holly Marie Combs, who starred with Ms. McGowan in the television series “Charmed.” She also received an invitation to appear on “Good Morning America” to talk about what she called the “systemic abuse of women in Hollywood.” Ms. McGowan, who has raised her visibility by rallying support for women’s rights, has extended her purview to include issues of racism. “My America is not what I saw last night” she wrote in an email. “I have seven brothers and sisters, all with very diverse jobs and lives. “I was raised by a hard working single mother,” she continued “I’ve lived in many states, worked in more.” She added, pointedly: “I’ve lived on a street that’s mixed racially. I can pretty much guarantee that not a politician in that room last night does. What a pity they might learn something. “ Ms. McGowan had been invited to speak Monday on a panel of actors, which included Wayne Knight and Dean Norris of “Breaking Bad,” about how storytelling techniques can apply to politics. But No Labels abruptly disinvited her after her comments on Sunday night, according to CNN. Was she contrite? “I did what I had to do, and left,” Ms. McGowan wrote, without confirming the report. “The other actors there are tremendous artists and people. I hope they are listened to.” Correction: October 13, 2015 \nAn earlier version of this article misspelled a “Breaking Bad” actor’s first name. It is Dean Norris, not Dan. \nFollow our fashion and lifestyle coverage on any of these accounts: Styles on Facebook , Modern Love on Facebook , Styles , Fashion and Vows on Twitter and Fashion on Instagram .
