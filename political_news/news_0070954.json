Footage of this whole thing went viral which forced the Douglasville Police Department and the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office to take action and investigate. This past Friday (Oct. 9) the Grand Jury indicted 15 Respect the Flag members on “charges they violated Georgia’s Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act” and “terrorist threats.” Two of the members were also reportedly charged with battery for a separate incident that occurred the same day at a nearby gas station according to Complex. The video is on the link as well so you can watch it. This is just absolutely disgusting.
