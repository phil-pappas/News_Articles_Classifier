The farming, agriculture and horticulture sectors along with the tourist sector are vital to this country’s economic and social wellbeing. \n“Good broadband is something that people in urban areas expect and rural communities and the people working within them are no different. Whether it’s the rural medical centre, farm, business or school, rural people expect to be connected to the rest of New Zealand and indeed the world in this day and age.”For more information contact Dalton Kelly, telephone 027 231 0067. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:45:42.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
