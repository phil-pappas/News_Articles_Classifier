The woman, Jessica Mann, of Flushing, Mich. (pictured above with her family), has a life-threatening brain tumor and was advised by her doctor to undergo tubal ligation (get her tubes tied) when she has her scheduled C-section  tentatively scheduled for Friday  as any future pregnancies could be fatal. But the Catholic Genesys Hospital in Grand Blanc refused multiple times to allow the procedure, citing religious directives that the sterilizing procedure is intrinsically evil, despite the fact that it has granted exceptions to patients in the past. This is why I would rather pay the extra fee for a private room at Springhill Baptist than go to St. Vincent North (which only has, and therefore does not charge extra for, private rooms).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:34:02.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
