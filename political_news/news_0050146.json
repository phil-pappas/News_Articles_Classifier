The plan also calls for reforms to Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. \nThe administration says that without congressional action Puerto Rico will face a \"long and difficult recovery that could have harmful consequences for the residents on the island and beyond.\" \nThe administration proposal, if approved by Congress, would give Puerto Rico a way to restructure its $72 billion in debt. On Wednesday, Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank announced it was ending talks with a group of bondholders without reaching a deal on debt restructuring. \nThe administration's plan is scheduled to be presented on Thursday to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico and America's other territories. \nIn addition to debt restricting, the administration said Congress needs to approve reforms to the island's Medicaid program for poor people to provide better access to healthcare and also provide low-income residents of Puerto Rico with access to the Earned Income Tax Credit.
