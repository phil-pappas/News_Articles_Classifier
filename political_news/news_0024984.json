He has spoken about it in interviews, including the emotional toll it could take on his family.\nBiden has been doing well in polls even as an undeclared candidate, though his former administration colleague Hillary Clinton continues to be the front-runner even with him in contention.\nHe faces a number of hurdles should he enter the race, including the calendar, being behind on organization and fundraising, and the harsh spotlight of being a declared candidate as opposed to a sympathetic, grieving public official.\nBiden has said repeatedly he has not made a decision and doesn't lean either way.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:42:37.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
