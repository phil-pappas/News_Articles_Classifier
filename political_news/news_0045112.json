(AP) - Columbia’s city manager says the city hired two Democratic state lawmakers as consultants because of their expertise, not to try to buy influence in the Republican-controlled Legislature. \nThe State newspaper reports (http://bit.ly/1RiI7Fr ) the city has agreed to pay the businesses of Sen. John Scott and Rep. Mia McLeod up to $49,500 each. Both represent areas of Richland County. \nNothing in state law bars a legislator from working for a local government. Both McLeod and Scott disclose their city earnings on state ethics filings. Other legislators also receive income from governments or groups that lobby the Legislature. \nBut the head of a government watchdog group says the practice can cross an ethical line. Common Cause director John Crangle says it’s sometimes difficult to distinguish between a consultant and a lobbyist. \n___ \nInformation from: The State, http://www.thestate.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:00:10.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
