Louie Douvis The Reserve Bank of Australia has cracked the whip at banks, saying their lending standards have not been sufficiently robust and that as a result the mortgage market presents a \"higher than average risk\" to the stability of Australia's financial system.\nIn an unusually tersely worded bi-annual financial stability review, the RBA said investigations by regulators revealed lending standards had been weaker than thought and in some cases breached prudential standards. Several banks had under-reported the amount of lending to property lenders and in some cases banks had breached consumer lending laws aimed at ensuring people only borrow as much as they can afford. \"In particular, poor documentation and verification by lenders in many instances suggests that some borrowers may have been given interest-only loans that were not suitable for them,\" the RBA said.\nWhile similar concerns have been raised before by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, it is the first time they have been raised by the RBA in the context of the security of the entire financial system. While the RBA said was no nationwide problem of oversupply in the housing market, it warned that high levels of new apartments in inner-city Brisbane and Melbourne meant those two areas were reaching the point of oversupply, leading to risks of price falls and potentially property developers going under.\nThe RBA's review comes after Westpac's shock move earlier this week jack up interest rates by 0.2 of a percentage point for the first time in more than three years, a move other banks are predicted to follow to some extent, which could more heat of the property market.\nThe rate hike has sparked predictions the Reserve may cut interest rates next month.\nBut Deutsche Bank economist Phil O'Donaghoe said the RBA's comments on Friday meant a rate cut next month was now less likely. \"The tenor of the financial stability review port leaves us thinking that it would be surprising for the RBA to pour 25 basis points (0.25 of a percentage point) rate cut fuel onto a fire that may still be smouldering,\" he said.\nOver 2000 properties are set to go under the hammer across Melbourne and Sydney this weekend, the two hottest housing markets. Ahead of the bumper number of auctions, the RBA said there were \"tentative\" signs of a turn in sentiment in both cities, citing slower price growth and a run of weaker auction results.\n'Better placed to manage risks' Despite highlighting risks in the property market, which also included poor lending standards, the RBA said the economy was better placed to manage the risks because of bank capital raisings, a recent toughening in credit standards, and the signs of slowing in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.\nThe central bank's comments come after several analysts have also argued prices are close to peaking, including Macquarie economists' prediction of a 7.5 per cent fall from next year.\nDespite risks caused by the heated housing market, the RBA said the evidence suggested household financial stress was \"fairly benign\", even though the rate of unemployment had risen.\nFearful of the risks of a property bust, regulators have been intervening in bank's mortgage businesses. An August customer file review by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission found that found that in 40 per cent of cases, lenders wrongly calculated how much time borrowers had to repay the principal when the interest-only period of the loan ended.\nCiti economist Paul Brennan said RBA appeared \"relatively\" sanguine on property, though it was unfortunate lending standards had not been improved earlier.\nIn a note to clients, Mr Brennan also stressed the fine line for policymakers in trying to cool down housing without sparking a significant slump.\n\"If sentiment turns too much, then this could trigger significant downward pressure on prices and rents that creates potential macroeconomic and financial disruption,\" Mr Brennan said.\nAside from residential property, the RBA said there were rising risks in the major banks' lending to commercial property.\nThe RBA said banks had also become \"increasingly weary of lending to property developers in markets that look oversupplied\".\n\"Speculative demand could lead to an excess increase in construction activity and future supply overhang,\" the RBA said, identifying inner city Melbourne and Brisbane as particularly vulnerable.\nFurther highlighting a softening in sentiment, the Westpac Melbourne Institute's index of whether now is a good \"time to buy a dwelling\" is about 30 per cent from its peak in 2013. The index has fallen especially sharply in NSW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:58:57.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
