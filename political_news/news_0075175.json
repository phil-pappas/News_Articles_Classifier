A newly configured ministry would be attempting to start out as it meant to continue. And an opposition would be prowling for vulnerabilities, anxious to expose any thinness in detail or spin masquerading as substance.\nVoters across the board ... have high expectations of Turnbull, and crucially, they do want him to act. It means Turnbull is already behind the eight ball.\nAmid the early jousting, a couple of questions-without-notice did more than most to define the character of the new Prime Minister's nascent leadership, and the extent to which it has forced changes on his opponents too. Both are works in progress.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time at Parliament House on Wednesday. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nMonday brought a query from the Greens MP Adam Bandt​ which probed the presumed gap between hardline Abbott policies on asylum seekers and Malcolm Turnbull's personal views: \"Prime Minister, will you accept that previous Labor and Liberal governments got it wrong, and will you release all children from detention?\"\nAdvertisement But if it was a softening on asylum seekers that the Greens hoped to uncover, it did the opposite with Turnbull playing an even higher moral card. Yes, the policy was \"tough\", even \"harsh\", but \"people had died\" under previous policies. Offshore detention, third country resettlement, and boat turnarounds, had saved lives.\n\"This is not a theoretical exercise, and I have to say to the honourable member he should reflect very seriously on his own party's conscience on this vital matter\". It was an ominous slap down.\nOn Tuesday, the first of many questions from Bill Shorten on superannuation sought Turnbull's attitude to people on large incomes exploiting tax concessions as legalised tax havens. Here, Turnbull quickly jettisoned Abbott's combative script, which had blithely surrendered billions in future revenue gains simply to free the coalition to wedge Labor as the party of higher tax and class envy.\n\"I've noted the opposition's proposals and we're clearly going to consider those proposals and any other proposals that are made as we review the situation.\" It was a significant concession, coming as it did on the same day that Turnbull would also call off the dogs on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\nBoth moves demonstrate the multiple ways in which the Turnbull administration is busily untying itself from past strictures, disentangling from pointless fights. Turnbull's judgments about what to keep, and what to cast off will be critical to his success.\nOn this, all sides agree, which is why his opponents are attempting to force the pace. Issue by issue, they want Turnbull to choose between appeasing his more conservative base on the one hand, and thereby disappointing voters, or, on the other hand, parading his more moderate/popular views on climate change and social policy, thereby losing his colleagues – as he had in 2009 as opposition leader.\nThis is Turnbull's \"Rubik's Cube\". A puzzle in which he must somehow satisfy four competing ends: First, reunite his riven party room. Second, initiate changes that justify his ascension. Third, reassure a wary electorate that he is not merely Tony Abbott in a better suit (noting that even at 50-50 in this week's Newspoll, that still represents a 3.5 per cent swing against the Coalition). And fourth, reconcile all of the above with the runaway expectations of most voters.\nSo, how significant is this expectation problem? For the first time, its scale can be quantified. Nationwide polling commissioned by The Australia Institute, an independent think tank, shows voters across the board do indeed have high expectations of Turnbull, and crucially, they do want him to act. It means Turnbull is already behind the eight ball.\nTaken from September 28 to October 9, the Research Now poll asked: \"Do you think Malcolm Turnbull should take stronger action in the following areas, even if there is opposition within his own party?\" The question was applied to five key policy fields: humane refugee policies; marriage equality; climate change; renewable energy; extra funding for school education.\nIn every single category, the majority answered yes. More humane policies on refugees registered a 55 per cent approval; marriage equality 61 per cent; climate change 67 per cent; renewable energy 81 per cent; and more money for schools, 76 per cent.\nEven among Liberal voters, support is at or above 50 per cent on each issue. That is, half of Liberal voters think Turnbull could be more humane to asylum seekers – presumably if it could be done without reviving the people smuggling trade.\nOn renewable energy, the desire for \"stronger action\" is 81 per cent, and drops by a mere 6 points when Liberals alone are counted. \"The research shows that Malcolm Turnbull has considerable support, both in the wider community and in the Coalition voter base, to do more on issues like renewables, refugees, equal marriage, and Gonski,\" Ben Oquist, the executive director of The Australia Institute, said.\nIt is no accident that these are the same issues on which Abbott had decided to defy community sentiment. The ANU's Marija Taflaga predicts the shift to Turnbull will place big strains on the party in the short term, but says it might also drag it from the margins on key policies to the centre where elections are won.\nThe PhD candidate, whose research focuses on the Liberals, said: \"The Liberal Party loves a winner and has a long-standing habit of allowing its philosophical image to be symbolised by such leaders. Should Turnbull be successful, this might see the party move on from its awkward mix of neo-liberal economics and social conservatism back to liberalism and a more traditional interpretation of conservatism, more like David Cameron in the UK.\"\nTurnbull, who in the past has been more of a \"me\" than a \"we\" kind of leader, acknowledges the problem, telling his MPs this week that expectations on them were \"enormous\", while also reassuring them that his chief advisers would be his ministers. The shift from the staff-driven Abbott office could not have been clearer.\nMark Kenny is Fairfax Media's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/voters-ready-for-change-under-new-pm-malcolm-turnbull-poll-finds-20151014-gk9h8l.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:27:46.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
