Paul Ryan formally declared his candidacy for speaker of the U.S. House on Thursday evening, pledging in a letter to GOP colleagues, \"We have an opportunity to turn the page.\"\n\"Instead of rising to the occasion, Washington is falling short — including the House of Representatives. We are not solving the country's problems; we are only adding to them,\" he wrote. It is time, he said, \"to start with a clean slate, and to rebuild what has been lost.\"\nRyan will face elections next week in a closed-door House GOP meeting Wednesday and then on the House floor Thursday.\nHis success is assured.\nAwaiting him will be a mess of trouble: a Nov. 3 deadline to raise the federal borrowing limit or face unprecedented default and a Dec. 11 deadline to act on must-pass spending legislation or court a government shutdown.\nDespite initial reluctance, Ryan told colleagues he was excited for the opportunity at hand.\n\"I know you're willing to work hard and get it done, and I think this moment is ripe for real reform,\" he wrote. \"I believe we are ready to move forward as one, united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:55:32.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
