This is a guy that's taken on some really tough situations in New Jersey. He's a great debater, he speaks his mind clearly and forcefully.\" \n\"Jeb Bush as well has an extraordinary record as the governor of Florida, an education governor, a guy who's made a difference there,\" he continued. \"He could be a very strong nominee. John Kasich has done a terrific job in the state of Ohio, rebuilt the economy. You've got four right there that are amazing individuals. And of course, Carly Fiorina has risen dramatically. So, we got some good folks.\" \nTapper pointed out that Romney had omitted Ben Carson, which prompted the guest to begin coughing. \nAfter a short pause to clear his throat, Romney said that he did not know much about Carson. \n\"He's obviously a very gentle and sweet soul who speaks his mind,\" Romney opined. \"And I think people are very drawn to somebody who is so willing to express his views, as he is.\" \nIt's not the first time that Romney has left Carson out of his list of qualified Republican candidates. \nSpeaking at the Washington Ideas Forum last month , Romney named Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Rubio as candidates who could win the presidency. He even included South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in the list, and specifically mentioned Donald Trump as someone who could not win. Carson, however, was excluded from Romney's list of winners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:18.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
