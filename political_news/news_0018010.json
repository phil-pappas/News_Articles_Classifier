In an effort to remain in the series, Beltre had a cortisone shot.\n\"Obviously we want Adrian in there,\" Banister said. \"He's the heart and soul of this ballclub.\"\nAfter going for tests at a hospital, Beltre returned to the clubhouse about an hour after the game and walked gingerly. An MRI confirmed Beltre had a strained back but no structural damage, general manager Jon Daniels said.\n\"We haven't ruled him out of tomorrow's game,\" Daniels said.\nTexas will have Joey Gallo and Ed Lucas travel from their Arizona Fall League team in case Beltre needs to be removed from the roster, a decision that also would rule Beltre out of the AL Championship Series.\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said Donaldson felt light-headed while playing defense in the top of the fifth, forcing the AL MVP candidate to come out of the game.\n\"They check for concussions, and apparently he passed all the tests. So that's good news,\" Gibbons said.\nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings.\n\"That's what we really needed from him,\" Banister said. \"I think he did a great job.\"\nGallardo is 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.\n\"We got in some good hitter's counts and he wouldn't give in,\" Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said. \"He didn't make those mistakes that we capitalize on.\".\nKeone Kela, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save.\nPitching on 11 days' rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts.\n\"I expect to have better results,\" a subdued Price said.\nGibbons said Price was the victim of timely hits by the Rangers.\n\"He wasn't getting hit around. It was just a couple of key hits at some key times that made the difference,\" Gibbons said.\nBlue Jays slugger Jose Bautista hit a solo homer in the sixth, then left with a sore right hamstring after popping out in the eighth and was replaced in right by Dalton Pompey. The Blue Jays said Bautista is expected to play Friday.\nDelino DeShields and Beltre hit RBI singles to give Texas a 2-0 lead in the third. Beltre, injured when sliding into second base as Prince Fielder hit into an inning-ending double play in the first, had difficulty running and was replaced by rookie Hanser Alberto in the bottom of third.\nEdwin Encarnacion's run-scoring infield single cut the deficit in half in the fourth - the first run Toronto scored off Gallardo in three meetings this season.\nPrice hit Odor with a pitch for the second straight at-bat, and Chirinos homered for a 4-1 lead.\n\"I think he relaxed a little bit with the people at the bottom of the lineup,\" Chirinos said.\nPrice hit just three batters all season, none after Toronto obtained him from Detroit on July 30th.\nKevin Pillar doubled home Russell Martin in the bottom half, but Toronto left a runner at third when pinch-hitter Ezequiel Carerra, batting in Donaldson's spot, hit an inning-ending groundouty. Cliff Pennington took over defensively in the sixth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:21:41.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
