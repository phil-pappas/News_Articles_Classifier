Councils that can stump up will be at a real advantage when it comes to getting future-proofed. \n\"It’s our poorest regions that will suffer. This immediately disadvantages councils which are already struggling to deliver for their ratepayers. These regions are also likely to be in most need of improved investment in their broadband. \n\"Once again the government is neglecting regional New Zealand. Amy Adams is cementing the rural/urban digital divide that so concerns small town communities. \n\"Amy Adams is making it up as she goes along. This isn’t good enough for rural New Zealand,\" says Clare Curran. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
