B G Chinis (Retd.) (Left) (Photo: Twitter) New Delhi: The horrific and sad culmination of the story of Aarushi Talwar’s family shook every Indian to the core. The dentist couple, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were convicted for the murder of their 14-year-old daughter Aarushi and domestic servant Hemraj. The couple were awarded life sentence. The CBI claimed the sentence was based on 'clinching wealth of circumstances’, which had earlier sought closure, citing lack of sufficient evidence.\nNupur Talwar is now a jail teacher while Rajesh works as an assistant in Dasna Jail hospital. Since the two of them are highly-educated, the jail superintendent thought the job allotted to them is the best for them as per their qualification.\nA Facebook page named, 'Free The Talwars' recently shared a post and claimed that this was the first time Aarushi's grandfather opened up about the case. The page also shared Aarushi's grandfather's plea in an open letter.\nAarushi’s grandfather’s letter said :\nA Grandfather’s Plea in an Open Letter\nI had an angel - Aarushi - as my granddaughter who was lovingly brought up at our - her Grandparents' house - since she was born in May 1994. I had seen her blossom into a doe eyed, beautiful, radiant and sparkling young girl who brought into our lives boundless happiness and joy.\nBut the destiny, at its worst, separated us from her just as she turned 14 year old, in a most cruel manner. She was murdered in her own house, in her own bed.\nWhen I saw her lifeless like a doll in her bed, I was numb with unimaginable shock. I could see faces around me with pairs of eyes following me. Some with curiosity, some moist, some with unbelievable blank expression, to fathom what had happened. I saw my daughter Nupur crying copiously and Rajesh - Aarushi's father, moving around aimlessly, not knowing what was happening around.\nThe days passed, with a boorish local police trying to investigate the murder in a disinterested manner culminating into the arrest of Rajesh, and subsequently infamous press briefing by IG Meerut causing unprecedented uproar in the media. UP Police had repeatedly warned us not to talk to as it would adversely impact the case but their motive was otherwise. They wanted to keep us away from the media to hide their incompetence.\nThe media became ferocious with speculative character assassination of Aarushi and her parents. The onslaught was severe. This bizarre circus continued throughout the trial culminating into an astounding judgement declaring Nupur and Rajesh guilty, and sentencing them to life in prison.\nWhen the judgement was pronounced, I literally sank on my knees, eyes overflowing with tears, body and soul completely battered. Destiny had delivered them and us another crushing blow and my world collapsed around me once more.\nAt 83, I do not think that I would be alive to see them out of jail, but I want to die knowing that people will continue to fight against this huge injustice. I feel completely let down by the institutions, by establishments, be they are police, media, CBI or judiciary.\nI am not asking for anything wrong to be done. I am not asking anything more than what is legally due to them. Just as I have protected the country's honour when I was in the air force, is it not their right for a free and fair trial, and restore their honour, or whatever is still left by now? I fought two wars for this country, I served the country with honesty, integrity and utmost dedication, and at this old age, this is what I get in return from every respected institution of this country?\nALL OF US SHOULD PONDER OVER THE FACT THAT IT'S FRIGHTENING EVEN TO THINK WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO NUPUR AND RAJESH. AND IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANY OF US IN THE SOCIETY?\nSometimes I wonder if this is the country I dreamt about, and fought for.\n- Gp Capt.
