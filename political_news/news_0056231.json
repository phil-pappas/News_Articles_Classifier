And it isn’t only because John did not want his pairing with Shruti Haasan to be repeated so quickly after Welcome Back.\nRH director Nishikant Kamat explains, “The Shruti-John pair was one reason for the postponement. My film got delayed because I got busy with Drishyam .”\nThe director offers another reason for the delayed release. “The film requires a whole lot of VFX. We can’t rush through that. Besides another big film Singh Is Bliing was released on October 2.”\nKamat feels biggies clashing at the box-office spells trouble. “We want to avoid any clash. So far, our date (Feb 5) is ours only. But you never know. Another film may decide to jump in to create an unnecessary clash.”\nIs he referring to the way Shah Rukh Khan’s Dilwale has jumped in to give competition to Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani out of nowhere? Avers Nishikant, “Any clash is unhealthy. We’ve happily gone to next year. It gives John and me time to work harder on our film.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:22:50.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
