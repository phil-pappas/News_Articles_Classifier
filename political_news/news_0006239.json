Let us be clear. That's just not true.\" Hillary Clinton said in an interview with MSNBC on Friday that the law was signed as a \"defensive action.\"\n\"I will govern based on principle not poll numbers,\" Sanders said. \"I pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest not the corporate interests.\" He vowed \"not to abandon any segment of American society - whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor or working class - just because it is politically expedient at a given time.\"\nClinton and Sanders sit atop a Democratic presidential field that has effectively pared down to a two-person race for the nomination after Vice President Joe Biden announced this week he would not seek the White House.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who trails both by a wide margin, was reaching for a breakout performance at the dinner. Both Clinton and O'Malley were speaking later Saturday.\nOne hundred days remain before Iowa's leadoff presidential caucuses, and the state Democratic party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner drew a raucous crowd of more than 6,000 activists in what traditionally serves as a kickoff to the Iowa caucuses.\nIt capped a daylong pageant of political activities: Former President Bill Clinton headlined his first rally of the campaign, introducing pop singer Katy Perry at a free concert for Clinton's faithful. Sanders led cheering supporters across a Des Moines bridge in a march that included chants of \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, the oligarchy has to go!\"\nClinton's campaign has been on an upswing this month. She received a boost from Vice President Joe Biden's decision not to run, then put together a grinding, competent appearance before a Republican-led congressional committee probing the deadly 2012 attacks on diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya.\nTwo lesser-known rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, abandoned the race following Clinton's strong performance on Oct. 13 in the first primary debate.\nThe dinner, called the \"J-J,\" was an important showcase for Sanders, a Vermont independent who has drawn large crowds with his calls for a \"political revolution\" to address the gap between the wealthy and the poor.\n___\nOn Twitter, follow Ken Thomas at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC and Catherine Lucey at https://twitter.com/catherine_lucey.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "https://twitter.com/catherine_lucey."], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:59:18.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
