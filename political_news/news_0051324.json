Republicans gave a distorted picture of what diplomats do, and of their own history of investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\nA look at some of the claims in the House hearing Thursday where lawmakers quizzed Clinton, now a Democratic presidential candidate:\n___\nCLINTON: \"I have said repeatedly that I take responsibility for my use of personal email. I've said it was a mistake. I've said that it was allowed, but it was not a good choice.\"\nTHE FACTS: Clinton's assertion that her actions were \"allowed\" is misleading. A better way to put it would be that at the time, it wasn't explicitly prohibited because it wasn't contemplated in the rules that federal officials would do all their emailing about public business outside official email channels. Federal rules did require agencies to preserve records.\nIn 2009, just eight months after Clinton became secretary of state, federal regulations on handling electronic records were updated to say agencies allowing workers to route official email outside the agency system must ensure that those records are preserved in their official email systems. The responsibility for doing that was assigned to the head of each federal agency.\nWhen Clinton was secretary, a cable went out under her name directing employees to \"avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts\" even as she continued doing so.\nIn 2014, after Clinton left the government, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that required any emails sent through personal addresses also be copied to official accounts.\n___\nCLINTON: \"There was a good back and forth about security.\" - On communications between U.S. personnel in Libya and the State Department in Washington, about security needs at the Benghazi compound before the Sept. 11-12 attacks at the compound and a nearby CIA facility that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nTHE FACTS: The independent review Clinton convened after the attacks deeply faulted State Department officials in Washington for poor communication and cooperation as diplomats in Libya pressed for more security and Benghazi grew more dangerous.\nThe Accountability Review Board cited a \"lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership at senior bureau levels\" and \"shortfalls in Washington coordination\" contributing to a \"woefully insufficient\" security force at the compound.\nThe fewer than half-dozen armed diplomatic security personnel at the compound \"were not well served by their leadership in Washington,\" the board said.\nClinton furthermore asserted that personnel in Benghazi were granted many of their requests for security equipment upgrades.\nThe review board, however, said \"Washington showed a tendency to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades\" to a \"profoundly weak\" system.\nAt the same time, Washington officials were \"generally failing to meet Benghazi's repeated requests\" to augment security personnel.\n___\nREP. TREY GOWDY: The Republican committee chairman ridiculed the idea of Stevens \"having to stop and provide public messaging advice to your press shop\" a week after a bomb blew a hole in the compound's wall in June 2012, without injuring anyone.\nGowdy referred to a request from the State Department's spokeswoman at the time, Victoria Nuland, who wrote, according to the chairman, \"We'd like your advice about public messaging about the spate of violence in Libya over the last 10 days.\"\nTHE FACTS: An important part of any ambassador's job is to be the public face of U.S. policy in the host country and to help decide what the U.S. government should say publicly about that country.\nState Department spokespeople receive guidance every day from ambassadors, assistant secretaries and other top officials about their areas of expertise, so that they can most accurately present U.S. policy to the public.\n___\nCLINTON: Asked about the dozens of emails she received from longtime political confidant Sidney Blumenthal, many with reports about developments in Libya, Clinton said his advice was \"unsolicited.\"\nTHE FACTS: Clinton was mischaracterizing some of those exchanges with Blumenthal.\nGowdy asked what she meant by saying his advice was unsolicited.\n\"I did not ask him to send me the information that he sent me,\" Clinton said.\nNoting that Blumenthal had no expertise about Libya, Gowdy read Clinton's emailed responses to some of his reports: \"Thanks and please keep them coming,\" ''Anything else to convey?\" and \"What are you hearing now?\"\nAt that, Clinton revised her description of how their email exchanges unfolded to \"originally unsolicited,\" saying, \"They started out unsolicited, and as I said, some were of interest.\"\n___\nGOWDY: The chairman defended his lengthy probe by arguing that seven previous congressional investigations \"were narrow in scope and either incapable or unwilling to access the facts and evidence necessary to answer all relevant questions.\"\nTHE FACTS: What Gowdy didn't mention: Five of those seven investigations were led and controlled by his fellow House Republicans, who were no pushovers. The other two congressional investigations, led by Senate Democrats, produced bipartisan reports.\nWhile each panel investigated matters under its particular jurisdiction, the mandate was still broad, and underlying facts behind the attacks were explored repeatedly.\nThat's not to say information that emerged after these investigations has been comprehensively explored. Gowdy noted his panel demanded additional documents and was the first to get Clinton's email - kept on her personal server.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Troy Thibodeaux, Ted Bridis, Stephen Braun and Bradley Klapper contributed to this report.\nEDITOR'S NOTE _ A look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don't tell the full story\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:49:50.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
