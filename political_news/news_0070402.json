But of late, the BJP has been luring the Dalits; it is even pampering Dalit leader Jitan Ram Manjh. Not only Manjhi, BJP also worked on Ram Vilas Paswan to win over the Dalits and allay their apprehensions. \nBut Singh’s comments are bound to revive the apprehensions of Dalits, something that the BJP can ill afford. Much will also depend on damage control by the BJP . “It has to act tough against Singh, but that doesn’t look like happening,” said Tiwari. \nWriter and Bihar Legislative Council former member Prem Kumar Mani said Singh’s analogy hasn’t come as a surprise, more than anything else. “It reflects a mind-set worse than animals.” The fact that Jitan Ram Manjhi demanded action against Singh proves the political implications of the ‘foot in mouth’, he added. While opposition parties demanded his ouster for his remarks in which two Dalit children have been killed in Faridabad . “Singh,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra had clarified about the statement. I think we shouldn’t blow it out of proportion.” \nSenior BJP leader and likely CM candidate Prem Kumar, a EBC, said, “The elections were being fought on the development issue. The opposition cannot succeed in its plan to deviate voters from BJP .” */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:25:57.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
