The deals, which date back to 2010 and 2011, led to her former solicitor Christopher Hales being struck off for professional misconduct.\nThe Edinburgh West MP has withdrawn from the SNP whip while the policy probe continues; she was the party’s business spokeswoman. The backbencher denies any wrongdoing and has stressed that she will co-operate fully with Police Scotland’s investigation.\nPromoted stories Meantime, the Law Society of Scotland, criticised for its handling of the inquiry into Mr Hales, has abruptly axed a debate on the timing of a second independence referendum that it had organised at this week’s SNP conference in Aberdeen because of fears that its impartiality could be called into question.\nThe body has strongly denied that a pro-independence campaigner on its staff was involved in a year-long delay in issuing a full report to the Crown Office, which then told police to begin an investigation within six days.\nThe Law Society raised the case twice informally with the Crown Office in December last year and just prior to the General Election in May but did not reveal the names of Mr Hales's clients until after the May poll. It later revealed that it had submitted a report on Mr Hales to the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, now the National Crime Agency, in 2011.\n“When will Scotland be ready for #IndyRef2?\" was due to take place tomorrow in what was set to be the only debate examining a second poll at the biggest gathering in the SNP's history.\nHowever, a spokeswoman explained: \"We were proudly non-partisan during the first referendum. We were concerned about some of the comments made about our fringe event at the SNP conference which made some people call our impartiality into question. That is why we have chosen to cancel this event.\"\nShare article It had been billed that the fringe would \"consider the pros and cons of pledging a new poll in the near or the more distant future.\" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes a second referendum is inevitable but has been reluctant to discuss potential timescales other that predicting Scotland will become independent in her lifetime.\nMr Bridgen was unavailable for comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-14T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:17:40.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
