Related Content Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \nBut the spotlight is largely on two: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \nThe former secretary of state needs to remind viewers of the debate sponsored by CNN and Facebook about why she began the year as the overwhelming front-runner and is best able to take the torch from President Barack Obama. \nSanders has the opportunity to prove to millions of voters why a 74-year-old self-described democratic socialist can take on both Clinton and Republicans. \nThere's also a lot at stake for the three lesser known underdogs, particularly former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, whose stalled campaigns could benefit from an \"all in\" performance Tuesday. \nHere are CNN's six things to watch in Tuesday night's debate: \nCan Clinton flip-flop gracefully? \nHillary Clinton will have to answer for the original sin of politics: flip-flopping. \nClinton came out against the Trans Pacific Partnership last week, when as secretary of state she heralded the agreement as the \"gold standard\" of trade deals. Her critics quickly accused her of shifting positions for the sake of political expediency in both appealing to liberals and creating distance between her and Barack Obama. \n\"Wow, that's a reversal,\" O'Malley, a TPP opponent, said last week. \"I can tell you that I didn't have one opinion eight months ago and switch that opinion on the eve of debates.\" \nClinton has also been accused of doing a course reversal on issues important to the Democratic base, like same-sex marriage and immigration, including whether she supports allowing undocumented people to obtain driver's licenses. She also only recently opposed the Keystone XL pipeline, after months of dodging the question. \n\"The greatest opportunity for these other candidates is going to be to go after her on shifting positions, mostly recently on the TPP trade deal,\" Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, said on CNN Monday. \nThe emails: Will anyone go there? \nClinton has battled, unsuccessfully for months, to overcome the political storm over her private email server. \nThe attacks have been led by Republicans while Democrats have mostly averted their gaze, hoping it would go away. \nIt's a tricky issue for a rival candidate to bring up -- they could risk harming their own support among Democrats by raising the divisive issue. But it's still possible that Clinton's rivals -- perhaps Webb or O'Malley -- will gingerly point to the issue on Tuesday as a way of suggesting that she abhors transparency and scrutiny. \n\"She needs to answer the email questions with transparency and openly,\" Patti Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, said on CNN Monday. She added that Clinton's biggest challenge is to avoid getting \"riled up\" if put on the defensive. \nClinton's campaign has seized on comments by GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that the congressional Benghazi committee was created to hurt her politically, as well as criticisms of the panel by a conservative former staffer. \nDonald Trump: Democrats' favorite punching bag? \nIf Democrats don't attack Clinton, who will they hit? Republicans. Especially Trump, the GOP front-runner whose unorthodox campaign has dominated the 2016 narrative so far. \nLook for the five Democrats on stage to go after Republicans from the start. The wealthy New York real estate developer presents an alluring target, and the more they can tie Trump to the overall Republican Party, the better. \nThe Democratic Party has used some of Trump's unfiltered remarks on everything from immigration to women to paint the GOP with a broad brush and label the party as exclusive and intolerant. \nFeel the Bern \nBy now, Bernie Sanders is used to being the star at the center of the stage. \nHe's drawing tens of thousands of supporters to campaign rallies, and he's become a liberal sensation, inspiring the popular slogan \"Feel the Bern\" among progressive Democrats. He's also giving Clinton a run for her money in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:56:14.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
