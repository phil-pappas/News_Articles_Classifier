(AP) â€” Conservation group Whatcom Land Trust has renewed interest in preserving Governors Point following the cancellation of a bankruptcy auction where the waterfront property south of Bellingham was to be sold.\nThe Bellingham Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1Qksltm ) bids at last week's auction were to start at $3.5 million to raise money for property owner Roger Sahlin 's creditors. Sahlin, whose family has owned the peninsula for decades, filed bankruptcy in May.\nA Land Trust board member, Rand Jack, attended the auction. He says it was called off after the Friends of Chuckanut conservation group was the only one to show up. An attorney representing Sahlin claims Land Trust misrepresented itself at the auction.\nJack says Land Trust is working with Friends of Chuckanut to raise more money for the 125-acre property.\n___\nInformation from: The Bellingham Herald, http://www.bellinghamherald.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1Qksltm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:55:52.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
