As if some of the obscure rules that Brussels lays down won't be picked up instead by British lawmakers. As if any EU financial contribution won't just get spent instead on more outreach workers here. Who are these people? I've not heard of out campaigners promising utopia. Immigration needn't and shouldn't stop. Lawmakers outside the EU will still seek to improve and adapt with society. Outside the EU governments still waste money. The out/leave campaign could succeed in bringing all these issues back within UK control. Control of immigration is achievable outside the EU. The system of lawmaking in the UK has lost primacy to an inferior system. Governments that waste money may not get re-elected, whilst the EU accounts cannot pass their own audits. There is a democratic deficit in the EU compared to the UK which results in the vote or voice of citizens being of variable worth across the EU. Finally as Hollande pointed out to Farage in the EP, staying in the EU isn't a vote for the status quo, it's a vote for ever closer political union. Leaving won't mean utopia, but it could be an improvement. Would the UK join the EU now - it seems unlikely. Why stay in an abusive relationship because you might not get a perfect one?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:02:46.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
