I don't have to share my views about that right now because I think it's important for the American people to make their own decision,\" President Obama said in a press conference Friday. \nThere's been plenty of coverage on when or if President Obama will endorse anyone vying for his job, and he's continued to be, at the very least, coy about the subject for months. \n\"Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?\" asked Savannah Guthrie. \n\"Love 'em both. Good try,\" Obama said in a \"Today\" interview . \nBut it's not uncommon for presidents to hold off on backing a successor at the beginning of the primary process. \nPresident George W. Bush didn't endorse Sen. John McCain until March, and President Reagan didn't even endorse his own vice president until May of election year. \nNo matter when it's done, a presidential endorsement helps a front-runner clinch the nomination. \nDespite McCain's efforts to distance himself from President Bush, the endorsement helped McCain shore up support from conservative Republicans, most of whom were backing other candidates during the primary.

If Vice President Joe Biden joins the race, Obama will be stuck between two figureheads from his administration.
