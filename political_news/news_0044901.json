The party appears to be reaching a nadir after more than 20 years of statewide losses to Democrats — finding few credible candidates willing or able to buck a trend that's only grown more pronounced. \nA rightward shift in the party — on social issues, taxes and the environment — has made it more difficult for moderates with sufficient statewide appeal to win Republican primaries, observers say. And the repeated defeats have created their own inertia: Good candidates who might be tempted to run, Republican leaders say, look at the party's record and are no longer sure it's worth the trouble. \n\"We're at bottom,\" said Jim Pasero, a Republican strategist and consultant. \"I don't know if it can be even less competitive politically than it is now.\" \nRepublicans last held complete control of the Legislature in 2001. Not only that, Democrats have a supermajority — enabling them to pass tax increases with no Republican votes — in the Senate and are just one vote shy in the House. \nRepublicans haven't won the governor's office since 1982. They haven't won any statewide election since 2002, when Gordon Smith was last elected to the U.S. Senate. \nAs of September , the party's share of registered Oregon voters had dropped to 29.7 percent, down from 36 percent in September 2001. Democrats' decline has been much shallower, with 37.8 percent of the electorate in September 2015, compared with 39.2 percent 14 years earlier. \nMoreover, the Oregon Republican Party has endured turnover and infighting in recent years, with fundraising falling off dramatically in the 2014 election. \nThe struggles haven't been without consequence. Richardson couldn't beat Gov. John Kitzhaber last November, despite a brewing scandal that led to Kitzhaber's resignation just three months later. In 2012, the party couldn't muster formal candidates against Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum or state Treasurer Ted Wheeler. \nThe losses have sent a message to potential candidates more comfortable writing checks or unwilling to walk away from thriving businesses. \n\"Business leaders who thought about running as Republicans 10 or 15 years ago don't think about it now,\" Pasero said. \"Things have become too difficult.\" \nParty leaders, working this month to rewrite their platform, acknowledge it's time for soul-searching — and to devise another new approach to salesmanship and recruitment. It's a familiar storyline for a party that's tried, and abandoned, similar efforts in recent years. \nIncreasingly, the party is trying to tie rural economic malaise and the corruption accusations that swamped Kitzhaber to the many years Democrats have gripped or shared power. They're also quietly emphasizing those concerns alongside wedge issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage that have limited the party's support in Oregon's bigger cities and suburbs. \nBill Currier, who was elected the state party's fourth chairman in four years this February, said recent polls have shown voters more and more convinced \"the Republican Party is not identifying well with Oregonians' concerns or values.\" \n\"I don't think that's so much a reality as it is a matter of how we have communicated our values and how the media has portrayed our party,\" said Currier, an information-technology specialist who also serves as mayor of Benton County's Adair Village. \"The Republican Party shares values with more Oregonians than Oregonians themselves realize.\" \nBut the window to land that pitch, with the May primary elections on the horizon, is shrinking. \nOnly a handful of long-shot Republicans have launched statewide campaigns so far, including Salem oncologist Bud Pierce for governor. Once again, no one has filed yet to run for attorney general, despite criticism of how Rosenblum handled the Kitzhaber scandal. \nThat's one reason party leaders hope to see Richardson run for secretary of state and Alley vie for governor. Competitive candidates at the top of the ticket might keep dejected Republican voters from junking their ballots. Their presence might also force Democrats to part with money they'd rather spend elsewhere. \n\"We don't have a candidate for every race. We're certainly working on that,\" Currier said. \"We have some good candidates. But we're definitely restocking the bench.\" \nThe latest effort is taking shape in races for the Oregon Legislature, observers say. Though Republicans lost ground in the House and Senate in 2014, some of the moderate-leaning candidates who won are seen as rising stars willing to work across the aisle. The party hopes to build on that recruitment next year. \nRepublican Rep. Knute Buehler of Bend, who declined to run for governor in this campaign cycle, risked the ire of social conservatives by championing expanded access to birth control pills. Republican Rep. Jodi Hack of Salem teamed with Democratic House leaders to pass an impeachment bill that ran aground only after it hit the Senate. \nThe Legislature has long been a launching pad to statewide posts, lofting most of Oregon's last prominent wave of Republican office-holders: Mark Hatfield, Norma Paulus, Bob Packwood, Vic Atiyeh and Smith. \nBut that pipeline has all but run dry. Democrats, holding or sharing power for more than a decade, occupy leadership posts. Republican lawmakers, increasingly from rural areas, have tacked right. \nThe Legislature's few remaining moderates also find themselves stymied by another political reality. \nModerates are more likely to emerge in the House, which has smaller districts and twice as many members as the Senate. But because House members face re-election every two years instead of four, they must give up their seats to seek higher office. That's a big gamble, given the party's recent history. Meanwhile, the Senate traditionally sees less turnover — further bottling up House members' ambitions. \n\"There's an entire generation of lawmakers who don't have your traditional stepping stones,\" said one Republican political consultant. \"That affects the field.\" \nRep. Julie Parrish of West Linn — another moderate who hasn't ruled out a statewide run someday — said her party can reverse its downward spiral by \"getting quality people\" and showing \"how we govern\" on issues that have polarized the state. \n\"What is our solution for affordable health care? What are our ideas on fixing carbon emissions?\" she said. \"For the right candidates, there's a lot of opportunity.\" \nCurrier said the party needs to work more closely with like-minded organizations — groups pushing issues such as gun rights and pro-business policies — to counteract Democrats' ties to well-funded environmentalists, labor unions and gun-control groups. He also wants to stress the \"daylight\" between conservatives and Republicans in Oregon. \nBut Jim Moore, a political science professor at Pacific University, said the party will continue to lose ground in left-leaning Portland, key to winning the state, without doing more to distance itself from its right wing. \nFifty years ago, Republicans might have claimed candidates such as Kitzhaber, Wheeler and Portland Mayor Charlie Hales. No more, he said, in an era of deeper conservative orthodoxy on taxes, environmental issues and abortion. \n\"The gulf between that reality and the reality of the Portland area,\" Moore said, \"gets deeper and deeper and deeper.\" \n— Denis C.
