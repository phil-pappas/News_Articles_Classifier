These trade agreements will serve as a foundation to catalyze private sector investments from the UAE, as well as government-to-government investments.\nBelize Natural Energy Limited's (BNE) model was integral in making today's historic milestone a reality. \"The signing of the UAE-Belize agreement is a critical step in fulfilling the original vision of native Belizean Mike Usher, who always believed that his country was full of abundant natural resources,\" said Susan Morrice , Chairman and Founder of BNE. \"He also believed that through the BNE holistic business model, the economic benefits of those resources could be shared by all Belizeans and pave the way for a better Belize. Since BNE first discovered commercial oil in 2005, we have always stayed true to that original BNE model and vision. Through BNE director Josh Stewart , who resides in UAE, and the special relationship he has developed with his Emirati partner, Ali al Naqbi , BNE is now in an excellent position to continue to build out its vision.\"\nWith its discovery of oil 10 years ago, Belize shares a similar vision with the vision of UAE's founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed, who believed that the discovery of oil was only the start of the ultimate economic success story for the country. BNE believes that its country can emulate the UAE's vision and prominence in the Middle East , and achieve a similar success story, with the UAE providing the necessary financial and knowledge-based resources to achieve this vision. The BNE vision is an important part of a growing public-private relationship, and the signing of these agreements between the UAE and Belize is the foundation from which the BNE vision for a better Belize will be realized.\nFor more information, visit http://belizenaturalenergy.bz/ .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273307\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273308\n releases/the-united-arab-emirates-and-belize-sign-bilateral-trade-agreements-300153150.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY18263&Transmission_Id=201510012006PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY18263&DateId=20151001", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://belizenaturalenergy.bz/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273307", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-united-arab-emirates-and-belize-sign-bilateral-trade-agreements-300153150.html", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151001/273308", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273308", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151001/273307"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:53:04.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
