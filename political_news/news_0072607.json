Over the next four months, the Project Health wellness program will deliver more than $10 million worth of free health services to multicultural communities with a significant number of uninsured or underinsured individuals across the United States . More than 700 Project Health events will be held at select CVS/pharmacy stores in 20 markets.\n\"Project Health is part of CVS Health's commitment to improve access to health care and ensure that cost isn't a barrier to important preventive services,\" said Troyen A. Brennan, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer of CVS Health. \"Our free health screenings can help identify health concerns or risk factors for participants who may not have access to care otherwise.\"\nProject Health offers an array of free comprehensive health risk assessments, including blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), glucose and total cholesterol screenings. Project Health events are held in multicultural communities where residents disproportionately suffer from certain treatable conditions, such as diabetes.\n\"Over the years, many of the patients we've seen at Project Health events have had abnormal glucose screening results,\" added Brennan. \"In fact, 27 percent of the patients screened in 2014 had abnormal glucose levels that had not been previously diagnosed. That's three times higher than the national average.\"\nTo help customers and patients with diabetes manage their condition, upcoming Project Health events will offer diabetes-specific information and resources to patients. Some events will feature diabetes educators who will be available to provide attendees with one-on-one guidance and support.\nAdditionally, Project Health events will be offering discussions with health plan representatives at select locations, so attendees can better understand the health insurance options available to them in the marketplace.\nProject Health events, held in markets with large multicultural populations, are open to everyone and do not require an appointment. Current locations include:\nAtlanta Charlotte Chicago Dallas-Fort Worth Dayton Detroit Houston Indianapolis Kansas City Las Vegas Los Angeles Miami Milwaukee New Jersey New York City Orlando Philadelphia San Antonio Tampa Washington, D.C. Project Health events are also being held at select CVS/pharmacy stores in Puerto Rico through November as well.\nOnce screened, CVS/pharmacy will help patients through on-site consultations with bilingual (Spanish/English) nurse practitioners or physician assistants who will analyze results and refer patients who require additional medical attention to no-cost or low-cost medical facilities nearby or to their primary care physician if additional follow-up care is necessary. CVS pharmacists will be available to conduct one-on-one medication reviews and answer any questions patients may have.\nSince 2006, Project Health has delivered more than $75 million worth of free health care services to nearly 760,000 people, demonstrating the continuing need for these critical services. As a result, many areas of concern among participants were discovered:\n48 percent were found to be overweight or obese 40 percent had abnormal blood pressure readings 27 percent had abnormal glucose readings 46 percent were found to have abnormal cholesterol levels Project Health events will be held from 2 p.m. â€“ 6 p.m. on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and/or Sundays at select CVS/pharmacy locations, with no appointment needed.
