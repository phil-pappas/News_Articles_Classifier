The seizures stopped when the Sudoku puzzle was discontinued.\nBerend Feddersen of the University of Munich, Germany, and coauthors suggest oxygen deficiency most likely caused some damage to the brain. The patient stopped solving Sudoku puzzles and has been seizure free for more than five years.\n lifestyle health wellbeing seizure Also Read The cup for all seasons Poor quality of life may affect teensâ€™ diabetes management Now, a wall that pees back on you if you dare urinate on it iPosture: Addiction to gadgets can break your back!", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sudoku-552944_640.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/sudoku-552944_640.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151025/lifestyle-health-and-wellbeing/article/puzzling-case-sudoku-induced-seizures", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:58:18.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
