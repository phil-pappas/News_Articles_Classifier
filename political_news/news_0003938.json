The red, white and blue Mustang, emblazoned with the Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) logo is expected to sell for almost $1 million on eBay. The auction will begin on October 16 at 9 pm eastern standard time and will run for ten days. 100 percent of the proceeds will directly go to WWP, in support of its 20 life-saving programs and services, which are offered free of charge to veterans, their caregivers, and families.\nOne such program is the Independence Program (IP) which helps injured service members and veterans design their own path from surviving to thriving. This innovative program is a partnership between WWP and the warrior and their family, uniquely structured to adapt to their ever-changing needs. IP pairs warriors who rely on their families and caregivers because of moderate-to-severe brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, or other neurological conditions with a specialized case manager to develop a personalized plan to restore meaningful levels of activity and purpose into their daily lives.\n\"The support being offered by the Miller family is remarkable,\" said Steve Nardizzi , chief executive officer at WWP. \"We are extremely grateful for their generous donation, which is providing us with the critical resources that we need to honor and empower Wounded Warriors, and make an impact in the lives of the veterans that we serve.\"\nThe Mustang being sold by the Millers was bought in a charity auction in 2012. On a journey that spanned more than 15,000 miles, across 48 States in 35 days, it was signed by the relatives and friends of many Veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to this nation. The total number of signatures, approximately 2,000, include those who were seriously injured, and those who suffered emotional trauma as a result of combat exposure in American conflicts going back to the Second World War. The signatures of several legendary sports figures-including Joe Namath , Bob Griese , and Dan Marino also mark the vehicle.\n\"I was never in the service, but I had a lot of friends who were killed in the line of duty,\" said Jack Miller , owner of the vehicle. \"It's a great charity. Ask Donald Trump and David Copperfield . It's their favorite charity, and I think they're both going to bid on the vehicle.\"\nThe winner of the eBay auction will be given a round-trip flight from anywhere in the continental United States to Jupiter, Florida , where they will be given a personal tour of the museum. Then, the winner will be invited by the entire Miller family to dinner at the first location of the Miller's Ale House, the restaurant chain owned by Claire and Jack Miller .\n\"I have 69 Mustangs, but this Mustang, and the charity auction, means a lot to me,\" said Miller. \"It goes beyond the automobile; it comes from my heart. It's for the soldiers.\"\nAbout Wounded Warrior Project\nThe mission of Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) is to honor and empower Wounded Warriors.
