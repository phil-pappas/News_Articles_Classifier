(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) September 30 at 5:22 PM I was confused by the Sept. 28 Metro article “ Distracted cellphone users walk a dangerous path .” The article implied that cellphones are the largest danger to pedestrians crossing the street, citing an example in which a pedestrian is looking at his or her phone while crossing a street and gets hit by a vehicle making a turn. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which the pedestrian would be at fault for this — turning vehicles must yield to pedestrians. A cellphone in the hand of the driver is a more likely cause of this type of crash. Eliminating right turns at red lights can also reduce these incidents.\nIn its 2013 publication “ Make Walking Safe ,” the World Health Organization lists measures that can be taken to protect pedestrians. In addition to a few suggestions for improving pedestrian behavior (cellphone use is not mentioned), there are many guidelines for addressing driver behavior, road design, vehicle design and land-use planning. In addition to reduction and enforcement of speed limits and laws against driving while intoxicated and, yes, cellphone use among drivers, the WHO suggests promoting “respect for the pedestrian’s right-of-way among vehicle drivers, motorcyclists and bicyclists.”\nWalking is a safe activity. Yes, sometimes people get distracted. But getting distracted on a sidewalk or in a crosswalk shouldn’t result in a trip to the emergency room. Pedestrians aren’t the problem. We need better laws, enforcement and design of our city streets.\nMoira McCauley , Washington\nThe writer is vice president of the nonprofit advocacy group All Walks DC.", "external_links": ["http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/make_walking_safe/en/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:20:57.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
