He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Text smaller Text bigger \nThe chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee several times has balked when asked about the difference between a socialist and a Democrat, shifting attention to the differences between Democrats and Republicans. \nSo a reporter from the Media Research Center gave Debbie Wasserman Schultz another chance, asking her the simple question again backstage before the Democrats’ debate Tuesday. \nMRC reported the Florida representative again “resorted to bashing Republicans for allegedly trying to take health care away from poor people.” \nSee the video of Wasserman Schultz: \nAsked the difference between Bernie Sanders' socialism and Democrats, she said: \"I've said this before. The important focus in this campaign will be between, the contrast between Republicans and Democrats and that difference and that contrast.\" \nShe accused Republicans of talking about kicking immigrants out of the country and taking health care away from 17 million people. \nDemocrats, she said, want to close the wage gap and providing more \"educational opportunities.\" \nWhat do YOU think? What's the difference between Democrats and socialists? Sound off in today's WND poll \nWND reported in August her dodge in response to NBC \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd. \nTodd asked: \"Given that Bernie Sanders is an unabashed socialist and believes in social democratic governments, [he] likes the ones in Europe, what is the difference? Can you explain the difference?\" \nWasserman Schultz's reply: \"You know, Chuck, it's always fun to be interviewed by Chris Matthews and I know that he enjoys that banter. The important distinction that I think we are going to be discussing, I'm confident we'll be discussing during this campaign, is the difference between Democrats and Republicans.\" \nSee the \"Meet the Press\" exchange: \nThe issue had arisen first on MSNBC, when the DNC chief awkwardly struggled to answer. \n“Hardball” host Chris Matthews asked Schultz about the presidential campaign of Sanders, a self-described socialist who is running for president as a Democrat. Sanders belongs to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, or CPC, the largest membership organization within the Democratic Caucus of Congress, currently with 69 declared members, reported WND. \nWasserman Schultz was asked point-blank by Matthews: \"What's the difference between a Democrat and a socialist? I used to think there was a big difference. What do you think it is?\" \nShe tried to dodge the question before then diverting to the bigger chasm between Democrats and Republicans. \nShe then went on to define the Democrats as for-the-people and the Republicans as extremists. \nSee the exchange:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:20:40.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
