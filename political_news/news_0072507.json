Soon after Biden delivered that speech his son Beau died this spring after a bout with cancer.\nJosh Alcorn, Draft Biden, senior adviser said in a statement, \"Nobody has more respect for the Vice President and his family than we do. Obviously we will honor his wishes.\" This was first reported by the Los Angeles Times.\nThe vice president's office declined to comment on the matter.\nDraft Biden had planned to run the spot ahead of the Democrats' first presidential primary debate Oct. 13 and the day after the debate. The vice president is not likely to participate in the debate. While Biden will likely skip Tuesday's debate, some close to him say that he is nearing a decision -- and is leaning towards a White House bid .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:38:03.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
