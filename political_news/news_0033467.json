Trump told CNN's Jake Tapper that he was \"really surprised\" to see his fortunes dipping in Iowa and said he is going to need \"to work a little bit harder in Iowa\" to win back support in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Two polls released Thursday and Friday showed Trump slipping to second place in Iowa with 20% and 19% of support, respectively, while Carson surged to first place with 28% in both polls. \"I've done really well with the evangelicals and with the tea party and everything and I just don't understand the number, but I accept the number,\" Trump said. \"It means I have to work a little bit harder in Iowa.\" Trump retweet insults Iowans While Trump has repeatedly emphasized that he is a \"counter-puncher\" and only attacks other candidates once they've attacked him, his assault on the retired neurosurgeon wasn't a response to anything Carson has said about Trump. In fact, Carson has been one of the only candidates to pull his punches against Trump, repeatedly refusing to criticize the billionaire who maintains his lead in the national polls.
