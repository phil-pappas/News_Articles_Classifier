This is flippant language to use about tragic situations, but the scenario of a small child finding a firearm, being curious about it and accidentally shooting someone, is staggeringly commonabout once a week by the best count. Its a scenario the pro-gun forces never talk about, perhaps because it cant by any stretch be solved by still more guns. According to a recent report in the Washington Post, toddler gun accidents happen on at least a weekly basis, that we know of. Only the most tragic cases make the news, and otherwise, no one is really counting. ADVERTISING Sometimes the toddler is on the receiving end, as in Chicago this past weekend when a 6-year-old killed his 3-year-old brother while playing a game of cops and robbers. Other times, a curious wee tot is the one who fires what he (and it is usually a boy) presumes to be a toy. Two weeks ago, a 2-year-old in South Carolina found a gun in the backseat of the car and shot his grandmother who was sitting up front. . . . Lock up irresponsible gun holders. Make them to the crime for murder that their 6 year old committed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:40:27.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
