Crime is down in San Diego after Proposition 47 reduced six low-level offenses to misdemeanors in California. Crime upticks are occurring in cities across the United States. And California’s jails and prisons had been overcrowded for decades, leading to the early release of people for crimes far more serious than those changed by Proposition 47.\nIn fact, Proposition 47 is credited with reducing crowding, allowing sheriffs to stop the practice of early release for higher-risk individuals. If police want to use newly available jail capacity for low-level offenses again, nothing is stopping them. It is a matter of local policy.\nVoters passed Proposition 47 because our old, one-size-fits-all approach to petty crimes wasn’t working. That was why I, after five decades in law enforcement (including serving as chief of police in San Diego), supported Proposition 47. Our failing state and federal justice systems call out for reform, but these changes will work only if law enforcement adjusts effectively and if we adequately invest in prevention.\nWilliam Lansdowne , Fallbrook, Calif.\n●\nThe article “ In California, leniency’s unintended effects ” left out an inconvenient truth: For decades, our justice system has had a revolving door in and out of jail and court for people addicted to drugs or with mental illness.\nAs a former prosecutor and retired superior court judge, I have encountered thousands of people similar to the man featured in the article. I never saw any evidence that forcing people into treatment changed their behavior, and incarceration itself can make these conditions worse.\nProposition 47 changed six nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors because we need to get smarter about how we use our justice resources. Law enforcement and courts still can incarcerate people for drug possession and petty theft, but all that has done to date is drive up costs and pause, not stop, behaviors that can be changed through alternative forms of accountability.\nIt is disturbing that attempts to reform a broken justice system are being blamed for the decades-old failures of that system — and decades of underinvestment in treatment and prevention.\nGeorge Eskin , Santa Barbara, Calif.\nThe writer is a consultant for Californians for Safety and Justice.\n●\nWho would have imagined that releasing drug­addicted thieves with the equivalent of parking tickets would result in more drug addiction and thievery? As California “leads” the nation in progressive thinking, the other 49 states and the District need to carefully observe the consequences.\nJohn Stewart , Manassas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:28.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
