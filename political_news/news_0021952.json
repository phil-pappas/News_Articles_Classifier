Hurricane Patricia is going to destroy an awful lot of what is known as the ‘Mexican Riviera’. The area extends from San Blas in the north to Acapulco in the south. In the middle of all that is the area around Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo. Manzanillo is where the Las Hadas resort is where the movie 10 with Bo Derek was filmed.\nHurricane Patricia will destroy places that we have visited and whose memories we love. Because this storm is so powerful the Las Hadas resort will be severely damaged.\nThis is an El Nino year like the first year we spent in Mexico. That year hurricane Linda threatened but did not come our way.\nLinda was also a category 5 storm. We learned a lot from the history of it. We were at anchor but we learned that the strong winds would have killed every one of the people who were waiting at anchor for the storm. No boat and anchor system can withstand the winds and storm surge from a storm of that magnitude.\nPatricia is worse. It is considered to be the strongest tropical storm on record. Patricia will kill Mexican people and non-Mexicans. There are thousands of non-Mexican people, and tens of thousands of Mexican people, who are at risk from this storm. None of them have seen a storm of this intensity.\nPlease pray for those who are exposed.", "external_links": ["http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/o-BO-DEREK-570.jpg", "http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hurricane-linda.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:06:28.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
