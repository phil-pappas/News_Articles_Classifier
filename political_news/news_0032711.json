Today, the export value of products from Côte d'Ivoire – cashew, cotton, cocoa, oil palm and coffee – is $12bn a year. The same can happen in Ghana with our farmers,” he added. \nWith Africa benefitting from “inward investment from the West and from major developing economies, particularly China”, Nana Akufo-Addo added that it is imperative “to put these investments to the right purpose, which is to develop our infrastructure for the long term, diversify the economy, and develop trade within the continent and within its regions.” \nThe over-dependence on the export of raw materials, Nana Akufo-Addo added, has increased, stressing that “it is this dependence that feeds our dependence on foreign aid. We cannot be doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result.” \nIn view of this, and with a clear programme of action for the industrialisation of Ghana – an economic transformation that touches every region of Ghana – Nana Akufo-Addo stated that he “remains optimistic about our future”, adding that “I am proud to be a Ghanaian.” \nIn concluding, he told the gathering that Ghana welcomed “the vigilance, the advice and the assistance of all lovers of freedom as our country continues its journey to prosperity and modernity.” Politics Follow Us \" When a man says he can swallow an axe hold the handle for him\" Translated from Hausa and Yott.
