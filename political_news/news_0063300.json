More N Ireland paramilitaries ‘committed to peace’ \nThe talks in Downing Street will see the two leaders agree to liberalise travel between China and Britain, with Mr Cameron eyeing a bigger share of China’s fast-expanding tourist market. \nBut amid the flurry of deals and extravagant diplomatic talk of a “golden era” in UK-China relations, Mr Xi’s four-day state visit began on Tuesday with a reminder that China’s human rights record still causes concern in Britain . \nWhile Mr Cameron has tried to keep public criticism of Beijing to a minimum, John Bercow, the House of Commons Speaker, made a series of pointed comments aimed at Mr Xi’s authoritarian government. \nWelcoming Mr Xi before the president’s address to MPs and peers at Westminster, Mr Bercow lauded Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese democracy campaigner. Earlier he called India “a great democracy”. \nJeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, said he raised human rights when he met Mr Xi ahead of a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday night but the talks were said to be “cordial and constructive”. More video \nThe Queen used her speech at the banquet to praise Deng Xiaoping’s “visionary concept of One Country Two Systems” for Hong Kong: a reminder of China’s obligations to the former colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. \nMr Xi began his visit to London with a ride in a gilded carriage down The Mall, where pro-democracy campaigners were heavily outnumbered by pro-Beijing supporters, some clad in officially provided T-shirts. \nThe president’s visit to Buckingham Palace was intended to set the tone for a visit which Mr Cameron hopes will establish Britain as China’s number one partner in the west. \nRead more \nThis would see tourists paying just £85 for a two-year tourist visa — the same price as a current six-month visa — instead of the current price of £324. Ministers are also exploring a pilot for a 10-year tourist visa, with unlimited multiple visits, just for China. \nAmong the deals to be announced on Wednesday, Britain will set up a new system of tourist visas for Chinese visitors, who typically spend £2,688 each on an visit, totalling about £500m a year. \nBeijing is expected to introduce a reciprocal arrangement for British tourists. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Britain has doubled in the past five years, from 89,000 in 2009 to 185,000 in 2014. \nMeanwhile EDF and its Chinese partners are planning to build up to three nuclear plants in Britain in the coming years. \nMr Xi said in his Westminster address that he regarded the UK as “the leading offshore renminbi trading centre outside Hong Kong”, a comment that will be warmly welcomed in the City of London. \nHowever, Mr Cameron has also promised to tackle Mr Xi over dumping by Chinese producers of steel on to global markets, seen as one of the causes of the crisis in the British steel industry . \nOver the past decade the UK was the top destination for Chinese capital in Europe, but Mr Cameron wants far greater flows in future. One Hong Kong billionaire, Li Ka-shing, spent more in Britain than all investors from mainland China combined since 2010. \nSteve Hilton, a former aide to Mr Cameron, told BBC’s Newsnight that the UK should impose sanctions on Beijing. \n“One of the worst national humiliations we’ve seen since we went cap in hand to the IMF in the 1970s,” he said of the visit. “China is a rogue state.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:06:24.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
