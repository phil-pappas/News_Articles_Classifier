The gun will be tested for fingerprints and DNA, as well as test fired, to determine whether it is the same gun that was used to shoot Officer Randolph Holder in the head.\n\"That firearm is consistent with the firearm that we were looking for,\" Aubry said.\nThe police also shut down part of a major roadway in the area of the shooting for a few hours Sunday morning as they conducted a ground search.\nHolder and his partner had responded to a report of shots fired near a public housing development in East Harlem on Tuesday night. When they arrived, a man said his bike had been stolen at gunpoint and the thief fled.\nThe officers caught up to a man with a bike on a pedestrian overpass that spans a highway and traded gunfire, police said. After Holder was shot, the gunman ditched the bike and took off, police said. He was caught several blocks away with a gunshot wound to his leg, Bratton said.\nShell cases from the test firing would be compared with discharged cases police recovered on 120th Street next to Holder's body — in addition to the cases at 102nd Street where the first shots were fired, Aubry said.\nThe chief of detectives said the searches were a \"24/7 operation\" since the night of the shooting.\nHe said the scuba team's work was \"very difficult.\" The gun was under 20 feet of water and \"they're on their belly and they're searching for it by hand.\"\nTyrone Howard has been charged with murder and robbery in Holder's death. His lawyer has said there are many missing details in the case.\nHolder's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the name of the police officer killed is Randolph Holder, not Rudolph Holder.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the gun was recovered from the Harlem River, not the East River.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:16:10.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
