Julián Castro, the former mayor of this South Texas city and currently the secretary of housing and urban development, endorsed Clinton at a Latinos for Hillary organizing event Thursday, the first of a series of such events designed to drum up enthusiasm among Latinos beyond the early four voting states. “She has always, always, been there for us,” Castro told the crowd as people waved Hillary signs that read “Estoy Contigo!” (“I’m with you!”) Switching to Spanish, Castro said “la diferencia” between Clinton and the Republicans is that “she respects the Latino community.” Clinton tried a few words of Spanish. “I love being La Hillary,” she said, referring to what signs scattered around the event called her. “But I am not just La Hillary, I am Tu Hillary,” she said, using the Spanish word for “your.” In an interview, Castro, who has mostly avoided politics to focus on his Cabinet position, said he had discussed his endorsement with Clinton last week at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus conference in Washington. Castro “Now that the campaign is getting into gear, I felt like it was time. It’s an added plus to get to do this in San Antonio, my hometown,” he said, adding that the 63 percent Latino city was a “bellwether” for the changing demographics nationwide Castro, 41, has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Clinton should she capture her party’s nomination — a notion she did little to dismiss on Thursday. “I am going to really look hard at him for anything because that’s how good he is,” Clinton said when asked about the vice presidential rumors. She reiterated her position to go beyond President Obama’s efforts to overhaul the immigration system, saying such changes would “boost wages, create jobs and save the taxpayers money.” Clinton also addressed issues like her plans for small businesses, equal pay for women, student debt and affordable child care. She even used the setting — deep in the heart of pro-Second Amendment Texas — to discuss the need for gun control, an issue that led to a contentious exchange with Sen. Bernie Sanders in Tuesday’s debate. The setting served as a nostalgic backdrop for Clinton, who spent time in South Texas when she was a young organizer working to register mostly Latino voters on behalf of George McGovern’s 1972 presidential campaign. “I was a blond girl from Chicago. I hardly knew a word of Spanish but I drove around South Texas and the Valley,” she said. “I made friends of a lifetime, so for me this is personal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:58:02.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
