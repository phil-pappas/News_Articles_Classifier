Paul LePage. \nThe full details of the requests are not yet public and many of the bills are unlikely to receive approval from legislative leadership. But the bills that advance to the upcoming session are likely to be contentious, setting the stage for the 2016 legislative elections. \nThe deadline to submit bill titles was Sept. 25. The Legislative Information Office published a full list of bill requests by lawmakers and agencies on Friday. \n___ \nInformation from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:14:53.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
