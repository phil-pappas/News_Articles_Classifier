Resize Text Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks in Tucson. (Rick Scuteri/Associated Press) By Editorial Board October 12 at 7:33 PM AS THE Democratic Party’s presidential candidates prepared for their first debate Tuesday night, the big story in the campaign was the rise of left-wing populism. Even before Hillary Clinton’s e-mail travails, socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was making surprising headway against the front-running former secretary of state by promising a “ political revolution ” against the “billionaire class,” featuring such crowd-pleasing ideas as a higher top income tax rate, a breakup of “too big to fail” banks, opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a hike in the minimum wage, free college tuition and so on. The net effect has been to push the party’s reigning ideology leftward, since the other candidates’ responses to Mr. Sanders have often been some version of “me too.” \nOurs is more in the vein of “not so fast.” Whether denouncing the influence of big money in politics or decrying the top-heavy distribution of income, Mr. Sanders identifies real issues. His solutions, though, are frequently simplistic or fraught with potential perverse side effects. He wants to raise the top income tax rate from the current 39.6 percent to at least 50 percent ; a new paper by economists at the Brookings Institution shows that that would barely affect income inequality, even if every penny of the resulting revenue were transferred to the bottom 20 percent of households. As for the minimum wage, Mr. Sanders’s plan to make it $15 per hour by 2020 “ could well be counterproductive ,” in the words of economist Alan B. Krueger — a former White House adviser and a minimum wage expert, who thinks $12 would be more like it. \nThere is nothing “progressive” about promising free tuition or expanded Social Security benefits, regardless of need, and regardless of resource constraints in an aging society and slow-growing economy. The real challenge for the country is finding ways to target government assistance where it will do the most good with the fewest unintended consequences. Thus the challenge for Ms. Clinton and her fellow candidates, starting Tuesday night , is to stand up for policy nuance in a party whose voter base seems impatient with it. \nThis is not the same thing as preserving political wiggle room, which is what Ms. Clinton did in denouncing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which she formerly supported) while leaving a few verbal loopholes to reverse course later. What we have in mind is the very idea that the task of governance is reconciling competing public wants and needs with available resources, not validating wish lists. In that sense, Ms. Clinton’s proposed financial regulation reforms , which she offered last week, represented an improvement over her free-trade flip-flop. As opposed to Mr. Sanders’s blanket call to split up the eight biggest banks , regardless of the actual threat they pose to financial stability, Ms. Clinton’s plan would target risk itself and at least give big firms a chance to show that the benefits of large-scale operations outweigh the costs before breaking them up. \nThe candidates who distinguish themselves Tuesday night will be those capable of explaining, persuasively, how they will convert their grand promises into tangible progress. Populism may get votes; pragmatism gets results. \nRead more on this topic:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:17:45.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
