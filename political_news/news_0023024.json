In other words, after each spike subsides, support for gun control is even lower than it was before the shooting.” They don’t think this pattern is inevitable, but for now, “Less support for gun control laws after tragedies is the normal reaction to mass shootings. Not the other way around.”\nIn the wake of last week’s Oregon murders, NBC News sums up the bad news for People :\nwhen you look at the poll numbers Americans are not clambering for gun control, particularly when you look at the number over time…\nGallup has been asking the same question on gun laws since 1990: In general, do you feel that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, less strict, or kept as they are now? And in that time the percentage of Americans calling for the laws to be tightened has fallen sharply .\nIn 1990, 78% of Americans said they believed the laws should be made “more strict.” In 2014, that “more strict” number was 47%. That’s a 31-point drop in support for tighter gun sale laws.\nEvents like this week’s Oregon shooting matter. In the days following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December of 2012, Gallup’s “more strict” number climbed to 58%. But that poll was within a week of the shooting and in less than a year, the number was back down to 49%….\nKevin Drum of Mother Jones with more bad news for his readers who want to believe the people’s will means more gun control:\nI routinely read lefties who Quote: polls to show that the country agrees with us on pretty much everything. Voters support teachers, they support the environment, they support financial reform, they support gun control.\nBut this is a bad misreading of what polls can tell us. There are (at least) two related problems here:\nMost polls don’t tell us how deeply people feel. Sure, lots of American think that universal background checks are a good idea, but they don’t really care that much. In a recent Gallup poll of most important problems, gun control ranked 22nd, with only 2 percent rating it their most important issue. Needless to say, though, gun owners are opposed to background checks, and they care a lot. Most polls don’t tell us about the tradeoffs people are willing to make. In the abstract, sure, maybe a majority of Americans think we should make it harder to buy guns. But if there’s a real-world price to pay how willing are they to pay it? A few months ago, a Pew poll that pitted gun control against gun rights found that gun rights won by 52-46 percent.", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com//reason/https://reason.com/blog/2014/02/12/why-mass-shootings-havent-ushered-in-a-n", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2375010", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx", "http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/data-shows-why-gun-proposals-are-rarely-acted-n438281", "http://www.people-press.org/2014/12/10/growing-public-support-for-gun-rights/", "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/10/gun-controls-biggest-problem-most-people-just-dont-care-very-much", "http://www.people.com/article/preventing-gun-violence-people-call-to-action-jess-cagle", "https://d1jn4vzj53eli5.cloudfront.net/mc/_external/2015_10/-8.jpg?h=178&#038;w=230", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:10:39.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
