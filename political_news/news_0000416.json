(Michael Holahan/Aiken Standard via AP) \nBEAUFORT, S.C. -- Carly Fiorina may be the only Republican feeling pretty good about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s performance during the marathon, 11-hour Benghazi hearing on Thursday. \nThe Republican presidential candidate jumped at the chance to use Republicans’ inability to pin Clinton with wrongdoing as perhaps the most salient rationale for her candidacy. \nWant a candidate who can stand toe-to-toe with Clinton during a debate? Look no further, the former tech executive told supporters at a town hall meeting in South Carolina on Friday. \n“Until or unless we have a nominee who is prepared to hold her to account during a general election debate,” Clinton will never be “held accountable” for her actions, Fiorina said. “I know every one of you in your heart of hearts cannot wait to see me debate Hilary Clinton.” \nFiorina has made it clear from the beginning of her candidacy that she can serve as a foil to Clinton in the Republican field – even as she battles with Donald Trump and Ben Carson for the outsider mantle. \nClinton’s strength, therefore, is her greatest advantage. \nAnd after two strong debate performances, which catapulted her to greater prominence in a crowded Republican field, some voters consider it a credible argument. \n“She’s right, we sure would like to see her debate Hillary Clinton,\" said Rosie Robson, 67, an undecided voter who called Fiorina a “very good speaker.” \n“I like that idea,” she added, musing “two women debating each other.” Abby Phillip is a general assignment national reporter for the Washington Post.
