Nic Walker Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims has warned he will come down hard on any market collusion between Queensland state-owned generators CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation, which have been accused of pushing up power prices through late bidding in the National Electricity Market (NEM).\nMr Sims – who earlier this year expressed concerns about the Palaszczuk government's proposed merger of the state-owned generators – said he had had discussions with Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt over the power consolidation.\nBut he said the \"ball is in their court\" about whether it will proceed, admitting the ACCC could not stop it.\nThe Australian Financial Review on Thursday revealed the Queensland government had told senior energy executives it was considering scrapping the merger proposal, in part because of alleged price-gouging by the state-owned generators .\nAlthough the Australian Energy Regulator enforces rules in the electricity sector – which have been set by the Australian Energy Market Commission – Mr Sims said the ACCC had the power to act if there was collusion between CS Energy and Stanwell in any late-bidding to push up power prices.\nMr Sims called on energy users to provide evidence to the regulator if they believed there had been collusion or anti-competitive behaviour by the two companies.\n\"Even though they are government entities, collusion is still possible and the misuse of market power is still possible,\" Mr Sims said in an interview with AFR Weekend .\n\"If there is an agreement and it has some anti-competitive affects we can look at it. They have a common owner [the Queensland government], which could make it a little more complicated but if that happens we would take a closer look at it.\"\n Jobs could be threatened It is alleged CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation engaged in deliberate late-bidding in the NEM – in the final five minutes of a half-hourly settlement period – which distorted the market and contributed to higher prices for retail users.\nBoth Stanwell and CS Energy have denied they are involved in late bidding and say they follow the rules set by the AEMC.\nStanwell executives recently told its big clients the $60 billion liquefied natural gas industry in Gladstone has had a \"profound affect\" on supply and demand in Queensland.\nThe price difference for electricity between Queensland and NSW is hurting business and could threaten jobs, according to big energy users.\nEnergy broker and consultant Troy Postle said he believed the late bidding was still happening and some companies were considering laying off workers.\n\"I have had Queensland business customers tell me that this has the potential for them to look at having to reduce employee numbers as they cannot afford to absorb the costs and they can't pass it on to their customers,\" Mr Postle said.\nThe AEMC has proposed tighten rules around late bidding in the NEM, but it is not planning to ban the practice.\nMr Sims said he was still concerned about the lack of competition in the generation sector in Queensland where CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation have a 66 per cent market share.\n\"They have taken on board our concerns, but the ball is in their court to get back to us about their plan,\" he said.\n\"As a state-owned corporation, it's complicated law, but they have it within their powers to do it without our approval. But let's see what they come back with. There are various ways to do things.\"\nThe Palaszczuk government abandoned the former Newman Liberal National Party's plans to sell all five government-owned energy companies. Instead it proposed a merger between the distribution companies, Energex, Ergon Energy and Powerlink as well as between the generators to achieve $150 million in savings.\nMr Pitt on Thursday said the merger proposals were still ongoing, but conceded the final combination and structure was yet to be finalised. A decision is expected before the end of the year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:39:35.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
