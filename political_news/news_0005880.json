(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) By DEB RIECHMANN The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nCongress on Wednesday sent President Barack Obama a sweeping $612 billion defense policy bill that he has threatened to veto over an ongoing battle between Democrats and Republicans about government spending. \nThe Senate voted to approve the measure 70 to 27. \nIf Obama vetoes the defense bill, it would be only the fifth time that has happened in the past half-century. The bipartisan measure has become law every year for more than 50 years. \nThe House passed the bill last week, 269 to 151, with enough Democratic votes to sustain a presidential veto. \nObama says he'll veto it because while it contains all the money he requested, he doesn't like the way Congress did it. The bill increases defense spending by padding a separate war-fighting account with an extra $38 billion. Congress didn't increase money for domestic agencies too as the president wants. \nIf the veto is sustained, Congress would be forced to revise the bill or try to settle the larger budget dispute. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., said the president's desire to veto the bill is \"outrageous\" in the light of national security threats. \n\"I wish I could say it surprised me that President Obama might — for the sake of unrelated partisan games — actually contemplate vetoing a bipartisan defense bill that contains the level of funding authorization he asked for,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"I'm calling on him not to, especially in times like these.\" \nRhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it was a good bill. He cited 60 provisions aimed at helping streamline defense acquisitions. He said other parts of the bill would help the Defense Department keep pace with changing technology, combat cyberattacks and provides key funding for the war in Afghanistan, the fight against Islamic State militants and Ukraine forces fighting Russian-backed rebels. \nBut he said he could not support it because it increases the war-fighting account, raising defense spending by doing an end-run around the spending caps. \nAdding funds to the account for Overseas Contingency Operations complicates defense spending, he said. It does not provide funds for many of the domestic agencies, such as the FBI, Coast Guard, Justice Department, because they remain subject to the spending caps. \n\"Defense budgeting needs to be based on our long-term military strategy,\" he said. \"A one year plus-up\" to the special account does not provide the Pentagon \"with the certainty and stability it needs when building its five-year budget.\" \nAfter the vote, House Speaker John Boehner issued a statement pressuring Obama to sign the bill. \nSen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, called a news conference to try to convince Obama to sign it. \n\"I continue to hope that the president just won't veto it — that there will be sufficient pressures on him that he won't veto,\" McCain said. \nThornberry said he too hoped the president would reconsider his veto, especially in light of the strong votes of support in both chambers. \n\"There has been a total of four vetoes in the past 53 years ... every one of them were because of something that was in the bill, not because of something that was outside the bill, which is the thing that the president is complaining about today,\" Thornberry said. \nBut White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the bill makes use of a \"funding gimmick that some Republicans have called a slush fund, to try to provide for the basic national security of the United States in a way that the president and commander-in-chief finds grossly irresponsible.\" Obama also is upset about provisions in the bill that would make it harder for him to transfer suspected terror detainees out of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba , as part of his plan to close it before he leaves office. \nAmong other things, this year's bill provides: \n—a 1.3 percent pay increase to service members and a new retirement option for troops; \n—authorizes lethal assistance to Ukraine forces fighting Russian-backed rebels; \n—extends the ban on torture to the CIA; \n—authorizes the president's request of $715 million to help Iraqi forces fight Islamic State militants; and \n—authorizes $600 million for the beleaguered U.S.-led program to train and equip moderate elements of the Syrian opposition force, but requires the defense secretary to get congressional approval each time he wants to use money for the program.
