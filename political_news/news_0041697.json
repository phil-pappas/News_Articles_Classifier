Today Auckland Council released its state of the environment report into ‘The Health of Auckland’s Natural Environment In 2015’. \nDelivered by Auckland Council’s Research and Evaluation Unit (RIMU) the report presents a snapshot of the current and potential environmental issues, recent changes, and long term trends. This is the latest scientific data analysis since the previous report issued in 2010. \nIn-depth information is provided on Auckland’s natural environment, with the latest monitoring results outlined across four areas: Climate, Air, Land, and Water. \nDr Megan Carbines, Senior RIMU Scientist, summarises the report’s key findings, saying; \"There have been mixed results since 2010. The report shows that there have been some improvements in our air quality, and localised successes for native biodiversity. Overall, however, there has been a continued decline in marine and freshwater environments.\" \nThe report shows Auckland’s environment continues to face a range of challenges, particularly as the footprint of urban Auckland expands. It is the vision of the Auckland Plan to be the world’s most liveable city; which entails a green Auckland that is beautiful and loved by its people, prosperous and full of opportunity, and recognises the mana of TÄmaki Makaurau iwi and hapu. \nThe Mayor describes the report as an important assessment of our environmental health, and a call to action for those of us who live in and love this place. \"There is only one Auckland, and as we grow we must grow greener\", says Len Brown. \nFull ‘The Health of Auckland’s Natural Environment In 2015’ report available here: www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/stateofauckland \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
