Actually, there is a wind of change blowing through Indian cricket. There's a change of perception (following the change of guard in the BCCI). Everyone watching the game seems to have switched sides especially because there is a different powerhouse in place now. Yesterday (Sunday) was not the first time India lost a game with MS still at the crease. This has happened on many occasions, including the IPL.\nBut his 'finishing' powers are on the wane. Over the past couple of years, he has failed to flourish even when batting first. He gets a base of, say, 280/3 after 46 overs, but fails to score those 40-50 runs in the end. It happened in the World Cup too...\nI personally don't think so. Go back to 2007, 2008. The same media and the same bunch of former players said this about Sachin Tendulkar. Look, there is a period in every player's career when he hits the ball better than ever. But if a former player expects a current player to come up with a match-winning knock every day, then he must be a genius. There is no better benchmark than Sachin. He scored 100 international hundreds. But he batted on 700 occasions. The difference is that when you bat at the end of the innings, it becomes the story of the match. The guys batting at the top get an equal, if not more, number of chances to finish the game. Two years ago, the guy who scored a 150 yesterday (Sunday) was the target of the media. Today, nobody says Rohit Sharma is not good enough. Hawa jab badalti hain, sab usi taraf ho jaate hain (when the wind changes direction, so does everyone else). Anybody who thinks good of Indian cricket must see if Dhoni has looked any fatter in the last six months. Actually, I don't think I have seen him any fitter. This means he wants to play on. So, instead of criticising him, I'd hold on for the man to tell us what he thinks of himself: whether he is good enough or no. If he has lost his ability, then he will be the first person to put his hand up and say 'Guys, I am done'.\nDo you think he should, perhaps, allow Suresh Raina to bat at No. 6 and bat up the order (No. 4) instead?\nIf he bats at No. 4, he will average more than he does now. There are numbers that are good for the scoreboard and there are numbers that really benefit the team. The management decides these things (batting position). It's for the totality of the team. It's not just about MS.\nIn the end, it came down to 35 off 24 and 11 off the last over. But Dhoni couldn't pull it off...\nThat's what I am trying to say. The guy who scores a hundred becomes the best player in the world on that day. The next day he gets criticised again. In the media, we seem to be passing judgments on a daily basis. At least those who have played the game should not do this.\nBut hasn't his ability to hit those free-flowing seem to have disappeared?\nThe same things were said about Tendulkar in 2007, 2008 and 2009. What happened after that? Can anybody explain what he did after that? He won us the World Cup. Nobody remains the same. There are always ups and downs. There's a movement and a lot of people have decided to get together and write stories. My question to you is this: If not MS at No. 6 in limited-overs cricket, then tell me who?", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://profiles.google.com/101061788010040353388/about"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:16:16.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
