Kay Henderson Bobby Jindal \nRepublican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, has appeared at more than 100 events in Iowa this year. So far this month, he’s spent eight days campaigning here. \n“We’re doing town halls,” Jindal says. “Oftentimes we’re the last person to leave. Everybody gets to ask their question.” \nJindal’s campaign or the “super PAC” that’s supporting him so far have staged an event in about half of Iowa’s 99 counties and Jindal is now making an aggressive declaration about Iowa’s Caucuses. It could force Jindal to drop out of the race on February 2, however, if he fails to meet the goal. \n“We’re very, very pleased to see growing crowds. We’re building a movement in Iowa. Our strategy is we’re going to win Iowa,” Jindal says. “…There’s a saying in Louisiana: ‘You go hunting where the ducks are.’ The first votes are cast in Iowa and that’s why we’re spending so much time here.” \nJindal was in Decorah over the noon hour today. He’ll join GOP competitors Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum at a church in Iowa City this evening for a “Jerusalem Call” event, sponsored by the Israel Allies Foundation. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul are also campaigning here in Iowa today.
