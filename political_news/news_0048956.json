Emirati authorities haven't revealed his whereabouts since.\nAmnesty International said in August that bin Ghaith was possibly detained for tweeting about violence in Egypt. Authorities held him for several months in 2011 for \"publicly insulting\" top officials in an online forum, before pardoning him under international pressure.\nHuman Rights Watch said bin Ghaith's situation was consistent with past cases of arbitrary detention by U.A.E.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
