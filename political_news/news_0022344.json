Through an introduction by Feeding America, a donation of more than 3,000 cases of various-sized bottles and packets of Salt for Life will be distributed to individuals and families through the Chicago Food Depository's network of 650 pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, mobile programs, children's programs and older adult programs.\nSalt for Life is Nature's Alternative Salt that, through a special recipe, delivers improved nutrition with an unprecedented 75 percent reduction in sodium, replacing it with potassium, a necessary and generally under-consumed nutrient. Salt for Life is gluten-free, made with non-GMO ingredients, and is Kosher Certified by the Orthodox Union.\n\"Good nutrition is important for everyone regardless of socio-economic status,\" said Peter Kaye , Chief Marketing Officer of Salt for Life. \"Given the prevalence of U.S. diets that are very high in sodium and very low in potassium, in particular among those who cannot always afford nutritious, high-quality food, it was a natural fit for us to make this donation to the Greater Chicago Food Depository.\"\nFeeding America is the nationwide network of 200 food banks that leads the fight against hunger in the United States . The network provides food to more than 46 million people through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs in communities across America.\nThe Greater Chicago Food Depository is a nonprofit food distribution and training center providing food for those in need in Chicago and throughout Cook County , Illinois.\nAccording to leading health organizations – such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) – most adults and children consume more sodium than they need with many consuming more than twice their recommended limit each day. Sodium is essential for life as it is a crucial mineral for the human body, and yet we only need between 180-500 milligrams (mg) per day 1 . For good preventative health management, the WHO, the CDC, and the FDA 2 state that most people should be consuming less than 2,300 mg of sodium per day, though many consume 50% or more than their maximum intake target. At the same time, these same organizations state that most people should consume at least 3,700 mg of potassium per day, yet most consume far less than that. Excess sodium consumption has been shown to cause or elevate numerous chronic health conditions. According to many nutritionists a potassium-to-sodium intake of 2-to-1 may help counterbalance the negative effects of consuming too much sodium. The CDC also emphasizes balancing potassium and sodium and advises that in general, \"people who reduce sodium, who increase potassium, or who do both benefit from having lower blood pressure and reducing their risk for other serious health problems.\" 3\nFor more information on Salt for Life ® , please visit www.saltforlife.com .\nAbout Salt for Life ®\nSalt for Life ® is Nature's Alternative Salt – a blend of naturally-sourced potassium salt from Canada and sea salt from Brazil .
