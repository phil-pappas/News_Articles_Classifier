BALDOR\nAssociated Press JERUSALEM (AP) - The top U.S. military officer is pledging further military cooperation with Israel in meetings with the country's leaders, amid increasing worries about Iranian involvement in the Syria conflict.\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They acknowledged that while the U.S. and Israel differ on the Iran nuclear agreement, the two nations must also deal with malign Iranian activities in the region. The seven-nation nuclear pact formally took effect Sunday, and could eventually provide Iran relief from international sanctions in exchange for constraining its nuclear program.\nNavy Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for Dunford, said the meeting at Netanyahu's residence included discussions about Islamic State extremists, Iranian influence and Iran's ties to Hezbollah.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:53:30.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
