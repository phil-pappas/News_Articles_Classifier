His father, who reached the party venue to pick him up, tried to intervene and was beaten up too.\nRohit, who was a resident of Gurgaon, had gone to attend a friend's birthday party in New Subhash Nagar area on Monday night where over 20 other people were also attending the bash.\nAccording to the police, Rohit went over to the DJ to request a change of music, but the DJ refused to comply and started hurling abuses at him. Soon, the situation escalated and the two got into a fight. Some of the other partygoers, who were drunk, joined the fight and started to attack Rohit and his friend Rahul with hockey sticks. While Rahul escaped with injuries, Rohit could not survive the attack.\nRohit’s father Deepak Bharadwaj in his statement to the police said he was worried that his son had not returned from the party and began to worry. He had called Rohit to ask him where he was and was assured that he would be home soon. But Rohit failed to reach home on time; it was late in the night and he stopped picking up his phone, prompting Mr Bharadwaj to go to the party himself to pick his son up.\nWhen Mr Bharadwaj reached the party venue the attack was still taking place and when he rushed to rescue his son; he too was beaten up by the drunk youth. He was pushed by one of the attackers and he hit his head on the wall and lost consciousness.\nHe told the police that he heard the attackers shout “finish Rohit off”. When he regained his consciousness, his son was lying lifeless on the ground with multiple injuries. Police say they sent a team at the spot after receiving a PCR call at around 12.30am.\nRohit was rushed to Civil Hospital but the doctors declared him as brought dead. The city police have registered a murder case and forensic teams visited the crime scene to gather evidence. The police tried to recover CCTV footage, if any close to the spot to throw light on what had happened, but found that there are no cameras close to the crime scene.\n“He was brutally assaulted and there were multiple injuries on entire body. Death was caused by the head injury,” Dr Deepak Mathur, forensic expert at Civil hospital, said.\nThe police have arrested three suspects in the case and all are in the disc jockeying business. They also recovered hockey sticks and the laptop used by the DJ to play music at the party.\n Killed over music request DJ gurgaon party Crime nation Also Read BBMP to make all payments online from next month 2 cops guilty of custodial death case Sushma Swaraj hits back at journalist who raked up propriety issue Now, Nehru’s BJP’s ‘hero’", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Dj-console_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Dj-console_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-crime/article/youth-beaten-death-over-music-request-party-gurgaon", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:08.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
