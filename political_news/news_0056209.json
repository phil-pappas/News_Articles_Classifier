The sheer skill level and creativity of the two wings are evident every time they touch the puck, and the big man in the center is no slouch, either. Same thing goes for the line of Jonathan Toews, Marian Hossa and Insert Very Fortunate Player’s Name Here. Skill is obvious, talent undeniable.\nBut as for why a trio such as Andrew Desjardins, Marcus Kruger and Andrew Shaw works so well as a shutdown line, well, that’s a little more complicated. Many, if not most, fourth lines are thrown-together hodgepodges of fringe roster players who see the ice a handful of minutes on any given night. But the Blackhawks’ fourth line was arguably their best during their run to the Stanley Cup in the spring, logging significant minutes at significant times against significant opponents — tasked with protecting leads down the stretch and keeping deficits within reach.\nSo what makes a good checking line? A few things, really.\nFirst, there’s a selflessness. Sure, Marcus Kruger would love to get another crack at centering Kane’s line, and he’s got the skill level to do it. Yeah, Shaw was thrilled to skate alongside Toews and Hossa during training camp before Quenneville opted to get the band back together last week. And of course, Desjardins would welcome the opportunity to be more offensive and score more goals.\nBut that’s not their job. In fact their shifts start in their own end about 75 percent of the time. Merely flipping the ice is a challenge and a victory. Any goals scored are mere bonuses.\n“Of course, you want to score goals,” Kruger said. “That’s what you want to do, help the team in that way. At the same time, what we all like the most is winning.”\nNext, there’s a versatility. The Hawks’ fourth line is the ultimate safety net for Joel Quenneville, because all three are centers who also have played on either wing in their careers. Any of them can take a faceoff, and having the lefty Kruger and the righty Shaw means they’re almost never at a disadvantage for a draw, no matter where on the ice it takes place.\nAnd any one of them can play any forward position, allowing them to change spots on the fly. If Kruger gets caught down low, either Desjardins or Kruger can hang back and ably fill his spot in the middle. There’s a freedom of movement that not a lot of lines have.\n“We’re interchangeable in a way,” Desjardins said. “That helps for the defensive part of it.”\nShaw spent most of the last two seasons centering the third line, but his game took off when he moved to the wing. He was far more effective on the forecheck, allowing the Hawks to possess the puck longer and create more scoring chances. Shaw likes playing center, but he knows he’s at his best on the wing.\n“I’ve had both experiences, and last year in the playoffs, I really stepped my game up when I moved back to the wing,” Shaw said. “It just allows me to get in on the forecheck, sustain pucks, and keep everything ahead of me.”\nThe last thing that makes the line so effective is how much pride they take in a job a lot of players wouldn’t want. It’s one thing to accept a defensive, low-scoring role. It’s another thing to embrace it. It helps knowing that your coach values defense above all else, and has a keen appreciation for what you’re doing.\n“I learned a lot after last year, after winning,” Desjardins said. “It takes that kind of stuff to win. Getting the puck out of your end in a key moment when we’ve been hemmed down — that has to be rewarding. … I think it’s a great role to have. You’re put in situations where you really have to mentally be prepared and be consistent. That’s what you want out of a role. It might not be the glamorous, scoring-every-night role, but you’ve got to take pride in your game and take pride in that role.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:10:13.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
