He has been talking with people who have worked with him on previous campaigns, should he take the leap and make a third run for the presidency. \nBiden has been making these calls personally, in the last day and a half - \"it's kind of like the last box you check before you jump in,\" the source told Cordes. Though that timing might suggest that his actions are tied to the Democratic debate this week, it is more the impending deadlines in the states for ballot access that have created a sense of urgency around making a decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:14:03.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
