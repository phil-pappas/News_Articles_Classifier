We need it addressed.”\nGrowing problem: Jamie says action is needed to tackle obesity\nGiving evidence to MPs on Westminster’s Health Select Committee, he said junk food firms had already stopped broadcasting ads during kids TV programmes.\nBut the multi-millionaire businessman and best-selling author called on them to go further by avoiding promoting their products during family shows too.\nJamie, 40, also insisted ministers had not written off a “sugar tax” as a way of tackling the obesity crisis gripping Britain’s youngsters.\nHe said David Cameron was reviewing all the evidence - and urged the PM to be “brave”.\nThe Naked Chef star demanded “honesty and clarity” from food companies, but feared they were reluctant to agree.\n“I don’t believe the industry - particularly the food and drink industry - I don’t think that utter clarity is their main objective because when you inform the British public with good, clear information they make good choices,” he warned.\n“They are not making good choices at the moment largely. I think it’s a major problem.”\nThe internet was “open territory” for junk food giants because it was “not policed”, Jamie said.\nPA Is that a yes from them? Jamie Oliver says there should be no junk food ads during Britain's Got Talent\nAnd top of his “shopping list” of demands for reform was the crackdown on TV adverts.\n“You can watch Britain’s Got Talent and there will be up to 13 advertisement for unhealthy food within that time. Under the circumstances, it’s inappropriate,” he rapped.\nJamie handed MPs drinks where he had altered the labels to make sugar levels clearer .\nHe said he had worked out how many teaspoons of sugar were in each drink, including 14 teaspoons in a bottle of Pepsi and 13 in a bottle of Ribena.\n“The reason industry do not want you to have that is that the impact is visceral,” he said.\nThe chef suggested a three-year sugar tax should be introduced to cut down on youngsters guzzling pop.\n“We should implement a three-year sugary drink tax of 20% per litre, which is seven pence on a regular can of soda,” he said.\n“I’m fully confident that the narrative of benefit to British children would be clear as a bell. But I also realise that if it wasn’t, it would be removed.”\nHe said obesity was putting a huge strain on the NHS, adding: “Being gentle, being polite is not a way to have a progressive obesity strategy.”\nPoll loading …\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Mirrorpolitics", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/Mirrorpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:34:06.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
