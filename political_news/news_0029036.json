Darell Issa \nConfusion reigns on Capitol Hill as Republicans in the House of Representatives try to figure out who they want to replace John Boehner (Oh.) as Speaker of the House after presumptive nominee Kevin McCarthy (Ca.) abruptly pulled himself from consideration on Thursday. While the Speakership's future is uncertain, Consumer Electronics Association president Gary Shapiro thinks the answer is clear, the next Speaker should be Californian Rep. Darrell Issa. He felt strongly enough about it to write a post on Medium about his reasoning. Gary Shapiro \n\"It's something I believe in passionately,\" Shapiro said in an interview with DC Inno. \"A caretaker Speaker is bat strategy for the Republicans and a bad strategy for the country. Darrell though is fundamentally incapable of sitting there and not trying to solve problems.\" \nProfessional trade groups rarely make the case for particular candidates in cases like these, and Shapiro made it clear that he's speaking as an individual, but he added that he shared the post with the CEA board beforehand and got positive feedback from them. As the CEA represents a wide range of tech and electronics companies, it's not unreasonable to think that they might buy Shapiro's reasoning, even if they can't say so due to not wanting to seem biased. \nShapiro breaks his reasoning down into several factors, but ultimately he thinks that Issa has the bona fides to appease the whole spectrum of the Republican caucus and keep the House functioning while still appealing to the hard-liners in his party. \n\"There's no question that he's a conservative and i think acceptable to the Tea Party,\" Shapiro said. \"And he's also a doer, a creative doer with a history of bipartisanship that's often overlooked.\" \nIssa has been picked out as a favorite of some tech industry groups before. Last year he was picked as one of the winners of the Congressional Internet Freedom Award from the Internet Association, another prominent trade organization. His credentials with the tech world notwithstanding, it's ultimately down to the Republicans in the House to vote on the next Speaker. Issa has expressen openness to the idea, but Shapiro said it may depend on Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wi.) who Issa would bow out for. But if Ryan sticks to his refusal to go for the gavel, Shapiro said the smart choice is Issa. \n\"He's someone who thinks outside the box,\" Shapiro said. \"I guarantee you skilled immigration reform will get through to Obama's desk. He'll work on long-term fixes to problems like that.\" All the tech news in D.C. you need to know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:40:05.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
