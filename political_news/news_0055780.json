The law eliminated the use of national-origin quotas, under which the overwhelming majority of immigrant visas were set aside for people coming from northern and western Europe.\nLatest from Politics Al Gore at the Washington Ideas Forum\nIn the subsequent half century, the pattern of U.S. immigration changed dramatically. The share of the U.S. population born outside the country tripled and became far more diverse. Seven out of every eight immigrants in 1960 were from Europe; by 2010, nine out of ten were coming from other parts of the world. The 1965 Immigration Act was largely responsible for that shift. No law passed in the 20th century altered the country’s demographic character quite so thoroughly. But its effects were largely inadvertent. The law’s biggest impact on immigration patterns resulted from provisions meant to thwart its ability to change much at all.\nThe United States has long struggled to define what it really means to become American and which immigrants qualify. George Washington declared the country was open to “the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions,” but the idea persists that America is a “ Judeo-Christian nation ,” that being a Muslim American is a contradiction in terms , and that some nationalities are inferior to others.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/", "http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_12.html", "http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/09/09/megyn-kelly-interview-ben-carson-kim-davis-jailing-surge-polls", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-fringe-tone-on-islam-shows-a-sharp-turn-since-911/2015/09/10/5a1d6d80-57d9-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:19:07.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
