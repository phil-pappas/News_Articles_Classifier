It also strongly refuted speculation that a pro-independence campaigner on its staff, who served on the committee responsible for passing the case to prosecutors, may have held up the process.\nMs Thomson, who denies any wrongdoing, said she intended to return to front-line politics as quickly as possible in a statement issued through her solicitor. She built a property portfolio by at times purchasing homes from people in financial distress and on occasion immediately selling them on at a substantial profit.\nPrior to the General Election, a series of prominent SNP ministers endorsed her for her record in the private sector, following her role as the head of the pro-independence Business for Scotland campaign group prior to the referendum.\nPromoted stories Alex Neil, the Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, hailed Ms Thomson's \"excellent grasp of the economic picture\" and \"commitment to how business can be used to support social justice.\"\nFiona Hyslop, Ms Sturgeon's Culture Secretary, described Ms Thomson as an \"ideal candidate\" for Westminster due to her \"knowledge of business, and her passion to make Scotland a better place.\"\nAngela Constance, the Education Secretary, praised Ms Thomson's track record during the referendum and said she would make \"an outstanding MP.\" Jim Sillars, the former SNP deputy leader, endorsed her \"commitment to social justice and how we can support the poorest in our society.\"\nAt First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon repeated her claim that her party had no knowledge of Ms Thomson's questionable business practices and said that if \"allegations\" surrounding her were true, they would amount to \"completely unacceptable\" behaviour.\nHowever, speaking following the session the First Minister's spokeswoman repeatedly refused to clarify whether Ms Sturgeon had been referring to possible criminality, after her solicitor was struck off for his role in 13 deals linked to Ms Thomson in 2010 and 2011 and a public ruling raised the possibility that mortgage fraud had been involved, or the practice of buying properties at knock-down prices from people in financial distress. The day before she stepped down from the party, Ms Thomson suggested that homeowners were \"relieved\" to sell her properties at reduced rates as they had been on the market for significant periods of time.\nOn the issue of cabinet members' pre-election endorsements for Ms Thomson, it was claimed they were based on \"the same understanding the majority of people had of her business, that she ran a property business. There was no understanding, no knowledge of the allegations that have been made.\"\nAt Holyrood, the First Minister said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest the SNP would allow a candidate to be put forward for election knowing there were \"serious problems\" over their integrity and hinted that her party's vetting procedures would be reexamined.\nShe said: \"Our vetting procedures as a party are robust but we keep them under review, as I would hope every political party does.\"\nLabour's Kezia Dugdale accused the SNP leader of \"running away\" from Ms Thomson, who was the SNP's Westminster spokeswoman for business, innovation and skills before she voluntarily withdrew from the party whip on Tuesday, meaning she was also suspended from the party.\nShe said: \"What we have here are vulnerable families losing out for the financial gain of others. Vulnerable people were taken advantage of as their homes were snapped up at knock down prices. Thatâ€™s just not right.\n\"I wouldn't expect the First Minister to comment on the specifics of a live police investigation, but this is also a moral matter and we need to be clear that this behaviour is just wrong.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson called on Ms Sturgeon to set out whether Ms Thomson would be welcome back on her front bench at Westminster, regardless of the outcome of police investigations.\nShare article She said: \"These are very serious questions in relation to ethics and morality, especially for a party which so shamelessly regards itself as worldly superior to everyone else.\n\"Surely the First Minister can agree no senior spokesperson should exploit the poor and vulnerable in this way, and that anyone who does has no future in the party.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:13:26.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
