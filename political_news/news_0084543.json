The Big Story: Blacked out The Centre’s window for declarations under the new Black Money Act saw only 638 filings, worth Rs.3,770 crore. This is only 58% of the figure Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared he would recover, during his Red Fort speech on Independence Day.At the time, Modi had pledged to end the “termite of corruption” and said Rs 6,500 crores of black money had been declared since the new Black Money Act was enacted in May.The announcement was, expectedly attacked by the Congress. \"The hollowness of PM Modi's claims has been exposed before the country,\" said Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. \"He said within 100 days, the government would bring back crores in black money. It's a shame that all they have got in 16 months is only 3770 crores.\"The black money promises made by the Bharatiya Janata Party in its manifesto have afforded the opposition more ammunition with which to attack the Modi government using it. “Mr. Modi promised to bring back Rs. 80 lakh crore, within 100 days, Surjewala said. “The biggest promise was Rs. 15 lakh would be deposited in every citizen’s bank account…. Amit Shah now says this was only a jumla (platitude)… On Mann Ki Baat , the Prime Minister says he doesn’t know how much black money is out there. It means the person who misled the nation must apologise.\"However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley denied that there was a shortfall and said that the sum of Rs 6,500 crore mentioned in Modi's speech pertained to the list of HSBC accounts that the government had received from official channels in France and Germany. What finally happened to #Modi 's promise of getting back #BlackMoney stashed abroad. http://t.co/4agjizGoT0 pic.twitter.com/UMlvp3L3b3 — The Telegraph (@ttindia) October 2, 2015 The Big Scroll: Scroll.in on the day’s biggest story Indian black money isn't parked in Swiss bank accounts, as this government seems to think, but right here in India, locked into its real estate .
