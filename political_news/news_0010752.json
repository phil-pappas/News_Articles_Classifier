The speech will be part of a national effort called \"Latinos for Hillary\" that the campaign is launching to coincide with Hispanic Heritage Month. \nThe speech is not the only way Texas is factoring into Latinos for Hillary. Texas is also among several states in which the campaign plans to host \"Latino house parties\" during the first Democratic presidential debate, which is scheduled for Oct. 13 in Las Vegas. And the campaign is dispatching U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro , D-San Antonio, to Nevada two days before the debate to stump for her in the early voting state. \nIn Texas, Clinton will have the opportunity to remind the state's Latinos of her work helping register Hispanic voters in South Texas after graduating from law school. Endorsing Clinton for president on Wednesday, former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis suggested Texans won't forget her early activism in the state come Election Day. \n\"I know that Hillary holds Texas in a very dear place in her heart,\" Davis said, later telling reporters, \" She's been loyal to this state, and I expect that this state's going to be loyal to her.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:02:54.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
