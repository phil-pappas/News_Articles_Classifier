And in more subtle ways, Trump hinted at a contrast between him and Carson as he pointed out that the U.S. needs a strong leader in the face of \"medieval times\" in which ISIS is beheading Christians. \nThe attacks mark an end to the d√©tente Trump and Carson have mutually maintained, though Carson said earlier Friday that he would not respond to incoming fire from Trump. But Trump's unprompted assault could change the tone of their relationship, which was cordial if not friendly during the previous debate, and undermines Trump's claim that he only punches back when attacked. \nTrump also said he did not \"believe\" the results of the Quinnipiac University and Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics polls on Thursday and Friday that showed Carson seizing the lead in Iowa. \n\"I don't believe those polls by the way because both of those pollsters disagree with me,\" Trump said. \"Both of those polling groups do not like me at all and I disagree (with the results).\" \nBut Trump's line of attack on stage veered from what he told Tapper in the interview shortly before taking the stage. \nTrump, in that interview, said he accepted the polls' results, but said he was \"really surprised\" and did not \"understand\" them. \n\"It means I have to work a little bit harder in Iowa,\" Trump said. \nTrump also launched into a fiercer line of attack against Carson in the interview, accusing the retired neurosurgeon of being \"very weak on immigration\" and in favor of amnesty. Carson supports giving undocumented immigrants guest worker status if they come forward and report their presence in the country, but has denied the characterization of his plan as amnesty. \nBut it was Trump's own stance on immigration and the controversial comments he has made about undocumented immigrants that stalked his rally on Friday. \nThree groups of a handful of protesters each disrupted Trump's speech at different moments, sowing unrest at the rally as the crowd broke out into boos and some confronted the protesters. \nHis supporters vigorously drowned out the protesters with boos, cheers and shouts of \"USA,\" \"We want Trump\" and \"Go home.\" \nSome Trump supporters also jostled the protesters and called them \"illegals\" as they were booted from the event by campaign staff, security and police officers. \nWhile Trump took a combative tone throughout the rally as he discussed his slipping numbers in Iowa and slammed the \"lack of leadership in Washington,\" it was his supporters who stepped up in a combative role when protests broke out. \nMindful that past protests have pushed some of his supporters to physical violence, Trump urged the crowd \"don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em\" and pointed out that they were exercising their freedom of speech. \nBut still, some supporters jostled with the protesters, pushing and grabbing them as they were shuffled out of the room. \nTrump's counter on this matter, as always, was in his words. \n\"I'm gonna win with Hispanics,\" he declared. \"I love the Hispanics.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
