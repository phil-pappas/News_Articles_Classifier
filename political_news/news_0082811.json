The company has contended that all of the wastes placed in the stacks were exempt under a law allowing mining wastes not to be treated as hazardous.That facility stopped producing sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid in 1999 and the production units involving those materials were permanently idled in 2005.\nHowever, civil complaints filed in federal courts in Louisiana and Florida on Wednesday outline a variety of practices dating back to 2003 that EPA contends shows the company was improperly classifying acid wastes and other contaminants that are considered hazardous under federal law, and disposing them in the gypsum piles, or otherwise violated federal laws governing hazardous wastes.\n\"EPA issued notices of violations at some, if not all, of the facilities and had our responses, and then we entered into settlement negotiations that lasted for eight or nine years,\" said Debra Waters, director of environmental regulatory affairs for Mosaic in an interview Thursday. She said the settlement between EPA and Mosaic was part of an industrywide crackdown by EPA on fertilizer manufacturers.\nPhosphate rock is mined in Florida and then brought to manufacturing facilities in Florida and Louisiana to be turned into phosphoric acid, and then into phosphate and potash fertilizers.\nThe manufacturing process leaves gypsum as a byproduct, and the material is often placed in ponds to dewater and then moved to stacks, some of which could be as much as 500 feet high.\nIn 2003, 2004 and 2005, EPA inspectors determined that sulphuric acid solutions used in the manufacturing process and other materials that it considered to be hazardous wastes were being added to the stacks, in what the agency said was a violation of federal law.\n\"At Mosaic's eight facilities in Florida and Louisiana, hazardous waste from fertilizer production is stored in large piles, tanks, ditches and ponds; the piles can reach 500 feet high and cover more than 600 acres, making them some of the largest manmade waste piles in the United States,\" said a Justice Department news release announcing the settlement. \"The piles can also contain several billion gallons of highly acidic wastewater, which can threaten human health and cause severe environmental damage if it reaches groundwater or local waterways.\"\nUnder the terms of the settlement, Mosaic will create a $630 million trust fund that will be invested until it grows to $1.8 billion, with the money to be used to cover the future closure of Mosaic's Uncle Sam plant in Louisiana and its Bartow, New Wales and Riverview plants in Florida. Part of the money also will pay for treatment of hazardous wastewater at and long-term care of those facilties and two other facilities that are already being closed.\nMosaic also will spend $170 million on a variety of projects aimed at reducing the environmental impact of its manufacturing and waste management programs at its manufacturing plants.\nThe company also will give the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality $1 million to fund studies on statewide water quality issues, and will spend $1.2 million to clean up an orphaned phosphate site in Mulberry, Fla.\nThe company also pay a $5 million civil penalty to the federal government, $1.55 million fine to the state of Louisiana and $1.45 million fine to the state of Florida, all of which were plaintiffs in the case.\nA consent agreement and complaints outlining the Louisiana and Florida provisions were filed late Wednesday in federal courts in New Orleans and Fort Myers, Fla., and are subject to a 45-day public comment period and approval by the federal courts.", "external_links": ["http://www.justice.gov/enrd/consent-decrees"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:27:43.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
