The battle for Washington's Legislative District 30 features two competitive candidates, a swing district and implications for the balance of power at the State House. \nDemocrat Carol Gregory, a member of the Federal Way School Board, was appointed to the seat in January following the death of Representative Roger Freeman. \n\"I don't start new; I start on the ground running,\" Gregory told KING 5. \nGregory's challenger, first-time candidate Teri Hickel, served as an executive director of the non-profit Advancing Leadership, as well as interim CEO of the Federal Way Chamber of Commerce. \n\"There's a potential for a change, and shifting the leadership to the Republican side will be really healthy for our state. Change is good,\" said Hickel. \nCurrently, the Democrats hold a narrow majority of the State House: 51-47. If that lead is reduced to 50-48, it could only take one Democrat to break party lines and potentially block legislation. \n\"Having a one seat majority limits what you can get passed, because any one member can essentially kill legislation within his caucus,\" said Paul Berendt, former State Democratic Party Chair. \nThe stakes are high, and money is pouring into the race. More than $1 million has been raised in total, across both candidates and independent expenditures. \nTo track money \n\"I suspect it could be one of the biggest spending campaigns we've seen in state history for State House of Representatives,\" said Berendt, who describes the race as one of the most intense and interesting to watch this year. \n\"Historically, (the district) has elected both Democrats and Republicans, and we have two really good candidates running in each party,\" noted Berendt. \n\"I'm not running so that the Democrats can control. I am running because I want to see school funding finished in the state and done properly,\" said Carol Gregory. \"The big issue next session is school funding, and I am very well versed in that. I have a whole career of experience in education. \nHickel counts education funding as a top priority of hers as well. \n\"That's my goal, is to really break down barriers and come up with solutions,\" Hickel said. \"The McCleary situation is important. We have felt what it feels like not to fully fund education here for a long time.\" \nSolving the school funding problem is expected to dominate the upcoming legislative session, as the state continues to receive fines for not fully satisfying the requirements of McCleary. \nThe State Supreme Court found the state in contempt for failing to come up with a comprehensive plan to fully fund education and reduce the overdependence on local levies. Lawmakers have yet to resolve how to solve the funding puzzle. \n\"When I'm out doorbelling, I'll talk to voters, and the they'll tell me, 'please don't' raise my taxes. That's really important to folks here,\" said Hickel. \n\"I think we would all like a revenue neutral plan, but I question whether that will meet the requirements of the Supreme Court,\" said Gregory. \nLearn more about the candidates:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:53:07.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
