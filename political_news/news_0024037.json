As GOP leader, McCarthy immediately was deemed the front-runner and was thought to have more than enough support to win the party nomination in a vote originally set for Thursday afternoon.\nNow, it's unclear whether more candidates will enter the race or whether the field will stand as is, with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., vying for the job.\nThe conservative wing of the party was gravitating toward Webster in the run-up to Thursday's meeting, and some lawmakers suggest he'll get a boost out of McCarthy's withdrawal.\n\"It might enhance Dan Webster's chances. Dan is a man of principle,\" Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., told FoxNews.com.\nWebster won the backing of the conservative House Freedom Caucus before Thursday's meeting.\nBut Chaffetz said he, too, is staying in the race. \"I really do believe it is time for a fresh start. That was the whole genesis of my campaign,\" he said.\nOther candidates could enter in the coming weeks.\nSpeculation immediately will center on Republicans who had put their names forward for other leadership posts. While McCarthy says he's now staying on as majority leader, it was a job Reps. Steve Scalise, R-La., and Tom Price, R-Ga., had been planning to run for.\nScalise was mum Thursday afternoon on whether he'd run for speaker now that McCarthy is out.\nPrice put out a statement backing the idea of a caretaker speaker who can lead through the 2016 election, without stating his own intentions.\n\"Now is the time for our members to come together and have an honest conversation about how we unify our Conference,\" he said. \"The best course would be for us to select a candidate for Speaker who will serve in that capacity for the next 15 months. This would allow the House to complete the business in a responsible manner, providing ample time for everyone's voices to be heard, leading into full leadership elections in November of 2016.\"\nOther candidates initially thought to be in the mix for majority leader, for a short time, were Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. Both opted not to run, but it's unclear whether they might now consider the speaker race.\nMeanwhile, the uncertainty has compelled Boehner to pledge he'll stay in the position until a successor is chosen, though he had planned to resign at the end of the month.\n\"I will serve as Speaker until the House votes to elect a new Speaker. We will announce the date for this election at a later date, and I'm confident we will elect a new Speaker in the coming weeks,\" Boehner said in a statement.\nNames that have been floated for a \"caretaker\" speaker also include Reps. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., and John Kline, R-Minn.\nAnother Republican with a strong base of support, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the party's vice presidential nominee in 2012, swiftly put out a statement saying he would not run for speaker, while saying he's \"disappointed\" McCarthy dropped out.\nPractically speaking, Republicans' overriding interest is to find a candidate who can muster an absolute majority on the House floor in a full chamber vote, originally set for Oct. 29. While McCarthy was likely to easily win the nomination, it was unclear whether he could muster a majority -- of roughly 218 members -- once lawmakers from both parties vote for speaker.\nFor his part, McCarthy said he thinks the party needs a \"fresh face.\"\n\"If we are going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that,\" McCarthy said. \"We've got to be 100 percent united.\"\nDemocrats put the onus on Republicans to sort out the confusion after McCarthy's withdrawal.\n\"It's up to House Republicans to choose the next Speaker,\" Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement.\nFoxNews.com's Cody Derespina and Fox News' Chad Pergram and Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:26:18.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
