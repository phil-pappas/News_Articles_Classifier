He said this was \"the next thing\" after Mr Cobyn adopted his idea for people’s quantitive easing \nHe said he wanted to create that tax was would “discourage people from over consuming”. \nHe said: “That is contentious, that is my belief, so what I have created is the idea of what might be a variation on the financial transaction tax which is a tax on people's bank accounts.” \nJeremy Corbyn has made a firm stand on Trident Photo: Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph \nThe basic rate for the Consumption Tax would start at “well under a per cent” rising to as much as 1.5 per cent as spending increases, with the tax taken monthly from the individual’s private bank account. \nThis would mean that a person spending, say £20,000 a year would not pay any of the tax at all. However it would rise in bands so that someone spending £100,000 a year would pay a set amount of tax, rising to a higher band for those spending over £1million a year. \nMr Murphy said: “If you were spending only £20,000 a year you probably pay no tax at all, if you are spending £100,000 a year you would have a tax charge. If you are spending £1million a year you would have a progressively higher tax charge. \n“What I am interested in is creating a tax system for the 21st century that builds the sort of society that we need now. \n“We have a hopelessly archaic tax called national insurance designed in 1945 which was perfect for the way we worked then and perfect for that time but which no longer meets our purposes. \n“Why doesn't it meet our purposes? It is actually a tax that discourages the creation of new employment.” \nPhoto: Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph \nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has previously signalled that he wants to merge income tax with National Insurance . \nMr Murphy is one of the co-founders of the Tax Justice Network, the campaigning organisation that has been at the forefront of the battle to bring the iniquities of tax havens into the spotlight. \nHis idea for “people’s QE” was picked up by Mr Corbyn as a variant on the Government’s £375bn quantitative easing programme to unblock the credit markets in the depths of recession. \nIt would see the Bank of England printing money to invest in public infrastructure projects, at the same time as boosting employment and economic growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:53:18.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
