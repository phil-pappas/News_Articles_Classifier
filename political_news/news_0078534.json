Mark Chelgren of Ottumwa, a maverick Republican lawmaker who has twice been elected in a heavily Democratic legislative district, says he plans to run for Congress in 2016. \nChelgren told The Des Moines Register Thursday he will seek the GOP nomination in June for the 2nd District seat now held by U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa City. The district generally covers southeast Iowa, including Davenport, Iowa City, Clinton and Ottumwa.. \n\"I don't dislike Dave Loebsack. This is a question of who is better suited to change Washington, D.C.,\" Chelgren said. \"We all agree that Washington, D.C., needs to be changed. But you are not going to do it by following party lines and doing what you are told.\" \nChelgren, who heads an Ottumwa company with 20 employees that manufactures components for wheelchairs, is married with two children and two stepchildren. In the Iowa Senate, he's often clashed with Democrats on a variety of issues, including the state budget, and he's known for closely reading the fine points of legislation and sometimes disagreeing with members of his own party. \nChelgren said he believes both parties - Democrats and Republicans - have a hierarchical system that expects lawmakers to do what they are told. \n\"I have never been that kind of guy. It is my expectation that I want to go to Washington, D.C., and announce very clearly that the people of Iowa, and specifically southeast Iowa, have elected me to come and do what is right,\" he said. \"I want to make sure we get back into the position of where we are respected internationally again and we can focus on policies that create jobs. I have that experience at the local level, and hopefully I can bring that experience to Washington.\" \nChelgren said he plans a formal announcement of his candidacy at 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Airliner Bar in downtown Iowa City. Afterward, he plans to attend the Scott County Republican Party's annual Ronald Reagan Dinner in Bettendorf. He is the first Republican to announce plans to run for the 2nd District seat. Marianette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, was defeated by Loebsack in 2014 in her third try for the seat. \nLoebsack, a professor emeritus at Cornell College, has represented the 2nd District since 2007. He's emphasized job creation and education, and he's been a strong supporter of the Iowa National Guard. The 2nd District tilts towards Democrats in voter registration with 160,000 Democrats to 136,000 Republicans, but 183,000 voters not registered with either party. 42 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1FIv6EE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:04:33.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
