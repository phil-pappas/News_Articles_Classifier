Fine’s call to action was for citizens to educate themselves on campaign finance, participate in events like this one, and to finally vote. \nNext a panel discussion took place, featuring former State Representative Karen Castor-Dentel , Rollins College Professor and WFTV 9 Eyewitness News Political Analyst Rick Foglesong , and Professor Michael T. Morely , Professor at Barry University. The panel was moderated by News Anchor Lauren Rowe . \nFoglesong defined the problem by defining perspectives involving free speech rights. Continuing the courts regulated speech when corruption or quid-pro quo was an issue. Continuing the danger of unlimited contributions are a danger when the integrity of the political system is threatened, saying “That’s the right argument to make”. \nCastor-Dentel described her experience running in a swing district, which made her race high profile and expensive “It is so slimy. The whole process. It has little to do with what your opinions are. It’s like gambling.” she said and continued “It was more like what favor they could offer me. You have lobbyists or people that are paid to be your friends. Now, that I’m not in office, they’re not calling anymore.” She also emphasized how hard it was for the normal person to run for office because of limited resources. \nMorely laid out three separate factors. Actual direct contributions, independent expenditures that allow supporters to express themselves, which he said is at the heart of the first amendment and finally campaign expenditures or when politicians spend the money saying “It’s a bumper stick slogan when you say ‘money isn’t speech’ but when money is facilitating the speech, that is how we communicate. That is how political communication occurs.” \nThe panel fielded questions from the audience regarding television campaigning, ethics, and possible changes to campaign finance law. The main takeaway was education and community awareness. \n“Share what you learn. We all do have a voice” said Rowe in closing.
