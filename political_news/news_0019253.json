Today marks a particularly dark day in this terrible episode. Jason has now been imprisoned the same awful length of time Americans were held during the Iran hostage crisis from 1979 to 1981. One day of unjust imprisonment would have been too many, but 444 days of this treatment is cruel to the extent that it is obscene. The religious leaders of Iran should allow an innocent man to join his family. The government of Iran can take an important step toward improving its standing in the eyes of the world by releasing Jason today. We urge them to do so.''\nContact: Bill McCarren , 202-662-7534 or wmccarren@press.org for the National Press Club\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20080917/NPCLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-press-club-statement-on-jason-rezaian-being-held-444-days-by-iran-300157252.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-press-club-statement-on-jason-rezaian-being-held-444-days-by-iran-300157252.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20080917/NPCLOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20080917/NPCLOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24568&Transmission_Id=201510090932PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24568&DateId=20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:03:19.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
