Johns Hopkins University ended their program because they realized that people who go through with the sex change surgery have a 20 fold increase in suicide rates as opposed to those who don't.\" \nLoudon was mostly likely citing a debunked interpretation of former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Paul McHugh, who claimed that a study launched in the 1970s showed that \"suicide mortality rose almost 20-fold above the comparable nontransgender population\" after reassignment surgeries. \nSlate concluded that McHugh's \"selective reading of the research on transgender experience and mental health presents a hugely lopsided picture of reality — a clear exercise in nudging the data to fit a preconceived bias.\" \nBut Loudon argued that it didn't make sense for a \"bankrupt\" prison system to treat transgender inmates with \"what is essentially a plastic surgery that is very dangerous and playing with lives.\" \nNell Daly, a licensed psychotherapist, pointed out to Doocy that inmates who identified as women were placed at a disadvantage when they were housed in a male prison facility. \n\"You're 13 times more likely to be raped than someone from the general population in prison,\" Daly explained. \nLoudon shot back that transgender inmates needed \"a lot of therapy\" in place of medical treatment. ↓ Story continues below ↓ \n\"The fact of the matter is even if they have the sexual reassignment surgery, their chances of greater depression and suicide are so much higher,\" Loudon said. \"Their chances of recidivism are so much higher that they're going to need additional psychological help anyway. So why not just give that to them instead and not risk their lives with an experimental program?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:19:08.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
