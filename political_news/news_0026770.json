(Wikimedia Commons) Comments Randy Dorn Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction \nWashington schools chief Randy Dorn announced Thursday that he will not run for re-election in 2016. He blasted lawmakers, the governor and the Washington Supreme Court for failing to ensure Washington adequately funds its schools, despite a 2012 court ruling mandating that happen. \nDorn, a former state representative, teacher and principal, was first elected to the top schools job in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. \nHe said in a statement that he will continue to fight for improvements in the state's public schools and their funding. He called for \"a fully funded school system that is consistent with the paramount duty of our state constitution.\" \nIn 2012, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that the state needed to pump a lot more money into schools , perhaps nearly $700 million a year, in order to reduce class sizes, improve teacher pay, create full-day kindergartens and make other improvements. \nThe Legislature has not done so, however. The court last year ruled that the Legislature was in contempt, and in August, it imposed a $100,000-a-day fine until lawmakers find a way to comply with the court ruling. \nDorn has been outspoken about that lack of action, and continued his strong language in his statement Thursday. \n\"I have made no secret of my extreme frustration. Our constitution requires a uniform, amply funded school system. But such a system doesn't exist today, and I see little, if any, progress toward creating one,\" he said. \nSpeaking of Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, Dorn said, \"The governor has never offered a plan for reforming levies and reaching full state funding. Some promising proposals have been introduced in the Legislature, but none have made it even to a committee vote. And the state Supreme Court has yet to impose sanctions meaningful enough to compel the Governor and Legislature to act. \n\"Our students need and deserve vigorous action from adults. But neither the Governor, the Legislature nor the Court have provided that leadership.\" \nA coalition of school advocates filed a similar lawsuit challenging the underfunding of Oregon's public schools. But the Oregon Supreme Court threw it out in 2009, ruling that Oregon's Constitution does not require adequately funded schools, as Washington's does. \nSince 2012, Oregon has had an appointed state schools chief, not an elected one. The first appointed superintendent, Rob Saxton, stepped down in July. Gov. Kate Brown appointed former Salem-Keizer assistant superintendent Salam Noor to the post. \n-- Betsy Hammond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:06:28.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
