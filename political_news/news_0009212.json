The government rejects the charge.\nMilan Knezevic, a top-ranking official of the opposition Democratic Front, which is at the forefront of the protests, said the country was at a historic turning point.\n\"Our message to Milo Djukanovic is ... to answer our democratic speeches and accept the creation of an interim government and organise the first fair and honest elections,\" Knezevic told the cheering crowd.\nMontenegro is a candidate to join the European Union and is expecting an invitation to join NATO. It is scheduled to hold a parliamentary election next year.\nBut Western governments and rights groups remain concerned over the level of organised crime and corruption, which flourished during the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\nBefore the protest, a group of opposition supporters pelted the Albanian embassy with stones in downtown Podgorica, damaging its exterior. Both the Montenegrin government and the Albanian embassy condemned the incident.\nThe opposition movement combines pro-Western parties and pro-Serb elements who cherish close ties between Montenegro and Belgrade. The latter oppose Montenegrin recognition of Kosovo, a majority ethnic-Albanian country which declared independence from Serbia in 2008.\nSource: Al Jazeera And Reuters", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MeGovernment/status/658035293547810816", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Montenegro?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/protesticg?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:57:23.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
