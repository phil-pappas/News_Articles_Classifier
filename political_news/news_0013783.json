Luntz went on to ask the group's front row for a word or phrase characterizing Sanders' performance, and the group threw out plaudits such as \"for the people,\" \"strong\" and \"straightforward.\"\nThe group also praised Sanders for his answer about Clinton's emails, in which he said that Americans are \"sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\"\nIn addition, the group were not fond of former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, both of whom they said shouldn't be at the next debate.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:07.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
