When one reads about the staggeringly low standards for behavior, you don’t know if that means they don’t really care about the moral character of these people… or if hiring and retaining moral degenerates is actually a government goal. \n[ See also, “ DEA Agents Bed Down Drug Cartel Prostitutes .” ] \nHere is the headline at USA Today: “ DEA agents kept jobs despite serious misconduct .” The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has allowed its employees to stay on the job despite internal investigations that found they had distributed drugs, lied to the authorities or committed other serious misconduct, newly disclosed records show. Lawmakers expressed dismay this year that the drug agency had not fired agents who investigators found attended “sex parties” with prostitutes paid with drug cartel money while they were on assignment in Colombia. The Justice Department also opened an inquiry into whether the DEA is able to adequately detect and punish wrongdoing by its agents. Records from the DEA’s disciplinary files show that was hardly the only instance in which the DEA opted not to fire employees despite apparently serious misconduct. Of the 50 employees the DEA's Board of Professional Conduct recommended be fired following misconduct investigations opened since 2010, only 13 were actually terminated, the records show. And the drug agency was forced to take some of them back after a federal appeals board intervened. In one case listed on an internal log, the review board recommended that an employee be fired for “distribution of drugs,” but a human resources official in charge of meting out discipline imposed a 14-day suspension instead. The log shows officials also opted not to fire employees who falsified official records, had an “improper association with a criminal element” or misused government vehicles, sometimes after drinking. \nWhile the reports contained no details about the incidents, on the face of it, “distribution of drugs” is a federal crime—the exact crime that the DEA is supposed to address. If you or I were accused of “distribution of drugs,” we would be put on trial and probably go to jail if found guilty. But these people not only escaped prosecution, but were permitted to keep their jobs combating the same crime that they were accused of committing! \nThese are the kinds of people that have been given authority and power over us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:13:00.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
