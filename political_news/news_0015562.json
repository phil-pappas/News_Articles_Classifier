The survey approaches the issue from the perspective of the suspect, examining access to effective criminal defense, and whether structures and systems exist to enable suspects to effectively exercise these rights.\nThis assessment comes after two decades of dramatic change in criminal procedures across Latin America ; in many countries the process of reform continues. Effective Criminal Defense in Latin America provides an opportunity to take stock of what is working, and what is not. This event will explore the key findings and recommendations of the research though a panel discussion with the authors.\nRSVP\nPlease RSVP to Katalin Omboli: [email protected]", "external_links": ["http://www.dejusticia.org/#!/actividad/2674", "https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e3e9fce9e4e1e6a6e7e5eae7e4e1c8e7f8ede6fbe7ebe1edfcf1eee7fde6ece9fce1e7e6fba6e7faef"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:39:26.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
