The family would be grateful for privacy at this time.\" \nMr Cameron described Lord Howe as a \"kind, gentle and deeply thoughtful man\" who had \"never stopped giving strong and sound advice\". \n\"The Conservative family has lost one of its greats,\" the Prime Minister added. \nMr Cameron said: ``Geoffrey Howe was a kind, gentle and deeply thoughtful man - but at the same time he had huge courage and resolve. \n\"His time as Chancellor of the Exchequer was vital in turning the fortunes of our country around, cutting borrowing, lowering tax rates and conquering inflation. Lifting exchange controls may seem obvious now, but it was revolutionary back then. He was the quiet hero of the first Thatcher government. \n\"He loved his politics and never stopped giving strong and sound advice. George Osborne and I benefited greatly from his wisdom and determination to improve the state of the country. The Conservative family has lost one of its greats. Our thoughts are with his family.\" \nLord Howe became Chancellor after Mrs Thatcher won the 1979 general election, and was a key figure in many of her most controversial economic reforms. \nIn her second term he was made Foreign Secretary, grappling with how to handle dramatic developments in South Africa – and the increasingly thorny issue of Britain's relationship with Europe. \nIn 1989, amid growing tensions with Mrs Thatcher over Europe, he was shifted to the more junior position of Leader of the House of Commons. \nHe was, however, also given the title of Deputy Prime Minister. \nHe resigned in November 1990, shortly after the PM declared that the UK would never join a single currency project. \nIn his devastating departure speech in the Commons, he criticised Mrs Thatcher for undermining policies on economic and monetary union in Europe that were backed by her colleagues and the Governor of the Bank of England. \n\"It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease, only for them to find, as the first balls are being bowled, that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain,\" he declared. \nThree weeks later Mrs Thatcher resigned after failing to prevent a Tory leadership contest going beyond the first round. \nFormer chancellor Lord Lamont said he was ``deeply saddened'' by the news. \n\"He was a truly brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer. Behind the quiet unassuming demeanour there was steely determination, dogged consistency and a sense of direction. \n\"He also had an impish sense of humour. Although he later fell out with Mrs Thatcher, they were for a long period a highly effective partnership, and she could not have succeeded without him. \n\"He was a Tory with a social conscience, who wanted opportunity for all. He was also a great friend and mentor to me for over 50 years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:10:37.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
