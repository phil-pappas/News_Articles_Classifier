Marco Rubio said Friday the White House position on Russian airstrikes in Syria is \"absurd\" and contrary to the reality on the ground.\nThe White House has said that Russia's airstrikes in Syria this week are not targeting ISIS. The administration said the attacks have been \"indiscriminate\" and have included rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's administration.\nAsked about that perspective Friday on Fox News, Rubio said the attacks were actually quite discriminate and targeted.\n\"That's absurd,\" Rubio said of the White House's claim. \"Vladimir Putin is deliberately targeting all the non-ISIS rebels. The more moderate they are, the more he's going to target them.\"\nRELATED: U.S. assesses Syria 'blunder'\nRubio said it was part of a Putin strategy to take out anyone who can oppose Assad -- who Russia supports -- so that the rest of the world has no choice but to accept him.\n\"He's trying to thin out the opposition so that the only opposition left in Syria to Assad is ISIS, and at that point he'll be able to force world to support Assad,\" Rubio said. \"I don't understand why the White House doesn't see it and why the President and his administration don't understand that.\"\nRubio is set to give a foreign policy address on Friday about Russian aggression. He has been showing off his foreign policy credentials on the campaign trail as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nA missing piece of U.S. strategy, he said, is to try to counteract the information warfare that is sowing distrust of America among civilians on the ground, something Putin is strategically taking advantage of.\n\"He's been very cunning about it,\" Rubio said, adding the White House has been \"quite frankly, incompetent about it.\"\nOpinion: Putin's Syria moves leave U.S. looking weak\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:52:26.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
