Once a car has been type ­approved by the manufacturer’s chosen national agency, it can be sold anywhere in Europe. \n“Car makers are able to go ‘type­approval shopping’ around Europe to get the best deals for them,” said Greg Archer, of campaign group Transport & Environment. \n“No one is checking that type approval authorities are doing an impartial or good job and this needs to change,” he added. \nLast month Volkswagen admitted that it had systematically installed software in VW and Audi diesels since 2009 to deceive regulators who were measuring their exhaust fumes. \n\nSince 2005 the VCA – an executive agency of the Department for Transport – has received a total of £84million from “product certification/type ­approval” services, according to a Greenpeace investigation. \nIt said the VCA’s outgoing CEO Paul Markwick, interim chief executive Paul Higgs and chief operating officer John Bragg had held senior positions with major car manufacturers. \nMPs on the Commons select committee on transport will question Volkswagen bosses, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and the VCA’s acting chief, Mr Higgs, over the emissions violations. \nA Department for Transport spokesman said the VCA charged car-makers in order to cover its operating costs and to provide value for taxpayers. \nHe added: “Whilst the VCA charges the industry for its services, its governance framework is set by government.” \nIt claimed there was “a conflict of interest”. A Greenpeace spokesman said: “The Government’s testing regime failed the public. The question is why? \n“Our evidence suggests it’s not actually in the VCA’s interests to catch out the car-makers. Their business model – and it has become a business – is to attract manufacturers to test their cars with them. It’s a conflict of interest.” \nIt said the proportion of VCA income derived from car-makers through type approval work has risen in the last 10 years from 52 per cent to 70 per cent. \nGreenpeace also claimed there was a “revolving door” between the VCA and the car industry .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:55:41.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
