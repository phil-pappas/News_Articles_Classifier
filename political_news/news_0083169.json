Bobby Jindal has attended more Iowa events than almost every other candidates running for president in 2016 -- Republican or Democrat.\nThe Des Moines Register reports Jindal has gone to 100 events in Iowa over 57 days since 2012. Only one presidential candidate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, has done more events than Jindal.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, has done as many events as Jindal -- again around 100 -- but has spent significantly fewer days in Iowa. He's spent 36 days in the state, as opposed to Jindal's 57, according The Des Moines Register .\nPerforming well in Iowa is key to Jindal's presidential campaign strategy. The Louisiana governor is focusing most of his efforts in that state and not traveling as much to New Hampshire, South Carolina or other places that host early primaries.\nThe Des Moines Register has put together a nifty graphic showing how many times each candidate has traveled to Iowa since 2012.
