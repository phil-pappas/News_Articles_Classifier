(Photo: PTI) New Delhi: India on Thursday reacted very sharply to reports of the US mulling a nuclear deal with Pakistan on the lines of Indo-US pact, saying anyone considering a nuke pact should first see Islamabad's proliferation track record.\n\"We have seen these reports and it is not for the first time this issue has surfaced. Whosoever is examining that particular dossier should be well aware of Pakistan's track record in the area of proliferation. And when India got this particular deal it was on the basis of our own impeccable non-proliferation track record.\n\"That is the reason US gave us 123 agreement in 2005 and that is why we got a NSG waiver in 2008. Pakistan's track record is completely different so we hope that will taken into account in making any such decision,\"\nSpokesperson in the External Affairs Ministry Vikas Swarup said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan leaking the nuke technology to countries like North Korea. Khan was one of Pakistan's top scientists and was involved in various scientific programs there until his dismissal in January 2004 by Pakistan government on the evidence provided by the US about his involvement in leaking bomb-making designs and equipment to at least three countries, Iran, North Korea and Libya.\nAhead of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to the US this month, a report in The Washington Post said the US is negotiating a pact on new limits on Pakistan's nuclear weapons and delivery systems, a deal that might lead to an agreement similar to the Indo-US civil nuclear deal.\n\"Pakistan has been asked to consider what are described as 'brackets',\" the report Quote: d a source familiar with the talks between the two countries as saying.

There was an issue of sequencing. We are committed to the Ufa understandings.\"\n\"The understandings are very clear and that is two (Indo-Pak) National Security Advisors are to meet to discuss all issues connected to terrorism. The DG BSF and the Pak Rangers and the DGMOs are to meet to sort out the issues on the border. The firings and disturbance on the border.\n\"And we have told that we are ready for the NSA-level dialogue. Last time Pakistan walked out of it but we are committed to this understanding,\" he said, adding where was a meeting between the foreign ministers as part of the agenda and understanding.\nIt is understood that Pakistan had pushed India for a meeting between their Foreign Ministers as a pre-condition for talks between their National Security Advisors which was turned down by the Indian side.\n US Pak nuclear deal Pakistan nuclear weapons nation Also Read Man falls from hotel window, dies on spot Telangana Chief Minister for more rail terminals Lok Sabha elections: Voting underway in Assam and Tripura amid heavy security, long queues seen Newly appointed Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu focuses on being liable", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/nation-current-affairs/article/pak-us-nuclear-deal-check-pakistans-proliferation-track-record", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Vikas-Swarup_1_1_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Vikas-Swarup_1_1_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:44:31.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
