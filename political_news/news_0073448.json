But this time, a plurality of 42 percent said that they expect Manhattan real-estate mogul, who has never held elected office, to win their party's nomination. And of a list of six top GOP contenders, 43 percent said that he has the best chance of winning next year's general election.\nTrump earned 32 percent from Republicans and Republican-leaning independent voters in the poll, followed by Ben Carson with 22 percent. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio followed with 10 percent, trailed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 7 percent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 6 percent, Carly Fiorina at 5 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 3 percent each and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 2 percent. Other candidates earned 1 percent or less support, with 3 percent having no opinion.\nTrump leads Carson and the rest of the field on key attributes in addition to being seen as the most likely to win it all. Approximately 47 percent said he is the best leader, while a plurality of 32 percent gave him the upper hand on the issues over Carson, at 19 percent. He is also seen as the strongest candidate on immigration, with 39 percent backing him in that regard, and 29 percent said he understands people like them, leading the field over Carson's 19 percent. Meanwhile, a larger share of voters saw Carson as honest (33 percent to Trump's 21 percent) and having a better personality (24 percent to 19 percent). At the same time, Bush leads the field in terms of the candidate voters felt is most experienced for the job, with 31 percent to Trump's 23 percent.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 by telephone, surveying 364 registered Republican voters or independent voters who lean toward the Republican Party with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-leads-expectations-shows-strength-attributes-poll/story?id=34599211"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:08:40.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
