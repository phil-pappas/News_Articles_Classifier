Respiratory Compromise increases patient mortality rates by over 30 percent and hospital and ICU stays by almost 50 percent. The Institute defines Respiratory Compromise as a state in which there is a high likelihood of decompensation into respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or death that could be prevented or mitigated through specific interventions (enhanced monitoring and/or therapies).\n\"Preventing or mitigating decompensation is critical because nearly any patient could be at risk and succumbing quickly to Respiratory Compromise,\" said Tim Morris , MD, President of NAMDRC and Chair of the Institute's Clinical Advisory Committee. \"One minute you have a patient who is doing fine and within a few minutes the patient rapidly deteriorates to a dangerous point of no return. In many cases, if we could detect this deterioration earlier, we could prevent the need for massive intervention.\"\nRespiratory Compromise, which includes respiratory distress, insufficiency, failure and arrest, can occur across numerous clinical scenarios. For example, Respiratory Compromise may appear post-operatively or may be drug-induced by the delivery of a sedative, opioid, or analgesic to patients who were not properly assessed or properly monitored.\n\"In addition to increasing hospital stays and costs, respiratory compromise drastically increases a patient's chances of dying, yet most instances may be preventable,\" said Michael Wong , JD (Executive Director, PPAHS). \"In the past year, several stories about unnecessary deaths due to Respiratory Compromise have made headlines and increased public awareness of this issue, and it's reassuring to see so many members of the medical community join us to seek solutions.\"\nThe Respiratory Compromise Institute will provide education to the medical community and general public. As well, the Institute is strongly committed to supporting a broad range of research that will assist health professionals in identifying useful monitoring and therapies, identifying high, moderate and low risk patients, and crafting educational tools to disseminate research findings.\n\"Bringing about actionable change in clinical practice to reduce the risk of respiratory compromise is the goal of the Respiratory Compromise Institute,\" said Phil Porte (Executive Director, NAMDRC). \"On behalf of our member organizations, the Respiratory Compromise Institute will soon issue a report that reviews the challenges of addressing Respiratory Compromise, as well as the pathway for solutions.\"\nActionable solutions that the group has identified include:\nDeveloping a standardized patient risk assessment tool to identify those at risk for developing respiratory compromise. Requiring electronic monitoring for high-risk patients, including continuously electronically monitoring with pulse oximetry for oxygenation and capnography for adequacy of ventilation, as recommended by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, The Joint Commission, and many other healthcare organizations. Improving continuous training of clinicians regarding the signs and treatment for respiratory compromise. Increasing the understanding and knowledge of medical conditions that precipitate respiratory compromise among all hospital staff. About Respiratory Compromise Institute\nThe Respiratory Compromise Institute (RCI) is a nonprofit group dedicated to improving patient health and safety by reducing the risk of respiratory compromise in varied settings, including the hospital, nursing home and the home. The Respiratory Compromise Institute brings together a broad-based coalition of organizations, companies, and individuals dedicated to reducing-and eventually eliminating-preventable adverse events and deaths due to respiratory compromise.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275014LOGO\n releases/respiratory-compromise-institute-unites-key-medical-societies-to-address-growing-incidence-and-burden-of-inpatient-respiratory-issues-300155968.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb91.jsp", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275014LOGO", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151007/275014LOGO", "http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2013.187.1_MeetingAbstracts.A5304", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG22686&Transmission_Id=201510080900PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG22686&DateId=20151008", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/respiratory-compromise-institute-unites-key-medical-societies-to-address-growing-incidence-and-burden-of-inpatient-respiratory-issues-300155968.html", "http://www.respiratorycompromise.org/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:51:40.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
