(AP) - Albuquerque’s City Council president is expected to propose a measure that goes further in ensuring the second Monday of October each year is recognized as Indigenous Peoples Day during a meeting in which another councilor intends to introduce a motion to censure him. \nBoth Council President Rey Garduno’s push for an Indigenous Peoples Day resolution that would give the counter holiday to Columbus Day more permanence and Councilman Dan Lewis’ motion to censure are on the agenda for Monday evening. \nThe meeting comes a week after Albuquerque officially observed Indigenous Peoples Day for the first time through a proclamation introduced by Garduno. It made Albuquerque one of a growing number of cities to recognize a holiday honoring the history and contributions of indigenous cultures as the U.S. observed Columbus Day. \nThe federal holiday commemorating the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus has evolved over the years into cause for parades and pageantry by those seeking to honor the Italian explorer, and protest by those who argue his arrival to the Americas ushered in centuries of mistreatment of Native Americans. \n“It’s an important step that many cities across the country have taken, and it’s especially important for our city because of its location, proximity, and relationship to the great Native nations of the Southwest,” Garduno said in a statement. \nBut Garduno’s proclamation put before councilors as they gathered for a meeting on Oct. 7 was hastily introduced and included “overtly political” language that read “as a not-so-subtle indictment” of the region’s European forebears, according to documents from Lewis that signaled he would motion to censure Garduno. \nLewis also took issue with public comments from Garduno that criticized councilors who did not sign the proclamation. \nSix councilors signed the document and three did not, including Lewis. He said he recognizes the contribution of Native Americans and likely would have signed a proclamation in recognition of their cultures if he was provided opportunity to suggest changes. \nFor councilors, that opportunity for input will come when the proposed resolution goes before the City Council, Garduno said. Unlike proclamations, resolutions are subject to more lengthy Council discussion and, if passed, must be signed by the mayor before becoming a city ordinance. \n“While I personally stand by the language of the proclamation, I recognize that the City Council, by its very nature, is a place where compromise can result in more unanimous outcomes for the good of the community,” Garduno said. “I look forward to working with my City Council colleagues on that resolution as it works its way through the Council process.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:35:09.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
