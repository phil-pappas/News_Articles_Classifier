Pot hasn’t been studied, tobacco has. And as vile as the tobacco companies are, they do actually know a bit about their product. Pot sellers? They know that their drug gets you high. It mellows you out. It’s a gateway drug, but then again, food is a gateway drug to obesity, right?! In other words, I don’t care about people smoking a plant that make you smell like three days of funk, and not wiping your butt after taking a dump. Beauty, beholder, you get it. But what I do know is that the Fed has only one thing in mind for pot, and that’s profit. Because breathing pot into your lungs can’t be any better than breathing tobacco.\nAs the National Post points out , it is worse:\nMarijuana is “infinitely worse” than tobacco and its use should be widely discouraged in Canada, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper says.\nThe remarks come the morning after the federal leaders’ French-language debate, in which Harper’s clash with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau over the issue of legalization was among the evening’s more memorable exchanges.\nThe Liberals support legalization; Trudeau argued during the debate that if pot were legal and regulated, young people would be less able to easily procure the drug than they are currently.\nThe Conservatives are vehemently opposed to the idea, with Harper saying that regulating its sale in the same way as cigarettes or alcohol would do nothing to keep it out of the hands of kids.\nWhen asked Saturday how the Conservatives square that position with the fact medicinal marijuana is currently used by thousands of Canadians to treat a variety of causes, Harper said there’s overwhelming evidence about the drug’s long-term effects.\nThe Fed knows this, but they will tell you they care about the health of Americans. Will ObamaCare treat pot smokers? Will they make cigarette smokers pay more for healthcare or is that covered in the taxes?\n“Show me the money!” should be the mantra for the Fed. Wait until they figure out how to profit from dope, and it will be on like a chicken bone.", "external_links": ["http://google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?tpl=safari&#038;site=theblacksphere.net&#038;hl=en-us", "http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/marijuana-is-infinitely-worse-than-tobacco-stephen-harper-says-as-he-encourages-pot-debate-to-go-up-in-smoke"], "published": "2015-10-13T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:39:18.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
