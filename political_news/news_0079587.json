Governor Tom Wolf is changing the way the commonwealth does business, by instituting a hiring freeze and travel ban.Thursday, the Governor instituted a hiring freeze and travel ban for all Pennsylvania’s governmental agencies. While the practice isn't out of the ordinary, the message is clear. It looks like the Governor is preparing for this budget impasse to continue on for a while.After 90 plus days without a state budget, it appears Governor Tom Wolf and his cabinet are pulling the purse strings on unnecessary spending.The Governor sent a letter to all department heads calling on them to immediately stop any new hiring while putting a ban on travel and general purchasing.The freeze will go into effect immediately for all salaried and wage positions. There are a few exceptions to the freezing including any jobs that:- Deal directly with patient care- Engage in law enforcement, public safety or corrections - Or generate or collect revenue Those jobs are exempt from the ban.The Governor also placed a moratorium on all in and out-of-state travel including airfare, hotels, food and tolls. Of course, there are exceptions to this ban as well including:- Any travel that is \"mission critical\" or inherent to the job, things like auditors or inspectors- Travel completely funded by third party money- Any prepaid reservations that would cost money to cancel. The cause of the changes are evident in the final line of the letter when it says, “Thank you for your continued cooperation and support of the Governor and the administration's efforts to reach a budget agreement that best serves the needs of all Pennsylvanians.\"Finally, the Governor is putting a hold on all discretionary spending as well including a ban on general purchases. There is no word on how long the freeze will last.
