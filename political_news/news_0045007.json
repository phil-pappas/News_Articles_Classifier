The happiness was not only for Mumbai taking another wicket in quick succession but also for Mandeep making way for superstar Yuvraj Singh to take guard.\nThe first ball, a low bouncer from pacer Dhawal Kulkarni, saw Yuvraj duck under it. The next, which was way outside the off-stump, was effortlessly cut over the slips to the third-man boundary. Twenty minutes later, it was time for lunch. Yuvraj returned unbeaten on seven from 12 balls in the company of Uday Kaul.\nOn resumption, the Punjab skipper exhibited a gorgeous straight drive off medium-pacer Balwinder Singh Sandhu's (Jr) full-pitched delivery for a boundary in the first over. Sandhu lured Yuvraj with another full, this time slightly outside the off stump, apt for a cover drive. Yuvraj fell for it and nicked it straight to wicket-keeper and captain Aditya Tare.\nAs the southpaw returned to the pavilion, scoring just 13, Punjab were down to four wickets for 75 and Mumbai had seized the upperhand.\nThe hosts continued to be on top of the game to finish Day 1 comfortably at 103/2 against Punjab's 154 all out in Group B second round Ranji Trophy encounter on Thursday.\nMumbai are just 52 away from taking the first innings lead, thanks to an aggressive knock from Shreyas Iyer (61*, 43b, 10x4, 1x6) after Mumbai were down to 41/2.\nCredit for Mumbai's strong position should go to their bowlers. On a track that had nothing much for them, Tare's decision to bowl first was justified by his seamers —Thakur (4/47) and Sandhu (4/31), who bundled the visitors for a cheap total.\nIf Mumbai's success was attributed to their bowlers sticking to the plan of targeting the stumps, Punjab batsmen were to be blamed for throwing away their wickets despite getting good starts. While Thakur troubled the batsmen with bounce and pace, Sandhu stuck to his strengths by bowling full and with swing.\nBefore Yuvraj became his victim, Sandhu had opener Jiwanjot Singh play a half-hearted shot resulting in a return catch. He then got Gitansh Khera, who threatened to take the match away. The wicket-keeper batsman (32) tried to cut a full delivery but it landed in the hands of slip fielder Suryakumar Yadav.\nMeanwhile, Thakur continued dominating from the other end, making it difficult for the visitors to keep the board ticking. While Sandhu took his fourth scalp by getting Sarabjit Chaddha, Thakur hit the final nail on its head by claiming last man Varun Khanna, who edged behind to Tare.\nMumbai began well with openers —Srideep Mangela (7) and Akhil Herwadkar (19) showing some promise. However, it was shortlived as they fell in quick succession.\nLater, Iyer, with support from Yadav, displayed some breathtaking flicks and drives. He even picked 22 runs including four fours and a six in one over from left-arm spinner Khanna. He reached his half-century with a lofted shot over mid-wicket against leg-spinner Ladda.\nSandhu, the star of the day, who now has taken 10 wickets from three innings was a happy man. \"Our plan was to bowl in the right areas, restrict the flow of runs and wait for the wickets,\" he said.\nOn dismissing Yuvraj, the medium-pacer said: \"The plan was to bowl him full. Since he is an attacking player, I let him drive. I also extracted swing and that got his wicket,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:37:57.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
