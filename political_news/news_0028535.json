In his work with the UK’s water systems, Fisher said he has appreciated “the open door, the willingness” to explore innovations.\n“This is not something we can find in Israel,” he said. “There is much more willingness to bring [in] other technologies from the US and Europe.”\nIn Israel, the main markets for water entrepreneurs are the industrial and private sectors, rather than the local government-run water corporations, he explained.\nAt Mapal, Fisher said he is trying to demonstrate to the public-run utilities, regulators and companies, that implementing Israeli-born purification technologies such as his can massively reduce energy costs and provide significant environmental benefits at the country’s sewage plants.\n“We are not losing hope,” he added. “We keep trying.”\nWhen asked why he was so determined to see his company’s technology operating on a wider scale in Israel when it is already performing well in many other countries, Fisher pointed to national pride.\n“First of all, we’re Israelis,” he said. “I have children here, I care about this country.”\n“It’s not something that will bring the company up or down,” Fisher added. “The issue that we raise here is awareness.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:56:10.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
