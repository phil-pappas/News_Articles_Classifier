Polls show that some of the strongest supporters of gun control are African-Americans and Hispanics. And by effectively offering her a political amnesty on her email travails – saying “the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails” – Mr. Sanders made it difficult for himself to seize on the issue should it worsen, and gave Mrs. Clinton a way to isolate Mr. Biden should he try to use the subject to attack her character. But what may have been the most lasting result of the first Democratic face-off was Mrs. Clinton’s attempt to fend off a threat from the vice president by linking herself so closely to the president they both served. “The Obama heir with her own credentials and opinions,” as Ms. Cutter put it. Mrs. Clinton turned to Mr. Obama as a shield when faced with questions that could raise doubts about her on the left. “Well, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then-Senator Obama, debating this very issue,” Mrs. Clinton said when the first hint of criticism arose about her initial support of the Iraq war. “After the election, he asked me to become secretary of state. He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him in the Situation Room, going over some very difficult issues.” Asked about her differences with the president, she first sought to avoid the question entirely, then said only that she would “build on the successes” of Mr. Obama and attempt to go even further in some policy areas. She called him “a great moral leader” on racial issues and defended his decision to use American forces in Libya. Mrs. Clinton never mentioned Mr. Biden – his name did not come up once during the entire debate – but she alluded to one of the most memorable areas on which she and Mr. Obama were in agreement, but the vice president was not. Recalling the “tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden,” Mrs. Clinton noted that she was “one of his few advisers” on that question – seeming to catch herself so as not to point out that Mr. Biden had had doubts about that military operation. It was a walk-to-the-edge caution that her advisers and surrogate supporters also employed after the debate, when they were clearly instructed to follow Mrs. Clinton’s respectful line on all questions about the vice president’s plans. But even as they offered the usual acknowledgments of the personal decision Mr. Biden has to make, there was also just a touch of bravado in the wake of Mrs. Clinton’s strong showing. “We’ve come to the point where he should decide,” said John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. “And if he’s going to get in, we’re going to run our race. And I think you saw that race being run tonight. She just hit it out of the park.” \nNicholas Corasaniti contributed reporting from Las Vegas, and Alan Rappeport from New York. \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
