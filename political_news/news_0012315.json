(NYSE: RFP) (TSX: RFP) learned that the U.S. Department of Commerce released rates in the countervailing duty (\"CVD\") investigation of imports of supercalendered paper from Canada. Commerce determined a final subsidy rate of 17.87% for Resolute, and rates of 20.18% for Port Hawkesbury Paper LP and 18.85% for all other producers/exporters in Canada. On July 29, 2015 , Commerce calculated a preliminary rate of 2.04% for Resolute. Commerce's justification for the change is based on the application of \"adverse facts available,\" saying that the Company \"did not fully cooperate with the investigation.\"\nResolute believes that it has fully cooperated with the investigation; it is surprised and disappointed with this announcement. The Company also reiterates its position that its production of supercalendered paper has received negligible, if any, direct or indirect subsidies of any kind. The Company will have no further comment until it has reviewed Commerce's written Issues and Decision Memorandum, which is expected to be issued later today.\nAbout Resolute Forest Products\nResolute Forest Products is a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including newsprint, specialty papers, market pulp and wood products.
