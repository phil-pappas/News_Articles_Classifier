Kirby later walked back his comment on Twitter.\nThe situation on the Temple Mount, which Muslims call the Haram al-Sharif, appears to be the trigger for the latest wave of violence, in which eight Israelis have died in attacks by Palestinians, and 31 Palestinians have been killed, either in the attacks or in clashes with Israeli troops. The area housing two major Muslim shrines, the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque, is controlled by Muslim authorities who answer to the Jordanian government, but Israel controls access to the site.\nPalestinian leaders accuse Israel of restricting Muslim access to the site and allowing more non-Muslims to enter. Israelis say Abbas is fueling these concerns to strengthen his hand against growing Islamist influence among Palestinians.\n\"They are challenged by the Islamic radicals inside the Palestinian community and outside, that they don't do enough,\" Yossi Kuperwasser, a former director general of the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs, told reporters in a conference call.\n\"So what do they do? They chose the idea of al-Aqsa. Al-Aqsa is of course something that is always there and the Islamic movement in Israel is always trying to raise the issue of al-Aqsa. But now there is also the willingness of [Abbas] to add his competition to this issue. This made it possible for everything to blow up. And that is what we're witnessing today.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner RNC chair: GOP will be 'cooked' as national party with 2016 loss The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM Top Story RNC chair: Republicans are 'cooked' if defeated in 2016 The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:33:37.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
