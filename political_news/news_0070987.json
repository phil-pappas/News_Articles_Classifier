As a result, its six-month growth rate has slipped into negative territory. Meanwhile, the CEI for Korea increased for the third consecutive month but its six-month growth rate has moderated. Taken together, the continued downward trend in the LEI and the moderation of the CEI growth points to increased downside risks to Korea's economic expansion in the near term.\nAbout The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® (LEI) for Korea\nThe composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component – primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.\nThe six components of The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® for Korea include:\nStock Prices\nValue of Machinery Orders\nIndex of Inventories to Shipments\nExport FOB\nYield of Government Public Bonds\nPrivate Construction Orders\nFor more information including full press release and technical notes:\nhttp://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=6\nFor more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators: http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci.cfm\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is an independent business membership and research association working in the public interest.
