(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) By Philip Rucker and Robert Costa October 14 at 3:35 PM LAS VEGAS — The Democratic presidential candidates have thrust gun control forward as a dominant issue for the national election, crystallizing a sea change in the politics of a controversial subject that recent Democratic nominees have often avoided. \nAfter years of deadly mass shootings across the country, and with President Obama voicing deep frustration with inaction by Republicans in Congress, the Democratic candidates led by Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed in a debate here Tuesday night to toughen restrictions on gun owners and gun manufacturers.\nMost seemed not merely willing, but determined and eager to lead the push for gun control into next year’s general election and effectively declared war on the National Rifle Association.\n“We have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence,” Clinton said at the CNN debate. “This has gone on too long and it’s time the entire country stood up against the NRA.”\nBut many Republicans say they welcome the focus, arguing that Democrats are underestimating the power of the pro-gun rights movement and risk overplaying their hand on the issue.\nDemonstrators wait outside of Roseburg Regional Airport for President Barack Obama's arrival in Roseburg, Ore., Friday, Oct. 9, 2015. (Ryan Kang/AP) In a sign of how potent this issue has become among Democratic primary voters, the most damaging part of the debate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might have been the attention on his mixed record on guns. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Clinton whether Sanders had been tough enough on guns, she said, “No, not at all.”\nSanders was put on the defensive for past Senate votes in favor of gun rights. He argued that his votes had been political in nature — he represents a rural state with a rich hunting tradition — but that he now supports a comprehensive approach that includes expanding background checks for gun purchases, eliminating the so-called gun show loophope and addressing the scourge of mental health.\n[ For many Democrats, debut debate renews sense of optimism ] \nFormer Maryland governor Martin O’Malley was perhaps the most passionate in discussing guns. He noted that as governor in 2013, in the wake of the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn., he ushered in sweeping new gun laws. “We did it by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA and backing down to the NRA,” he said.\nO’Malley singled out two members of the live debate audience, Sandy and Lonnie Phillips, whose daughter, Jessie, was killed in the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo.\n“It’s time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation,” he said.\nIn his first post-debate public appearance, O’Malley was scheduled to visit with the Phillips family in Las Vegas and hold a press conference on gun safety.\nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, joins a rally of university students, organized by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, on Capitol Hill October 6, 2015. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) Both O’Malley and Clinton cited the NRA when asked who they considered their enemies. The NRA responded by warning that by pushing gun control, Democrats risk a backlash in the general election. \n“The only problem with the Democrats anti-Second Amendment strategy is that the vast majority of Americans disagree with them on this issue,” NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said.\nGrover Norquist, a leading conservative activist and member of the NRA’s board, went so far as to predict Democrats would “now lose the presidency” for speaking out on guns.\n“Democrats tend to be urban, the kind of people who aren’t invited to go duck hunting, and if they do go hunting, they find it slightly icky,” Norquist said “When that part of their party comes through, they lose. When they start to say that people with guns are the problem, that they don’t trust people with guns, and that people with guns are somehow connected to mass murders, that’s what turns voters off.”\n[ Does Clinton’s debate performance take the air out of Biden’s balloon? ] \nMany Democrats, however, argue the numbers are on their side. Support for background checks is extremely high — between 85 and 92 percent in recent polls — and wins support from both gun-owning households and other households. Support is also very high for laws preventing those with mental illness from purchasing guns and for a federal gun database.\nAt the same time, only about half the public feels an impetus for greater restrictions on gun ownership. People are also split on the effectiveness of stricter gun laws or background checks in stopping convicted criminals from buying guns.\nIn addition to the presidential race, guns are also likely to be a factor in some Senate contests nexty year as several Republicans elected in the 2010 GOP wave defend their seats in blue or swing states — and their party’s slim Senate majority. In Pennsylvania, Sen. Pat Toomey (R) broke with his party to become a leading advocate for expanded background checks and is up for reelection in 2012.\nThe Democrats’ evolution on the issue has been vivid. In the early 2000s, while serving as chairman of the party, Terry McAuliffe cautioned Democrats to bypass gun control, especially in swing states. Now as Virginia’s governor, McAuliffe has become a leading advocate for universal background checks and has called himself “the most aggressive candidate ever in Virginia history talking about safe, common-sense gun regulations.”\nIn the 2008 campaign, the Democratic candidates studiously avoided talking about guns. After Barack Obama was criticized for saying people “cling to guns or religion,” he rarely brought up the issue again, including in his 2012 reelection campaign. Then came Newtown and a string of mass shootings in the three years since.\n[ Winners and losers from the first Democratic presidential debate ] \n“The political calculus has changed,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, the group started by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg (I). “Candidates are now running on gun safety.”\nArkadi Gerney, who focuses on gun safety at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal think tank, said that “leading Democrats today feel that being for strong laws on issues like background checks is a winner in general elections, and an absolute necessity in primaries.”\nClinton’s passionate pitch on guns fits in with her overall campaign strategy. Rather than focusing on winning over moderate voters or demographic groups like “NASCAR dads,” Clinton is doubling down on the coalition that propelled Obama into the White House: African Americans, Latinos and women, especially those in the suburbs in swing states like Virginia and Ohio. Many of those voters support expanding gun restrictions.\nMatt Bennett, a Democratic strategist with Third Way, noted how few Republican candidates and leaders jumped to the NRA’s defense in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s debate.\n“The politics have changed and the NRA has become a pariah for much of the country,” Bennett said. “In a Republican primary, nobody’s going to attack the NRA, but they get that in a general election the NRA is not going to be useful for them. It’s shifted in the same way that gay marriage shifted.”\nBut Brian Walsh, a GOP consultant and former spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said that Clinton will almost certainly tone down her talk on gun control if she makes it to the general election.\n“I don’t expect the same rhetoric from Clinton next fall. Is she going to go into eastern Ohio and talk to blue-collar Democrats and others in the same exact way on guns? Unlikely,” Walsh said. “Republicans are going to talk about guns in their own way, talking about tackling mental-health issues without infringing on Second Amendment rights.”\nCosta reported from Washington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:24:57.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
