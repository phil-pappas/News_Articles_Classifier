The SoCal Fair Trade Campaign is a group of labor, environmental and social justice groups which oppose the Partnership and previous agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n“Our fear is we’re going to seem the same thing we saw with NAFTA, which is millions of jobs off-shored, hundreds of thousands of warehouses leaving the country,\" said Kali Gochmanosky, organizer with SoCal fair Trade Campaign. \"This is putting a downward pressure on wages. It’s effecting the economy.” \nThe group wants the Obama administration to open up the details of the elaborate trade pact between Pacific nations immediately. Under the so-called fast-track approval the president won earlier in the year, Congress is required to receive at least 90 days notice, before an up or down vote on the final package.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:05:53.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
