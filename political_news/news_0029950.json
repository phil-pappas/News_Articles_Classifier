Srinivas Yadav’s resignation issue and stumped the media as well.\nAsked if bypolls would also be held for the Sanathanagar Assembly constituency, represented by Mr Yadav, along with Warangal and Narayankhed, he said, “Why bypoll for Sanathnagar? You have an MLA there. He did not resign.”\nEnergy minister A. Jagdish Reddy immediately corrected him and while getting down from the dais, the home minister clarified that the issue was with the Speaker.\n“He (Mr Yadav) did not tell me when he resigned, he informed the Speaker,” Mr Reddy said with a smile.\nThe resignation issue has haunted Mr Yadav for a long time. While he has asserted that he had submitted his resignation to the Speaker long back, the Speaker is yet to accept it.\nOpposition Telugu Desam, Congress and other parties are gunning for him and are demanding that the Speaker accepts his resignation and make way for byelections.\nStates: Telangana South Telangana Nayani Narasimha Also Read Call for roaring focus on tiger conservation Extension on illegal land rules fails 44 per cent school buses yet to get fitness certificates in Karimnagar Bengaluru: Cop does his duty, but gets the boot", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Nayani%20Narasimha%20Reddy_1_0_1_0_0_1_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151009/nation-current-affairs/article/nayani-narasimha’s-faux-pas-stumps-all", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Nayani%20Narasimha%20Reddy_1_0_1_0_0_1_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:40:32.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
