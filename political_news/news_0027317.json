They can't hear the boos ... they can hear your vote' UPDATED 4:04 AM EDT Oct 09, 2015 Photos Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images \nAn energetic President Barack Obama blasted 2016 GOP presidential candidates and decried the \"anti-immigrant sentiment\" in America Thursday night at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Awards Gala. Videos Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \nAfter listing his administration's accomplishments including cutting the unemployment rate by half, providing health care to millions of Americans and targeted enforcement for children of immigrants, the president quipped, \"All of which makes you wonder, why are some of the folks running for my office so down on America?\" \nThe crowd erupted into cheers and laughter as Obama added, \"They've invented this new reality where everything was terrific back in 2008, when unemployment and uninsured rates were raising, DREAMers lived in fear of deportation ... and bin Laden was still at large. That was the golden age, apparently ... and then I came along and messed it all up.\" \nThe president slammed Republicans who say they want to turn back the clock on his administration's work on immigration. He offered rare praise to his predecessor, George W. Bush, who spent a year trying to pass an immigration plan through Congress that offered a temporary work program for undocumented immigrants. \nWithout naming him, Obama took aim at GOP 2016 front-runner Donald Trump, who has proposed building a massive wall between Mexico and the United States to keep out undocumented immigrants. \n\"America's greatness does not come from building walls,\" the president said, accusing Republicans of making voters fear immigrants. \"It comes from building opportunity.\" \nObama also alluded to GOP contender Marco Rubio's track record on immigration. The Florida senator sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. \n\"Some of the very same Republican politicians who championed immigration reform in the past, some of whom sponsored these efforts, suddenly they want nothing to do with it,\" Obama said. \nAs the audience booed, the president interrupted them. \n\"Don't boo ... vote. They can't hear the boos ... they can hear your vote,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:16:31.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
