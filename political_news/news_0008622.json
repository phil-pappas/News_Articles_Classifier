Once, the boss asked if he could “strip search” her. \nMale co-workers mimicked the supervisor’s behavior, engaging in a litany of seedy come-ons. They asked her what color underwear she wore. They kissed and hugged her against her will. One guy stroked her inner thigh and crotch. Another tried to bite her. \nThe woman and the alleged culprits were guards at an Arizona Department of Corrections prison in Tucson, according to court records. The men’s behavior was so egregious that the U.S. Justice Department intervened and sued DOC on her behalf. DOC never admitted liability, but the state settled for $182,500. \nHers was one among 57 discrimination, harassment, retaliation or other workplace settlements that cost taxpayers more than $6 million from 2009 to 2014. About one-third were for $10,000 or less, while nearly half were $25,000 or more. Four of Arizona State University’s nine settlements cost the state more than $100,000 each, excluding legal costs. \nThe Arizona Republic’s investigation of the settled public employee cases also found: \nPayouts averaged more than $72,000. The biggest was $949,288. Some of the largest settlements went to women at state agencies and universities whose claims described harassment ranging from groping to sexual demands. One female correctional officer said she was handcuffed to a railing and pepper-sprayed. Two ASU students said they were propositioned by their professors. \nUnequal pay for women remains a problem. In one case, a woman who complained was retaliated against with false allegations of sexual harassment . The accusations against her were eventually discredited, with a judge saying she was “exonerated.” But the state fought her claim, costing taxpayers 40 times what it would’ve cost to raise her pay. \nThe Republic found five of the accused named in settlement agreements were disciplined in connection with their alleged activities. One person was fired. \nIt took nearly two years on average for the state to settle, The Republic’s analysis found. The lingering cases sometimes cost taxpayers more because the state ended up picking up everyone’s legal tab. When employees went to court, it often took years to resolve because the state often didn’t settle until facing an adverse judgment in court. \nThe state Governor’s Office of Equal Opportunity was created to help agencies mediate problems and minimize harassment and discrimination. But its budget has shrunk, it no longer issues regular progress reports, and it was down to one employee most of this year. \n“Anyone who has litigated (against the state) knows the culture. It’s one of secrecy, silence and concealment,” said civil-rights lawyer Stephen Montoya. “Something can be done and something needs to be done for the sake of taxpayers.” Explore some of the stories \nSelect a woman's name below to learn more about her story: <!--iframe--> Want notification when we publish other watchdog or investigation pieces? \nSign up here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:02:38.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
