During a press conference earlier this year, Megan Sennett, an Annapolis resident, talks about why she supports mandatory paid sick days. With three months before the Maryland General Assembly reconvenes, lobbyists for worker issues are gearing up to support a state sick-leave bill when it's reintroduced. (By Chase Cook / File photo) Elisha Sauers Contact Reporter esauers@capgaznews.com Paid sick-leave advocates gear up for state bill's reintroduction in January. \nSupporters of mandatory paid sick days are already preparing for January when Maryland lawmakers will reintroduce the bill in the General Assembly. \nThe Working Matters Coalition, which is heading the campaign for paid sick days in the state, held a teleconference Monday night, involving worker advocacy groups, local elected officials and Jordan Brooks, assistant director of the White House's Council on Women and Girls, to discuss strategies. \nBrooks stressed President Barack Obama's call on state and local officials to take the lead on paid sick days. The president issued an executive order in September requiring all federal contractors to provide paid sick days to their employees. \nSome counties have already taken up the issue. Montgomery County passed a sick-leave bill, and Prince George's County is holding a hearing Tuesday morning for similar legislation. \n\"We are part of a growing national movement,\" said Melissa Broom, a Working Matters organizer. \nBut it's that broad scope that has some lawmakers, such as House Minority Leader Nic Kipke, R-Pasadena, skeptical. He believes any \"additional burdens\" on small employers would criple businesses' ability to grow and create jobs. \n\"I get frustrated with the political games in our state,\" Kipke said, \"because I think it's more about the next election.\" \nThe state legislation, known as Maryland Healthy Working Families Act, would have required most employers to let workers earn up to seven days in paid sick time annually had it passed this year. More than 720,000 Maryland workers in the private sector don't have paid sick leave, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research. \nThe bill, however, died without a vote. \nState House and Senate leaders said advocates needed to build stronger support for their proposal. Many businesses had opposed the plan, either objecting to the mandate or believing it was overreaching. \nSenators John C. Astle, D-Annapolis, and Jim Rosapepe, D-College Park, were among the co-sponsors of the bill. Business groups, such as the Northern Anne Arundel County Chamber of Commerce, opposed it. \nSen. Catherine Pugh, D-Baltimore, who was the lead sponsor of the bill, participated in the teleconference, and said it is an \"opportune time\" to reconsider the plan. \n\"We're championing the right cause,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:52:35.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
