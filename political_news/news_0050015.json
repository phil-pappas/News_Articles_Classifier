Adams is joined by her sister Roxanne Adams and niece Jenobia Meads. (Timothy C. Wright/For the Washington Post) October 2 at 6:09 PM Regarding the Sept. 30 front-page article “ Waiting in jail for help — and dying ”:\nHow many more mentally ill people must suffer and die in prison for the crime of an unsound mind? I am livid (and can only imagine his family’s pain) that Jamycheal Mitchell, 24, who suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was imprisoned for four months in two Virginia jails, because he allegedly stole $5.05 worth of food.\nIn the Hampton Roads Regional Jail, while awaiting a bed at a local psychiatric hospital, Mr. Mitchell apparently was allowed to go naked and smear his own feces and received little treatment for his maladies. His family members said he was kept apart from them, so they were unable to advocate on his behalf.\nMost stunning, jail officials enabled the 6-foot Mr. Mitchell to waste away from 180 to 144 pounds. Ironically, the jail’s excuse was that officials could not say for sure Mr. Mitchell wasn’t eating and the kicker, “[Mr. Mitchell] did not complain that he was losing weight.” Even if he had, would jail officials have heard him?\nBeth Craig Jones , Alexandria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:31:16.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
