He said some of the dead could not be removed yet because the fire was too intense.\nThe death toll is the worst from a blaze in Ireland since Valentine's Day 1981, when 48 people died in a Dublin dance hall.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:53:52.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
