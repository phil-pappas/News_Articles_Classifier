He tends to give long and at times rambling speeches, he has repeatedly said he has no interest in attacking his fellow Democratic rivals, and his aides say he's barely engaged in traditional debate prep in the days leading up to Tuesday. The added challenge for Sanders will be to win over viewers who are skeptical about whether the senator can rise to the occasion of being a national leader. Why libertarian Penn Jillette likes Bernie Sanders Which Clinton shows up? Clinton has spent months on the defensive, due to the controversy over her private email server and surprised by the strong progressive surge that's powering Sanders to her left. She's come across as not forthcoming in some interviews, reminding voters of the political obfuscation that at times clouded her husband Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s. Clinton's poll numbers and approval ratings have dipped as a result. But she's a known strong debater, and went toe to toe with Barack Obama again and again in 2008. A repeat of those assured, likable performances on Tuesday night could go a long way toward reminding 18 million Democrats why they voted for her in her first presidential primary campaign. \"Hillary Clinton is an excellent debater,\" said Pfeiffer. \"She is excellent, crisp, knows the substance up and down, is very good in the back and forth.\" For all her struggles in the race so far, she is still the overwhelming front-runner and faces by far the highest expectations. Clinton also knows the dangerous potential of debates. Her halting answer about driving licenses for undocumented migrants in the 2008 season was the first crack in a front-running White House campaign that Obama eventually overhauled. What celebrities want to ask the candidates Is this Martin O'Malley's only chance? O'Malley has spent months berating Democratic leaders for failing to schedule more debates, all as he has struggled to climb above single digits in the polls. Once seen as a fresh and accomplished new Democratic voice, the former Maryland governor -- partly due to his failure to command much media coverage -- is badly in need of a fresh boost of energy. He and his other underdog rivals, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, will want to emulate Carly Fiorina. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO used fiery performances in the GOP debates to jump-start a stalled campaign and put herself into the top tier of GOP candidates. O'Malley, 52, is also by far the youngest person on the stage. Sanders is 74, and was born months before America entered World War II. Most of the rest are baby boomers. Clinton is 67, Jim Webb is 69 and served in the Vietnam War, and Lincoln Chafee is 62. Unlike the Republican primary, which features candidates spanning generations -- Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal are just 44 -- the Democratic contest looks like it is for seniors only. The age gap could give O'Malley an edge. And he'll need any advantage he can get. \"The one person who has a great opportunity here is Martin O'Malley,\" former Mitt Romney adviser Kevin Madden said on CNN Monday. \"When you're at 1%, and you're Martin O'Malley, that's very easy. He has nowhere to go but up.\" Clarification: This story has been updated to better reflect Clinton's position on immigration policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:05:04.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
