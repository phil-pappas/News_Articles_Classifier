Now Ranbir, scion of the Kapoor clan, is paying homage to Dev saab in his own sweet manner. For his next film Tamasha , he has gone ahead and done an almost perfect impersonation of the late evergreen actor.\n“This is for the song Matargashti ,” confirms our source, “A fun number which is basically a Ranbir song all the way with Deepika accompanying him, it has Ranbir stepping into Dev saab's shoes (or rather cap) for a good part. His body language, facial expressions and mannerisms are truly in line with that of the legendary romantic hero and his jovial persona has also been kept intact.”\nIt didn’t just end here. The AR Rahman composed song even has lyrics by Irshad Kamil throwing more than just subtle hints around Dev Anand inspirations. So the words Dil Ka Bhanwar have been borrowed from the title song of Dev Anand’s classic Tere Ghar Ke Saamne while his Prem Pujari is being referred to as well.\nSo happy was producer Sajid Nadiadwala with the Mohit Chauhan sung song that he went ahead with a no-bar approach when it came to the presentation and grandeur, making it one of the biggest songs on play today.\nWhen contacted, filmmaker Imtiaz Ali was happy to talk about the homage. He says, “The great personalities from cinema are a part of our upbringing and influence is just like a close friend or family member. We admire them, emulate them and they spring out from within us when we are happy — like in Matargashti .”\nWell, now here’s is looking forward to all the happiness which is expected to be on play with Tamasha .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:25:09.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
