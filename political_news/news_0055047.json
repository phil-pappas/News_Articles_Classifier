As part of the law that passed Obamacare in 2010, all new government-backed student loans are serviced by the Department of Education.\nBefore then, however, many government-backed student loans were issued by banks and other lenders. There is still $370 billion in such loans outstanding, according to the consumer agency, about one-third of total student debt.\n  Roger Stone: Only Trump and Cruz have the guts to challenge Clinton \"It's really not hard to take points that came out of ... focus groups and go out and spit them out.\"\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/15/15 12:01 AM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ Of those borrowers, at least 30 percent, or five million, are delinquent, the bureau calculates.\nStudent debt is difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, meaning that if borrowers face obstacles repaying or restructuring their debt with their servicers, problems could persist for a long time.\nThe report analyzed 6,400 complaints about student loans and 2,300 debt-collection complaints related to student loans submitted by consumers to the agency over the past year.\nThe bureau concluded from the complaints that servicers made it difficult for student borrowers to learn their options regarding income-based repayment plans, which cap monthly student loan payments as a share of income. If the borrowers were able to enroll, they were sent confusing paperwork and had trouble making sure they were up to date on payments.\n\"Customer service is constantly giving me false information and not helping me to get my payments lowered,\" read one complaint. \"I have complained to numerous organizations and have not gotten any help since. Please, help me. I am trying hard not to allow my loans to go into default. I am not trying to ignore my loans, but how can I pay a 2,000 monthly payment.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton's rivals strike out looking At the debate her fellow candidates demonstrated that they do not have the instinct or toughness to win.\nBy Washington Examiner • 10/15/15 12:01 AM The report casts private servicers like Navient, Genesis Lending and Wells Fargo in a negative light.\nThe consumer bureau's student loan ombudsman argued that the report issued Wednesday strengthened the argument for implementing new regulations on the student loan market proposed by the bureau and other regulators at the end of September.\nThe loan market overhaul contemplated by the agencies would set new rules for lending to students and increase penalties for servicers who fell afoul of them.\nTop Story Iran ayatollah's new missile: Lawmakers demanding action \"This   action,\" Rep.
