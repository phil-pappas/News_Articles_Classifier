Kent Sorenson testified in federal court Thursday in the trial involving two former aides of the Ron Paul 2012 campaign. Other Stories \nForm aides Jesse Benton and Dmitri Kesari are accused of making secret payments to Sorenson just before the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. Authorities say the payments were for Sorenson to switch his support to Ron Paul's campaign. \nSorenson took the witness stand on Thursday afternoon. \nHe explained that since 2008, he had received PAC money from people affiliated with the Paul campaign, including Kesari. Sorenson said it started in October when he began to feel that Michele Bachmann wasn't going to win the campaign. \nIn December of 2011, Sorenson said he and his wife had dinner with Kesari. That evening he said Kesari gave his wife a check for $25,000. \nThe check was from Kesari's organization, Designer Goldsmith Inc., and made out to Sorenson's corporation named Grass Roots Strategies. \nSorenson said at the time he told Kesari that he wasn't sure he wanted to switch to Paul's campaign. He said he was conflicted because he was facing financial issues at the time. \nThe trial is scheduled to continue on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:32:42.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
