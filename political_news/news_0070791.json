Paris prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into French government accusations that Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government has committed crimes against humanity.\nThe prosecutor’s office said Wednesday the investigation is based on photos taken by a former Syrian officer who fled in 2013 and focuses on atrocities allegedly committed between 2011 and 2013.\nIt comes as Russia, a key Assad ally, is trying to rally an international action against Islamic State extremists in Syria, and some western voices are softening their positions against Assad because of mounting violence by the extremists. France remains staunchly opposed to Assad.\nThe probe, opened this month, is in its earliest stages, prosecutor’s office spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. It is unclear who might eventually be charged and whether French investigators would travel to war-torn Syria.\nLast Sunday, France has started unilateral airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Syria, although the experts believe the strikes will likely have but a limited effect. The U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out regular airstrikes that punish but have failed to decimate IS, which controls large swaths of Syria.\nHollande’s decision to carry out targeted strikes on strategic IS sites is coupled with France’s bid to press for a political solution to the Syrian crisis. Beyond military objectives, the strikes serve to bolster France’s position in helping to find a solution to a crisis that also includes Russia and Iran.\nSunday’s air raids on the IS training camp site in the Euphrates valley lasted about five hours, the Defense Ministry said, with fighter jets — five of them Delta-winged Rafales, taking off from Jordan and the Persian Gulf, the ministry said without naming the Gulf location.\nFrance has carried out 215 airstrikes against IS extremists in Iraq as part of the coalition since last year, the Defense Ministry said earlier this month. But it previously held back on engaging in Syria, citing concern over playing into Assad’s hand and the need for such action to be covered by international law.\nOfficials now evoke “legitimate defense” as spelled out in the U.N. Charter to support strikes in Syria.\nFrance has already been attacked by extremists claiming ties to IS. Hollande — who has ruled out sending ground troops into Syria — has cited “proof” of plans for attacks on France and the growing danger to Syrian civilians, with a large chunk of the population fleeing in a massive exodus.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:48:36.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
