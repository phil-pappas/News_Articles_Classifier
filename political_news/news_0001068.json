Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, (right) called for the creation of the committee. (AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt) × COLUMBIA — More meetings have been canceled in the state’s capital this week, as South Carolina focuses its attention on recovering from damaging historic floods.\nThe Joint Capital Bond Study Committee will no longer meet at 1 p.m., today. That’s a biggie, because the introduction and ultimate passing of the amendment that created this committee soured budget talks during the 2015 legislative session.\nSenate Majority Leader Sen. Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, was the voice behind the amendment. At the time, he said the committee would study the state’s capital needs, so that it could come back to the 2016 legislative session with a clearer picture of what lawmakers should borrow money for.\nThose capital needs might change now after the floods. Many of the state’s aging infrastructures have suffered from the historic downpour. And that could lead to borrowing money for other projects not initially envisioned.\nThe state’s chief budget writer in the Senate has already voiced the likely need to have the state borrow money during the upcoming legislative session. The meeting has not been rescheduled yet.\nRelated:\nHaley: SC recovering swiftly after historic floods ( The Post and Courier )\nNew sea rise study paints doomsday scenario for Charleston, other low-lying cities ( The Post and Courier )\nRain-weary S.C. coast promotes sunny image Messages aim to reassure tourists ( The Associated Press )\nFlood victims turn to North Charleston insurance event for help ( The Post and Courier )\nResidents question decisions made with released water ( The Greenville News )\nOfficials scramble for funding to replenish storm-damaged beaches ( The Sun News )\nIn other news:\nTrump leads solidly in South Carolina, new CNN poll shows ( The Post and Courier )\nCharleston mayoral candidates scrap on biggest stage ( The Post and Courier )\nIvanka Trump: Dad disrupting 2016 race in ‘positive way’ ( The Associated Press )\nTed Cruz to report $13.5 million cash on hand — at or near the top of the GOP field ( The Washington Post )\nDebate Performance Adds Little to Lincoln Chafee’s Daunting Numbers ( The New York Times )\nJeb Cuts Back ( Politico )\nWhy Clinton Can’t Win By Going After the NRA ( Bloomberg )\nHillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders look to build on debate performances ( The Associated Press )\nS.C. has first conviction under human trafficking law ( The Post and Courier )\nLawyer questions Greenville sheriff’s use of K9s ( The Greenville News )\nS.C.
