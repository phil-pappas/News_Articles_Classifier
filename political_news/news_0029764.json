It seems a number of others are struggling to comprehend the new team's policy-making process and the way it communicates its message.\nAt last night's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, shadow chancellor John McDonnell explained why he'd abandoned his support for the government's commitment to run a budget surplus.\nA number of MPs described the U-turn as \"chaotic\" and \"shambolic\". \nThe same word was used, perhaps unsurprisingly, by Mr McDonnell's political opponents including the SNP's Angus Robertson and the Chancellor.\nPlay video \"Sept 2015: New Plan With No Deficit\" Video: Sept 2015: New Plan With No Deficit There are two separate strands which need to be separated.\nFirstly, Jeremy Corbyn has made it clear he believes the party needs to seek counsel from the grass roots when constructing priorities, suggesting the days of the National Policy Forum (at least in its present form) are numbered. \nThat would support Mr McDonnell's decision to consult MPs, his economic advisers and individual members of the shadow cabinet when authorising the turn-around.\nA source close to the shadow chancellor told me he was being \"intellectually consistent\" and not \"blindly following\" a path as the realities shifted around him.\nPlay video \"McDonnell: Review Tax System\" Video: McDonnell: Review Tax System But policy shifts happen in many large businesses and organisations - mostly under cover of darkness.\nThe problem is what Diane Abbott referred to on BBC radio as the \"process story\".\nThe machinery is fully visible, allowing opponents to attack while embryonic positions on important matters are gestating.\nSo some restive backbenchers, already wary of the new leadership's stance on the economy and defence, feel doubly exposed.\nPlay video \"Labour Lays Out Its Economic Plan\" Video: Labour Lays Out Its Economic Plan Even positions of principle for Mr Corbyn - and remember its honesty and frankness which got him elected - are starting to trip up the party.\nAn atheist republican should have issues with some of the more ceremonial aspects of the job, like singing the national anthem or meeting the Queen.\nBut instead of trumpeting his consistency, the party's managers seem unable to know what to do.\nInstead of cauterising the row, they inflame it.\nPlay video \"Sept 2015: Labour's New Economics\" Video: Sept 2015: Labour's New Economics As one Labour frontbencher told Sky News this morning: \"This week (the leadership) has not only been shown to be out of touch, but incompetent as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:40:16.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
