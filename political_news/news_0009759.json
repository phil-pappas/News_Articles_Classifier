Protesters were escorted out of the event by security and police officers, and numerous protesters got into verbal and physical altercations with other attendees at the event. \nWingers will inevitably claim it was the \"left's thugs\" who started the fights, but in the video above, we have evidence of how things were really going. The spit was flying in one direction, and it certainly looks as though it went right to left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:51:58.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
