(AP Photo/Eric Risberg)\nAssociated Press Oct. 16, 2015 | 9:57 p.m. EDT + More By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer\nNAPA, Calif. (AP) — Brendan Steele did not feel much different about his game Friday except for his score. One thing that didn't change was his name atop the leaderboard at the Frys.com Open.\nSteele had to settle for pars on the closing three holes at Silverado that can produce birdies. He had a 2-under 70 — seven shots higher than the opening round — but all that mattered was a two-shot lead.\nSteele was at 11-under 133 and led over Will Wilcox (67), Jhonattan Vegas (71), Graham DeLaet (68) and Harold Varner III (70), who missed a 10-foot birdie putt on his last hole that kept him out of the final group in his rookie debut.\nRory McIlroy struggled to make putts again. He shot 71 and was six shots behind.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
