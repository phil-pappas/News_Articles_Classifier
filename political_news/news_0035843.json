Bobby Jindal for the Office of Motor Vehicle's decision to send out 1.2 million debt collection notices for fines on insurance-related violations.\nDonelon, who is running for re-election to a third term as insurance commissioner, issued a news release blasting the Jindal administration for using the fines \"to plug a hole in the state's budget.\" Administration officials have acknowledged the state faces a shortfall that will likely result in mid-year budget cuts, estimating last month that a $50 million gap was a very conservative estimate.\nOMV is seeking to collect fines on drivers who have allowed their insurance to lapse, but some of those lapses due to mistakes in paperwork and communication -- not situations where drivers have stopped paying their insurance and continued driving. For instance, drivers who sell a car or move out of state may move their insurance to a new vehicle or a new out-of-state policy, but failed to communicate that situation to the OMV.\nThe fine is assessed after the OMV is notified that the driver has stopped paying for that insurance policy.\n\"We want all drivers to be insured because when more drivers are insured, auto insurance rates can go down,\" Donelon said in a statement. \"But the way that this has been handled is fundamentally unfair. For years the state has failed to collect fines. Now, years later, the average citizen likely does not have the documents to prove that they had insurance one way or the other. No one keeps proof of insurance from a decade ago.\"\nCol. Mike Edmonson, the superintendent of the state police, acknowledged in an interview that the letters people initially received may have been \"a little firm.\"\n\"I can't put that back in the box,\" Edmonson said. \"But the bottom line is we've got to fix it now.\"\nEdmonson said the point of the letters was to get people to clear their record if they're listed as having lapsed insurance. That includes collecting fines in appropriate situations, and canceling out fines of people who did not deserve them.\nEdmonson said motorists can check the status of their fines here.\nAddressing Donelon's concerns about the age of some of the records -- some of the fines go back 20 years -- Edmonson said he's directed OMV personnel to be understanding if people don't have records for fines assessed before 2006. But he said those people are still going to need to make contact with the OMV to discuss their situation.\n\"We'll get them to sign an affidavit ... something we can put into the record that shows us they can tell us\" what occurred that caused the lapse, Edmonson said. \"They still have to work with us.\"\nAbout one-quarter of the notices sent out were for violations issued before 2006, Edmonson said.\nDonelon said one person who called his office to report a $600 fine is an Iraq war veteran who was deployed overseas during the time the insurance expired. Donelon questioned whether the state has \"effectively deprived many of its citizens of their legal rights.\"\nEdmonson said that's not the case, saying that the effort is not part of a money grab -- it's a product of a law passed in 2015 that allowed the state to collect old debts. He said if OMV didn't make an effort to collect old fines, people would continue to ignore notices because the state did not previously have any mechanism to collect them.\n\"Why do anything that creates a fee or penalty if you're not going to collect it,\" Edmonson said. \"I'm not going to send anything for final debt unless I'm absolutely sure we've exhausted all means to clear that record.\"\nThere will be more letters going out soon, Edmonson said, this time to drivers who have old traffic fines that have caused their drivers licenses to be suspended.\nAfter this story was published, the Jindal administration issued this statement:\n\"The reported lapses in insurance the OMV is making an effort to address is the result of insurance companies, regulated by the Department of Insurance, reporting information directly to the OMV. If the accuracy of the information is in question, Commissioner Donelon has the responsibility to ensure insurance companies are properly reporting this information.\"\n. . . . . .
