CASCADE TOWNSHIP, MI – Ohio Gov. John Kasich compared job skills to the talents of NBA basketball players and talked about how his religious faith motivated him to run for president during a campaign stop this afternoon outside Grand Rapids.\nThe former Republican congressman also used a football analogy to characterize the GOP's leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump. \nCheck out the video above to hear Kasich call Trump an \"American Idol\" and reference the upcoming Michigan-Michigan State football game. As he did at last month's Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference , Kasich touted his governing experience as a distinction that should help him survive the inevitable narrowing of his party's field of presidential candidates. \n\"I'm a reformer who's actually accomplished things,\" Kasich said Monday, Oct. 12, after touring Lacks Enterprises on Kraft Avenue SE. \"At the end, we have to be able to land the plane. It's not just about standing on a corner and yelling and screaming or being a clanging bell. It's about being able to have the skills to get things done to fix this country.\" \nKasich was scheduled to board a plane this afternoon for New Hampshire, where later this week he will unveil his plan for the country. \nHere are a few things he said Monday in Kent County: \n• what he sees as the most important topic in the presidential campaign \"I think the biggest issue is always the pocketbook, the economics. Aren't we more worried about our jobs than anything else? We can talk about all the foreign policy stuff, but what it gets down to is 'Am I going to keep my job? Am I going to get a raise? Am I going to get better benefits?' and 'What's going to happen to my kids?'\" \n• comparing the marketability of LeBron James to a regular Joe \"If you don't have skills, if you don't get trained right, then you can't make any money. I look at every job just like I look at an NBA player: The more you can score, the more money you make. If you have skills, you get paid more. If you have less skills, you get paid less.\" \n• why he thinks government should give incentives for manufacturing technology \"There's a thought that if you use technology that it's going to put people out of work, but if you use technology you can produce more things better in a shorter period of time, which means you can sell more, which means you can have more profits, which you hope would mean the workers get more money. People increasingly worry about 'Is technology going to put me out of a job?' What we're finding is that technology, at least in this operation (at Lacks), is creating more work and there's less you have to do with your back or your hands and more you do with your brain.\" \n• why he's running for president \"In life everybody has a God-given purpose and a set of blessings and I think when you get blessings you better give back. I really believe everybody's made special for special things. We don't have to measure what we're doing to make things a little better in the world on the basis of how much money we make or what our position is, because I don't believe that's the way the Lord thinks about it. I think he thinks, 'I gave you stuff, what are you doing with it?' This (campaign) I did because I felt like I know how to fix things and I know how to get the country working again, so I should go and do it.\" \nMatt Vande Bunte covers government for MLive/Grand Rapids Press.
