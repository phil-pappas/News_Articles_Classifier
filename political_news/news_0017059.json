The proposal was dubbed the “Community Safety Initiative.” \nSome in Springfield took exception with the plan to offer universal early education. Opponents called it a “government overreach” and an attempt at “social engineering” — much to the chagrin of advocates who saw early education programs as a way to overcome the adverse effects of poverty on education. \nThe push to make early childhood education available to 3- and 4-year-olds in the Springfield area didn’t stop, however, as supporters continued to work for expansion of the area’s early education programs. \nNow, two Springfield lawmakers say they’ll propose bills next year, which, if they pass into law, would likely bring the issue of using local funds for early childhood education to the fore once again in Greene County. \nFor the past three years, Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield, has introduced “enabling” legislation that would allow Greene County residents to vote on whether to increase the countywide sales taxes by a 1/4 cent with the new revenue going toward early education programs. “There is just more and more research piling up, that says when kids start school behind they don’t catch up.” Rep. Lincoln Hough (R-Springfield) \nThe legislation would also allow any city within Greene County to add a 1/4-cent sales tax for early education programs to its local sales tax upon voter approval. \nLast year, Rep. Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, filed a nearly identical bill in the House. The lawmakers said they plan to file the legislation again next session. \n“There is just more and more research piling up,” Hough said, “that says when kids start school behind they don’t catch up.” \nDuring a conference focused on fighting poverty in Springfield last week, Hough was asked what the state could do to help. He singled out support for early childhood education as a key policy initiative. \nLincoln Hough (Photo: File Photo) \n“Let’s get the children ready to learn,” Hough said. “Let’s break the cycle.” \nBoth Dixon and Hough said they are reasonably confident their bills will become law this time around. \nDixon said his bill had momentum last year before it was derailed by a filibuster over a right-to-work bill that shut down the Senate in the final days of the legislative session. \nIf their legislation does pass, local early childhood education advocates would have a new chance to make their case that providing universal access to early education programs is a worthwhile investment — one that would save future taxpayers costs associated with jail cells, social programs or other burdens borne from poverty and crime. \nBut advocates will also have to overcome the deeply skeptical opposition that erupted a decade ago. \nOrganizers of the failed Community Safety Initiative have said their proposal was too complicated and that they didn’t do enough to stress the benefits of early education, the News-Leader has previously reported. \nLawmakers tout local control \nBoth Dixon and Hough said they see value in early childhood education. But they also said their legislation is not really about education or taxes, but rather local control. \n“It’s not a tax increase,” Dixon said, referring to the specific, tax-enabling impact if the bill would pass. “All it is is a local option. All it does is give the local community the ability to do what they want to ... It just gives Springfield voters the legal authority to decide for themselves. Since we’re a political subdivision, that has to be granted by the state.” \nBob Dixon (Photo: File Photo) \nIf Greene County voters approved the 1/4 cent sales tax it would create $11.8 million annually, according to a March analysis by the Committee on Legislative Research Oversight Division. \nThat analysis did not have an estimate for how much revenue would be created if only Springfield adopts the tax bump. However, a similar analysis from 2013 found if Springfield adopted a 1/4 cent tax increase it would generate $6 million in new revenue. \nIf voters were to approve the tax increase, the county would be required to name an existing “task force” to oversee distribution of the tax dollars. That task force would be charged with setting the requirements for which local programs would be eligible to receive funds from the trust. \nAlthough it doesn’t say so in the legislation, the expectation is the task force would make the funding available to both public and private programs, lawmakers said. \nHough’s bill, would require voters to re-approve the tax every five years. \nEchoing Dixon’s statements, Hough said it won’t be the lawmakers who go to bat for early education programs with a tax bump if the bills pass. That will be up to supporters, he said. \n“They know the work is going to be on them to explain why this is necessary,” Hough said. \nThe legislation, if it passes, would be a huge boost for the city, said Dana Carroll, child advocate for the Every Child Promise, an advocacy organization that has spearheaded the push for universal access to early education in Springfield. \nDana Carroll (Photo: File Photo) \nHowever, Carroll said while her group is hopeful the enabling legislation passes so the community can ask for a tax, it won’t necessarily be her group that leads the campaign for a referendum vote. \nNew tax revenue for early education programs would require likely a referendum vote at a general election, which come every two years. That was how the bills were written last year. \nCarroll said it is unlikely proponents would be able to organize a campaign in support of the referendum by the 2016 general election, meaning the next available opportunity would be in 2018. \nA need? \nProponents of expanding early childhood education programs in the Springfield area point to a Mayor’s Commission for Children report that examines whether children are ready for school upon entering kindergarten. \nThe report, released in May, found that last year 28 percent of kindergarten students in Springfield were “not prepared” to learn, the News-Leader has previously reported. \nReleased every four years since 2006, similar reports state Springfield students have lost ground. In 2010, 20 percent of kindergartners were not ready the report found. \nIt is not as if there is a complete dearth of early education programs in Springfield, however, Carroll said. \nThe federal Head Start program offers low-cost early education programing to families in poverty, the Springfield Public Schools offers its own free early education program, Wonder Years, made available by federal funds and there are private providers that offer early education programs in the Springfield area, Carroll said. \nStill, that network of providers leaves many of the area’s 3- and 4-year-olds without access to affordable high-quality preschool, she said. \nWhy? Many families don’t qualify for the free- or reduced-cost programs and can’t afford private programs, Carroll said. She also noted that federal and state early education programs have had their funding cut in recent years.

The group uses a national framework called Classroom Assessment Scoring System to determine if a program is adequate, Carroll said. \nThis pilot has shown results in helping students prepare for kindergarten and could serve as a model for how to distribute tax dollars to existing early education programs both public and private, Carroll said. \nOfficials, business community voice support \nJohn Jungmann (Photo: File Photo) \nLocal education and county officials and business leaders are backing the bills. \nSpringfield Public Schools Superintendent John Jungmann said the district would be interested in expanding its preschool programs. \nThe bills puts no restrictions on what kind of programs the new tax could fund. They could be private or public or faith-based school programs. \nGreene County Administrator Chris Coulter said county officials support the bill, are generally supportive of investing in early education and would most likely hold a public hearing to consider putting the tax increase on an election ballot in the coming years if the legislation were to pass. \nAlso, the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce has had early education funding as a legislative priority for several years and supports Dixon and Hough’s legislation, said Sandy Howard, senior vice president of public affairs. \nShelby Ragsdale, lead teacher of the Pre-K class, add food coloring to a mix of homemade play dough with students (from left) Lincoln Scott, 4, Maddie Markin, 4, and Grace Duncan, 4, at Grow to Know, 2747 E.

The group raised more than $1 million to fund pilot projects over a three-year period. \nStories that sprung from the Every Child journalism effort can be viewed at http://archive.news-leader.com/section/everyChildEducation. \nWhat enabling resolution would allow \nBased on the nearly identical bills Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield, and Rep. Lincoln Hough, R-Springfield, filed last year to allow a new sales tax to support early childhood education, here is what the enabling legislation would allow and require: \n■ Would allow up to a 1/4 of a cent sales tax increase in Greene County, or any of its cities, that would go to early education programs. \n■ A simple majority of voters could approve the tax during a general election, which occur every two years. \n■ All but 1 percent of the revenue generated by the new tax would have to go toward early education programs. That 1 percent would be sent to the state’s general revenue fund to pay for the cost of collection. \n■ If the tax was approved, the county or city would be required to create an “Early Childhood Education Sales Tax Trust Fund.” \n■ The county or cities would select an existing task force to oversee the trust fund. The task force would be charged with determine what programs would be eligible to receive funds and how those funds would be disbursed. \n■ Residents could petition to have the tax repealed. If residents collected signatures from 10 percent of the registered voters in the last gubernatorial election, the county or city would be required to hold an election calling for the repeal of the sales tax. \n■ Hough’s version of the bill would require voters to reauthorize the sales tax every five years. \n■ The impact of a 1/4 cent sales tax on a $100 purchase would be 25 cents. \nA decade ago, voters smacked down early education plan \nIt wasn’t even close. \nIn the autumn of 2005, Greene County voters roundly rejected the so-called “Community Safety Initiative,” a proposed 1/4 cent sales tax intended to boost local law enforcement and early childhood education programs. \nMost of the money from the new tax, about $10 million, would have gone to pay for new law enforcement personnel, staff in the county prosecutors office, and a new regional crime lab. “Uh, it was devastating. We just got killed.” Dave Coonrod, former Greene County presiding commissioner \nAnd about $3 million would have gone to a early childhood education programs, which proponents argued would help prevent future crime by helping ensure children were successful in school. The funds would have been made available to participating school districts in the county. \nOn that election day, Nov. 8, 2005, the measure was defeated by 3,780 votes. About 12 percent of the county’s voters turned out for that special election. \n“Uh, it was devastating. We just got killed,” said Dave Coonrod, who was then the Greene County Presiding Commissioner and a proponent of early education programs. \nLocal leaders pushing for the new tax had chosen to pair the two initiatives to one new tax and to ask for voter approval in the same referendum. Many would later come to regret that tactic. They said it confused the issues, making both proposals more complicated for voters. \n\"I think they pushed this kids' thing, and I call that extortion, myself. I think people should correct their kids at home, rather than having the police do it,\" a Willard resident told the News-Leader at the polls. \nShortly after voters downed the initiative, the News-Leader ran a story asking whether it was the victim of a general anti-tax attitude in the community. \n\"I'm sick of damn taxes,\" said another Willard resident as he left the polls, the story reported. \nBut it wasn’t just voter confusion or a general anti-tax sentiment that worked against the proposal. Many voters took issue with the very idea of early childhood education. Some called it “social engineering” and “a government overreach.” Those opinions can be seen in the News-Leader’s coverage of the election. \n\"The reason I voted against it was because of the part about the (early childhood development). That's one thing I think they messed up. The state and our government are too much in our lives the way it is. It wasn't because I didn't want the sheriff and police departments to have more money. ... ,\" a Republic man told the News-Leader at the polls back in 2005. “I'm not quite sure about the children's part, I think that's still the responsibility of the family.” Springfield city employee in 2005 \nEven some of those who voted for the tax were suspicious of the early education component. \nOn the day of the vote, a Springfield city employee who voted yes because the tax would benefit law enforcement needs, told the News-Leader he was dubious of the early education plan. \n\"I'm not quite sure about the children's part,\" said that employee. \"I think that's still the responsibility of the family.\" \nOne of the strongest opponents to the measure was a local radio commentator at KSGF named Vincent David Jericho, Coonrod said. \n“He beat us bloody even though we tried to reasonably explain what we were trying to do,” Coonrod said. “He took it as government interfering in the way you raise your children. And that’s the drum he beat all the way to the election.” \nCoonrod said proponents went on a “rubber chicken tour,” speaking with local civics groups about the benefits of early education programs. But those efforts did not gain nearly enough traction with average voters, he said. \nCoonrod said he thinks things could be different if there is a new vote. That’s because people now generally have a better understanding of what early education programs are, he said. He noted Arkansas and Oklahoma have programs to provide universal preschool programs and there has been a push on the federal level too. \n“The bottom line is we were way out ahead of the parade,” Coonrod said, later adding “It was too much to lay out on the table. Early childhood development and it’s interactions and its interweaving with society, in particular the criminal justice system.” Share This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:28:54.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
