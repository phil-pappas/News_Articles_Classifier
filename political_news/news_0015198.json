He was instrumental – both at the strategic and implementation levels – in deepening Israel's bilateral economic relations with a number of countries, including the United States , Germany , Canada , and China . Kandel was the Israeli Head of the Joint China-Israel Bilateral Task Force on Economic Relations, which was established by the Premier of China and the Prime Minister of Israel during the Prime Minister's visit to China in 2013.

During the two-year period in which he co-led this initiative, Kandel worked closely with China's and Israel's governments and businesses to expand trade and investment opportunities for Israel.\n\"Among the most promising economic trends in Israel is its innovation economy,\" said Kandel. \"As Head of the NEC, I was fortunate to witness firsthand the remarkable impact that technology and entrepreneurs are having on Israel. Start-Up Nation Central exists to help enhance this trend and to bring businesses, investors, and governments to Israel – to work closely with Israeli innovators – to solve complex business and technology problems facing the world.\"\nLeading players from Israel's innovation community applauded the appointment of Kandel.\n\"His global perspective, his experience at world-class academic institutions, and his proven track record in driving a number of the country's unprecedented economic achievements, make Kandel a natural choice for Start-Up Nation Central,\" said Michael Eisenberg of Aleph, a leading venture capital fund headquartered in Tel Aviv. \"Kandel's appointment will further catapult Start-Up Nation Central as a central entry point for international business executives looking to navigate and better leverage Israel's greatest natural resource – its inventors and entrepreneurs.\"\nAdditional statements from a number of Israel's top technology and life sciences executives are available upon request.\n\"Eugene is truly unique.
