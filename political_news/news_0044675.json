FILE PHOTO | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Speaking at a workshop with the Commission for Revenue Allocation at the Serena Hotel in Mombasa on Friday, senators from poorer regions supported a proposal by the constitutional body to limit funds to Nairobi. The city boasts better roads, electricity connection and water distribution, among other basic amenities, unlike counties like Tana River, Isiolo, Mandera and Lamu. Advertisement More by this Author \nSenators have proposed to reduce the amount of money given to Nairobi County to slow down development in the city for other regions to catch up. \nSpeaking at a workshop with the Commission for Revenue Allocation at the Serena Hotel in Mombasa on Friday, senators from poorer regions supported a proposal by the constitutional body to limit funds to Nairobi. \nThe city boasts better roads, electricity connection and water distribution, among other basic amenities, unlike counties like Tana River, Isiolo, Mandera and Lamu. \n“The main reason for devolution is to put poor counties at par with the others. Nairobi has better roads, health services, electricity distribution and other infrastructure. Capping funding to slow its development is the solution to inequitable development,” said Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale. \nNairobi has been the highest beneficiary of shareable revenue in the last three years. In 2013 it was allocated Sh9.5 billion, the following year Sh11 billion and this year it is set to pocket Sh13 billion. \n“You cannot say because Nairobi is contributing 60 per cent to the national economy it should get more funds,” said Mombasa Senator Omar Hassan. \nLawmakers, mostly from perceived wealthy counties, rejected the proposal. \n“If we aprrove the proposal, what will happen when, for instance, Turkana and Lamu catch up? Will we be putting caps on each county that is considered developed?” asked Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi. \nNominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro said Nairobi had a fair share of poor people who needed better services.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:54:11.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
