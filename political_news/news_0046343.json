By 1982, the company's own analysis of climate models found temperatures could rise up to 5 degrees from the \"connection between Exxon's major business and the role of fossil fuel combustion in contributing to the increase in atmospheric CO2.\" By 1991, a senior researcher at the company's Canadian subsidiary said such temperature rises \"will clearly affect sea ice, icebergs, permafrost and sea levels.\"\"If at any point in that journey Exxon -- largest oil company on Earth, most profitable enterprise in human history -- had said: 'Our own research shows that these scientists are right and that we are in a dangerous place,' the faux debate would effectively have ended,\" McKibben wrote. \"ThatÂ’s all it would have taken; stripped of the cover provided by doubt, humanity would have gotten to work.\" Yet, publicly, Exxon funded institutes to cook up reports denying the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community and, as it happens, its own researchers. There needs to be jail time here. Like with tobacco, there has to be jail time and monetary reimbursement here on out on all bad climate changes which result in damages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:43:48.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
