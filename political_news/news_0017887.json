It’s her program of taking in Muslim migrants that represents the gravest threat to the freedom and future of Europe since the fall of the Soviet Union.\nMerkel may have already doomed Germany. The Bild newspaper published a leaked secret government document estimating that the number of migrants invading Europe this year might reach 1.5 million.\nAnd that bad news gets much worse because the document estimates that each migrant will bring in as many as eight family members once they’re settled in, bringing the year’s true total to 7.36 million.\nThat’s almost 10 percent of the population of Germany. In just one invasion.” – Daniel Greenfield", "external_links": ["http://www.michellesmirror.com/2015/10/why-are-you-all-so-cynical.html", "http://www.rightwingriot.com/archives/1841", "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/09/vox-dems-totally-stoked-over-hillarys-plan-to-rule-by-decree-or-something/", "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/obama-roseburg-shooting-armed-protesters", "http://qz.com/520652/groundwork-eric-schmidt-startup-working-for-hillary-clinton-campaign/", "http://badblue.bitnamiapp.com/trendr8.htm", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/09/vote-paul-ryan-vote-amnesty-luis-gutierrez-endorses-paul-ryan-speaker/", "http://althouse.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-federal-government-just-stopped.html", "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/260393/muslim-migrants-increase-crime-germany-65-daniel-greenfield", "http://www.steynonline.com/7225/safe-space-totalitarian-groupthink", "http://www.henrydampier.com/2015/10/sucks-to-your-iq/", "http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/drip-drip-drip_1042861.html?page=1#.VhevT0bc_S0.twitter", "http://badblue.com/tech", "http://politistick.com/youll-cheer-when-you-see-what-these-missouri-college-students-did-the-the-isis-flag/", "http://rightwingnews.com/column-2/clintons-leftward-tack-on-immigration-and-guns-has-risks-for-november/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/world/europe/ankara-turkey-explosion-deaths.html?_r=0", "http://lidblog.com/renee-ellmers-addresses-the-affair-rumors/", "http://godfatherpolitics.com/25596/congressman-trey-gowdy-rips-gop-establishment-leader/", "http://therightscoop.com/un-secretary-general-issues-despicable-statement-condemning-israel/", "http://directorblue.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/https://www.tedcruz.org/", "http://www.activistpost.com/2015/10/the-mystery-of-isis-toyota-army-solved.html", "http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/10/shirley-sherrod-case-settled-now-put-to-bed-myth-that-breitbarts-tape-misleading/?", "http://gotnews.com/breaking-dc-sources-renee-ellmers-kevin-mccarthy-to-resign/", "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/260399/million-man-fraud-comes-washington-matthew-vadum", "http://www.weaselzippers.us/236396-irony-lost-dems-meet-to-talk-more-gun-control-surrounded-by-armed-guards/?", "http://www.3ders.org/articles/20151009-ekaggrat-kalsi-3d-prints-cool-doodle-clock-that-perpetually-writes-time-on-a-magnetic-board.html?utm_medium=twitter&#038;utm_source=twitterfeed", "http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2009/10/get-yer-steaming-hot-larwyns-linx-blog.html", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/09/russia-s-new-mega-missile-stuns-the-globe.html", "http://panampost.com/panam-staff/2015/10/02/venezuelan-governor-suggests-eating-fried-rocks-amid-shortages/", "http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/10/when-is-a-hillary-scandal-not-a-hillary-scandal/", "http://www.publiusforum.com/2015/10/09/fire-the-leeches-now-federal-employees-make-78-percent-more-than-private-sector-workers/", "http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2015/10/09/if_the_republicans_are_imploding_over_kevin_mccarthy_why_aren_t_the_drive_bys_happy_about_it", "http://searchengineland.com/google-won-pr-battle-seo-thats-good-thing-232761?", "http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2015/10/09/cnn-tracks-down-latino-trump-supporter-to-question-her-about-las-vegas-event/", "http://patterico.com/2015/10/09/applying-obamas-lecture-on-mass-shootings-to-his-own-policy-of-killing-innocent-people/", "http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/10/08/saving-the-west/", "http://rightwingnews.com/column-2/the-more-you-politicize-guns-the-weaker-your-case-becomes/", "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/260392/muslim-madness-merkel-daniel-greenfield#.VhfaG8EiTNo.twitter", "http://www.thecommentator.com/article/6105/hillary_clinton_s_increasingly_awkward_campaign", "http://directorblue.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:37:20.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
