But if you are one of the Kardashians, you don’t go to festivals... you bring them home. And that is precisely what celebrity couple Kim and Kanye did for their tot North West for her first birthday — they brought a kid version of the Coachella Festival right into their backyard. The ‘Kidchella’ themed party saw the Kardashian clan come together and put up a Karaoke performance and even erected a giant ferris wheel right in their backyard. The party also featured a special bouncy castle for North and her friends that cost a cool $15,000. The whole affair is said to have cost a lot more.\nSophia Ecclestone (Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland’s daughter)\nThe F1 couple’s only daughter, Sophia is the rightful heir to Grandpa Bernie’s Formula One Empire. And no less than a princess of any actual empire, Sophia’s birthday bash too was a royal affair. Proud parents Tamara and Jay went the whole nine yards to give Sophia a day to remember, replete with ‘S’ shaped special balloons, four-foot high castle cakes and even exotic zoo animals. What’s more, the couple even invited Disneyland princesses to make it a truly magical and fairytale affair. The event reportedly cost a whopping £70,000, according to some sources.\nJayden and Sean Preston (Britney Spears’ sons)\nChildren’s birthdays are special events, whether you are a celebrity or not. But in that sense, hit-maker Britney Spears seems to be quite lucky seeing how both her sons Jayden and Sean’s birthdays come in close proximity with just a day’s gap in the middle. And with double the reason to celebrate, the pop star sure went overboard with her celebrations as she threw a grand skateboard themed bash for her young sons replete with a great music and a gigantic DJ console-themed cake from Linda Cohen Cake Pops.\nSuri Cruise (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ only child)\nDoting parents Katie and Tom sure don’t think twice before splurging on their darling tot Suri Cruise. The superstar couple spent a whopping $100,000 on their daughter’s eighth birthday — a cool $4,000 on flowers alone. With a four-tier cake, thousands of pounds of flowers and an array of pink balloons, the Cruises seem to be setting the bar higher with each passing year. And while the bash was high on money, it wasn’t low on love as well, as mommy put in special effort to decorate cupcakes to wish Suri a ‘happy birthday’, spelling each letter with a cupcake.\nBlue Ivy Carter (Jay Z and Beyonce’s little girl)\nMusic royalty Beyonce and Jay Z had already set the bar pretty high with their daughter Blue Ivy Carter’s previous birthdays with one featuring a $80,000 diamond encrusted Barbie Doll and the other featuring a $30,000 playhouse. So it was evident that the couple had to do something special for her grand third birthday bash. So the couple went ahead and booked an entire zoo for Ivy’s party and even threw in a little reunion of mommy Beyonce’s previous band members from her Destiny’s Child days. The affair was certainly a royal one as it even featured both the Queen Bee and the li’l princess’ wearing tiaras.\n North West Sophia Ecclestone Jayden and Sean Preston birthday bash sunday chronicle Also Read When I take shots, I see god I still feel like an outsider: Kabir Khan Pedal ‘posh’ers ride along A fashionable tale", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151004/commentary-sunday-chronicle/article/children-fancier-ilk-0", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/SURI%20CRUISE_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/SURI%20CRUISE_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:52:31.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
