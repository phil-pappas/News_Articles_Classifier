This report is required by Italian Law, within 90 days of the initial ruling. \nAlso to be kept in mind is that there is no NOT GUILTY verdict in Italy: the possibilities are:- \n1) The appellant is insane. \n2) The crime did not exist. \n3) NOT HAVING COMMITTED THE ACT, which is what was applied here, and wrongly interpreted by some Knox/Sollecito supporters to signify complete exoneration. \nThis commentary is not intended to be a complete analysis of the whole report, but is based on MY OWN TRANSLATION, and presupposes some knowledge of the case. First, it must be understood that Marasca had to accept three judicial truths, already confirmed:- \n1)There were multiple participants. \n2) The burglary was staged. \n3) Amanda Knox is guilty of calumny- naming an innocent man as the murderer. \nThe remit of this panel was not to retry the case, but to consider the points of appeal. Anyone familiar with the case will be aware of the the objections of ex defendants:- \nThere was no motive; international protocols governing collection of forensic data were violated; there exists the impossibility of the removal of selective traces; the witnesses were unreliable; the weapon identified was incorrect; items contained in Guede’s in camera trial were used by the prosecution whereas the defence had no opportunity to cross examine…. These objections are well known to all who have followed this trial. \nIn Knox’s case, there is also the assertion that the false confession was made under duress, -and new for Sollecito- that Knox’s putative involvement had a negative effect on his appeal, and that in any case he was not named in the “confession” as being present at the scene. \nIn addition Sollecito claimed that further investigation into his computer gave him an electronic alibi at the time of the murder. \nSo, these were the specific points the judges had to consider. Without a shadow of doubt, the report issues an absolutely blistering attack on the collection of evidence, the destruction of computers which could have yielded vital clues, the absence of any credible motive, including those assigned in previous trials. The witnesses were considered too unreliable to secure a safe conviction. That there is no evidence whatsoever to place the exdefendants in the murder room concurrent with the murder is confirmed as fact. \nHowever, this is the point at which many news outlets have halted their reporting, thereby falsely leading non Italian speaking readers to believe this is the sum total of the report, and indeed many were gleefully reporting just that, only hours after the issue of the report, long before a proper thorough translation was available. To report in this way is not only misleading; it is irresponsible and reprehensible. \nSo, I propose to redress that imbalance somewhat. \nOne very interesting, but neglected piece of reasoning, which actually does not involve Knox and Sollecito in any way, is that the murder resembled an EXECUTION , (although admittedly the judges do not use that word), word rather than a disorganised attempt to cover up a botched robbery. \n“We are referring to multiple elements, linked to the complex reconstruction of the crime, which rule out Guede having acted alone.” ( p 28 ) \nIn the same paragraph there is a reference to the “chilling nature” of the murder. Now given that the presence of Knox and Sollecito is excluded from the murder room, what were the judges alluding to? \nWho, if not Knox and Sollecito, was in that room, leaving no trace? There is no further elaboration, and this observation is easily missed. We have to make our own inferences here, if we so wish. \nAnyway, back to our protagonists. Missing from many media reports is that the judges placed the exdefendants at the cottage, although not in Meredith’s bedroom and at an indeterminable time. \nPage 46, third paragraph. :- \n“Another factor against her ( AK) is the mixed DNA, hers and the victim’s in the smaller bathroom, which is evident proof that she had contact with the victim’s blood, which she tried to wash out. The traces of the victim correspond in fact to washed out blood while those referring to AK correspond to a rubbing of the skin. These however are not unequivocal proof, since she could have been in contact with the blood some time after the murder, in the likely attempt to remove the most evident traces of what happened. Again, this behaviour can be seen as an attempt to cover up for herself or someone else, but not necessarily proof of her direct involvement in the murder.” \nI have been taken to task on this by advocates of the innocence of Knox and Sollecito, who claim this is evidence of the judges’ ruminations regarding different hypotheses, but by this time we are nearing the end of the report, and it is reasonable to infer that this is the opinion of the Marasca panel. \nSimilarly, Knox’s claim to have been under severe psychological pressure is dismissed, ( possibly because the calunnia conviction is now a judicial truth), but more likely, as I interpret it, that the Judges just did not find the ‘false confession” theory credible. \nThe theory that she did so in order to avoid psychological pressure from detectives seems extremely weak.” \nAnd if we scrutinise the reasoning regarding Sollecito, the fact that his NARUTO cartoon was playing on the file sharing site of his computer did not require his presence, and therefore this alibi is not sustained. \nIn fact, the final pages denounce the credibility of the ex defendants, reasoning that it is just not plausible that Knox, on encountering the scene she described, did not immediately telephone Sollecito for help. \n“On the other hand, given that the presence of Ms. Knox inside the house is certain, it is hardly credible that he was not with her. And also, if we follow one of the versions given by Knox, whether it be the second one, which, on returning to her home dwelling on the morning of the 2nd of Nov, after the night spent in her boyfriend’s house, she would have realised immediately that something strange had occurred ( door open, traces of blood everywhere.), or the other, extracted from the memoriale, according to which she was present in the house at the time of the murder, but in a different room from the one where the ferocious attack on Ms Kercher was taking place, it seems strange that she had not phoned her boyfriend, but yet there was no telephone communication between them, based on the acquired telephone data. “( p52) \nThe Report concludes by referring to “strong suspicions” and “conflicting evidence” which lead to a reasoning that no further trial would serve any useful purpose, and therefore the appellants are acquitted under section 2 of the Italian penal code: that is to say when there is insufficient or contradictory evidence on which to base a conviction. \nAs my own final words, I do not wish the reader to infer that I wish to implicate or condemn the exdefendants in any way. My insistence that the whole report be considered, with all parts disclosed, is rooted in an objection to the selective or purposefully misleading reporting elsewhere. \nThe Marasca panel applied the law and its own logic to this appeal, and the way forward for the Italian judiciary is to learn from the mistakes made in this trial. Its implications go far beyond. Protocol must be adhered to; certainty must be reached. All should be transparent- hopefully to improve the system and reduce the possibility of wrongful convictions or wrongful acquittals. \n25 Current Visitors On This Page CRYPTOCURRENCY COMING TO COMMODITIES SOON Commodities are powered by Investing.com RECENT ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:26:15.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
