Tuesday, 13 October 2015, 12:43 pm Press Release: Ministry For Culture And Heritage \nSubmissions close this Friday on the discussion document Content Regulation in a Converged World. \nTime is running out to put forward submissions on media content regulation in the discussion document Content Regulation in a Converged World released by Broadcasting and Communications Minister Amy Adams. \nPaul Barker, Acting Cultural Policy Branch Manager, Ministry for Culture and Heritage says submissions, closing this Friday 16 October, provide an opportunity for industry and public views on the regulations affecting today’s media landscape. \n“Released in August, Content Regulation in a Converged World asks people what they think about everything from Sunday morning advertising to the rules around general election programmes and content classification across various media,” Paul Barker said. \n“As much of our regulation was designed around traditional forms of delivery the current system for content regulation treats content differently depending on the medium through which it’s delivered. \n“In the modern media environment, consumers can access a range of content through a range of devices, at any time and it’s timely to ensure our legislation is fit for purpose. \n“We want to ensure regulation is flexible and fair, and reflects the way people do business and consume media today and in the future. This is why we want to get views from people from all walks of life as well as the media industry. \n“We want to ensure policy and legislation is durable, technology-neutral and supports innovation and change and at the same time helps business and consumers to reap the advantages of digital transformation,” Paul Barker said. \nMore information and the discussion document can be found at: http://www.mch.govt.nz/contentregulation and in this Two-page summary on content discussion document . \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:04:59.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
