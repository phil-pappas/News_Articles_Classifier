(photo credit:REUTERS)   Israel is urging various leaders around the world to impress upon Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas the need to stop incitement and try to rein in the raging terrorism, Israeli government officials said Monday. The comments came after EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called both Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday evening in an effort – her office said in a statement Monday – to “promote calm, encourage restraint and avoid actions which would fuel tensions even further.” According to the statement, Mogherini said, “Too many people have died already and too many families were left bereaved.” She condemned terrorism against civilians, and “stressed that any reaction should be proportionate.”These conversations followed talks US Secretary of State John Kerry held over the weekend with both Netanyahu and Abbas.Meanwhile, a delegation of representatives from the Quartet that was expected to arrive on Wednesday to discuss how to restart a diplomatic process has reportedly postponed its visit at Jerusalem’s request. Over the last two days Israeli officials never confirmed that the visit would take place. According to the EU statement, Mogherini told both leaders the only way to tackle the violence and unrest was to quickly restart a credible political process. “The immediate priority is for the parties to agree on substantial steps which would improve the situation on the ground and build a path back to final status negotiations. A negotiated two-state solution is the only way to bring the lasting peace and security that both Israelis and Palestinians deserve,” she said. According to Mogherini, Abbas told her he is determined to keep the situation under control, and Netanyahu assured her he was committed to maintaining the status quo. “President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have both expressed their willingness to work on the implementation of the provisions agreed at the Quartet meeting in New York at the end of September,” Mogherini said. At that meeting, which took place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, the Quartet – the US, EU, Russia and the UN – urged Israelis and Palestinians to take significant steps to achieve a two-state solution, but stopped short of initiating a new peace process.
