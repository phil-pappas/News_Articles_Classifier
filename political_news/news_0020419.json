The election will take place in two phases, concluding in early December. \nFew candidates have broad recognition or clear platforms, and most have a pro-government bent. \nThe vote will mark the final step in what has been billed as a transition to democracy. But critics say the next legislature is likely to be a rubber-stamp body that further solidifies the power of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, a former general who led Morsi's overthrow.
