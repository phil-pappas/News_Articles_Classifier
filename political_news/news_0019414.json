Picture: PUXLEY MAKGATHO Related articles Number of black CEOs in SA declining‚ and few positioned for the top Leadership battle in starting blocs Faltering progress in Africa worries governments, investors In this article People: Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma AFRICAN countries need strong government institutions and political parties to prevent conflict on the continent, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Tuesday.\nMs Dlamini-Zuma, the African Union Commission chairwoman, has been touted as a possible replacement for President Jacob Zuma should he step down at the African National Congress’s (ANC’s) 2017 elective conference.\nShe was addressing a dinner to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Tiso Foundation, a public benefit organisation focusing on youth development, leadership and education.\n\"The lessons we can learn from recent history in conflict-ridden areas is that we must have strong government institutions, the rule of law and, even, strong political parties,\" she said.\nShe cited the conflict in South Sudan as an example of why strong political parties were important in maintaining stability. The battles within that country’s governing party had spilt over into the rest of society and caused havoc.\nHer comments come as the ANC is battling to contain factionalism and its damaging effects on the organisation.\nMs Dlamini-Zuma is a proponent of African solutions to African problems, saying the continent is young and filled with opportunities and possibilities. However inequality continues to blight the continent.\nEducation, she said, is the fastest \"equaliser\", and called for a focus on higher education, as well as building strong foundations at primary and secondary levels.\nShe also described Africa importing 83% of its food as the \"biggest scandal of the 21st century\", because the continent had 60% of the world’s arable land. Young Africans had to be encouraged to view agriculture as a possible career path, she said.\nBut energy and transport remained constraints to development across sectors.\nMs Dlamini-Zuma also punted easy travel among African countries by doing away with visas, as Rwanda has done.\n\"It can be done, but we need to see how we can manage it,\" she said.\nAn Africa-wide passport was another possibility, which could entrench a spirit of Pan-Africanism.\nMs Dlamini-Zuma’s name, meanwhile, has been raised as the ANC contemplates the possibility of having a woman president.\nShe said women were in the majority on the continent and should not be seen as a \"vulnerable\" group, but rather as \"unexplored talent\".\nSA was closing the gender gap, however, black female students remained under-represented at tertiary institutions in the fields of maths and science.\nTurning to leadership, Ms Dlamini-Zuma said people needed to \"think beyond their immediate ambitions\" to take the country forward, as the founders of the Tiso Foundation had done when the organisation was founded in 2005.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:25:14.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
