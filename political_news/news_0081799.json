Get things done on this day, but don't work yourself to the point of exhaustion, which can be a fault of this transit.\nLustful Venus enters innocent Virgo on Thursday, October 8, turning romances frigid. If this is the case, work to reestablish passion.\nMercury stations direct by this weekend, ending a period of retrograde. Problems concerning communication, transport, transit, and technology should improve. Unresolved issues between people are more easily addressed and amended.\nVenus and Saturn form hard aspects on Saturday, October 10, so be wary of falling victim to fears about relationships, thinking that they are worse than they are. Saturn often indicates acute dissatisfaction with people who do not live up to rigorous and rigid standards. This time is best for self-reflection and introspection.\nLibra (September 23–October 22)\nThis week you may have difficulty relating to others, feeling cool and reserved even toward those you love. You will have to spend time reevaluating what you are getting out of your relationships and what you are putting into them. It may be time for you to make some major decisions and readjustments.\nScorpio (October 23–November 21)\nNow it is necessary to separate yourself from the illusions that run through even the best relationship, and to look at what is really there. You and your loved ones are only human, and there is a limit to what you can expect of others and of yourself. You may feel guilty about your imagined inadequacies with regard to your loved ones, but do not take these feelings too seriously. Instead, focus on your future together.\nSagittarius (November 22–December 21)\nThis is a good week to be by yourself, no matter how lonely you feel, for if you sought company, you would still feel lonely. This time is best for reflective contemplation. What you learn will improve your relationships when this transit is over, so look forward to enlightenment and happiness.\nCapricorn (December 22–January 19)\nThis is not usually a depressing transit, but it can be made into one by working too hard. Loneliness, whether justified or not, is a danger of this transit, because you may mentally isolate yourself from other people and disregard the lighter side of life. Avoid separating yourself from others unnecessarily and make an effort to remain cheerful.\nAquarius (January 20–February 18)\nNow is a good time to look around with a critical eye and see what needs to be changed or corrected in your environment. You are very conscious of the flaws of everything you look at, but you are not so overwhelmed that you cannot see the good as well. You want to make the situation better, not simply be a carping critic.\nPisces (February 19–March 20)\nYour mind is on serious concerns, and although you are not likely to feel depressed or to have other negative feelings, you are not attracted to frivolity or lightheartedness either. Now you respect people who have more experience than you do, and you are likely to turn to them for advice. Or someone else may cast you in this role and come to you for help. Older people, especially, are likely to be of service in this way.\nAries (March 21–April 19)\nThis week you will work very efficiently on any lingering or tedious project that requires your absolute focus and concentration. But it is best to avoid any work that requires great breadth of scope and vision. You are much more concerned with details than with overall patterns, and in dealing with larger structures, you may be overwhelmed by the fine points.\nTaurus (April 20–May 20)\nIt is quite possible that this transit will signify someone coming into your life who will act as a teacher or guide in your quest for meaning. It is also possible that you will play this role for someone else. The only recommendation is to be careful not to overidealize such a person, and not to allow yourself to be overidealized, for this could lead to disappointment later on. In spite of this problem, the chances are that everything will work out very favorably in the long run.\nGemini (May 21–June 20)\nYou have a strong desire to reform and remake at this time, and you should be striving to improve conditions all around you, to renew and to serve as a vehicle for regeneration in your world. If you attain personal power in any way at all, use it to clear up and clean out. You may have the chance to lead or influence others, so use that influence to help them grow with you.\nCancer (June 21–July 22)\nYou should realize that under this transit it is quite easy to exert power and make changes. The energies seem to flow in the direction you want, presenting you with opportunities for taking control in some way. Subordinates and assistants will be especially helpful, so delegate responsibly.\nLeo (July 23–August 22)\nThis transit can coincide with professional success, political power, or tremendous gains in personal wealth and resources. On a more humble level, this transit can give you the chance to straighten out situations in your life that have been sources of trouble for you.\nVirgo (August 23–September 22)\nYou should be motivated by something more than your own personal ambition, even though that will be favored along with any ambition in your life now. But if this power is selfish and personally oriented, you will have trouble later on, and the results will not be lasting. You must recognize that you benefit most when you can couple your own interests with those of the people you live and work with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:10:31.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
