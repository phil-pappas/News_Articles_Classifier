(Photo: PTI) Lucknow: In a direct attack on BJP in the aftermath of Dadri killing, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday alleged the 'chalu' (cunning) party was bent on disturbing atmosphere in the state with an eye on polls and suggested countering them \"intelligently\".\n\"They bring a new topic every six month. First, it was Make in India, then it was Swachh Bharat and now its Digital India,\" he said.\nAkhilesh said, \"While this is happening on one hand, different issues are being raised in UP every six month. The objective is only one -- who forms the government in days to come.\"\nReferring to Badaun incident in which two cousins were allegedly raped and found hanging from a tree, the chief minister said, \"I had no inkling as to how far the matter would have its echo. We had to give explanation everywhere. Big organisations raised the issue before the United Nations, but at last reality came out...\"\nThe CBI had found no evidence of murder or sexual assault in its probe into the death of two teenage cousins, whose bodies were found hanging from a tree in the district in May lat year.\nThe chief minister said that his party was taking the state on the path of progress.\n\"Some persons want to distract the attention of the people from the efforts of Samajwadis, who are taking the state on the path of progress and prosperity,\" he said while addressing a function here.\nPointing out some of the projects of the Samajwadi Party government, Yadav said his government was constructing metro and Lucknow-Agra Expressway, and has also distributed 'Samajwadi' pension and laptops among students.\nAfter enumerating the achievements, the chief minister said, \"BJP and other communal forces feel that they should distract the attention of the people from these schemes and poison their minds.\"\nThe CM said, \"Who is disturbing the atmosphere in UP? I have already said that they are 'chalu' (cunning) persons and we have to counter them intelligently.\"\n\"This is up to the people to decide. While on one hand there are progress loving people, secular Samajwadis, on the other there are persons who want to bring issues which have nothing to do with the development.\"\nYadav was speaking at a prize distribution function here to honour high school and intermediate students, who got highest marks in Urdu.\n UP CM attacks BJP Akhilesh Yadav communal forces nation Also Read Bitter Ranjit Sinha won’t demean CBI, PM Modi to chair meet today to choose new chief No AP State Road Transport fare hike despite losses: Transport minister Masarat Alam release: Will take up all issues with PDP at Cabinet meeting, says BJP TD: KCR is into political prostitution", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/akhilesh-yadav-_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/nation-politics/article/cm-attacks-‘chalu’-bjp-says-they-‘want-poison-peoples-mind’", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/akhilesh-yadav-_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:30:17.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
