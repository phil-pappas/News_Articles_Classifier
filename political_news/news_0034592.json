(Photo: PTI) Bengaluru: Former India captain Dhanraj Pillay on Monday batted for the participation of Pakistani players in Hockey India League (HIL) and suggested the league authorities to siphon off some money for setting up academies to develop and improve the quality of the sport in India.\nPillay said Hockey India should have taken permission from the politicians to allow Pakistani players to participate in Hockey India League. \"Hockey India should have taken permission from the politicians to allow Pakistani players to participate in the HIL. I don't think they would have any issues with that,\" he told PTI in an exclusive interview here.\nPillay is in the city for the second edition of Bengaluru Cup which is being played at the Hockey Stadium here. Pillay is guiding Air India team.\nThe crux of the matter is that Pakistanis refused to tender apology for their misconduct and hence they have banned them from playing in the HIL, Pillay said. \"The problem is they have not apologised for their misconduct, that happens. However, things could have been sorted if the federations would have approached the politicians,\" he said.\nRead: Pakistani players make obscene gestures to crowd after beating India, coach apologises\nThe International Hockey Federation (FIH) on December 14 last year banned two Pakistani players for one match each in the aftermath of Pakistan's victory over India in the Champions Trophy semifinal.\nAfter winning the game 4-3 in a thrilling battle, several Pakistani players had removed their shirts, danced in jubilation, and raised obscene gestures towards the crowd.\n\"The HIL authorities should give some money for setting up of academies to breed young talents and bring them onto the world stage,\" he said.\n\"We had appointed Roelant Oltmans as the High Performance Director, but did not give any grassroot programme for developing and improving the sport in India. Oltmans was aiming only at the established players whether they were playing for a junior, sub-junior, under-21 or senior team. He slowly spread his wings, came closer to Hockey India official, and now he is been appointed as India Hockey Coach,\" he said.\nAlso Read: 'I hope Pakistan players give India a befitting reply when we next meet them in a match'\nOn the issue of foreign coach, Pillay said the country does not require them because the country has enough quality coaches. \"Moreover Dhyanchand, Daljeet Singh Dhillon, Jugaraj Singh and myself are products of Indian coaches, not foreign,\" Pillay argued.\n\"Foreign coaches also do not give hundred per cent to different countries and language is the biggest barrier as Indian players do not understand English,\" Pillay said.\nAsked if he would follow in the footsteps of Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to buy a Hockey India League team, Pillay said he has no wherewithal to buy one, but could start a league spending Rs 20 lakh in Maharashtra.\nAlso Read: Indo-Pak hockey issue is solely between them: FIH\n\"I don't think. I am not in a position to buy a team, but I can start something like a Pune and Mumbai League by spending Rs 20 lakh. I cannot spend Rs 6 crore on buying a team,\" he said.\nReplying to yet another query, Pillay said the Hockey India League has raised money in the sport and now the players are getting huge money which is good. \"When I started my career in 1992, I was earning Rs 1.25 lakh, but now players are earning almost Rs 70 lakh. Yes, the league has not only brought lot of money to players but also to federations,\" he said.\n hockey India Pakistan Dhanraj Pillay Hockey India League Roelant Oltmans Also Read 'Would love to have Pak players, but not with bad behaviour' Hockey: Pakistani players make obscene gestures to crowd after beating India, coach apologises No FIH event in India till Pakistan players are punished: Hockey India", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/sports-other-sports/article/dhanraj-pillay-bats-pakistanis-participation", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Dhanraj_PTI_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Dhanraj_PTI_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:52:55.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
