Many in the community have said they were angered by his pro-gun-control remarks hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College.\n\"I've got some very strong feelings about this, because when you talk to these families, you're reminded that this could be happening to your child, or your mom, or your dad, or your relative or your friend,\" Obama somberly told reporters after meeting with survivors at Roseburg High School. \"And so we're going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place. \"\nHowever, the president added, \"Today it's about the families and their grief, and the love we feel for them. And they surely do appreciate all the support that they've received.\"\nOne woman, leaving the high school after meeting the president, refused to stop for an interview. But she said emphatically, \"It wasn't a discussion, it was a hug.\"\nShe was likely referring to the noisy discussion taking place at the airport – where he helicoptered in from Eugene – and outside the high school, where most of the demonstrators made it clear that they didn't welcome him to Roseburg.\n\"Just by being here, he politicizes\" the shooting deaths, said Chuck Cooper, a retired homebuilder from Oakland, Oregon, arguing that the president's goal was not to console victims but to build support for new restrictions on guns.\nA large banner, \"Obama Go Home,\" was hung at the entrance to the airport, and signs berated his stands on guns while others praised the local sheriff, John Hanlin, for his past insistence that he wouldn't enforce gun restrictions he regarded as unconstitutional.\nPresident Obama arrives in Roseburg President Obama arrived by helicopter at Roseburg airport on Friday afternoon.\nAt one point, a truck raced past the airport crowd as a young man leaned out the window joyfully waving a Confederate flag.\nOthers welcomed the president, albeit in seemingly smaller numbers. About a dozen people who said they were past or present students at the community college waved signs in front of the high school welcoming Obama.\n\"We're about peace and love, nothing political,\" said Sara Garcia, an unemployed Roseburg resident who said she attended the school in 2012.\nInside the high school, the president gave plenty of embraces, passed out commemorative presidential coins and had a particularly emotional exchange with Matthew Downing. He's the 18-year-old Umpqua student who was in the classroom where the shootings occurred but was not fired on after the gunman gave him a package and told him to give it to the police.\nGov. Kate Brown, who accompanied Obama to the high school, said the president told Downing, \"You're here for a reason and don't forget that.\"\nObama supporter hopes to represent 'silent majority' Dulcie Bagley, a resident of Roseburg, shows her support for President Obama.\nShe said the exchange was so moving she had to turn away. \"I had to give them a moment of privacy,\" the governor said.\nBrown said she came away convinced that the survivors who attended the meeting felt that Obama's visit was valuable.\n\"The individuals he spoke to were so comforted by him and so grateful he was present,\" said Brown.", "external_links": ["http://videos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2015/10/president_obama_arrives_in_ros.html", "http://topics.oregonlive.com/tag/umpqua%20community%20college%20shooting/posts.html", "http://videos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2015/10/obama_supporter_hopes_to_repre.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:37:04.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
