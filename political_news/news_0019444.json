He was shifted to the High Dependency Unit in early afternoon, as his condition showed some signs of improvement.\nSpeaking to dna, his elder brother Sartaj said that Danish had regained consciousness, and was able to communicate with the family.\nDanish has been admitted in the Kailash Hospital, in Noida, owned by Mahesh Sharma, BJP union minister, who received much criticism for his comments in Dadri after the attack for calling it an \"accident\".\n\"Danish is awake, he has eaten some dal and some custard,\" said Sartaj. \"He is able to talk to us, answer some basic questions. When we ask him how he is feeling he responds.\"\nHowever, Sartaj added, since it is a brain injury Danish's memory has been affected. He remembers nothing about the lynching that took his father's life and left him battling for his, after rumours spread in his village that his family had slaughtered a cow and were consuming beef.\nAccording to Sartaj, Danish knows he is hurt, can feel his injuries but does not know the cause for them.\n\"He was worried about his upcoming exams. I had to tell him the paper leaked and they had been postponed. Only then did he relax,\" said Sartaj. He said that, for now, he wanted all questions about the lynching kept away from Danish. \"I try not to let anyone ask him about what happened. I haven't told him about our father. He can go into trauma,\" he said. \"I appeal to everyone to pray for my brother's recovery, and to stand up for us so that justice can be done.\"\nHowever, Sartaj did not say whether the family would leave Bisara permanently. Though, the Indian Air Force, where he works as an engineer at the rank of Corporal, offered his family accommodation to an airbase or station, Sartaj said he would take the family elders' views into account before making any decision. \"I will also talk to the air force authorities as to what kind of security my family would need.\"\nMeanwhile, after Wednesday's peace meeting, the police has arrested two more people in Dadri for \"spreading hate\". The district magistrate NP Singh told the press that two people had been arrested from Jevar and Surajpur for spreading rumours through Whatsapp. Another person, who has been using a fake handle on twitter for spreading rumours that could incite violence, is being tracked. The DM said that youngster, most of them unemployed, were being targeted by political parties and fringe groups, and that the police was taking utmost care that no one broke the law.\n\"We warned Sadhvi Prachi that she would be arrested under section 153-A of the IPC, and she left,\" said Singh.\nHowever, he refused to comment on Sangeet Som specifically, though the latter had spoken to the villagers in Bisara on Sunday, promising help to bail out the accused.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:28:52.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
