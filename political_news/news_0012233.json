Since 2010, Cumbria Police have already had £20m taken from their funding.\nUnder proposed changes to police funding arrangements, announced by the Minister for Policing Mike Penning on Friday, Cumbria Police will lose £9.5m in funding.\nChief Constable Jerry Graham said: “Disappointingly, we have been advised that current funding formula proposals would mean Cumbria would lose highest proportion of our budget out of all the forces at 15.83%, which equates to £9.5 million.\n“This is obviously of great concern to Cumbria Constabulary, as there is only so much money that can be saved while retaining a viable policing service. We will be looking at these proposals in detail over the next few days and establishing what exactly it would mean for Cumbria’s people and communities.\"\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is forecasted to outline a minimum of £11.5m spending cuts when he delivers the Comprehensive Spending Review in November.\nAfter taking account of cost pressures such as inflation rises, the tally of spending cuts required from Cumbria Police rises to £26m.\n...there is only so much money that can be saved while retaining a viable policing service.\n– Chief Constable Jerry Graham Cumbria Constabulary now has until 30th October to respond to the Home Office with their concerns, which they say they will do in detail.\nPolice and Crime Commissioner, Richard Rhodes said: “Savings of £20million have already been achieved. These further reductions will mean that policing resources in Cumbria will have fallen by £46million over a ten year period to 2019/20.\n“Proposed cuts of this scale will have a significant impact on the level of policing within the county and I will now be working with the Chief Constable on ascertaining the future financial viability of the police service.\"\nLast updated Tue 13 Oct 2015 Read more 5 updates Cumbria Police funding cut by £26m Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:10:01.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
