As with the Korean deal we failed the first time around and Trade Minister Groser and Prime Minster Key’s language tells us this deal is way less than they promised. \n\"Two of our critical primary industries, on which we rely so much, know that they have been sold out. \n\"For Mr Groser to say he can’t comment because of the Canadian elections in two weeks’ time is unadulterated nonsense. He owes the New Zealand people the facts now and a comprehensive briefing now, not sometime after Christmas when everyone is on holiday. \n\"We want facts not hype and the devil is in the still secret details. \n\"The North American media is going mad on these negotiations whilst we have hardly woken up. \n\"We need to hear the facts from independent parties not internationalists, meaning National Party politicians. We don’t need cherry picking of percentages that look pretty but on examination, and set against inflation, look extremely elusive. \n\"Further negotiations will continue in a vacuum of secrecy. New Zealand First suspects that the final result will be way less than the ballyhoo we have been served up thus far. \n\"New Zealand was promised a stretch limo and we’re getting a low-price sedan. What can be said now is that our over 40-year battle to get a surplus of exports over imports has just got harder,\" says Mr Peters. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:02:56.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
