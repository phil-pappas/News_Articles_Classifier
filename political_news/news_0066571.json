Emmanuel Bautista said Otaza was instrumental in the surrender of 154 NPA rebels last May.\nHe emphasized Otaza's championing of programs to support rebel returnees in transitioning back into everyday life.\n\"Several NPA rebels who enjoy kinship with Mayor Otaza through the indigenous peoples network have indicated a desire to re-enter formal society because of the mayor’s integrity, credibility, and the success of his programs.\"\nOtaza and his wife joined the underground movement in the fight against Martial Law, but resurfaced in 1986 after the restoration of democracy.\nA member of the Manobo indigenous group, he later took a role in the government’s Service Caravan, which aims at extending basic government services to indigenous peoples.\nSince March 1969, the NPA has been waging one of Asia’s longest running insurgencies, which the military says has claimed more than 3,000 lives in the last eight years alone.\nTalks with the CPP and its armed wing were suspended a few years ago after the rebels demanded the release of their associates from custody.\nHowever, government negotiators said they were coordinating with Norway to determine how negotiations with the group can move forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:26:46.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
