John Boozman in Arkansas. \nEldridge's campaign said Thursday that the former federal prosecutor raised more than $403,000 between announcing his campaign on Sept. 9 and the end of the latest fundraising quarter on Sept. 30. He has $400,761 cash on hand. \nEldridge served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and stepped down in August preparing to launch his bid. \nBoozman was first elected to the Senate in 2010 and is seeking a second term. \nEldridge is running in a state where Republicans have made major gains in recent elections tying Democrats to President Barack Obama, who remains deeply unpopular in Arkansas. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
