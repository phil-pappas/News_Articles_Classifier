According to NASA, on an average, 10 to 20 meteors will be visible per hour during the Draconids.\nThe meteor display is caused by the remains of a comet raining down on earth. The shower originates from the constellation Draco in the far northern sky. Incidentally, the term Draco is Latin for dragon and was the name of Harry Potter’s arch-nemesis Draco Malfoy in JK Rowling’s books.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/04SG6OTHVUo"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:29:57.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
