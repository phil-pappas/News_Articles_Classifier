Martin O'Malley is defending his record despite the unrest this year in Baltimore, where he served as mayor before his two terms in Annapolis.\nHe says he \"didn't make our city immune to setbacks,\" but says \"we saved over 1,000 lives in Baltimore in the last 15 years and the vast majority of them were young and poor and black.\"\nO'Malley goes on to note that he enacted gun legislation in Maryland \"by leading with principle, not by pandering to the NRA.\"\nO'Malley identified in the audience the family of a victim of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting in 2012.\n___\n6:10 p.m.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is defending capitalism - and going after her most serious opponent in the process.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders describes himself as a Democratic socialist, and in Tuesday's debate he has praised countries like Denmark for their protection of workers.\nWhen the candidates were asked by debate moderator Anderson Cooper if they agree with Sanders' view, Clinton was quick to chime in. She says when she thinks about capitalism \"I think about the all the small businesses.\"\nClinton concedes that every so often capitalism needs to be saved from itself but \"our job is to rein the excesses of capitalism.\"\n___\n6:09 p.m.\nBernie Sanders is kicking off his first debate answer by listing some of his favorite countries - Denmark, Sweden and Norway.\nThe self-proclaimed Democratic socialist says all three nations are examples of places that provide for working people. Sticking with his progressive campaign message, Sanders is railing against a system in the United States that he says benefits the very wealthy.\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton seized on the comments from her top opponent in the race, saying capitalism can also help small businesses. \"We are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America,\" she proclaimed.\nSanders shot back that business growth is meaningless if it only benefits the \"top 1 percent.\"\n___\n6:08 p.m.\nLincoln Chafee says his views on the issues haven't changed, even though his political affiliation has.\nThe former Rhode Island governor and senator is a former Republican and independent. Now, when he's running for president, Chafee says he's a \"proud Democrat.\"\nIn the first Democratic debate, Chafee says despite those changes in political affiliation, on policy he is a \"block of granite.\"\nHe says, \"I have not changed on the issues.\"\nChafee says the Republican Party left him and there was no room for a liberal moderate in the GOP.\n___\n6:05 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is immediately defending changing her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement last week.\nShe says, \"Like most human beings, I do absorb new information.\"\nClinton adds that she had hoped the agreement would be \"the gold standard,\" but in the end says \"it didn't meet my standard.\"\nAsked whether she is a \"progressive\" or \"moderate,\" she describes herself as a \"progressive\" with \"a long history of getting things done.\"\n___\n6:04 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton says economic fairness for the middle class is the centerpiece of her campaign for president.\nShe's promising to raise the minimum wage and push companies to share profits with their workers.\nShe also offered a message directly to women in her opening statement: \"Fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you too can grow up to be president.\"\n___\n6:02 p.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is appealing to the middle class in his opening debate comments, saying the top 1 percent is thriving while regular Americans are working longer hours for lower wages.\nHe is also calling for campaign finance reform to curb the influence of the wealthy, combating climate change and spending more on education and jobs for young people to keep them out of jail.\n___\n5:58 p.m.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley says his executive experience makes him the best leader.\nHe is citing his work pushing to raise the minimum wage, promoting gay marriage and advancing gun safety legislation as he introduces himself at the first Democratic debate. O'Malley says his work is evidence that he know how to get things done and is \"very clear\" about his principles.\n___\n5:52 p.m.\nFormer Virginia Sen. Jim Webb is emphasizing his \"record of working across the political aisle\" in his opening statement, while promoting his national security credentials.\nHe says he \"fought and bled\" for his country in the Vietnam War as a Marine and later served as the secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration. He is calling for a \"common sense\" foreign policy to keep the nation safe.\n___\n5:50 p.m.\nThe Democratic debate is underway with opening statements.\nThe first statement comes from former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee, who reviewed his resume and boasted of having no scandals while in office.\n___\n5:40 p.m.\nCNN is broadcasting the debate live to virtual reality headsets.\nPartnering with company NextVR, the network is making the views available to some 100,000 people who possess an Oculus-made Gear VR headset that works with specific Samsung smartphones.\nNot everything will be visible, though. Viewers won't see the notes the candidates are writing on the pads of paper on their podiums. NextVR's post-production director Timothy Amick says its cameras were specifically positioned far enough away to not get a peek at the scribbles.\n___\n5:30 p.m.\nPresident Barack Obama is trying to rally Democrats before the party's first presidential debate.\nThe president spoke to the party faithful via a video aired before the faceoff. He cited progress, like the legalization of gay marriage, that has occurred since his election.\nThe president asked Democrats to \"work even harder\" in this election cycle to ensure he is replaced by a Democrat next year.\n__\n4:40 p.m.\nNevada Sen. Harry Reid is giving no inkling of which Democratic presidential candidate he plans to support, calling the participants in Tuesday's debate \"five of my friends.\"\nReid says he expects the debate to be substantive. It's the first of six scheduled Democratic debates, a number Reid said he was satisfied with during a press conference a few hours earlier.\nReid also facetiously apologized for saying Iowa and particularly New Hampshire are not representative of how the rest of America will vote because no one lives there and there are no minorities. He made the remarks Monday at a pre-debate event.\n\"New Hampshire is terribly populated and loaded with lots of minorities,\" Reid said Tuesday.\nCensus data shows New Hampshire's 1.3 million people are 94 percent white.\n___\n4:20 p.m.\nOne of the most talked-about Democrats in the 2016 race won't even be on stage.\nVice President Joe Biden plans to watch the debate from the Naval Observatory, his official residence in Washington. Biden's office says he's also hosting a high school reunion earlier in the evening.\nBiden is months into serious deliberations about whether to join the Democratic field. It's unclear what role the outcome of Tuesday's debate will play in his decision.\nThe vice president had a light schedule Tuesday in Washington, but made an unannounced stop at the Turkish Embassy to sign a condolence book honoring the 97 people killed in weekend bombings in Ankara.\nBiden's decision could come at any time, but his schedule for Wednesday is already jam-packed. The White House says he'll attend President Barack Obama's daily briefing in the Oval Office, speak at a White House summit on infrastructure investment, and meet with Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. He'll also have lunch in private with Obama.\n___\n4:10 p.m.\nAn October 2007 memo circulated by President Barack Obama's campaign advisers says Hillary Rodham Clinton was vulnerable to attacks on her character and Obama was better positioned to represent change.\nThe memo, reported by The New Yorker hours before Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, says in blunt terms that Clinton couldn't be \"trusted or believed when it comes to change\" and is \"driven by political calculation not conviction.\" The memo also argues that Clinton embodies \"trench warfare vs. Republicans\" and is someone who has worked the system rather than change it.\nIt's unclear if Clinton is still vulnerable to those attacks. But at least one member of her team is well aware of the arguments.\nOne of Clinton's first hires was Joel Benenson, who was Obama's pollster and one of the authors of the memo. He's now one of Clinton's top campaign strategists.\n___\n3:55 p.m.\nRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump says he'll be live-tweeting the Democratic debate, and he expects it to be \"a very boring two hours.\"\nDemocratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton responded, saying, \"Glad you'll be watching. It's going to be 'huge.'\"\nAnother Republican contender, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, is also getting in on the action.\nHe's been live-streaming his day on the campaign trail and will be offering his reaction to the Democrats' first faceoff on video.\nTrump said Monday he expected most viewers to tune in to the debate for a few minutes and then fall asleep.\nHe's also expecting low ratings for CNN compared with the record-breaking audiences his faceoffs with fellow Republicans have drawn.\n___\n3:50 p.m.\nSupporters of rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in a friendly faceoff on a crowded pedestrian bridge in Las Vegas ahead of Tuesday's debate.\nWearing blue shirts, Clinton supporters are chanting \"Madam President.\" Opposing them: red-shirt-wearing registered nurses yelling, \"Equal rights, jobs that pay, Bernie's best for the USA.\"\nIn the middle were several trapped Las Vegas tourists.\nJim Shilling, a 74-year-old tourist from La Crosse, Wisconsin, certainly didn't mind.\n\"I love it. There's enthusiasm. Democrats need enthusiasm,\" he said. \"I'm with 'em both.\"\n___\n3:45 p.m.\nThe Democratic candidates for president are making their final preparations for their party's first debate of the 2016 race for the White House.\nThe candidates and their staffs are on-site at the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas, taking walkthroughs of the debate hall and preparing for what's expected to be a policy-heavy confrontation.\nHuma Abedin (HOO'-muh AB'-uh-deen), a top adviser to front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, has tested out the candidate's podium at center stage.\nSen. Bernie Sanders also tested out his spot, and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took a moment to get a feel for the debate hall.\nAlso onstage will be former Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia.\nNot on stage: Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering joining the contest and is said to be watching the show from home.\nThe debate begins at 6 p.m. Pacific time on CNN.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:40:02.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
