The new Assembly members will also need to be exposed to the SADA- MVP operations to enable them participates actively in the planning for the development of MVP communities' \nHe expressed worry about the lack of requisite knowledge and skills of some of the Assembly members on the operations of the District Assembly, and noted that it was seriously affecting them in their quest to deliver at the Assembly level and make positive impact. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:01:27.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
