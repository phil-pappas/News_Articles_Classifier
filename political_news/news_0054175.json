Gov. Tate Reeves managed to mix in some campaigning while ground was broken on the $45 million Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Experience Saturday in downtown Meridian. The state's government has committed $25 million toward the project, having approved $5 million disbursements over a five-year period. Reeves (R), who is seeking a second term as lieutenant governor, said the center reflects the kind of wise investments a conservative government can make. \"Look, we're just running on my record bringing good, strong conservative leadership for the state of Mississippi,\" Reeves said. \"When we travel around Mississippi, we hear from voters every single day that they are very frustrated with what is going on in Washington, D.C. But, they are very happy what is going on in Jackson.\" Meridian Star Posted October 9, 2015 - 5:09 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
