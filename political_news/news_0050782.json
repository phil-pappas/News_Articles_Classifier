The New York Times reported last week that U.S. soldiers still fighting the war in Afghanistan  14 years on  are under orders to be culturally sensitive regarding different attitudes among our Afghan allies about, uh . . . the sexual abuse of children. One officer was relieved of his command several years ago, the Times informed us, because he punched out an Afghan militia commander for keeping a boy chained to his bed as a sex slave. And in 2012, three Marines were shot and killed at a U.S. base in Helmand Province by a 17-year-old Afghan tea boy who may also have been the sex slave of a warlord ally stationed there  possibly in retaliation for the Marines failure to intervene in the situation. The father of one of the murdered Marines said that officers had told his son to look the other way regarding child rape because its their culture. Oh, the sensitivity! Shane Harris, writing a few days later in The Daily Beast, expanded on the moral helplessness of the American invaders in such matters: A 45-minute scripted presentation given to Marines as part of their pre-deployment process . . . explains that laws and norms about sexual relations vary from country to country, and that in Afghanistan in particular, sexual assault is a cultural issue, and not a purely legal one, he wrote. . . . The training guide supports allegations by Marines and Army soldiers in recent days that theyve been told not to intervene to prevent sexual assault in Afghanistan, including the rape and sexual enslavement of children on U.S. bases. Where does one start deconstructing the moral weirdness of all this? The stories dont address the American invasion itself, which has shattered Afghanistan and created infinitely more harm than it has eradicated. Instead, were left seething at the scapegoat du jour: anonymous higher-ups, who are imposing strategically mandated directives on our boys on the ground: Pedophile warlords are our partners in fighting the Taliban. Dont look too closely at their leisure activities. In the Times story, in particular, a sense of American innocence permeates the situation. Our soldiers know better and want to do the right thing  impose decent values on a sleazy, immoral culture  but despite being armed to the teeth, they cant force our allies to behave like good Americans. The real villain here, if we look no deeper than the Times chooses to, is political correctness. OMG....why are we in this country? Why have we stayed? Oh, that's right. They have minerals we want and we're having a pipeline for oil built. For the profit we rape the children and turn a blind eye. Greed and corporations go hand in hand. Bring home the soldiers and let them spend their money here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:52:01.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
