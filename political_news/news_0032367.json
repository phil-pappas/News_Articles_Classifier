On this date in 1873, a sturdy and somber-looking building opened its doors to admit 17 long-term residents. Then it promptly closed and locked those doors. With the opening of the Indiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls in Indianapolis , the country had its first maximum-security penitentiary built for and managed by women. Formerly, female convicts were imprisoned in male facilities where they suffered abuse from male guards and inmates. The reformatory remains locked for business to this day, now named the Indiana Women's Prison. It houses around 430 of the approximately 111,000 women in federal and state prisons. Overall, there are around 1.36 million prisoners in state facilities. America's state governments spend over $48 billion per year on their corrections systems. Profile America is in its19th year as a public service of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSources:\nKane's Famous First Facts, 2823\nIndiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls history: http://americanprisonsystem.com/2011/04/indiana-womens-prison/\nStatistics on Women Offenders: http://www.corrections.com/news/article/30166-statistics-on-women-offenders\nPrison Population: http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/p13pr.cfm\nState corrections: http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=SGF_2013_SGF003&prodType=table\nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
