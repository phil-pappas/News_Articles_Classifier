Peter begins by discussing some of the points him and Ron Paul see eye to eye on, the biggest of which, is that the world is so used to running to the Dollar when global economic struggles arise, that they have completely ignored the fact it is the Fed and the Dollar that are going to CAUSE the global financial meltdown. Just because everyone else is running to the Dollar, doesn’t mean they all won’t lose their hats when the bottom falls out.\nPeter uses an analogy that Dr. Paul can relate to, by referring to the Fed as a cancer that is killing our nation. If the patient, in this case the United States is going to survive, then the cancer has to be cut out permanently. Instead, we live in a short sighted country that will probably FEED the cancer with more quantitive easing rather than take our medicine now. Sadly, the more quantitive easing that occurs, the bigger the bubbles get, and the bigger the final collapse is going to be.\nWhen pressed for a high level solution for most average folks to avoid getting wiped out when the Dollar does crash, Peter suggests investing in overseas markets NOT denominated in dollars. Look for stocks paying a dividend, and then when the U.S. finally does implode, the investor will have the advantage of the dividend paid out PLUS an advantage in the exchange rate back to Dollars, or whatever happens with our currency.\nBOTTOM LINE: GET OUT OF THE DOLLAR!\nMichael Snyder writes:\nThe worst stock market crashes in U.S. history have come during the month of October. There is just something about this time of the year that seems to be conducive to financial panic. For example, on October 28th, 1929 the biggest stock market crash in U.S. history up until that time helped usher in the Great Depression of the 1930s. And the largest percentage crash in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average by a very wide margin happened on October 19th, 1987. Overall, 9 of the 16 largest single day percentage crashes that we have ever seen happened during the month of October . Of course that does not mean that something will happen this October, but after what we just witnessed in September we should all be on alert.\nClearly, there is a tremendous amount of momentum toward the downside right now. As you can see from the chart below, all of the gains for the Dow since the end of the 2013 calendar year have already been wiped out…\nAnd as I wrote about just the other day, last quarter we witnessed the loss of 11 trillion dollars in “paper wealth” on stock markets all over the planet. The following comes from Justin Spittler …\nThe S&P 500 fell 8%… and so did the Dow and the NASDAQ. It was the worst quarter for U.S. stocks since 2011.\nStocks around the world dropped too. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks 85% of global stocks, also had its worst quarter since 2011. The STOXX Europe 600 Index, which tracks 600 of Europe’s largest companies, fell 10%. It was the worst quarter for European stocks since 2011 as well.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite fell 28% last quarter, its largest quarterly decline in seven years. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 19%. It was the worst quarterly decline for emerging market stocks in four years.\nIn total, last quarter’s selloff erased nearly $11 trillion in value from stocks around the world.\nSadly, the mainstream media is assuring everyone that things are going to be just fine, and a lot of people on the Internet seem to have the attitude that “ nothing is happening “. Just like in 1929, a brief period of stabilization after the initial fall has lulled many into a false sense of security. The following comes from Zero Hedge …\nJust as in 1929, the market was performing fantastic and the continuous wealth increase seemed to be unstoppable. A short 10% correction was seen as ‘healthy’ and soon a new uptrend was starting (the green line). This is exactly the same scenario we saw in the past few weeks. Market commenters said the 10% drop in the Dow Jones was a ‘healthy correction’ and we’re on our way to the next uptrend and Christmas rally.\nMost people seem to assume that since I run a website called “The Economic Collapse Blog” that I must be rooting for a stock market collapse and an economic implosion, but that is not true at all. The longer that the financial markets can hold together, the longer all of our lives can stay quiet, peaceful and “normal”. Once the chaos begins, all of our lives will change dramatically. No matter how much any of us have prepared, what is coming is going to deeply affect all of us at least to a certain degree.\nIt would be far better for me, my extended family and my friends if I am wrong about an imminent financial collapse . Most of the people that I personally know are not even close to ready for what is coming. And during the coming credit crunch it is inevitable that people that I personally know will lose jobs and suffer business setbacks.\nSadly, the truth is that life in America is never going to be any better than it is right now. At some point, this stock market bubble will fully implode. At some point, our debt-fueled prosperity will disappear. At some point, the extraordinary recklessness of the big banks will catch up with them in a major way.\nAs we witnessed in 2008, our financial system is not designed to handle a severe bear market. We should have learned some very hard lessons from the last time around, but we didn’t. Instead, our financial system is even more vulnerable to a crisis today than it was back then. A huge turn down by the financial markets will rip many of our top financial companies to shreds. So a bear market would be extremely bad news, but unfortunately many prominent analysts seem to believe that this is precisely what we are now facing …\nJim Cramer, the ex-hedge fund manager and host of CNBC’s show “Mad Money,” has been vocal recently on air, saying repeatedly that he doesn’t like the market now, and last week said “ we have a first-class bear market going .” Similarly, Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management, has been sending out notes to clients and this newspaper for weeks, saying the poor price action of the stock market and many hard-hit sectors, such as energy and the recently clobbered biotech sector, has all the earmarks of a bear market. Over the weekend, Kaltbaum said: “ We remain in a worldwide bear market for stocks .”\nOn the way up, all of the extreme risk-taking didn’t seem to matter much because everyone was making a lot of money.\nBut on the way down, all of the extreme risk-taking is just going to accelerate the collapse.\nPersonally, I do not know exactly what will happen over the next few weeks, but without a doubt I have a very bad feeling about the rest of this year.\nWhat about you?\nWhat do you think will happen?\nPlease feel free to add to the discussion by posting a comment below…\nFOR LINKS TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY & THE COMING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE:\nDisaster: Will EU Become a New Enemy to the U.S. After Refugees Collapse EU?\nPeter Schiff: “The Fed Admits Rates Could Stay at Zero Forever”\nPeter Schiff with Mr. “I Have No Fear Of an Economic or Stock Market Collapse”\nPeter Schiff Explains Why Financial Bubbles Are Ready to Pop\nPeter Schiff: Everybody Is Preparing for Wrong Outcome in US Economy\nThe Elite Have Prepared For the Coming Economic Collapse – Have You?\nChina Warns Washington It’s Been Liquidating U.S. Treasuries\n2 Day Crash That Was Larger Than Any 1 Day Market Crash In U.S. History\n10 Signs the US is Transitioning to Third World Country Status (Videos)\nPeter Schiff On China’s Currency Devaluation and the Federal Reserve Board\n10 Horrifying Realities Americans Find Too Awful To Face\nGerald Celente: Massive Market and Trade Instability Will Cause WW III\nChina Knocking on the Door of Reserve-Currency; World Teeters on Collapse\nPeter Schiff: Greece Was a Sideshow.
