The rally, to be held on November 14, is modeled after a similar one that Cruz held in August in Iowa. Cruz told a Des Moines crowd of more than 2,500 then that, “There is a war on faith in America today.”\nCruz has made outreach to conservative Christians central to his candidacy. He launched his campaign in March at Liberty University in Virginia, the world’s largest Christian university. He traveled to Kentucky to support clerk Kim Davis after she was arrested for refusal to issue gay marriage licenses. And he talks repeatedly about the threats against religious freedom on the campaign trail.\nTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, is expected to join Cruz at the Bob Jones University rally, along with twin brothers Jason and David Benham, whose reality TV show on HGTV was cancelled after making comments about a gay “agenda.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:46:02.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
