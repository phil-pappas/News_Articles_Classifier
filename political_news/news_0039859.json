(Photo: Robert Scheer/The Indianapolis Star) \nAn internal investigation at the Marion County Jail has prompted the facility to discipline staff and demote its jail commander. \nMarion County Sheriff John Layton announced Wednesday that the reorganization of jail staff was the result of a pending investigation. WISH-TV reports that the probe has focused on the apparent suicides of inmates Michael Morris in August and Marvin Sharp in September. \nLetters were sent this week to 18 jail employees to inform them of disciplinary action against them, mainly ranging from warnings to 24-hour suspensions. \nFormer jail commander Lt. Col. Royce Cole will be demoted to captain of the Arrestee Processing Center. He will be replaced by James Martin, a 12-year veteran of the Marion County Sheriffâ€™s Office. \nThe changes go into effect Oct. 17. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
