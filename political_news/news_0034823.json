Among them: endorsements from all the major caucuses in the GOP conference, time with his family and tweaking a rule to make it harder to toss the speaker out of office.\nThe demands aren't going over well in right-wing media.\nAt one point on Drudge Report, headlines blared: \"KING PAUL: PLEDGE YOUR ALLEGIANCE TO ME,\" \"DO IT BY FRIDAY,\" \"HE'S A DEM FAVORITE,\" \"OBAMA'S NEW PARTNER,\" 'F' conservative rating,\" and \"WANTS TO SCRAP THOMAS JEFFERSON'S RULE.\"\n“[Ryan] wants to get elected after it is made impossible to get rid of him, then he will really get into specifics ... Amnesty anyone?” Red State founder Erick Erickson wrote . “This would be a terrible, terrible deal for House Conservatives. It would gut their ability to pull the House Republicans to the right.”\nThe Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro wrote , “This is wrongheaded in the extreme. Conservatives should not grant Ryan that sort of power simply in order to place him in the Speakership. Signing a procedural blank check to anyone, no matter how trustworthy they appear, is a recipe for disaster.\"\nCongress\nHow Paul Ryan got to (almost) yes By Jake Sherman , John Bresnahan and Anna Palmer\nAnd conservative radio host Laura Ingraham let loose on Twitter, writing , \"EMPEROR RYAN: How many co's wd choose the employee who issued demands abt personal time then said 'take it or leave it.'\"\nThe hazing from the pundits is an amplified version of the early resistance to Ryan among House conservatives, especially members of the House Freedom Caucus. The criticism could also exert pressure on those lawmakers to oppose Ryan, who’s vowed to run only if he's the consensus pick of the party.\nIt doesn't mean that Ryan's path to the speakership is doomed. But a coronation does not appear likely.\nMuch of the displeasure was focused on Ryan's call to change a House procedure that allows members to force a floor vote to oust the speaker. But other conservative voices expressed frustration with the fact that Ryan — who has made it clear he has no problem staying in his current position as House Ways and Means chairman — is making the demands because he didn’t want the job in the first place.\n“It is not the job of The Freedom Caucus to make Paul Ryan take the Speakership if he doesn’t want it,” Ben Domenech wrote in The Federalist.\nDomenech, who pointed out that Ryan is “likely the most competent leader in the Conference and he would doubtlessly be a good Speaker on his own terms,” compared Ryan’s negotiations to those of a millennial negotiating for a job he doesn’t want.\n“if you don’t want a job — really, really don’t want it — one way to approach the job interview is to act like a Millennial. That is, to make clear you have some very high expectations for what the new employer will do for you,” Domenech said. ”Like, twice as much vacation time, totally flexible telecommuting, setting up a new game room, stocking the right kinds of ethically sourced snacks, and getting rid of the two-century-old functional rules of the House of Representatives as written by Thomas Jefferson himself.”\nPaul Ryan willing to be Speaker of the House Writing in Hot Air , Jazz Shaw laid bare his admiration for the Wisconsin Republican but called it “a mistake to rush rashly into the arms of a savior if the price is disastrously high.”\n“I’m not opposing Paul Ryan as the next Speaker of the House, but I would much prefer to see the next Speaker elected in regular order, have them ready to commit to the full demands of the office and be sworn in knowing that they are still answerable to the members,” Shaw wrote.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.redstate.com/2015/10/21/paul-ryan-wants-house-conservatives-to-sign-their-own-death-warrant/", "http://www.dailywire.com/news/560/paul-ryan-demands-republicans-unite-behind-him-ben-shapiro", "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/21/the-house-needs-a-speaker-but-not-an-emperor/", "http://thefederalist.com/2015/10/21/paul-ryan-wants-to-be-speaker-on-his-own-terms/", "https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/656780960927739904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2015-10-21T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:54:05.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
