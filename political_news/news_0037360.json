It’s the first loss of an American service member since the fight against ISIS began, and the first U.S. combat death in Iraq since 2011. U.S. special operations forces operating in Iraq in what Pentagon officials say was a supporting role took part in an Iraqi operation to free Iraqi hostages, including members of the Iraqi Security Forces. After more than 70 hostages were freed, 39-year-old Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler, a veteran of 14 official combat deployments and doubtless several other less-official trips into danger, died of his gunshot wound.\nHis death has raised the question of how an American could have died in combat when America, at least according to President Barack Obama and his national security leaders, is not at war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:44:42.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
