That is essentially putting the issue into the hands of the people of Scotland, where it properly should be handled.”\nPromoted stories Mr Swinney explained a number of issues from the EU referendum and the replacement of the Trident nuclear deterrent had an ability to change the debate on a second independence poll.\n“Some substantial things may emerge that change the debate, for example the situation on the European referendum, such as the impact of the UK government’s austerity attack and the benefit attacks, such as the whole approach to renewing the Trident nuclear missile system programme. What does that do to the debate in Scotland? This is a debate that can develop and change,” he noted.\nMeantime, Ken Clarke, the former Conservative Chancellor, warned the SNP leadership against complacency and said he did not believe the current domination of the SNP over Scottish politics would “last for too long”.\nCautioning against hubris, the Nottingham MP said: “I would want somebody in my immediate entourage, who would tell me at least daily ‘remember you are mortal.’”\nShare article He said there had to be someone telling the leadership that voters would get bored with complete dominance and that “Scotland will not live with a Kazakhstan-type parliament. We’re a single-issue party, a protest party; that won’t last”.\nHe added: “My main point would be if you just carry on being Scottish Nationalists demanding another referendum with about two opposition members in the Scottish Parliament, people will get bored; demonstrate competence.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-15T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:57:01.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
