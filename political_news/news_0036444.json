Ghana is endowed with mineral resources like gold, bauxite, manganese, diamond, cocoa and an abundance of human resources. We now produce oil in commercial quantities, and yet still we are worse off as a nation,' he stated. \nChairman Wontumi was of the conviction that Ghana's problems stem from the fact that the President Mahama and his NDC have nothing good to offer Ghanaians. \n'If the NDC had not set out, when they won power in 2009, to destroy what President Kufuor had built, there is no way you will find the spectre of hundreds of young men and women walking the streets without jobs,' he said. \nHowever, Chairman Wontumi assured the gathering that all hope was not lost, stressing that 'if we are able to work hard and ensure that Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo becomes President of Ghana, that will be the only way to bring massive development to Ghana, as well as improve the wellbeing of Ghanaians.' \nHis message to the President Mahama and the NDC ahead of the 2016 election was simple. \n'My message to the NDC is that they may have delayed our victory, but they cannot stop us (an NPP victory) in 2016,' he said, eliciting a rousing round of applause from the packed auditorium at the Georgia Hotel. \nHe thanked the parliamentary candidates and their aspirants from the 16 constituencies present at the meeting for their resolve towards fostering unity amongst the rank and file of the party, and, ultimately, working together for a resounding Akufo-Addo victory in the presidential election, as well as delivering the majority of seats for the NPP in the Ashanti Region in 2016. \nSource: Peacefmonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:21:19.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
