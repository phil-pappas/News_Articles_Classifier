Grassley (R-Iowa) said.\nThe bill will reduce mandatory minimum drug sentences, give judges more discretion for sentencing low-level drug offenders and provide a means for offenders to get out of prison early if they go through rehabilitation programs, Grassley said Wednesday.\nThe proposal will be much more modest than the sweeping reforms Senate Democrats passed last year. That bill would have slashed mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses by at least half.\nDespite the strong bipartisan coaltion of nine senators backing the latest proposal, it faces uncertain prospects, even in the Senate.\nThe bill is likely to be burdened with crippling amendments, including one on abortion, from conservatives who vow to fight it tooth and nail, backers say.\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte (R-Va.) has been critical of a more liberal criminal justice proposal that has been introduced in the House and has been working very slowly on his own more modest proposal.\nObama becomes first president to visit prison, but reform push has limits Christi Parsons President Obama has made a push for broad-based reform of the criminal justice system in recent days, commuting the sentences of 46 inmates and, on Thursday, becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal prison.\n“We've got to be able to distinguish between dangerous individuals who need...\nPresident Obama has made a push for broad-based reform of the criminal justice system in recent days, commuting the sentences of 46 inmates and, on Thursday, becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal prison.\n“We've got to be able to distinguish between dangerous individuals who need...\n(Christi Parsons) Presssure on Goodlatte to pass reform legislation increased last summer when House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said he supported reforms. But Boehner announced last week that he is resigning from Congress on Oct. 30.\nBackers in the Senate say that criminal justice reforms must be passed and on the president’s desk by early next year to have a chance of becoming law in a presidential election year. That's a tall order given the partisan turmoil that is expected to bog down both houses of Congress in the coming months.\nTwitter: @timphelpsLAT\nALSO\nArtist fatally shot while working on anti-violence mural in Oakland\nCongress approves stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown\nLet's consider leniency for many 'violent' offenders too Andrea Roth Ever since President Obama commuted the prison sentences of 46 nonviolent drug offenders last week, reformers have been calling for similar acts of leniency for other nonviolent drug offenders still behind bars.
