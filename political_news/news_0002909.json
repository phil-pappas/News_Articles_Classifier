The party has joined Women 50:50 and Women for Independence in energising the discussion about women's place in public and political life.”\nShe added: “It wouldn't be fair to judge their offer in Scotland before it's finalised, but the relatively timid UK policy platform set out in their launch this week does raise questions about the strategic benefits of standing against candidates from parties whose gender equality commitments may be bolder.”\nThe decision of the WEP to stand for Holyrood is likely to be seen as a direct challenge to Nicola Sturgeon’s feminist credentials.\nEarlier this month, the SNP leader explained why she thought quotas were necessary to speed up the pace of change in politics, saying: \"I don’t want my nine-year-old niece to still be fighting these battles... I don’t believe it is good for any of us to underuse the talents of 50 per cent of the population.”\nBut opposition politicians have accused her of image over substance.\nScottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has called for feminists, not just women, to be in positions of political power, in what was widely perceived as a criticism of Ms Sturgeon.\nWEP also intends to stand in other elections next year, including local elections and, potentially, for London mayor.\nScottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: \"At least 50 per cent of Scottish Labour's new candidates will be women and we are proud to have the third female Scottish Labour Leader in Kezia Dugdale. We are committed to securing gender equality not just in the Scottish Parliament, but for women all across the country.\"\nShare article At the formal launch of the party last week representatives called for free childcare for parents of all children aged more than nine months and political quotas at the next two general elections to achieve a gender-balanced Westminster parliament by 2025.\nThe party also called for quotas for the number of women on boards and for the abolition of the married tax allowance, with the money saved to be reinvested in rape crisis centres.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-26T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:45:39.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
