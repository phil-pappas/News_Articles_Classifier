The measure to allow doctors to prescribe life-ending medication succeeded on its second attempt after the heavily publicized case of Maynard, the woman with brain cancer who moved to Oregon to legally take her life. California will become the fifth state in the nation to allow terminally ill patients to legally end their lives using doctor-prescribed drugs.
