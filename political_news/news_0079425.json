These changes have involved a lot of difficult decisions and our officers and staff have had to adjust to a lot of change over a relatively short period of time, while continuing to provide a professional policing service for the people of Cumbria.\nThe report states that the Constabulary is ‘well prepared to face its future financial challenges’. However the recent proposals for further cuts, of potentially £26 million, would have a detrimental effect on what the HMIC recognises as a good and efficient force.\nWe have worked tirelessly to ensure previous savings would not result in losing our connections to local communities and issues. If the proposed future cuts are approved, this would no longer be the case and the level of service we would be able to provide would be unrecognisable to people currently living in Cumbria.\n– Deputy Chief Constable Michelle Skeer Last updated Tue 20 Oct 2015 Read more 8 updates Cumbria Police faces funding cuts of up to £26m Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:45:27.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
