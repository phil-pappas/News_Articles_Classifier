Photo: Andrew Meares\nADF's patchy response to climate change Bill Shorten will travel to remote Pacific islands at risk from rising sea levels in a bid to put the political focus back on climate change as he searches for ways to neutralise Malcolm Turnbull's soaring popularity.\nThe Opposition Leader, his deputy Tanya Plibersek and immigration spokesman Richard Marles will embark on a four-day tour of the region next week, visiting Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. Climate change will be the focus of their meetings with local leaders.\nIllustration: Matt Golding.\nLabor wants to put climate change at the centre of public debate in the run-up to a major United Nations summit in Paris later this year, believing it's a key political weakness for Prime Minister Turnbull.\nAdvertisement Mr Turnbull has been a vocal advocate for climate change action, famously losing the Liberal leadership in 2009 amid the party's civil war over his support for Labor's emissions trading scheme.\nBut since taking the top job last month he has been treading carefully through fear of alienating the party's conservative base. He has defended both the Abbott government's Direct Action policy and its greenhouse gas reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels.\nMr Shorten, who has been trailing in the polls and struggling to gain traction since Mr Turnbull's elevation, is keen to exploit the divisions.\nLow-lying Kiribati and Marshall Islands are among the nations most at threat from rising sea levels. The political leaders of both countries took offence last month when Immigration Minister Peter Dutton was caught on microphone making a joke about their plight.\nMr Shorten says they deserve better.\n\"These are our neighbours and we have a responsibility to act by taking serious action on climate change, not adopt weak policies that are designed to appease the far right of the Liberal National parties,\" Mr Shorten told Fairfax Media. \"These leaders deserve Australia's action, not insults.\"\nMr Dutton's joke, made to former prime minister Tony Abbott and recorded by a boom mic he didn't know was there, sparked outrage last month. One Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official says the comment was \"catastrophic\" for Australia's relationship with affected countries.\nMarshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum said at the time Mr Dutton's \"insensitivity knows no bounds\" while Kiribati President Anote Tong lashed him for his \"arrogance\" and \"moral irresponsibility\".\nIn a speech last week, Ms Plibersek warned of the potential disruption that could be caused by climate refugees in the coming decades.\n\"If we are seeing the world struggle with mass movements of people now, imagine what the world will look like when that movement is doubled,\" she said.\nMr Turnbull is yet to confirm whether he will attend the Paris summit or send someone in his stead.\nThe Turnbull government's new minister for Pacific Island affairs, Steve Ciobo, is also expected to travel extensively throughout the region in the coming weeks and months. He is tipped to attend the Conference of the Pacific Community in Niue next month, at which climate change will be a focus.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/asleep-on-duty-australias-patchy-military-response-to-climate-change-risks-20151021-gkegd4.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T10:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:24:27.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
