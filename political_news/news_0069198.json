Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF) to provide vital cell lines to academic, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology organizations committed to speed a cure for Parkinson's disease.\nParkinson's disease is a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder that affects one in 100 people over age 60. While the average age at onset is 60, people have been diagnosed as young as 18. Recent research indicates that at least 1 million people in the United States , and more than 5 million worldwide, have Parkinson's disease.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, ATCC will provide services and products to the global scientific community that is working to address this challenging disease. Specifically ATCC will provide cell line authentication, mycoplasma testing, and repository management services. ATCC will also produce and validate custom master cell banks (MCBs) from macrophage cell lines provided by MJFF, including wild-type LRRK2, LRRK2 knockout, and human LRRK2 T1348N (GTPase-dead) knockin.\n\"At our core, ATCC is about contributing to breakthrough scientific discoveries through the provision of high quality biological products and services. We are honored to partner with The Michael J. Fox Foundation to accelerate breakthroughs in Parkinson's disease research,\" stated Raymond Cypess , DVM, Ph.D., CEO at ATCC. \"As the premier biological resource center that global researchers have relied on for 90 years, ATCC has been privileged to work with outstanding organizations, such as The Michael J. Fox Foundation, and we look forward to partnering with additional foundations.\"\nTerina Martinez , Ph.D., associate director of research programs at MJFF, said, \"These cell lines are important tools for our efforts to advance understanding of Parkinson's disease and further drug development toward new therapies for the millions living with this disease. We're pleased to be working toward these goals with ATCC, a well-regarded organization with the capabilities and track record to help us serve the Parkinson's research community.\"\nThis special cell line collection will be established by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and will be available at www.atcc.org .\nAbout ATCC\nATCC collaborates with and supports the scientific community with industry-standard products and innovative solutions. With the world's largest and most diverse collection of human, animal, and plant cell lines, as well as molecular genomic tools, microorganisms, and biological products, ATCC is a trusted biological resource for the worldwide research community. Together, the people of ATCC share in its mission to acquire, authenticate, preserve, develop, and distribute biological materials and information for the advancement of scientific knowledge. Founded in 1925, ATCC is a non-profit organization with headquarters in Manassas, VA . Discover more at www.atcc.org .\nAbout The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research\nAs the world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's research, The Michael J. Fox Foundation is dedicated to accelerating a cure for Parkinson's disease and improved therapies for those living with the condition today. The Foundation pursues its goals through an aggressively funded, highly targeted research program coupled with active global engagement of scientists, Parkinson's patients, business leaders, clinical trial participants, donors and volunteers. In addition to funding more than $450 million in research to date, the Foundation has fundamentally altered the trajectory of progress toward a cure. Operating at the hub of worldwide Parkinson's research, the Foundation forges groundbreaking collaborations with industry leaders, academic scientists and government research funders; increases the flow of participants into Parkinson's disease clinical trials with its online tool, Fox Trial Finder; promotes Parkinson's awareness through high-profile advocacy, events and outreach; and coordinates the grassroots involvement of thousands of Team Fox members around the world.\nCompany contact\nRenee Randall\nATCC\nTel: (703) 365-2773\nEmail: rrandall@atcc.org\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275420LOGO\n releases/atcc-to-develop-custom-cell-lines-for-the-michael-j-fox-foundation-for-parkinsons-research-300156901.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atcc-to-develop-custom-cell-lines-for-the-michael-j-fox-foundation-for-parkinsons-research-300156901.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151008/275420LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275420LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH23892&Transmission_Id=201510081513PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH23892&DateId=20151008", "http://www.atcc.org/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:59:05.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
