Tulsi Gabbard needs a ticket to Tuesday night's Democratic debate -- Bernie Sanders has her covered. That was the message of Sanders' campaign manager on Monday, responding to a report that the Hawaii Democrat had been uninvited from attending the debate by the Democratic National Committee. \"If she needs a ticket, have her give me a call,\" Jeff Weaver said on CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday. \"I think we have a couple; we can give her one.\" Weaver had been asked about a New York Times report that Gabbard, a vice chairwoman of the DNC, had received a message through her staff about her attendance at the event one day after she appeared on television calling for more Democratic debates. RELATED: DNC chair heckled with debate calls Read More Sanders' campaign has also called for more debates, as has fellow Clinton challenger and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, however, has remained steadfast in her decision that there will only be six sanctioned debates for the Democratic presidential candidates. A DNC spokeswoman told The New York Times that Gabbard was not uninvited, but that the committee communicated that the focus at the debate should be on the candidates present and the difference from Republicans. Representatives for the DNC and Gabbard did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. Weaver said the Vermont independent senator, running second in the polls to Hillary Clinton, is a supporter of more debates. \"We would love to have debates: The more debates, the better,\" Weaver said on Monday. \"It's healthy for the Democratic Party to have more debates.\" Weaver said more debates would keep media attention on Democrats and would feature the left's flank of the party's platform \"on the frontburner.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> From Our Partners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:17:34.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
