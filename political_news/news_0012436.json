And yesterday, MPs quizzed Mr Swire about the Government’s efforts to broach the topic. \nResponding to their concerns, the former Northern Ireland minister stated that building a “strong relationship” between the nations was allowing ministers “to discuss all issues”. \n“No issue, including human rights, is off the table,” he said. \n“We certainly do not see this visit as presenting a binary choice between greater economic co-operation and human rights, as some would have us do. I reject that utterly. \n“There are things that we take for granted in this country. We should be ever-vigilant of the fact that others around the world do not enjoy those same liberties. \n“We should be jealous in guarding the privileges that we enjoy and do everything we can to export them to countries that are less fortunate.” \nAmong the high profile deals announced this week was a £6 billion investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor. The project is expected to create around 25,000 over the course of its construction and day to day running. \nOfficials also signed deals for BP to sell £6.5 billion worth of natural gas to Chinese firms over the next 20 years, and reached an agreement on sustainable development goals. \nFiona Bruce, the chairman of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission who tabled the urgent debate, said she recognised “the significance” of Britain’s business links with China. \nBut she said dialogue on human rights, freedom of thought, speech and assembly, and the rule of law must also be placed “at the centre” of the relationship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:36:55.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
