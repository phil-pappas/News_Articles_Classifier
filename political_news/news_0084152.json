K. Bagbin"], "text": "Date: 01-10-2015 Time: 05:10:56:pm Majority Leader of Parliament, Alban S. K. Bagbin \nThe Majority Leader of Parliament, Alban S. K. Bagbin would depart Ghana for the United Kingdom tonight to attend the Executive Committee meeting and the 61stGeneral Assembly of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA). Mr. Bagbin who is also the MP for Nadowli-Kaleo constituency in the Upper West region is representing the West African sub-region in the Executive Committee of the CPA. One key objective of the event that is taking place from the 30th of September to the 8th of October, 2015 is to argue the case for changing the existing status of the CPA as a Charity organization to that of an International Diplomatic organization. \nThe change in status according to the Majority Leader is to “capture the real intention and objectives of the Association since its formation in 1948.” In a pre-departure interview, the Majority Leader and the sub-regional representative on this august body said African countries currently contribute over 50% of the funds for running the CPA and yet by its status it remains a Charity organization under the laws of the United Kingdom. \nThe MP will thus be presenting an important Paper to reform the CPA to become an international diplomatic organization. This involves an amendment of the constitution, particularly articles 35 and 37. Earlier on Monday, the 28th of September, the Majority Leader delivered a speech on behalf of the CPA at the 6th Accountability Conference and the 5th Annual General Meeting of the West African Association of Public Accounts Committees (WAAPAC) in Lome, Togo. \nThe speech was themed: “Beyond Public Accounts Committee Recommendations: The Missing Link in the Pursuit of Public Accountability.” The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is a unique platform of Parliaments of Commonwealth countries and plays an important role in fortifying democracy, rule of law and sustainable development. CPA envisions encouraging Parliaments and Parliamentarians to widen the arena of engagement in delivering pledges made to the people. \nThe Association also emphasizes the need for hands-on and the critical role of Parliaments in leading the development agenda of governments, as well as ensuring accountability and transparency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:00:22.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
