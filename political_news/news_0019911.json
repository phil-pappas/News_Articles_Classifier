I shouldn't have repeated such an emotive phrase. \n\"The choice facing anyone who is presented with testimony of this kind is whether to pass it on to the authorities and urge them to investigate or to ignore it. \n\"I chose the first option. I felt it was my duty to do so.\" \nMr Watson said he believed Lord Brittan \"would have been interviewed even if I hadn't intervened because the DPP made it clear in her reply to my letter that the police investigation into him was ongoing\". Share article \nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found in July 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution, but the decision was never passed on to the peer. \nThe case was reopened last year after Mr Watson wrote to the DPP and police later interviewed Lord Brittan under caution, when he was seriously ill.
