In the video, Fiorina's song continues, \"I'd rather stay, right here, at home instead I want to lie back down inside in my nice warm bed. My name's Snick and you're gonna have to carry me.\" Although Snickers was the center of attention on Fiorina's \"Tonight Show\" appearance, she tells viewers on Facebook that she also made up a song for her dog Max, but she declines to sing it for now. Fiorina came away from the second Republican presidential debate with positive reviews , and recent polls show the former Hewlett-Packard CEO in third place behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson. As of Monday morning the video had 200,000 views, with viewers calling Snickers and Max the \"First Dogs of 2016\" in the comments. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:52:36.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
