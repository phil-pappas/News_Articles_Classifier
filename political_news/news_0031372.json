(Photo: PTI) New Delhi: The role of an acquaintance of former media magnate Indrani Mukerjea, who once worked for her husband, has come under the scanner of CBI which is probing the sensational murder of her daughter Sheena Bora in 2012.\nCBI sources said the residence of the Kolkata-based acquaintance of Indrani, who is believed to be a former employee of her husband Peter Mukerjea, was recently searched by the agency team looking for material to corroborate claims of Indrani during her questioning.\nThe sources claimed the acquaintance had not surfaced in the investigations of Mumbai police and the central agency will dig deep into the new link as it could reveal some new facts about the case and possible motive as well.\nThey said the suspected involvement of the new lead could open a completely new angle of probe for CBI which is looking at the possible motives behind Sheena's killing.\nIndrani, her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai have been arrested on the charge of murdering Sheena and disposing of her body in a forest in Raigad near Mumbai in April 2012.\n24-year-old Sheena, Indrani's daughter from her first marriage, was murdered on 24 April, 2012, and her body was burnt and disposed of the next day.\nThe Mumbai police had exhumed remains of a body from Raigad forest and later claimed that digital superimposition of the profile of Sheena had matched with the skull recovered from the forest.\nThe police had also extensively grilled Indrani's husband Peter, though he is not an accused in the case. Others questioned in connection with the case include Peter's son Rahul Mukherjea and Vidhie, daughter of Indrani and Sanjeev Khanna.\nThe agency, which recently took over the investigation from Mumbai police, has filed a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including those related to criminal conspiracy, murder, abduction, destruction of evidence, causing hurt by giving poison and under the Arms Act.\nThe decision to handover the probe to CBI came after days of uncertainty on the supervisory role of former Mumbai Police chief Rakesh Maria, who was shunted out in the midst of the inquiry that he had proactively helmed.\n Indrani Mukerjea CBI Sheena Bora murder nation news Also Read Narendra Modi wishes nation on Ganesh Chaturthi Bihar: Election Commission bans exit polls from October 12 till November 5 FTII row: Students seek Narendra Modi's intervention to resolve issue Sheena murder: 'No FIR, senior cop had ordered,' claims police inspector", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/indrani%20hospital_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-current-affairs/article/role-acquaintance-indrani-under-cbi-scanner", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/indrani%20hospital_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:32:10.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
