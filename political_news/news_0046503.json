Peter King, R-N.Y., on Monday night took shots at Donald Trump for criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to stop 9/11 from happening.\nTrump has said the former president could have prevented the terror attacks, while Jeb Bush has insisted his brother kept the country safe. King sided with the Bushes, and told Megyn Kelly on Fox News Monday night that what Trump has said is misleading and untrue.\nBriefings given to Bush in August 2001 show there was no evidence of any terror attack coming against the United States, King asserted.\n\"Former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said in his memoirs there was no evidence that there was going to be an attack in the United States,\" King said.\n  Webb drops out, considers independent run \"I'm stepping aside from the Democratic primary process,\" Webb said.\n  1:21 PM It wasn't until director Michael Moore released a 2004 documentary, \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" that people began to believe that 9/11 could have been prevented, King added.\n\"Donald Trump now is sounding like a left-wing, Michael Moore wacko,\" King said. \"If he wants to be commander in chief, he better understand what this is about. Because right now, he's just talking in riddles. It makes no sense.\"\n\"You can have honest differences with President Bush,\" King said, but \"on 9/11, he had no warning whatsoever. … I lost many constituents on that day. If I thought that President Bush had any responsibility for that, I would be the first to talk about it.\"\nKing, who is serving in his 12th term, sits on the Homeland Security Committee and chairs the subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner U.N. chief calls for peace in Israel Ban Ki-Moon visited Jerusalem to talk to Israeli and Palestinian leaders about reducing violence.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/20/15 1:06 PM Top Story Biden: 'I actually like Dick Cheney'   Hillary Clinton's skills working with others.\n  11:33 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:27:19.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
