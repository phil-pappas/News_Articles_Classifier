Biden said from the White House Rose Garden that he had run out of time to raise enough money and set up a campaign. He did not endorse Clinton or anyone else in the unsettled battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. \nHere's a look at some reactions to the decision. \n--- \n\"Joe Biden is a good man and a great vice president. Serving alongside him in the Senate and then the administration, I saw first-hand his passion for our country and our people... I am confident that history isn't finished with Joe Biden. As he said today, there is more work to do. And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton \n--- \n\"The guy has a storied career. I disagree with him on philosophy, on policy, but he's clearly a great guy and served with distinction. ... I thought he would have been a pretty competitive candidate for the Democratic nomination.\" \n—Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush \n--- \n\"I thank (Biden) for his continued service to the nation and his support of the middle class ... I also commend @VP's outlining of an agenda to make college free, fight economic inequality, close tax loopholes & protect dignity for all.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, via Twitter. \n--- \n\"I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.\" \n—GOP presidential contender Donald Trump, via Twitter. \n--- \n\"@JoeBiden is one of the most decent, compassionate public servants our nation has produced — I respect his decision & wish him the best.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley, via Twitter.
