They don’t need to worry about anything. The players’ interest will be protected. There will be no problems to the players,” IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla stressed. \nThe cricket governing body ‘s decision means that the two teams could return in the 2018 edition of the IPL . During the working committee meeting, the cricket board decided that it would go with the Supreme Court -appointed Justice R M Lodha committee’s recommendation of suspending the two teams for two years. \n“The two vacant slots (created by CSK and RR) should be auctioned for two years. After that, we will decide whether to go for two more franchises or we should confine IPL to eight teams,” he said after the meeting. It has also been decided by the Board that its Annual General Meeting will be scheduled for November 9 and starting the Treasurer’s Office operations from the BCCI Headquarters at the earliest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:02:03.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
