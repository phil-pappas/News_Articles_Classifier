I think ours was the last generation of families to do this, although the economy is helping to make it popular again. Each summer, we’d take one big trip (with my father’s two-week vacation) and each weekend my parents would find someplace exotic, but not too far, to take us. Even though many things changed along the way, (not the rain – that was always the same) one thing did not. It was The Trunk. My mother found it in the attic of the very old house I grew up in and since the hasps and the lock were still in working order, she had my father drag it downstairs to the back yard. She painted it battleship grey and, like any good child of the ‘60s, she covered the inside with contact paper. Voila! We had a dry-goods trunk that was pretty much water and critter proof. These family excursions were both informative and formative. I’ve been in every state in the Union except two (Hawaii and, weirdly, Idaho), I’ve seen more cathedrals and churches than the Pope, Mt. Rushmore, the Hoover Dam, and the world’s largest ball of string (not as big as you’d think). But most of my memories are related to food. My mother never made cinnamon toast at home, or fried bread, and you have no idea how good Hamburger Helper tastes under the stars (and snaps to a woman who can make it over an open campfire). As we grew older and headed off to school, the camping died out. I snagged The Trunk for my first apartment, painted it black and painted all the fittings to look like brass. I thought it was very chic, but I was very young. I still have it and it sits at the end of the bed in my guest bedroom. Now I keep my sweaters in it. I like my sweaters the same way I like my men; big, cuddly, and comforting. For lack of men, I fill in with dogs and sweaters. Every sweater that gets stored in the trunk I’ve made myself. Each fall, I have that moment when I open the trunk and – BAM! – I’m six years old all over again. The scent of Wonder bread and the musty smell of dry goods hits me like a hammer and my mother is telling me to get out the lunch things. I’m right back there in my sneakers and windbreaker and the entirety of a weekend in far-off Delaware stretching before me. The scent only lingers on my sweaters for a couple of days, but I sniff them a lot. Do I need The Trunk to recall those memories? No. But that smell is the perfume of my childhood. It reminds me to remember the good times and the bad. And who says a little nostalgia isn’t good for the soul?
