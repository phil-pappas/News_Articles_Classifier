With 48% of the vote, Trump is trouncing Dr. Ben Carson (14%) and Marco Rubio (12%). The 34-point gap between Trump and Carson dwarfs the 9-point margin between the two in Emerson's recent national poll. Lagging behind the leaders, Jeb Bush has slid to 7%, only slightly ahead of Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz .\nIn the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton leads Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders 59% to 25%, with all other Democrats under 5%. In a sign of trouble for Clinton, 47% of Independents said her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State made them less likely to vote for her, compared to 24% of Democrats who said the same. A majority of Independents (56%) believe her doing so harmed U.S. foreign policy. Independents make up roughly half the state electorate.\nVoters weighed in on a range of other issues. Seven in ten (71%) support the Boston Police Department's pilot program to equip police with body cameras. Only 11% are opposed. Support is mixed for a 2016 state ballot question that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana by adults. Forty-one percent (41%) favor the initiative, and 48% oppose it. In 2012, Massachusetts approved the medical use of marijuana 63% to 37%.\nThose polled strongly favor a proposed federal law that would restrict the sale of tobacco products to those under 21. Support was 59% or higher for both genders, all major political affiliations, and all age groups except those 18 to 34, who oppose the measure 51% to 37%.\nAs the undefeated New England Patriots continue their post-Deflategate \"Revenge Tour,\" 51% of respondents said they believe the Pats will win the Super Bowl this season. By a margin of 48% to 22%, Red Sox fans gave a \"thumbs up\" to manager John Farrell being rehired for the 2016 baseball season. Farrell missed part of this season while undergoing cancer treatment.\nDespite a popular song that extols Boston and the Charles River, voters apparently don't \"love that dirty water,\" at least not enough to drink it. When informed that Harpoon Brewery had used river water to create a special-edition pale ale to commemorate the cleanup of the Charles, only 29% said they would drink it if they were offered a glass.\nCaller ID\nThe Emerson College Polling Society poll was conducted from Friday, October 16 through Sunday, October 18 . The polling sample for the Democratic and GOP primaries consisted of 265 and 271 likely primary voters, respectively, with a margin of error of +/-6% and +/-5.9%, and 629 registered general election voters with a +/-3.9%, and a 95% confidence level. Data was collected using an Interactive Voice Response system.
