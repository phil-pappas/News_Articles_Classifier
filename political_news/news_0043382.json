Rates have remained unchanged since May.\n The Australian dollar pushed higher on the release of the minutes. Just before 11.30am (AEDT), the local currency was trading at US72.58c, but in the minutes immediately after it touched as high as US72.76c.\nThe RBA said there was \"some signs\" that recent regulatory steps to curb surging bank lending to property investors was having some impact in Sydney. That improvement had occurred alongside welcome steps by banks to tighten lending practices and boost their prudential capital levels, it added.\nStill, competition in the mortgage sector remains fierce, and a key policy challenge will be to ensure that lending standards at both foreign and domestic banks did not weaken, it added.\nHouse prices in major capitals like Sydney and Melbourne have climbed sharply over the last year, fanned by speculative investment, low interest rates and strong demand from overseas buyers. The RBA has warned about an imbalance in lending and risks of coming house price falls.\nEarlier cuts in interest rates were still flowing through to the economy and bolstering growth, while a lower Australian dollar was helping in rebalancing the economy away from mining-led growth, the RBA said.\n\"This rebalancing was being increasingly supported by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, which had led to a noticeable increase in net service exports over the past year,\" it added.\nThe Australian dollar has fallen by around 25 per cent against the US dollar in the last year.\nThe RBA cut rates twice in the first half of this year as the economy was belted by sharp falls in commodity prices and growing talk of a slowdown in China, Australia's biggest trading partner.\nBut since then, commodity prices have been steady, or even stronger, giving the RBA scope to remain on the policy sidelines.\nA slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter, which prompted talk of growing recession risks in Australia, appeared due to temporary reasons, the RBA said.\n\"The moderate expansion of the economy had continued, although GDP growth in the June quarter was low, in line with expectations, reflecting what appeared to be temporary weakness in resource exports as well as further falls in mining investment,\" it added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:52:36.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
