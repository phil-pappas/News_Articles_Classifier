The council's action Thursday night (Oct. 8) takes $200,000 from the current year's budget for restrooms at the Dew Drop Jazz and Social Club and at the historic Lang House.\nAn $8,000 budget adjustment was also made for the Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). The city currently has two AEDs, one at City Hall and one at the police department headquarters. Officials did not say where the additional five would be placed.\n\"AEDs are amazing tools that even an untrained person can use to save a life,\" City Councilman Rick Danielson said in a news release.\nThe money for the public restrooms comes partly from state grants and partly from city coffers, officials said. Last month, Mayor Donald Villere said the addition of the facilities would \"be of great benefit to the general public.\"\nThe Dew Drop, which was built in 1895 and has seen minimal renovation over the years, was donated to the city in 2000 and operates as a music hall under the auspices of the non-profit Friends of the Dew Drop. The organization stages about 12 concerts a year at the hall, divided between spring and fall seasons. It does not have restrooms and patrons now use facilities at a church next door. But Villere has said the church facilities are inadequate for the crowds that the Dew Drop attracts.\nIn July of 2013, the city purchased a 120-by-190-foot lot across the street from the Dew Drop that contained a small, dilapidated structure. At the time, city officials said they hoped to eventually convert the building into restrooms.\nThe Lang House was originally located at the corner of Wilkinson Street and Lakeshore Drive, but was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nThe owners donated the house to the city in exchange for having it removed from the lakefront property where it resided for more than 150 years.\nIt was moved to property at 605 Carroll St. and has been completely restored by local historians, but it does not have restrooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:22:26.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
