Government statisticians also confirmed the share of the population in work was the highest since records began in 1971.\nThis depicts a healthier economy than most economists were expecting, after a barrage on indicators have pointed to a slowdown in activity during the third quarter. Analysts underscore that pay for British workers had so far risen on the back of a tighter labor market, as employees found it increasingly difficult to fill job openings, but Wednesday's data points to living standards being boosted by productivity gains.\nIndeed, average weekly wages -- excluding bonuses -- rose 2.8 per cent during the period. Most analysts believe pay will keep edging up in the near term, boosting the purchasing power of households after a seven-year squeeze.\nRecent government data show workers are producing more output for each hour of work, which is a gauge of how much earnings for employees can grow without stoking inflation. Increases in productivity, which have long been poor in Britain, are usually hailed by economists as the best way to ensure rises in living standards will be sustained in the medium term.\nFurther fueling these gains is a fall in the cost of living. Inflation has been close to zero all year, dragged down by the tumbling price of oil and food in the international markets. Fresh data released Tuesday by the ONS showed consumer prices actually fell on the year in September after staying flat in August, which means any rises in pay are even stronger when measured in real purchasing-power terms.\nUK Treasury chief George Osborne called the official figures \"great news,\" but warned that economic growth in Britain's trading partners is slowing.\"We must not be complacent,\" he added.\nStronger productivity, together with a negative inflation rate and concerns about the international outlook, make it increasingly unlikely the Bank of England will raise its main interest rate -- currently pegged at record-low 0.5 per cent -- any time soon. In its last policy meeting, the BOE's rate-setting panel said increases in labor costs were still lower than would be consistent with the central bank hitting its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term.\nHowever, signs of a healthier domestic economy could also persuade some officials that British households and businesses are ready to cope with higher borrowing costs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:57:04.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
