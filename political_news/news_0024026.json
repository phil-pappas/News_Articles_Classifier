Anyone in Lander's district can vote for their favorite projects. The top vote-getters receive funding. \nLander hosted two public brainstorming workshops recently to kick off this year's round of participatory budgeting. \nAt Tuesday's session, residents sat at tables in the P.S. 230 cafeteria and dreamed up project ideas. One man suggested signage that would guide people to getting better exercise in Prospect Park; someone else said they wanted compost bins in Kensington. \n\"It's a good idea,\" said Brooklyn Community Board 12 member Mamnun Haq of the budgeting program. \"Who knows more than the community what they need in their area? You can easily hear the people's voice.\" \nParticipants at Tuesday's workshop included P.S. 230 principal Maria Della Ragione. \"We love it,\" Della Ragione said. \"Walk our classrooms and you'll see PB in action. We've gotten smartboards, we've gotten laptops.\" \nThis year Della Ragione said she's hoping P.S. 230 can win funding to air condition its stifling hot cafeteria. \nLander was one of the first four City Council Members to bring participatory budgeting to New York; this year, 27 council members are using the budgeting tool. \nTraditionally participatory budgeting dollars have been restricted to capital projects that cost more than $35,000, but this year there's funding available in Lander's district for lower cost projects. \nAlso new this year is the voting age — it's been lowered to 14 in Lander's district. \nPeople can submit participatory budgeting ideas online until mid-October. The ballot will be released in the spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:23:04.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
