Mercer and others are not the result of “the post- Citizens United era of unrestricted giving.” Citizens United extended the right of individuals to make unlimited independent expenditures to nonprofit and for-profit corporations, but Mercer’s giving comes from his personal fortune, not a corporation.\nThe culprit behind the Mercer phenomenon is the court’s 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo , which, although upholding limits on what individuals may give directly to candidates, ruled that Congress may not impose limits on what individuals can spend independently. Whether expenditures by Mercer and other ultra-rich individuals are truly independent is much in doubt. Not in doubt is that Citizens United cannot be blamed for the massive spending by billionaires that has the potential to seriously distort our electoral process.\nAlan B.
