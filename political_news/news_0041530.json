It is expected to be introduced to Parliament for its first reading in early 2016. \n\"Young and urban Māori don't know what is going on,\" says Daniel Haines, a spokesperson for the group. He says the consultation documents and hui organised by the Minister have raised more questions than answers. \n\"We have organised our own hui and invited academics, lawyers and other interested people to help us understand the changes,\" says Mr. Haines. \nThe group is calling for the Minister to meet with young people before the Bill is introduced to the House. \n\"We want to help the Minister, because we need a durable law that works for our kids, and theirs,\" says Mr. Haines. \nThe discussion hui is at 6pm on Monday 19 October, Waipapa Marae (University of Auckland) and is open to the public. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:28:28.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
