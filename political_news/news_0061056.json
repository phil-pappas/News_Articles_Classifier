But it inaccurately depicted the debate as between “religious conservatives” and “liberal activists.”\nMany who do not share Davis’s views are ordinary people of faith and deeply religious individuals whose theology on matters of human sexuality differs from that of Davis and Pope Francis. Some are gay, but many are not. While they support gay couples and their families, they would cringe at being labeled “liberal activists.”\nWe all should feel threatened by the notion that an elected government official enjoys religious freedom to discriminate against us. Others who disagree with Davis’s actions are political conservatives who appreciate the genius of our Constitution in protecting religious liberty by keeping government from deciding whose interpretation of scripture is the correct one.\nKaren E.
