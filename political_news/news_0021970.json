The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will provide the remaining 65 percent. Swogger's group is now $9.5 million away from its goal.\nHowever, because two other Tennessee groups are also trying to build veterans homes, it is crucial that the remaining funds be raised before August 2016, Swogger said.\n\"If they get their funds together by Aug. 1, we lose our place in line,\" she said.\nThe home is to be built at the Arlington Development Center and construction could start in January 2017 if funding is in place.\nBut, without the total amount in hand, construction could be delayed for years, which means the cost would go up, she said.\nFundraising began in 2006, when the total cost was $18 million and the group was responsible for $6 million.\nTo date, the state has committed $10 million, the Plough Foundation has pledged $2 million, and Shelby County and an anonymous donor, $1 million, Swogger said.\nThe initial $80,000 donation was made by commission chairman Terry Roland . Each commissioner has a $100,000 grant allocation that can be awarded to nonprofit groups or toward a community enhancement project.\nAfter Swogger's presentation, commissioners Willie Brooks, George Chism, Justin Ford, Eddie Jones, David Reaves and Van Turner each committed to an additional $10,000. Commissioners Melvin Burgess and Reginald Milton each gave $2,500.\nSwogger was joined by a group of veterans and their supporters, along with Kevin Rardin , an assistant district attorney and the chief prosecutor in the county's veterans court.\nRardin served 21 years in the U.S. Army Reserve, including a year in Afghanistan, and pulled from his pockets his military identification tags and a Bronze Star, awarded for valor.\n\"I knew that Commissioner Roland had already led the way by making his commitment,\" Rardin said. \"I had hoped that we would be able to sway some of the other county commissioners today into donating. So I'm gratified.\"\nThe full commission will vote on the grant on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:43:17.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
