Class action lawsuits are often the solution to this problem. If the company cheats you and you alone out of a few hundred dollars, youre probably out of luck. But if the same company illegally cheats thousands of people out of a few hundred dollars as part of the same scheme, class actions allow those thousands of people to join together in one grand lawsuit. Because their combined suit is now worth a lot of money, they are suddenly likely to be able to recruit excellent legal counsel to represent the class. Campbell-Ewald Company v. Gomez, a case the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday, could deal a mortal blow to class action litigation, however. Indeed, if the defendant in Campbell-Ewald prevails, companies that engage in multi-million dollar lawbreaking could gain the power to shut down class action litigation altogether by paying out a tiny fraction of what they should owe. Typically, class action lawsuits are brought by a named plaintiff  often a single individual who alleges an injury that is similar to the injury experienced by all of the other members of the class. Campbell-Ewald involves a government contractor that allegedly violated a federal law prohibiting automated unsolicited text messages. The named plaintiff is Jose Gomez, a man who received one of these messages. . . . And Sanders was wrong about the greed of Wall Street and corporations? I'm a good grrrl, I am.

You're starting to knee jerk that emotionalism right into the big stupidity wall. Why would I read a lying piece by the unqualified thinkprogess when I have read the district court's ruling, the Ninth Circuit court's ruling, and the three questions before the Supreme Court, which you have not read a word of, nor could you find the rulings and the briefs, and if you did, you would not understand a word of it?

OMG....you won't stop digging yourself into the \"I'm so stupid I love it\" hole. Okay, don't let me stand in your way of really making an ass of yourself...keep digging boy. Posts: 9,925 Quote: n their brief, Campbell-Ewalds attorneys rely on a very fine distinction to justify this proposed rule. Though Gomez indicated in his initial legal filing that he was bringing this lawsuit as a class action, courts generally must hold a separate proceeding to certify a class before class action litigation can proceed This is a necessary process to answer questions such as whether the members of the class actually share common claims and whether the named plaintiff is actually representative of the class. Motions asking a court to certify a class are typically hotly contested and may be litigated for months or even years before a class is eventually certified. Campbell-Ewalds attorneys claim that a class only acquires a separate legal status if and when the class has been certified by the district court. In effect, they claim that they have the right to buy off the named plaintiff and shut down a class action until the moment when a class is certified. A class action defendant could wait until a judge is about to rule on the class action certification and then, if they think that the judge is about to rule against them, buy off the named plaintiff and walk away. There are two reasons to believe that the Roberts Court is likely to use this case as a vehicle to undermine class actions. The first is that theyve shown a willingness to do so in the past. In the 2011 decision AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, for example, a 5-4 Court gave companies the power to force consumers to sign away their right to bring a class action as a condition of doing business with the company. Concepcion was an oddly reasoned decision that relied on an irrelevant statute which makes no mention of class actions, so, if nothing else, it demonstrates the Courts willingness to be flexible with the law in this space.
