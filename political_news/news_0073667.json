The number of spaces programming new artists has dropped from 136 to just 88. The London's Grassroots Music Venues Rescue Plan, produced by the Mayor's Music Venues Taskforce, suggests that whilst London's music industry is generating billions for the economy it's under threat at a grassroots level.\nThe Mayor of London Boris Johnson says: 'From the Rolling Stones to David Bowie, the Clash to Oasis and Ed Sheeran to Adele, grassroots music venues have played a key role in enabling some of the biggest names in music to develop as artists and to build audiences. They are the incubators for the stars that go on to pack stadiums in London and across the world. The Music Venues Taskforce report makes it clear that protecting live music venues is crucial to London's continued position as the music capital of the world.\nThe Rescue Plan identifies a range of factors for grassroots music venues closing and continuing to be under threat. This includes rising rents and licensing restrictions; noise complaints by resident and landlords selling venues to developers to turn into housing.\nLast updated Mon 19 Oct 2015 Entertainment Music London Boris Johnson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:29:16.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
