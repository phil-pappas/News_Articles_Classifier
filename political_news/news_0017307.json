And \"unless you're not very bright, you'll be able to see what's going on\" next fall, he said. Appearing on Fox News' \"The Kelly FIle\" on Wednesday night, the retired neurosurgeon called the Democratic candidates' response to a debate question about the Black Lives Matter movement \"so typical of political correctness in our country.\"\n\"Of course all lives matter, and all lives includes black lives. And we have to stop submitting those who want to divide us up into all of these special interest groups and start thinking about what works for everybody,\" he added, remarking that many policies of the current White House have \"hurt black lives\" and \"all people who are in the underclass.\"\n\"You know, the way that we have doubled the national debt and basically abolished the banking system, savings accounts and bonds and things like that, which used to be a mechanism for poor people and middle-class people to grow their money. It virtually doesnâ€™t exist anymore. You have to have risk tolerance so you can go into the stock market. That tends to happen with people with more income,\" he explained.\nCongress\nGOP establishment stands by as activists pummel Ryan By Anna Palmer\nAfter the show contrasted clips of Ronald Reagan and Bernie Sanders from the debate discussing their respective views on inequality, Carson remarked that some people running always want to \"keep class warfare on the front burner\" and \"appeal to the baser instincts of jealousy.\"\n\"And this is ridiculous. You can take all of the money of the top 1 percent, and when you look at our fiscal gap, which is over $200 trillion, and you apply all the money of the top 1 percent, you're not going to get very far,\" he said. \"That's not the answer,\" he said, adding that the answer is fewer regulations and restrictions on growth.\nCarson said he watched most of the debate but said that he kept falling asleep.\n\"It sets 2016 up for a magnificent time in the world of politics because we will be able to contrast a system that is of, for and by the people with a system that is of, for and by the government,\" he predicted.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:38:59.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
