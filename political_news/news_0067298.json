The lawsuit alleges the store ignored several warning signs that the gun was being sold to a “straw buyer,” or someone who was buying a gun for someone who couldn’t legally do so. Officer Bryan Norberg and retired Officer Graham Kunisch were both shot in the face after they stopped Julius Burton for riding his bike on the sidewalk in the summer of 2009. Surveillance video shows that the officers scuffled with Burton and slammed him into a wall before he shot both officers. Investigators said Burton got the weapon a month before the confrontation, after giving $40 to another man, Jacob Collins, to make the purchase at the store in West Milwaukee. One bullet shattered eight of Norberg’s teeth, blew through his cheek and lodged into his shoulder. He remains on the force but said his wounds have made his work difficult. Kunisch was shot several times, resulting in him losing an eye and part of the frontal lobe of his brain. He said the wounds forced him to retire. \nLaws were instigated during the Bush Whitehouse which protected gun store owners from liability in criminal shootings, Recently, presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton promised to repeal these laws. \nThough appeals are expected in the case against Badger Guns, if this ruling stands, the floodgates will be opened and gun store owners will become the focus of the gun control lobby. Instead of focusing on the real criminals, more and more cases will be filed against business people who are just trying to make a living. \nThe criminals will have one more line of protection, and rights will be stripped from law-abiding citizens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:49:17.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
