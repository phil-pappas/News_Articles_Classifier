Lawmakers are taking steps to make sure it never is.\nThe House on Tuesday is expected to pass legislation and send it to Gov. Rick Snyder for his signature.\nThe bill would prohibit the sale, use or possession of powdered alcohol.\nThe legislation’s supporters say the product is unsafe and opens the door to more underage drinking. Creators of the product have said it is no more dangerous than traditional liquid alcohol.\nThe product has won federal approval, and states have been moving quickly to prohibit it.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
