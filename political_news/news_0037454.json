(L to R) Candidates Ginny Deerin, Councilman William Gregorie, Rep. Leon Stavrinakis and John Tecklenburg answered questions concerning the food and beverage industry. Brad Nettles/Staff × The clear winner of this afternoon’s F&B Mayoral Forum was the food-and-beverage industry, which demonstrated its seriousness about city politics through high turnout and thoughtful questions for the four participating candidates.\n“I have never voted in a mayoral election, and I say that aloud just to make everyone feel OK,” Butcher & Bee’s Michael Shemtov said in his opening remarks. Shemtov originally conceived of the event as a get-together for his employees, but ended up partnering with BACE League of Charleston to broaden its scope.\nApproximately 100 people gathered in the Culinary Institute of Charleston auditorium to hear candidates Ginny Deerin, William Gregorie, Leon Stavrinakis and John Tecklenburg take on issues including transportation, workforce training, diversity in restaurants and the late night ordinance. Maurice Washington was expected, but didn’t attend.\n“I thought it was great,” Shemtov said after the two-hour forum concluded. “It’s always a challenge to get people to answer questions directly.”\nFor the most part, candidates stuck to their stump speeches, waiting for the moderators to quiz them on concerns specific to the food-and-beverage industry. And even then, references to restaurant and bar experiences were oddly absent.\nThe only clear indicator of the candidates’ personal involvement with restaurants -- other than Stavrinakis’ mention of his family history of restaurant ownership and Deerin’s allusion to a Lee Lee’s Hot Kitchen construction project delayed by permitting -- came during the lightning round. BACE League’s Elliott Smith essentially asked each candidate “if you were a local restaurant, which local restaurant would you be?”\nStavrinakis chose Manny’s, keeping it in the family: “My brother would kill me if it wasn’t Manny’s,” he said. Gregorie selected Hall’s Chophouse (“it’s a good spot to meet people”), and Deerin picked Charleston Grill (“there’s music and really great booze, although I’m not drinking til I win.”) Tecklenburg went with The Recovery Room, which helped organize the event.\nIn response to the more substantial questions posed by the panel, all four candidates repeatedly stressed the importance of citizen participation in the rulemaking process; improved public transportation and worker training. Candidates were also asked to weigh in on the possibility of a citywide increase in the minimum wage, but none of them advocated an ordinance setting a higher rate.\n“I think as a city we want to be one where employees are paid living wage,” Deerin said, recalling a woman she met at a CARTA bus stop who makes $7.25 an hour as a housekeeper. “We can do better than that. I will work day and night to encourage the private sector to increase our wages.”\nCARTA came up multiple times during the forum, since many food-and-beverage workers can’t afford to live or park downtown, which remains the city’s restaurant hub.\n“We are now working with CARTA to make sure they have service when people get off work,” said councilman Gregorie, who represented himself as the establishment candidate. “When they say something good about our city, they’re talking about me, folks,” he later said in one of the event’s few laugh lines.\nTecklenburg suggested creating a program to discount public parking for food-and-beverage employees, while Deerin called for a dedicated late-night shuttle and park-and-ride lots. Gregorie asked for a show of hands by workers who live in the peninsula and drive to work: “I think that’s where we need to start. Making sure (people on the) peninsula use bicycles and public transportation.”\nNone of the candidates provided a proposal for monitoring late-night activity, although both Deerin and Stavinakas called the current late night regulations flawed; Tecklenburg said it was “the wrong move” to adopt them.\n“It seems like there are a lot of other things that you could go through before you start talking about moratoriums and shutdowns,” Stavinakas said. “In the end, when you’re shutting things down, it doesn’t serve the community long-term.”\nCandidates were also asked how they would ease the regulatory burdens on bars and restaurants. Stavinakas declined to name an issue, saying “I would want to ask you guys what our problems are.” Tecklenburg suggested the permitting process could be sped up by outsourcing reviews if city staff was overextended. “I’d like to revisit why you have to clean your sidewalks,” Deerin said.\nTo conclude the forum, each candidate was allowed to briefly address the audience. A condensed version of their comments follows:\nJohn Tecklenburg My involvement has been mostly through helping non-profit agencies; through my faith in God and having worked for Mayor Riley. My wife Sandy and I raised family of five here, so we have a deep understanding of Charleston. You all are such an important part of serving not just our visitors, but have led to such a vitality. It’s part of our culture as Charlestonians. I’m a common-sense business guy, and I feel like I have a pretty good moral compass.\nLeon Stavinakas The turnout says how much you care about your industry and the city. You know, for 40 years, we’ve seen the difference that strong proven leadership makes for city. We’ve seen the city transform. So now we have to ask ourselves what we want moving forward. I have a proven record of getting things done for Charleston. We have amazing opportunities and really big challenges in front of us.\nWilliam Gregorie I’m ready day one to be mayor of city of Charleston. I know how to bring the dollars to our city. In addition, I have established rapport with our current department heads and staff. One of the greatest achievements we’ve had is women and minority businesses. (At the) Gilliard, we have $45 million coming back to women and minorities…again, please vote for me. My mantra is one Charleston, a city which works for everyone. The whole Mother Emanuel incident makes me ready because I’ve been tested.\nGinny Deerin I am you. I have waited tables late at night and waited tables early in the morning. I’ve been manager of a restaurant just long enough to know how hard that is. I have many friends and many supporters in the F&B business. From my personal experience, I do believe I understand issues you face and want very much to work with you in partnership. I really think you are so much our heart and soul of what makes our city such a wonderful place. Whether you’re a big restaurant or small restaurant, I cannot wait to begin working with you to make our city an even greater city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:42:23.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
