The plant needs millions of dollars in safety improvements.\nThe 680-megawatt plant, which went online in 1972, was relicensed in 2012 for another 20 years.\nThe timing of the shutdown depends on several factors, including further discussion with ISO-New England, the operators of the region's power grid.\nEntergy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leo Denault said the decision to close Pilgrim was \"incredibly difficult.\"\nLow current and forecast low wholesale energy prices are expected to lead to annual losses of more than $40 million in revenue for Pilgrim.\nBill Mohl, president of Entergy Wholesale Commodities, said Tuesday that the plant is expected to spend $45 million to $60 million under the enhanced oversight of the plant.\nAfter shutting down, Pilgrim will transition to decommissioning. The Pilgrim nuclear decommissioning trust had a balance of about $870 million as of Sept. 30, 2015.\nThe spent nuclear fuel at the site will be placed in storage onsite and could be there for decades.\nThe decision to close the plant was a \"decision of last resort,\" Mohl said.\n\"Losing Pilgrim as a significant power generator not only poses a potential energy shortage, but also highlights the need for clean, reliable, affordable energy proposals,\" Gov. Charlie Baker said.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
