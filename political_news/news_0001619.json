He does it better than I do.\"\nLarry David portrays Bernie Sanders on \"Saturday Night Live\" (left) and the Vermont senator himself. NBC / Getty Images Contributor advertisement Sanders was campaigning in Fort Madison, hours after an \"SNL\" skit made fun of last week's televised Democratic debate .\nMimicking Sanders, David said: \"I'm the only candidate up here who's not a billionaire. I don't have a Super PAC, I don't have a backpack. I carry my stuff around loose in my arms like a professor between classes … I own one pair of underwear — that's it.\"\nReal-life Sanders responded: \"Last week, I bought my second pair of underwear,\" adding: \"Please don't write it down. That was a joke.\"\nHe later speculated that his scraggly image endeared him to voters and talked of how his impoverished childhood established him as the outsider in the race for the Democratic ticket.\n\"Well I think it's my hair that attracts the American people,\" he joked. \"Neat, well groomed, your typical politician.\"\nadvertisement Sanders added: \"I think the fact that my dad came to this country at the age of 17 without a nickel in his pocket … I grew up in a 3-1/2 room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, our family never had a lot of money and from my earliest years I am more than aware of what it is like to grow up in a family that did not have a lot of money and that's a lesson that I have not forgotten.\"\n\"We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world,\" Sanders said. \"People shouldn't have seniors trying to figure out how to live and we shouldn't have the highest rate of childhood poverty on earth.\"\nHe also remarked on the challenge ahead in Iowa, saying: \"If we win in this state — it's close but think we can — I think it lays a groundwork to victory. If we win this thing, it would be the biggest political upset in modern America.\"\nFacebook Twitter Google Plus Embed 2:48 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog advertisement", "external_links": ["http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/re5hh7oo5Fgu", "http://www.today.com/popculture/larry-david-plays-bernie-sanders-hilarious-saturday-night-live-sketch-t50836", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-the-best-of-bernie-sanders-at-debate-544051779592", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1267186/151019-bernie-larry-jpo-629a_65c9381c6484a8de6803547544840b0a.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_21427708", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/a_orig_bestbernie2_151013.jpg", "http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=a_orig_bestbernie_151013", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/WHPEFKvExSnq", "https://twitter.com/share?text=FROM", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.nbcnews.com/video/watch-the-best-of-bernie-sanders-at-debate-544051779592&t=FROM", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/L10HfWeXRq0U", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/phcFTQT7nerB", "http://nbcnews.to/1VRJ4G5", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/DnsaC5yYfyxk", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1267186/151019-bernie-larry-jpo-629a_65c9381c6484a8de6803547544840b0a.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000.jpg", "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_43/1267186/151019-bernie-larry-jpo-629a_65c9381c6484a8de6803547544840b0a.nbcnews-ux-600-700.jpg", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/UHsDZOugje_s"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:27:27.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
