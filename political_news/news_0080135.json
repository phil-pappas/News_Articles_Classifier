Without active management, it is predicted bats will become extinct on the mainland within 50 years. \nThe money received by Forest & Bird will be used to employ a project manager to expand their predator control network, work closely with iwi to develop a community education package, and restore habitat in the Pelorus catchment. \nForest & Bird’s Regional Conservation and Volunteer Manager, Debs Martin, is excited with the result. “Not only do Forest & Bird contribute to a range of outstanding restoration projects in the region, but the additional capacity provided by this significant funding boost from the Ministry’s Conservation Community Partnership Fund, enables us to make a big difference in protecting our threatened animals and places.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:52:28.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
