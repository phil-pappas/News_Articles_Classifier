A Hindu mob had smashed through the heavy wooden door to the man's home, then beat him to death with his wife's sewing machine.\nThe legislator's anger, though, was not about the killing. Instead, Sangeet Som was furious that men had been arrested in the attack in the village, just 30 miles from New Delhi. Som, a member of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, called the arrests \"atrocities on innocent villagers.\" As for the family of the dead man, he dismissed them as \"those cow killers.\"\nA few days later, a half-dozen BJP politicians slapped around a legislator on the floor of a state legislature, angry that he had served beef at a party. In southern India, six members of a leftist student political party were suspended after their attempt to serve beef curry on campus to protest the farmer's killing set off a melee. On Friday, violence swept another northern village amid rumors that a cow had been slaughtered, with a crowd, who had chased down two Muslim men they suspected of cow-killing, clashing with police and burning several cars. Some villagers and police were injured, but no major injuries were reported.\nCows have long been sacred to Hindus, worshipped as a mother figure and associated since ancient times with the god Krishna. But increasingly, cows are also political. They have become a tool of political parties, an electioneering code word and a rallying cry for both Hindu nationalists and their opponents.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence on the late September mob killing of Mohammad Akhlaq, saying religious and ethnic bigotry threatened the country's economic growth.\n\"We should decide if Hindus want to fight Muslims or poverty. Muslims must decide if they want to fight Hindus or poverty,\" Modi said at a campaign rally in Bihar state, where elections start next week. \"It is unity, communal harmony, brotherhood and peace that will take the nation forward.\"\nBut Modi also rose to power as Hindu nationalist, and since his election last year hard-line Hindus have been demanding that India ban the sale of beef — a key industry within India's poor, minority Muslim community. In many Indian states, the slaughtering of cows and selling of beef are already either restricted or banned.\nIn the past, Modi has spoken out angrily against India's beef industry.\n\"Brothers and sisters, I don't know whether this saddens you, but my heart screams out\" at the rise of Indian beef exports, Modi said in a 2012 speech. \"I am unable to understand why you are silent, why you are taking this lying down.\"\nSince becoming prime minister, though, he has danced delicately between an intense desire to be seen as a tolerant international statesman — the sort of man who is greeted warmly by presidents and jokes around with Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg — and the need to satisfy a political base that is deeply distrustful of Muslims and other minorities.\nThat dance has, his critics say, emboldened extremist Hindus and given rise to everything from a series of church vandalisms to the recent mob killing. Criticism of cow slaughter, some say, is often simply code for anti-Muslim sentiments.\nIndia, a country of 1.3 billion, is about 81 percent Hindu and 13 percent Muslim.\n\"I am afraid the hotheads will get busier. They are greatly encouraged and their strength is rather strong,\" said Inder Malhotra, a political analyst and former editor of the Times of India newspaper. \"One of the reasons this prime minister keeps quiet about it, is that he doesn't want to lose these Hindus because they are a very strong proportion of his supporters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:26:50.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
