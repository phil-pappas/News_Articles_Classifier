Photo: John Greim/LOOP IMAGES/Corbis\nAt a Target in San Jose, California, on Wednesday , bargain hunters and their children were treated to what sounds like a very titillating porn soundtrack over the store's loudspeakers while they were busy browsing the aisles for discounted cat litter and birthday cards they'd never send. In a video captured by Gina Young , a local shopper carting around her children, she asks the question on everyone's mind: \"What is going on at Target right now?\" Her son is heard weeping uproariously in the background as sexy groaning plays out.\n\"People offered to help me cover my twins' ears. Others threw their stuff down and walked out. Employees were running around everywhere. Picking and hanging up phones, which worked ... for about two minutes before it started up again,\" Young posted on her Facebook page. Imagine the horror! There is as yet no explanation for why the porny soundtrack was streamed over the Target store's speakers but one thing is certain: Muzak will sound even more disappointing from here on out.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvGBQ9bev2k", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/10/15/porn-audio-blares-over-target-loudspeakers/73996670/", "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/video/3307073-x-rated-audio-shocks-customers-at-san-jose-target-store/"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:05:37.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
