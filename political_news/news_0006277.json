Now we know that he was cashing cheques from his Tory friends in the City at the same time. There is more than a whiff of hypocrisy here.\"\nBlackford insisted he didn’t know Craigen had given money to the Conservatives in the past.\nShare article He said: “I have no knowledge of him being a Tory. He just gave us a small donation.”\nA spokesman for Craigen declined to comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-25T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:02:18.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
