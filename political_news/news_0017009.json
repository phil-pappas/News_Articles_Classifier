Trump, the self-funding real estate developer, has sown doubt and uncertainty among the Republican Party’s donor class. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bush have kept up a grueling schedule of fund-raisers, with Mr. Bush’s campaign holding at least 58 events over t 90 days ending in September. Mr. Cruz’s campaign, by contrast, said that 6,000 of his small contributors had pledged to make recurring donations every month — providing enough cash flow, with no fund-raising appearances necessary, to cover Mr. Cruz’s expenses in the first four primary states, as well as in others where the campaign has set up operations. “There is tremendous power among these donors,” said John Pudner, a former campaign manager to Representative Dave Brat of Virginia — the conservative who unseated Eric Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican in the House, in 2014 — who now heads a conservative group that looks to empower small donors. “I think they’re realizing that they can be a counterbalance, particularly social conservatives.” The reliance on small donors does not always come without a cost. Mr. Carson has relied heavily on expensive direct mail and telemarketing consultants to raise money, spending prohibitive sums in the first months of his campaign. But Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush both spent at an even higher rate than Mr. Carson — four of every five dollars each man raised — in the three months ending Sept. 30. Terry Giles, who was Mr. Carson’s campaign manager and now advises super PACs supporting him, said that Mr. Carson and other upstart candidates, including Mr. Sanders on the left, had benefited in their fund-raising from public distaste over “establishment” politicians. “Political endorsements mean nothing,” Mr. Giles said. “If anything, they just turn people off. It’s a whole new ballgame.” Photo Carly Fiorina signed autographs after an event in Davenport, Iowa, last month.

While super PACs are not required to disclose updated fund-raising totals until January, groups backing Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush have reported raising at least $140 million in unlimited contributions. Mr. Rubio, reflecting his straitened finances, has relied for television advertising on a nonprofit group , Conservative Solutions, which does not disclose its donors. Mr. Cruz is the only one of the candidates emphasizing their outsider status who has succeeded in the super PAC realm: Groups backing him have raised at least $38 million ($15 million of it from the Wilks family, who earned billions of dollars in the fracking boom and are staunch opponents of abortion and same-sex marriage ). Mr. Carson is now scrambling to catch up: Advisers to his super PAC held a donor gathering at a Texas ranch last weekend, and Mr. Giles said the group expected large financial commitments in the weeks ahead. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:29:42.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
