Reducing benefits or raising premiums for those now retired, regardless of income, is inherently unfair.\nThis strategy also imposes additional uncertainty for those nearing retirement and engaged in retirement planning. Any efforts to maintain the solvency of these systems should remain focused on pre­retirement modifications such as increasing the retirement age and the level of income subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes. And changes to these systems should not be used as a covert means of wealth redistribution.\nDonald J.
