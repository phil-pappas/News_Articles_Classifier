Voters asked to give it a shot Comments \nVoters in Coos County will decide next month whether to adopt an ordinance to prohibit local enforcement of Oregon's new background check law and to direct the sheriff to determine which state and federal gun laws are unconstitutional. \nThe Nov. 3 vote, in the wake of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in the county just east of Coos, is a sign of the deep support for gun rights in much of rural Oregon. \nSupporters gathered the signatures to put the measure on the ballot before a gunman killed nine and wounded nine others at the college Oct. 1. But sponsor Rob Taylor predicted that the heightened debate over gun control since the shootings will only increase support for the measure from voters worried about additional firearms restrictions. \n\"I'm so confident that this Second Amendment measure will pass, I'm not spending one dime,\" said Taylor, a retired optician living in Bandon. \nAlmost identical measures have been approved by commissions in eastern Oregon's Wheeler and Wallowa counties. And many other counties have adopted measures expressing support for gun rights and opposition to Oregon's new law requiring background checks on private gun transfers . \nThe Coos County measure has attracted legal doubts about whether localities can decide on their own which laws are constitutional. \n\"Federal courts have been very hostile to local officials ignoring state and federal laws,\" said Norman Williams, a professor at Willamette University's law school and director of its Center for Constitutional Government. Summary of Coos County gun-rights measure Summary of Coos County gun-rights measure A yes vote adopts and makes part of the Coos County Code the Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance. If approved the ordinance requires: • Any law or regulation in violation of the U.S. or Oregon Constitution pertaining to the right to bear arms to be deemed as unconstitutional and void; • Prohibits the use of Coos County funds, facilities and employees to enforce or punish any law, rule or order that infringes upon the right to bear arms such as (not exclusive): • Registration requirements for lawfully owned firearms • Prohibitions as to \"assault\" type firearms • Restrictions pertaining (to) magazine capacity, clip capacity or types of ammunition • Background check requirements beyond those required in December 2012 • Restrictions prohibiting possession, carry or transport of lawfully possessed firearms and ammunition • Requires Sheriff to determine whether any law or regulation pertaining to the right to bear arms violates the U.S. or Oregon Constitution • Exempts current criminal laws pertaining to firearms from the ordinance • Provides financial penalties for violations of the ordinance Source: Coos County Elections \n\"This strikes me as much ado about symbolism and little to do about protecting Second Amendment rights,\" he added. If opponents think the background check law is unconstitutional, he said, they should \"go to the federal courthouse and sue.\" \nCoos County Sheriff Craig Zanni, who would get the task of figuring out what gun laws are constitutional, describes himself as a strong supporter of gun rights. \nBut Zanni said in an interview this week that he has \"some concerns about the wording\" of the ballot measure, particularly the notion that the sheriff should scrutinize the constitutionality of laws. \n\"I'm not sure the courts would agree with that concept,\" he said. \"I would just bet there would be some legal challenges to it.\" \nZanni said he doesn't intend to do anything different if voters approve the measure. \nCounty Commissioner John Sweet said passage of the measure \"would put us in a very, very awkward spot.\" \nIt's one thing to ask local elected officials to uphold the Constitution, Sweet added, and quite another \"to ask them to make their own constitutional interpretations.\" He declined to say how the county would react if the measure passes. \nCurrently, Zanni said he doesn't go out looking for violations of the new background check law, saying he has other enforcement priorities. But he said he wasn't ruling out that someone in Coos County could face prosecution if they violated the law. \nIn that sense, Zanni is following the lead of many sheriffs around Oregon. Retired Curry County Sheriff John Bishop, who now runs the Oregon State Sheriffs Association, said his group has repeatedly made it clear sheriffs will enforce the laws \"whether we support them or not.\" \nAt the same time, he said, \"we don't have the resources to do everything,\" particularly in rural counties where many sheriffs are hard-pressed just to keep 24-hour patrols. \nWallowa County Sheriff Steve Rogers said he was initially concerned about the language in his county's ordinance directing him to scrutinize the constitutionality of gun laws. But he said he concluded that any directive he came up with would ended up facing legal challenge anyway. \nIn the end, he said, the two-year-old ordinance \"hasn't affected my job one way or another.\" \nIn Wheeler County, Oregon's least populated, Judge Patrick Perry said the ordinance there hasn't been challenged legally or had an impact on law enforcement. \"I would say I have to view it more as symbolic,\" he said. \nThe three Coos County commissioners in April signed a letter opposing the background check bill, then moving through the Legislature. But the commission didn't act on Taylor's request to enact his \"Second Amendment preservation\" ordinance. In response, Taylor gathered enough signatures – 1,436 were required – to place the measure on the ballot. \nTaylor acknowledged that his measure could be largely symbolic. But he said he would welcome a legal challenge to test how far local officials can go in refusing to enforce laws they regard as unconstitutional. \n\"Until we get a challenge on it, we don't know how effective or ineffective it is,\" said Taylor. He argued that the expanded background checks unfairly raised the costs of buying a gun privately and amounts to the registration of firearms. \nNobody seems to be running an opposition campaign. Penny Okamoto, executive director of Ceasefire Oregon, which supports stricter gun laws, said her group decided not to campaign against it. \n\"We can talk about it until we're blue in the face,\" she said, \"but it's not constitutional...This is way out of the realm of what a sheriff is capable of doing.\" \nCORRECTION : An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that \"several\" counties had adopted proposals defending gun rights and opposing the background check law. It should have said \"many\" counties. \n--Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:36:36.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
