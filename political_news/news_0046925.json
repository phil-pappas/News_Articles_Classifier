Charm is also evident. No one gets elected to anything without charm. \n\"For the record,\" he says, not once but several times, \"I have and always will be the longest serving Haitian native elected in the United States of America … because every Haitian community leader is behind me. Always, always behind me.\" Buy Photo \nSpring Valley Mayor Demeza Delhomme speaks during a meeting with the editorial board of the Journal News in West Nyack Sept. 29, 2015. (Photo: Joe Larese/The Journal News) \nDelhomme has a tough job. \nSpring Valley is a chronically troubled village. \nLong before the Tappan Zee Bridge was built, it was a Rockland County summer resort for New York City residents who wanted to escape the heat. Starting in the 1960s, the village was rapidly transformed by an immigration wave from Caribbean and Central American countries. Many of the new residents found homes in the old resort hotels that were converted into cheap, substandard housing. Now, Spring Valley is one of the poorest municipalities in the state. Almost one-quarter of its residents live below the poverty line. Its per capita income is $16,359, which is half the state average and lower than even that of Bronx County. \nConsisting of two square miles, Spring Valley is a crowded place with a population that grew 23.1 percent in the first 10 years of the 21st century. According to estimates, there are at least 32,500 people living in the village today. \nPredictably the village is beset by problems — fire safety hazards, building code violations, crime, homelessness, hunger and so on. \nAll of these vexing issues are on Delhomme's plate. \nNevertheless, his biggest problem, he seems to suggest, are the people who thwart him — among them a contentious board of village trustees and the press, namely The Journal News. \nAt a meeting held Tuesday with members of the newspaper's editorial board, Delhomme unleashed a bravura rant that was exhausting to listen to, and yet must have been a catharsis for him. \nStories written about him were \"unfair and unjust,\" he insisted. \nThese reports \"destroyed my credibility, destroyed my family. Your newspaper was putting in gutter journalism about me. It's unfair. It has to be corrected immediately!\" \nThe overall message was that Delhomme's accomplishments could easily be discovered and reported if the right people were interviewed. \nNevertheless, even the aggrieved mayor has to admit that his first two years in office have been controversial. Actually, it's been a train wreck. \nDuring his first year in office, he was jailed for four days when he defied a court order to open a summer day camp for children. He shut the program down, he claims, because it operated in a \"broken run-down building\" and was \"poorly run.\" However, he claimed on Tuesday that he complied with the court order by unlocking the building, but that one of his adversaries secretly re-locked it — and that got him in trouble with the judge. \nHe had just completed his first year as mayor in January when three citizens accused him of misconduct and malfeasance and filed a 41-page lawsuit to get him kicked out of office. The charges ranged from illegally hiring and firing village employees to using the village's credit card and E-Z Pass for personal trips. \nAt a June 8 public meeting, he had a verbal exchange with a nemesis, Trustee Vilair Fonvil. \nDelhomme stood up, waved his hands and started shouting. \n\"You heard from me,\" he said. \"That's the king! That's the king! You heard it from the king!\" \nWas this a fit of small-town megalomania, or an example of Delhomme's sense of humor? Several witnesses laughed, so it may have been the latter case. Who knows. \nHardly a laughing matter, however, is the fact that the village has been operating without a budget since June — again the result of the mayor's contentious relationship with the board. \nWhatever his critics think of Delhomme, they cannot say he's worse than his predecessor, Noramie Jasmin, who was convicted of taking bribes. The former mayor is presently serving a four-year sentence in a federal lockup. \nDelhomme said he is a man of principles who is not motivated by money and greed. He said that he donates his entire mayoral salary to local charities and needy individuals. \n\"I don't have a red cent,\" he said. \"I don't need that money to buy a house. I have my own house to live in forever until I die.\" \nHe also said he felt he was paid too much so he cut his salary from $125,000 to $115,000. \nThis was news to us. \nThe $10,000 pay cut was contained in Resolution No. 128. It passed unanimously, proving that some things are easily settled in Spring Valley.
