He lives in Washington. \nYour bio says before you went into radio, you were an actor. What was your best part? Annys Shin has been a staff writer at the Washington Post since 2004. View Archive Google+ I was not a professional actor. I wanted to be. I was a member of a theater group. We ended up doing a series of children’s plays on the radio. The station asked if we could do a news magazine. We said, “Sure, we can act like news people.” [Later], I saw a job advertised by the Howard University radio station for a news editor and thought having played [one] before that that qualified me to apply. I faked them out and got it and have been doing radio ever since. \nBasically, you’ve been typecast. Basically, I’m a fake newsman. [Laughs.] \nWas your radio voice always the same as it is now? [After a friend] said I should learn to speak from my diaphragm, I was so fixated on going lower to my diaphragm that I started speaking in a deeper voice. If you heard my voice before I was in radio it was probably an octave higher. \nWhat do you do to prepare for work each day? First, there is the abandonment of a social life, because doing a long-form interview show every day requires a great deal of reading. Last year, I got Wizards season tickets in order to force myself to have some place to go in the evenings. I ended up giving away half of the tickets. \nYou interview a lot of prominent people. Do you ever get star-struck? And if so, how do we tell? I am never star-struck. I am really turned off by stars. I tend to want to interview reclusive people. There is a writer named Edward P. Jones who is extremely reclusive. This is a guy who I used to run into at the Whole Foods who would avoid eye contact. But I was always so impressed by him. He wrote a book several hundred-and-some pages long and had memorized it all before he wrote it. He is the “un-star.” Those are the people who really impress me, people who have remarkable gifts who don’t seem very anxious to be famous. \nYou once said tough questions don’t have to be confrontational. Are there ever exceptions? Yes. If I were to interview Louis Farrakhan and I said, “Do you really believe that white people were created by a mad black scientist?” I suspect that there would be a few tense moments there. But if I ever interview him again, I am determined to ask that question. \nWho would you rather make a buddy movie with: [easygoing “Politics Hour” regular] Tom Sherwood or [combative ex-“Politics Hour” commentator] Mark Plotkin? Plotkin. Because there would be more conflict. \nFor stories, features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit WP Magazine . \nFollow the Magazine on Twitter . \nLike us on Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:36:48.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
