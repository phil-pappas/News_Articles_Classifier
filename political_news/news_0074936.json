Charlie Baker’s new plan for lifting the cap on charter schools was blasted by union and education leaders who skewered the governor for attempting to take money away from public schools while failing to address the root problems they say charter schools present.\n“The governor’s proposal continues to punish urban public schools in order to reward quasi-private charter schools,” said Richard Stutman, president of the Boston Teachers Union. “At a time when resources are scarce, it is a disservice to our 57,000 students to take any funds away from public schools.”\nBaker yesterday announced his intention to file legislation to increase the number of charter schools by 12 a year focused in districts that are performing in the bottom 25 percent statewide. The current cap limits the number of charter schools to 120. Under the proposed legislation, charter schools would be allowed to use a weighted lottery system that would favor “high-need” and low-income students as well as become a part of choice-based district enrollments.\nCritics latched on to the dual systems of schools charters are creating, with little headway made on parental input and disciplinary standards that have been the source of scorn among the opposition.\n“Charter schools use hyper-disciplinary policies and high suspension rates to serve fewer high-need students than public schools,” Marlena Rose, coordinator for the Boston Education Justice Alliance, said in a statement. “This enables them to make inflated claims of success without acknowledging they serve a different population, and abandons the students who are pushed out of charter schools.”\nBaker said his plan “puts mechanisms in place” to address those types of students, including those with disabilities. But critics pounced on the small number of kids his plan will actually affect.\n“I think you (have to) fix the system,” said Paul Dakin, superintendent emeritus of Revere Public Schools, on Herald Radio’s “NewsFeed” program. “Not by a short-sighted approach by looking at 3 percent of the students, because that’s all we have in charter schools right now. The real problem needs to be tackled by addressing all schools in all districts and not leaving kids behind because we’re going to lift the cap on charter schools.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:16:26.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
