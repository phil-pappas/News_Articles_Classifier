Brian Schweitzer endorsed former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, giving his Democratic colleague a boost as the Democratic field thinned out this week.\n\"I'm endorsing Martin for President today because I believe he is the candidate that best represents the future of our Party,\" Schweitzer said in a statement. \"Martin and I worked closely together as Democratic governors, and I saw firsthand how he didn't just talk about his progressive valuesâ€”he actually put them into action.\"\nSchweitzer, who was at one time considered a possible 2016 Democratic presidential contender, will also serve as the national co-chairman of O'Malley's campaign.\nThe endorsement comes just hours after former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee announced he was dropping his bid and a few days after former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb dropped his bid.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:10:48.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
