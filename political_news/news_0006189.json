Our courts have already determined, once you're on a public road, the public safety takes precedent, and DUI checkpoints are legal, and you are obligated to cooperate with them. In this state you will be arrested based solely on not cooperating, and you are always welcome to spend the thousands necessary fighting it, which is exactly what you will do. And still end up losing. By the way, it takes on average 4 years to get your case heard in the state appeals courts. Unless you have political connections, or have a lot of money and time on your hands, you're in a no win situation. I guess Virginia said fuck the right to a fair and SPEEDY trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:51:54.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
