The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is looking into the Thursday shooting on the Kaibab Plateau. The Arizona Game and Fish Department says the shooting was self-reported and the agency conducted a preliminary investigation. Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement personnel have taken it over. California condors were listed as endangered in 1967. They were reintroduced to northern Arizona in 1996. About 70 condors are in a flock that roams the Arizona-Utah border.
