Only three people were injured in one incident in 2007, caused in part by the surface of the runways, the city argues. And Hopkins boasts one of the lowest rates of pilot deviations in the FAA Central Region.\nIn the statement, the city commits to staffing the airfield maintenance team by working with an employment agency and reaching out to trade schools and other sectors of the aviation industry to find qualified candidates.\n\"With these new, creative methods to maintain staffing levels, the City will be well equipped to handle the upcoming winter season,\" McGory wrote, promising that the city will have 108 employees on the airport's snow removal team – 92 percent of the budgeted level – by Oct. 17.\nThe response goes on to address each of the FAA's allegations related to specific dates at the airport.\nThe city attributes some of the incidents to poor judgment on the part of individual supervisors.\nSuch was the case, one night in December 2013, when a supervisor allowed the entire maintenance crew to go home just before it began to snow, and two aircraft became stuck on taxiways, unable to brake on the icy pavement.\nIn another case, city officials said, the FAA is holding the airport responsible for flight diversions during a 22-minute window while snow was falling and both major runways happened to be shut down for plowing.\nMcGory wrote that the airfield maintenance crew reacted as soon as pilots began reporting poor braking conditions. And given that Hopkins, like many major airports, doesn't have the equipment to plow both runways at once, the airport opted to shut one down and plow the other, he wrote.\nThe flight diversion that occurred during those minutes was just poor timing outside of the airport's control, the city's response states.\nIn still other cases, when the FAA said the airport failed to properly treat runways with deicing chemicals, the city argues that pilots' observations of the pavement conditions did not align with the airport's own objective testing, which concluded that conditions were good.\nAs for the numerous days when the airport was not fully staffed, in violation of the FAA agreement, airport officials concede that was true.\nBut the city argues that the number of workers per shift is secondary to the overarching goal of actually keeping the runways safe.\nSzabo said the FAA's true standard is to have sufficient staff on hand to clear runways within 22 minutes. Those goals were met, he contends.\nThe minimum staffing requirements, which fluctuated based on the severity of weather conditions, were mostly \"self-imposed\" Szabo said.\nThey began as an internal management tool, he said, and somehow found their way into the FAA snow and ice control plan.\nAnd the standards that were set, \"at the end of the day, turned out to be not very helpful and somewhat arbitrary,\" he said.\nSzabo said the calculation was based on how many workers and pieces of equipment would be necessary to plow the airfield efficiently, given the predicted inches of snowfall. But it is effective only if the weather is predictable, he said. And different kinds of snow require different deployment strategies.\nIn the future, a command staff will meet regularly to discuss the weather and determine whether to activate the new snowplowing program, which calls for each shift to overlap.\n\"It gives us the ability to monitor the actual conditions vs. the prediction and have sufficient staff here,\" Szabo said. \"I would rather err on the side of safety than have to worry about how many individuals are here.\"\nSzabo recoiled from questions about former Airport Director Ricky Smith's recent assertions that Mayor Frank Jackson's administration ordered him to cut his budget by leaving some airfield maintenance positions unfilled.\nJackson's spokesman has said that Smith had \"standing authority\" to fill vacant positions critical to the daily operations at the airport, including airfield maintenance, without seeking further approval.\nSzabo, who was airport commissioner under Smith, said he discussed his staffing concerns with Smith but does not know why Smith didn't fill the budgeted positions.\nWhen pushed, Szabo added that he holds some responsibility for those vacancies, too. But he declined to elaborate.\n\"I own what happened and what didn't happen,\" Szabo said. \"But I prefer to look forward rather than look back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:41:02.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
