Logan College to discuss the impact of the state's budget crisis on higher education. \nWhile college leaders described some tough and painful days ahead, without state help, the committee's chairman emphasized the need for them to live within their means in an ever more competive climate.\"There are some programs that we're probably tonna have to say no to, or delay,\" said Illinois Senator Kyle McCarter (R) of Lebanon. The Illinois Senate Higher Education Committee began it's hearings Thursday with that ominous warning. It set the tone for testimony from community college and university presidents about the dire financial straits higher education finds itself due to the Illinois budget crisis.\"If a budget deal is not reached by February, significant adjustments to the college will have to be made,\" explained Larry Peterson of JALC, who revealed the college currently runs a cash deficit of three million dollars. Further cuts, he said, would send shockwaves for miles around.\"..and it will be a very draconian kind of effect on not only the institution, but also the Southern Illinois economy.\" Meaning, less job training, and less opportunity. Others stressed how much state money they've saved.\"But really, we're looking at roughly a quarter of what we do, based on state support. That's down significantly over the past ten years,\" said SIU President Randy Dunn. But the head of the committee says it's not enough.\"My constituants come to me, day after day and say 'listen, I'm gonna go to Murray State, I'm gonna go to Mizzou, it's a lot cheaper there' they shouldn't be able to say that,\" said McCarter. He says the colleges need to cut costs, like pensions, wages, workman's comp, and procurement to remain competitve.\"We want to help students, we do. But the way you do that, you lower your costs, so you can be competitive with the University of Missouri,\" he explained. McCarter believes lower costs boost the economy, meaning more jobs and fewer people leaving Illinois for greener pastures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:36:52.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
