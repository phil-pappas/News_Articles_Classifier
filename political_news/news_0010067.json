Alphabet's stock price has largely increased since Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced a corporate reorganization on October 2 to separate and oversee the company's portfolio of businesses. \nReCode reports that today will also be the first time new Google CEO Sundar Pichai will be on the analyst call. Analysts expect Alphabet to post an earnings-per-share of $7.21 with revenue of $18.53 billion, up 12 percent from $16.52 billion one year ago. \nGOOGL is currently trading at $685.52, up by about $12 or 1.88 percent since closing yesterday. Last quarter's (Q2) earnings report, also CFO Ruth Porat's debut, provided sales of $14.35 billion and spurred the largest one-day stock rally in history following Porat's vocal commitment to fiscal responsibilities. \nThe Alphabet reshuffle should translate into greater financial clarity for many more of Google's side ventures, including Google Fiber and their life sciences work. And though the company has promised the public numbers on its non-Google ventures, that information will not begin to be disseminated until next year. As a result, today's report remains, for all intents and purposes, a search engine-centric Google earnings call just as it always has been. This obviously includes some large brands, like YouTube and Google Play, but don't expect an update on Nest for example. Here's the three things we're watching heading into today's report : \n1.) The intro of Pichai as CEO \nBoth Pichai and Porat will likely work in tandem to answer questions related to Alphabet's financials. Expect more of the same, however, in term of investor interest related to continued mobile viewership growth of Youtube and the number of views and CPCs (cost-per-click). Pichai may also speak generally about his own vision for Google as an increasingly separate entity, but one that nonetheless will remain the Alphabet's cash cow. \n2.) YouTube's continue progress as an Ad revenue machine \nIn Q2, Google offered great numbers in this arena. First, average viewing time was more than 40 minutes on mobile, representing a more than a 50 percent hike from last year. The number of advertisers running video ads was also up by an impressive 40 percent mark. And lastly, the average \"spend per advertiser\" (related to the top 100 advertisers) was up 60 percent. It will be difficult to match that growth in many respects. \n3.) App install ads in Google Play \nIn July, Google launched install ads in Google Play.
