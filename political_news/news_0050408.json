According to Hedge Fund Alert , the group \"Focuses on both emerging and established managers, leveraging deep operational knowledge from one of the co-head's 14 years at D.E. Shaw. In addition to fund formation, [the group] advises managers on spinoffs, complex transactions and litigationâ€¦[and] offers ERISA and tax support.\"\nPryor Cashman's Investment Management Group is co-led by partners Bertrand C. Fry and Jonathan T. Shepard , and provides high-level attention to established managers-some with assets under management of up to $85 billion-and start-ups. In addition to launching hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds, the firm uses its full service platform to assist groups seeking to spin out, to assist with complex transactions and projects, and to advise on pre-litigation strategies and conduct litigation. In fact, the firm's litigators have earned their reputation as formidable advocates representing many leading investment managers and funds and achieving decisive victories in some of the most significant cases in the industry. Most notably, earlier this year, the firm obtained a decisive Second Circuit victory in the Madoff liquidation proceeding ( cert. denied by US Supreme Court) which significantly restricts the scope of clawback remedies available to a liquidating trustee.\nThe HFM US Hedge Fund Services awards were established to honor the firms that have demonstrated a consistently high standard in providing legal services to the sector, developed a repertoire of effective services and demonstrated both customer and revenue growth.\nPryor Cashman LLP ( www.pryorcashman.com ) is an independent full service law firm with over 140 attorneys in its main office at 7 Times Square in New York City and an office in Los Angeles . With broad and sophisticated transactional, intellectual property and litigation practices, Pryor Cashman provides a wide range of services to meet the varying legal needs of institutions, entrepreneurs and individuals.\nContact: Kathy O'Brien\n203-268-1315\nkobrien@jaffepr.com\n releases/pryor-cashman-named-an-hfm-us-hedge-fund-services-awards-finalist-in-three-categories-300163363.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.pryorcashman.com/lawyers/jonathan-t-shepard.html", "https://www.pryorcashman.com/lawyers/bertrand-c-fry.html", "https://www.pryorcashman.com/news-and-insights/pryor-cashman-serves-as-lead-counsel-in-successfully-persuading.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC33422&Transmission_Id=201510211000PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC33422&DateId=20151021", "http://www.pryorcashman.com/", "https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/131283/298918/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pryor-cashman-named-an-hfm-us-hedge-fund-services-awards-finalist-in-three-categories-300163363.html", "https://www.hfalert.com/documents/FG/hsp/hfa-rankings/392647_LawFirms.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:38:37.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
