State water officials set water consumption rates in 2013 as the conservation standard.\nThe savings came despite a month in which the average temperature was 7 degrees higher than normal.\n\"The San Diego community keeps rising to the water conservation challenge despite exceptionally hot weather,\" said Mark Weston, chairman of the Water Authority Board of Directors.\n\"It's critical for our region to maintain a leadership role in conservation as we enter the fifth year of drought,\" Weston said. \"While we all hope that El Nino will produce more rain and snow in coming months, there's no guarantee that will happen where we need it most -- in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains.\"\nSDCWA officials said even if El Nino produces heavy rains, more than one year's worth of precipitation will be needed to end the drought.\nAccording to the agency, water being saved now is being stored for use next year, in case the drought continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:41:55.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
