The partnership will seek to apply Riverside Research's patented, quantitative, tissue-characterization algorithms to the ExactVu™ high–resolution micro-ultrasound platform to develop new capabilities in the system's ability to detect and characterize prostate cancer.\n\"Urologists are demanding more from their imaging tools because current ultrasound systems do not have sufficient resolution to visualize and target biopsies of suspicious regions,\" says Randy AuCoin , Exact Imaging's President and CEO. \"Our ExactVu micro-ultrasound system enables a new paradigm in real-time imaging resolution - - a 300% improvement in resolution compared to conventional ultrasound. This advance will allow urologists to clearly visualize and target suspicious regions for biopsy, in addition to performing systematic biopsy protocols. With the addition of Riverside Research's novel, quantitative, tissue-characterization techniques, we will continue to develop new applications and workflows to help clinicians further identify and characterize these suspicious regions. The ultimate goal is to improve the clinical outcomes enabled through micro-ultrasound-based prostate imaging and biopsies.\"\n\"We are very excited about applying our extensive experience in ultrasound-based tissue characterization and tissue-type imaging to the ultra-high frequencies enabled by the ExactVu system to explore novel possibilities in differentiating healthy from disease prostate tissue,\" says Dr. Ernest Feleppa , Director of the Lizzi Center for Biomedical Engineering at Riverside Research. \"The rich data generated at these ultra-high resolutions allows us to improve the accuracy of our quantitative ultrasound methods for differentiating cancerous from noncancerous tissue in the prostate. Ultrasound is the global standard of care for urological imaging, and we expect that combining micro-ultrasound's resolution and enhanced information content with our tissue-characterization algorithms will yield very exciting new insights and, ultimately, improved clinical outcomes.\"\nAbout Exact Imaging (formerly Imagistx):\nExact Imaging ( www.exactimaging.com ) is the world's leader in high-resolution micro-ultrasound systems enabling real-time imaging and guided biopsies in the urological market for prostate cancer. Operating up to 29 MHz, the ExactVu™ micro-ultrasound platform enables a whole new level of resolution comparable to MRI but with the benefits of ease of use, affordability, and being an extension of the current urological workflow. Using the Exact Imaging platform, urologists will now be able to visualize suspicious areas in the prostate and specifically target biopsies at those areas in addition to performing systematic, trans-rectal, ultrasound biopsy protocols. Please note that this system has not yet received FDA or CE approval, and so is not yet available for commercial release.\nAbout Riverside Research\nRiverside Research is a not-for-profit organization chartered to advance scientific research in the public interest and in support of the United States government.
