That is President Obama’s description, not mine. In January 2017, he will leave the White House and his successor, whomever that may turn out to be, will take over. The history of the Obama administration will begin to be written and only time will tell how it will be described. It is almost guaranteed that his Nobel Peace Prize will be mentioned. I’m still unable to wrap my head around that one, but I guess that’s because my conservative mind just can’t grasp the liberal lunacy of awarding someone who has virtually no experience with the Nobel Peace Prize. \nIt really does remain to be seen how history will treat President Obama and his eight years in the White House. Some of it may hinge on who is doing the writing. If a liberal college professor, or some other liberal who is a fan of Obama’s gets their dirty little hands in the mix, it will, no doubt, be filled with accolades and praises. If that happens, there are some inconvenient truths that will simply have to be ignored. \nWhat about Fast and Furious and the lies and obfuscations that have surrounded that scandal? Yes, I called it a scandal, even though Jay Carney thinks it is no such thing. \nWhat about Benghazi and the lies and obfuscations that have surrounded the how and why of the deaths of four Americans who were trying to protect other people? What about the media collusion in covering up the truth about what happened that night in Benghazi? \nWhat about the Secret Service and the prostitutes in Columbia in 2012? That scandal is even alive today, with new evidence coming to light that a White House aide was involved with a prostitute at the same time and same place. This, in spite of claims to the contrary by the White House. There is even evidence that shows the investigation into what happened in Columbia was delayed at the request of the White House. You see, they didn’t want it interfering with the 2012 elections. You can read more about this scandal at America’s Watchtower . \nWashington Post – “We were directed at the time . . . to delay the report of the investigation until after the 2012 election,” David Nieland, the lead investigator on the Colombia case for the DHS inspector general’s office, told Senate staffers, according to three people with knowledge of his statement. \nWhat about all the great economic news we keep hearing? We are told unemployment is down, but it is only thus because the Obama administration has changed the way they count the numbers. That is one thing they are quite good at, this counting of numbers. They know how to manipulate them with the best of crooked accountants. Everything from the unemployment rate to the number of deported illegal immigrants has been changed to fit into the news the way President Obama wants it to fit. He can claim the private sector is doing just fine all he wants, but anyone with half a brain can see it is doing no such thing. \nClearly, the Obama administration has their own ways and methods of dealing with the problems and issues any administration is certain to have. Rather than being the most open and transparent administration in American history, I think other terms are more descriptive of how they have conducted themselves since January 2009. I am not so naive as to believe that any administration can be manipulative of public opinion, even going so far as to lie to the American people. I am sure it happened before Obama came to town and I am quite sure it will continue. That does not, however, give them a pass for all the lies they have passed off to the American people as the truth. \nMy trouble with the Obama administration is this. They seem to have perfected the technique of lying to us all. With the help of their friends in the media, they have succeeded in pulling the wool over the eyes of enough Americans to be elected to two terms in office. Their lies have been covered up by more lies. They have manipulated the media into doing their bidding. Methinks the most descriptive term for the Obama administration would be to call them all a pack of liars. Looking at their few successes and many failures, that seems to be the only thing they are really good at. I hope and pray they will be repaid in full after November 4.
