China has reportedly arrested hackers, but also may be attacking defense business networks. President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping arrive at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden at The White House on Sept. 25, 2015.\nBy Tom Risen Oct. 9, 2015 | 4:46 p.m. EDT + More China’s President Xi Jinping has promised that his nation will not conduct or knowingly support online theft from U.S. business networks, and reports that Chinese authorities arrested a group of hackers ahead of his visit last month gives hope that he is serious.\nChinese officials arrested hackers in early September whom U.S. intelligence agencies suspected of stealing trade secrets from American businesses, The Washington Post reports. This could be the start of shift on cybersecurity enforcement in China, which has been accused by the Obama administration of sponsoring hackers who steal billions of dollars worth of intellectual property from U.S. firms with the goal of selling the information to China-based companies.\nRELATED\nChina’s Xi Jinping Flexes Business, Tech Muscle President Barack Obama has said he will watch carefully to ensure China keeps its agreement to refrain from digital economic espionage. A public trial and convictions of the arrested hackers would be a significant display of China’s commitment, since the communist nation has so far refused to extradite five members of the People's Liberation Army whom the Justice Department charged last May with allegedly stealing trade secrets and communications from U.S. companies.\nThe FBI, however, warned U.S. defense contractors just three days after Xi’s state visit with Obama that hackers based in China have targeted hundreds of firms working for America’s military, The Daily Beast reports. The FBI brief on the hacks against defense contractors resembles the attack on the Office of Personnel Management that affected an estimated 21.5 million federal employees or job applicants , which is also believed to have originated in China , according to reports.\nThe Obama administration has stopped short of publicly blaming China for the OPM attack and the Chinese deny responsibility.\n[ READ: President Obama, Chinese President Xi Jingping Announce Agreement to Stop Hacking ]\nThe non-hacking agreement between the U.S. and China apparently leaves a loophole for both nations to target defense contractors and networks to obtain political or military data that is crucial to national security, but forbids industrial espionage to benefit businesses, The Daily Beast reports.\nMilitary secrets likely stolen by China in recent years including data on the U.S. Navy's F-35 plane for the purpose of designing the communist nation's J-31 prototype, which closely resembles the American jet fighter, security analysts have told U.S. News.\nTAGS: China cybersecurity FBI", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Is%20China%20Keeping%20Its%20No-Hacking%20Promise%3F", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/08/china-cyberspying-on-u-s-after-no-hacking-deal.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Is%20China%20Keeping%20Its%20No-Hacking%20Promise%3F", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1t5i%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Is%20China%20Keeping%20Its%20No-Hacking%20Promise%3F&summary=China%20has%20reportedly%20arrested%20hackers%2C%20but%20also%20may%20be%20attacking%20defense%20business%20networks.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-a-first-chinese-hackers-are-arrested-at-the-behest-of-the-us-government/2015/10/09/0a7b0e46-6778-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:58:33.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
