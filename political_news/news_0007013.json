(ticker: TRTC), a cannabis-focused agricultural company. \"It can be a nice social setting where you learn from the research performed by the various members.\"\nMany clubs, he adds, \"are comprised of diverse individuals from various business sectors and levels of investment experience.\"\nYet it's also possible that club members, in an attempt to aggregate their knowledge , also unwittingly pool their ignorance – especially when it comes to dotting the investment i's and crossing the trading t's.\n\"The pitfalls are like those with any other group or organization – when your group isn't organized, when the members have conflicting interests and when clubs are formed loosely without formal rules,\" says Winnie Sun, managing director and founding partner of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, California.\nLike a lottery pool or two couples sharing a multiunit property, investment clubs allow people to combine financial resources, such as funding a larger stock purchase or portfolio , even as the members further their education and experience with the market. They've been around for decades, and typically proliferate in communities and regions far beyond the bustle of Wall Street.\nIn those places and cases, it's not so much a matter of get rich fast as stick to the task – and that's where the ticker hits the tape. \"Most investment clubs have been established in bull markets and with short-term enthusiasm,\" says K.C. Ma, director of the George Investments Institute at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida. \"But they're rarely sustainable, because most people will not volunteer their time in the long run.\"\nEven though that donated time can turn into real money, it sometimes proves to be too much. \"The operation, portfolio management, investment research and execution require more than several full-time jobs for managing more than one person's money,\" Ma says.\nAnd among a loosely organized bunch, sometimes a hit-the-lottery mentality is hard to avoid. \"People ask me from time to time what their club should invest in and I've found that advising them to stick with a balanced mutual fund, from a reputable money manger like Vanguard or Fidelity, is not what they are looking for,\" says Michael J. Driscoll, clinical professor and senior executive in residence at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York. \"They want a tip on a hot stock. And one of the best tips I heard early on in my investing career was that if you want to make a little money investing in hot stocks, then start with a lot of money.\"\nIndeed, two University of California professors, Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, found that the average investment club tilted its common stock investment toward high-beta, small-capitalization growth stocks – with 60 percent of clubs underperforming a broad-based market index. The title of their paper? \"Too Many Cooks Spoil the Profits.\"\n\"A big problem with investment clubs is group-think,\" says Robert R. Johnson, president and CEO of The American College for Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. \"If a club is homogeneous in terms of construction, there is a danger that members will start to look at opportunities from similar perspectives. What you want in any kind of group is someone who will think critically.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:18:26.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
