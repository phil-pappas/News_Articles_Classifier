View Gallery 1 of Pope Francis asked forgiveness Wednesday for recent scandals that have rocked Rome and the Vatican, showing again he doesn't much care about making waves if it's for the sake of reassuring his flock. Francis didn't cite examples in his off-the-cuff request for pardon at the start of his general audience and his spokesman declined to elaborate on what he might have meant. However, the past week has seen its fair share of headline-making news that has involved the church in one way or another.

But Mayor Ignazio Marino's downfall followed criticism within the church that the city was ill-prepared to handle the millions of pilgrims expected for Francis' Jubilee Year of Mercy, which starts in December. In an uncharacteristic jab, Francis himself spoke critically of Marino en route home from the U.S. WATCH: Pope Francis Hugs, Blesses Prisoner Pope Francis shook hands with inmates and took a moment to bless one, following his address at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility.

Federico Lombardi, declined to specify which scandals Francis was referring to, saying the pope clearly intended his apology to be \"ample and general.\" While stressing that Marino's resignation was a political, not church, issue, Lombardi said it had clearly affected ordinary Romans who had come to the audience, and that Francis, who is bishop of Rome, wanted to acknowledge their pain.

When he saw the dressed up baby, Francis seemed to laugh heartily.
