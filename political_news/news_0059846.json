I don't find any reason that I need to be unhappy,\" he said. (Photo: AFP) New Delhi : He has been in prime form since the start of the Test series in Sri Lanka and Ishant Sharma has realised that he has enough skills to dismantle the batsmen with his quick bowling rather than words.\nSpeaking for the first time since ICC slapped a one Test suspension for his on-field conduct in the third Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC, Ishant said that he would be \"aggressive\" but with his performance.\n\"Obviously, I think it is a pretty good thing that Virat Kohli has backed me. Whoever is aggressive on the field -- be it bowler or batsman -- is doing pretty well. I think if you have to dominate the game, you have to be aggressive but not with the words but as to how you approach the game and what you do on the field (performance),\" Ishant told reporters after his match-winning nine-wicket haul against Vidarbha in the Ranji Trophy here on Sunday.\nRead: Blame on Virat Kohli for Ishant Sharma’s ‘over aggressiveness’\nQuestioned whether Indian bowling will have less impact in his absence, Ishant replied, \"Cricket is a team game. And India does not need Ishant Sharma but Ishant Sharma needs India.\"\nProbe him about his non-selection in the Indian ODI team, and the reply is curt and shows that he is a bit hurt. \"Well, you need to ask this question to someone else (selectors) and not me. I can only perform and I am doing that. I can only do what's there in my hands and what else can I do,\" he said bluntly.\nAlso Read: Sanjay Manjrekar sees no sense in India’s aggression\nWith match figures of 9/47, the obvious question was about his rhythm which has been top notch in recent times. \"I am pretty happy with my bowling. I don't find any reason that I need to be unhappy,\" he said.\nHe troubled the Vidarbha batsmen with pace and bounce which he considers his strength. \"Well, that's my strength. Pace and bounce. Believe in what I need to do and that's what I have been doing. Important thing is to back your strength as that's what helps you in the long run, much easier to go and perform,\" Ishant pointed out.\nAlso Read: I want Ishant Sharma to be aggressive, will be the first one to push him: Ravi Shastri\nIshant will be playing the next Ranji Trophy game against Virender Sehwag's Haryana, starting from October 15-18. For him having bowled 34 overs in this match won't be a problem as the next one starts in another three days' time.\n\"I will play in the next match. I believe 30 overs (34) is nothing if you see how much we bowl in Test matches. I have bowled more than this. I don't think there will be more work load than this as we are playing with five specialist bowlers,\" he concluded.\n Cricket Team India Ishant Sharma Virat Kohli Ranji Trophy Also Read Ishant Sharma is the least talented among Indian bowlers: Ashish Nehra I asked him what time will he join me for dinner: Ishant 'Unreachable' Ishant Sharma not included in Delhi Ranji team ‘A fast bowler cannot be a nice guy,’ says Jeff Thomson", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Ishant_AFP_1.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Ishant_AFP_1.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/sports-cricket/article/i-want-be-aggressive-not-words-says-ishant-sharma", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:16:38.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
