Ellis said Friday that he's taking a job as the senior director of compliance and communications at the Utah Educational Savings Plan. He says he feels it's a good opportunity and that it is the right time to make a switch out of public office. Ellis, a Republican, was elected state treasurer in 2008. Nov. 1 will be his last day in office. The state elections office says the Utah Republican Party's governing body will suggest three candidates to replace Ellis. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert will choose one to serve the rest of Ellis' term until the 2016 election.
