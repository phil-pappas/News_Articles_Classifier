We need to normalise gender equality so it becomes a reality for everyday New Zealanders” said Dr Blue. \nThe Human Rights Commission’s Tracking Equality at Work (TEW) also revealed women and young people are more likely to be paid less than any other New Zealand workers. Pacific women were at the bottom of the pay ladder. \n“Our most marginalised group of workers - young women (aged 15-24) are paid less than half the average hourly wage of our least marginalised group of workers, Pakeha men (aged 45-64),” said Dr Blue. \n“Gender equality doesn't just improve the lives of women it improves the future of entire generations.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:12:53.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
