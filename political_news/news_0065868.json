(Baltimore Sun video) \nFormer mayor Sheila Dixon kicked off her mayoral campaign with a rally at the B&O Railroad Museum Sunday. (Baltimore Sun video) Jessica Anderson Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Former Mayor Sheila Dixon opened a new campaign office in Station North, with help from a drumline. \nDozens of supporters — along with a drumline — greeted former Mayor Sheila Dixon at her new campaign office in Station North on Saturday. \nThe pep-rally styled-event was held to celebrate the opening of her newest office \"in style,\" and serve as the \"center\" of her mayoral campaign \"to reclaim, revive and rebuild Baltimore,\" according to a Facebook page announcing the event. Outside, supporters held signs and wore red T-shirts with the slogan, while the drumline performed on the corner and could be heard blocks away. \n\"We have so many great things going on in Baltimore and it's important that we build on what we have,\" Dixon said after making her way through the crowd. \nDixon, 61, announced her campaign last month, just days after Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that she would not run for re-election. Rawlings-Blake took office after Dixon resigned in January 2010 when she was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of stealing gift cards intended for the needy. \nDixon is among a crowded field of Democrats running for mayor, including state Sen. Catherine E. Pugh and City Councilman Carl Stokes, in the April 26 primary. \n\"We need people to help us get the message to the citizens of Baltimore,\" she said. \"The people of this city are going to determine who is going to get elected, and it's not going to be special interest groups, it's not going to be what happened in the past, it's about moving forward and people's voices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:35:20.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
