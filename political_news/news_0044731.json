Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.\nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter.\nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl.\nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:46:56.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
