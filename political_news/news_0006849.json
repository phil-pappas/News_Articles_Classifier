Scrutiny over Rubio's shoddy attendance record increased earlier this month when the Florida senator missed a key vote on defense spending to campaign in New Hampshire.\nRubio also explained remarks he made on the Senate floor this week when he said federal workers who don't do their jobs should be fired.\n\"Someone might say you're not showing up, you're not doing your job by voting,\" Gangel said.\nRead More \"Not true, not true,\" Rubio said.\n\"You don't think you're in a glass house?\" Gangel asked.\n\"Voting is not the only part of the Senate job,\" Rubio said. \"I mean, the most important thing a senator does is constituent service. We're still involved in looking out for Florida's issues.\"\nRubio said Senate votes are important, but added that as a member of the Intelligence Committee, he was updated on recent briefings.\n\"I was just there this Tuesday,\" Rubio said. \"I got fully briefed and caught up on everything that's happening in the world. I'm fully aware.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:10:11.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
