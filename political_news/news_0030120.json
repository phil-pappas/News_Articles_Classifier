Photo by Jim Narcy Our 2013 list of the top ten haunted Denver places to visit on Halloween according to Shadowlands.net , a website that purports to haunted locales across the country, includes plenty of venerable edifices, including the Lumber Baron Inn, the Molly Brown House and the Denver Children's Home.\nBut also making an appearance is Denver International Airport. Shadowlands maintains that \"several problems were encountered while building the airport. This is reportedly due to the fact that the airport was built on top of sacred Native American ground. Some employees and visitors have reported hearing or seeing strange things.\"\nThese claims are hardly the only weird ones surrounding DIA, which has become a magnet for wild conspiracy theories, many of them centered on murals by artist Leo Tanguma and detailed in one of our most popular features ever, \" DIA Conspiracies Take Off ,\" written by Jared Jacang Maher.\nA slide show created in conjunction with the article spotlights photos of the murals, with text by Maher explaining, in sardonic terms, what conspiracy theorists think Tanguma's various images mean. These pics are supplemented with maps and blueprints that supposedly reveal a secret Nazi subtext to DIA's layout.\nThe truth is out there â€” and it's also on view below.\nRelated Stories DIA Conspiracies Take Off \"Nazi alien meant to warn international travellers about the coming New World Order, or symbol for general despotism throughout the ages?\" Photo by Jim Narcy \"Death of a little girl meant as a warning to those of the Jewish faith (pay no attention the bible she's holding) that death comes their way in the New World Order, or simply the death of a child meant to symbolize the death of a child.\" Photo by Jim Narcy \"Are those flames in the background the product of some Nazi alien conspiracy, or just a troubled capitalist past?\" Photo by Jim Narcy \"There are those out there who believe a race of reptilian humanoids like this one lives under DIA in a huge underground city where they feast on lost children.\" File photo \"Denver International Airport, orginally named Adolph's Airfield, is shaped like some sort of weird spidery-looking thing.\" Google Maps \"Oh my God!
