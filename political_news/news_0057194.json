I love my job. I love what I do for a living,” she said, adding she hoped the city would promote worthy candidates of all races. “That’s the whole purpose of this.”\nA jury in Suffolk Superior Court yesterday ordered the city to pay Charles $388,160 for economic damages, $500,000 for emotional distress, and a whopping $10 million in punitive damages.\n“We understand that it is a large award, but it’s a signal from the jury that what the city has done deserves condemnation,” Charles’ attorney, Monica Shah, said.\nMayor Martin J. Walsh’s spokeswoman Laura Oggeri said the city will likely appeal the verdict and noted the alleged actions happened under the administration of the late Mayor Thomas M. Menino.\nCharles started working for the city’s trust division in 1986, overseeing the Edward Ingersoll Browne Fund, which provides public art grants.\nBut in 1998, her division was transferred to the Treasury Department.\nOver the next two years, Charles was stripped of her title as community services director even though she kept doing the same tasks, according to court documents.\nCharles was never given an explanation for the changes and was denied a meeting with the city’s chief operating officer.\nIn 2011, her longtime boss retired after refusing a request by another city manager to give Charles a bad performance review, instead giving her positive marks, Shah said.\nCharles took on her superior’s work without added pay or a promotion. But she was pushed further out of running the Browne fund, and she filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, court papers state.\nWhile the complaint was being heard, the Treasury Department filled her old boss’ position, but changed the title and responsibilities so that Charles would not recognize the position, Shah said.\nMeanwhile, two others were hired instead of Charles, and she was disciplined for the first time in her years working with the city.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=City+hit+with+%2411M+verdict+in+discrimination+suit"], "published": "2015-10-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:32:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
