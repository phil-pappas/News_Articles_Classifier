Special elections occur at unusual times and usually have lower turnout than regularly scheduled elections like Tuesday's. \"People have the chance to go out and voice their opinion. People always complain. If you don't vote, how do you improve anything?\" Smith asked. \"I think people are discouraged,\" said John Howcroft, an Acushnet farmer and Democratic analyst. \"The decline of the middle class, so to speak being threatened. There's a disenchantment type of feeling right now. Unfortunately, in that situation, you're not getting the quality elected officials and they're not meeting the challenges and people become more disenchanted.\" One pundit, Thomas Hunt, a former Democratic fundraiser, said there doesn't seem much on the horizon that could change the Tuesday results — in which all five incumbents on the ballot — easily led the field in the preliminary balloting. \"I think that the sequence you saw in the primary with very little change will be what we see in November. The top five today will be the top five next month,\" said Hunt. In the at-large race, the four incumbents — Brian K. Gomes, Linda Morad, Debora Coelho and Naomi Carney — were the top finishers. Newcomer Shawn Michael Thimas, an insurance representative, was eliminated from the race. Chamber of Commerce administrator Ian Abreu, who has run three prior times, was the top vote getter among non-incumbents, followed by former longtime city assessor Peter Barney. \"Unless there is stirring up of issues confronting the city, it will probably be generally the same results,\" agreed Howcroft. Analysts said Barney, a longtime politico, will have to shake up the issues rather than run on his name if he wants to get elected. \"He is very capable. It's not an issue campaign right now. If there are more issues, I'd expect Peter to do better,\" Howcroft said. David Alves pointed out that Barney hasn't run for office in 10 to 12 years. \"His best asset is to get out and campaign. Just to take it for granted won't make him an elected official,\" Alves said. \"Ian has always worked hard. Right now, it looks really good for him,\" said Smith. In Ward 4, incumbent Dana Rebeiro will face off in the final against former four-term councilor Joseph \"Jo-Jo\" Fortes. To many analysts' surprise, Bruce Duarte Jr., a former three-term Ward 4 councilor, placed fourth behind Joshua Fernandes, a police officer. \"I was surprised of where he landed,\" said Howcroft. \"And I was surprised of the resurrection of Jo-Jo Fortes. He continues to have a network of people who have been supporters and he activated them.\" The question becomes who can draw the support of the three unsuccessful candidates into their pools, the analysts said. \"I was surprised both doing as well as they did,\" said Alves of Rebeiro and Fortes. \"They come from two entirely different sections of the ward. That is what is interesting. Who can pull from Duarte, Fernandes or (Ramona) Silva's people into their base?\" Alves said Rebeiro draws votes from younger people, while Fortes tends to carry weight with older people and those who work along the waterfront.
