All times local.\n12:15 p.m.\nThe United Nations refugee agency believes Slovenia has the capacity to accept some 7,000 migrants coming to the country on their way toward Western Europe.\nUNHCR spokeswoman Caroline Van Buren said at Slovenia's border with Croatia Saturday that \"all is going well\" as the first groups of migrants started arriving to the small Alpine nation.\nThe flow has turned to Slovenia after Hungary sealed its border with Croatia for migrants shortly after midnight Friday. Most of the people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia want to reach rich EU nations such as Germany.\nSlovenia has said it will accept migrants as long as Austria and Germany keep their borders open. Several hundred people have come so far with more expected later Saturday.\n___\n12:05 p.m.\nHungary says it has temporarily reinstated border controls at its frontiers with Slovenia to prevent migrants from entering the county in an unrestricted manner.\nThe measure announced Saturday came hours after Hungary closed off its borders with Croatia, from where thousands of migrants a day were entering. Both Slovenia and Hungary are part of the European Union's Schengen zone of border free travel.\nSince Croatia said it would start sending migrants to the border with Slovenia, Hungary fears they could try to cross into Hungary from Slovenia on their way to Germany and other European destinations.\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a statement that the government was defending Hungary and its citizens from the \"mass wave of unidentified, uncontrolled migrants.\"\n___\n11:55 a.m.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says she won't offer \"false solutions\" to the migrant crisis as she faces pressure to do more to limit the influx.\nMerkel told Saturday's edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that Germany can control its borders but not close them completely — \"that wouldn't even succeed with a fence, as the example of Hungary shows.\"\nThousands of new arrivals a day have been stretching Germany's capacity to house refugees and other migrants. But Merkel said she won't promise \"false solutions\" because they wouldn't even hold for two weeks and would create bigger disappointment that the problem hasn't been resolved.\nMerkel added: \"I am working with all my power for sustainable solutions, and they don't depend on us Germans alone and will take time.\"\n___\n11:25 a.m.\nTurkey's state-run news agency says 12 migrants have drowned after their boat sank off the Turkish coast in the Aegean sea.\nThe Anadolu Agency says the Turkish Coast Guard on Saturday rescued 25 other migrants from the sea.\nThe group was trying to reach the island the Greek island of Lesbos — an entry point for a majority of migrants making the journey from the nearby Turkish coast.\nThere was no immediate information of the nationalities of the migrants.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nAmnesty International has called European Union leaders to put refugee rights above concerns to protect their borders.\nAmnesty's call Saturday came a day before German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to hold talks with Turkish officials on an EU plan that would give concession to Turkey in exchange for stemming the flow of migrants into EU countries.\nOfficials say the concessions would include an aid package, easier access to EU visas for Turkish citizens and speed-up EU membership talks.\nAmnesty said the EU should be looking for ways to \"offer safe and legal routes to refugees to reach Europe.\"\nThe group said: \"A deal premised on keeping refugees in Turkey fundamentally ignores both the challenges they face there and the obvious need for the EU to offer protection.\"\n___\n10:20 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:30:34.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
