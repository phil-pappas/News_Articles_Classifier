And if you’re a reporter for, say, the New York Times, and you’re handed a story line with a tight deadline, mistakes will be made.\nEven so, 6 mistakes in one drive-by hit job on Melania Trump seems a bit excessive.\nOkay, technically it was a hit job on The Donald; Melania was just collateral damage.\nDon’t hate me because I’m beautiful, hate me because I’m Melania Trump\nI think I’ve found a solution for these overworked journalists:\nA company called Automated Insights created a program called WordSmith that generates simple news stories based on things like sporting events and financial news. The stories are published on Yahoo! and via the Associated Press, among other outlets.\nNPR even pitted one of it’s best business reporters against the machine ; the machine completed the assignment in 2 minutes while the live reporter took 7. If you want to insert your own editorial bias into the story though, you’ll have to pony up for the optional political spin pac.\nOf course there will always be a small group of individuals so gifted that the software will prove useless to them:\n“Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength but out of weakness because his client Mr. Assad was crumbling and it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money. Now he’s got to put in his own planes and his own pilots.”\nThose silver-tongued devils are few and far between and will not be relegated to reporting for the likes of the New York Times.", "external_links": ["http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-swSKl93Tlbw/VhJycwKCeoI/AAAAAAABYnM/3YVoVPZz6lw/trump_thumb%25255B8%25255D.png?imgmax=800", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tISLxj_2zaU", "http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/05/20/406484294/an-npr-reporter-raced-a-machine-to-write-a-news-story-who-won", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-484jnnNkxDo/VhJyZdHDbfI/AAAAAAABYmk/zTsVaZxvaxw/s1600-h/deadline_usa_copy%25255B4%25255D.jpg", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2HfRRpEkuFM/VhJyZ8lJBbI/AAAAAAABYms/MLF452N5I4g/deadline_usa_copy_thumb%25255B8%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fF02v9304gg/VhJycMSDqnI/AAAAAAABYnE/ZyzCjKENz6o/s1600-h/trump%25255B4%25255D.png", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9OoZ0pNUAVc/VhJyboCMQ6I/AAAAAAABYm4/Gqq8fvalmCE/drive%252520by_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/fashion/melania-trump-the-silent-partner.html?_r=0", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_YrLExnhb9I/VhJya-3NIII/AAAAAAABYm0/q0Rir2Dah3A/s1600-h/drive%252520by%25255B4%25255D.jpg", "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tom-blumer/2015/10/04/they-do-have-editors-right-ny-times-issues-six-corrections-melania?utm_source=twitterfeed&#038;utm_medium=twitter"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:11:50.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
