Over and over, I’ve found, the JJ has been a major event and sometimes the critical turning point in the caucuses contest. \nAs a political pageant and historical moment, the JJ probably hit its peak in 2007, when Barack Obama outshined Hillary Clinton and John Edwards just weeks before the 2008 caucuses. But its significance goes back much further than that – back to 1975 and the first truly contested presidential caucuses. \nSeven presidential candidates attended the ’75 dinner, and the Register organized a straw poll of attendees to gauge their organizational strength. \nJimmy Carter won with 256 votes – about 23 percent of those cast. \nThat little poll was thrown together by a newspaper and conducted on an electorate of just 1,094 hardcore activists, but it was reported nationally and helped establish Carter as the Democratic frontrunner. \nCandidates showed up again in 1979 and 1983, and by 1987 the event was a full-on spectacle. \nA Washington Post dispatch from the ’87 JJ describes rival campaign volunteers assembling outside Des Moines’ old Veterans Auditorium at 1:45 a.m. so that they could rush into the hall as soon as the doors opened to begin plastering every available surface with campaign signs. \n“I felt I was going to be trampled. The people were pushing and shoving and yanking. For a minute, I thought I was finished,” a Paul Simon volunteer named Beth Deppe told the Post. “It was like being inside a pinball machine.” \nIn 2003, candidates once again packed the hall with supporters and “papered the house” with posters. Howard Dean, who was leading the pack at that point in mid-November, caused a stir by rolling 47 buses through downtown Des Moines – all of them allegedly filled with soldiers in his grassroots army. \nWhen I talked to Dean campaign manager Joe Trippi last spring, he admitted to a bit of gamesmanship. \n“Yeah, some of those buses were empty,” he allowed, before adding sarcastically, “But no one's ever pulled theater at a JJ dinner before.” \nThose sign wars and show-of-strength shenanigans were all prelude, though, to the 2007 JJ. \nThen-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama turned out thousands of supporters on the day of the dinner, held a rally with pop star John Legend and led a march through downtown Des Moines featuring its own drum corps. Inside the auditorium, he was introduced by the Chicago Bulls’ arena announcer, and used his speech to draw his sharpest contrasts yet with the front-running Clinton. \nWhen I talked to Obama adviser David Axelrod last May, he likened the JJ to a boxing match. \n“Yes, that was the seminal event,” he said. “We knew it would be. We knew that we had to make a big stand there.” \nObama’s speech, Axelrod said, was “magnificent” – a judgment that the national political establishment largely shared. It marked the start of Obama’s surge to victory in the caucuses and beyond. \n“Everyone in the hall knew that this was a big moment,” Axelrod told me. “And from that point on, we had inexorable momentum in Iowa.” Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1RYujkv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:46:40.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
