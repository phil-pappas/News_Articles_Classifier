Earlier, Dewesh Sehra, district magistrate of naxal-affected Kaimur, has denied permission for Modi’s election rally, forcing BJP to apply for a second time with a promise to bring smaller crowd. \nBJP on Saturday has petitioned Election Commission seeking permission for holding the rally and lodged a complaint against denial of it despite SPG clearance. \nBihar will go for polls in a five phase election from October 12 and end on November 5. Counting of votes will take place on 8 November. \nThe term of the current 243-member Bihar assembly expires on November 29. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:18:38.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
