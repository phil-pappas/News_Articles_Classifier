But then an odd thing happened. When the traffic light changes the entire crowd stops partying and obediently clears the street. The cops don’t need to raise a finger. “What a well-behaved crowd!” laughs the guy taking the video. And he’s right. We are a well-behaved crowd, even in our most joyous highs and miserable lows, Canadians define ourselves by our sober restraint and reluctance to challenge authority. \nIt was for this reason that casting Stephen Harper out of 24 Sussex Drive felt like such a monumental release. For years, Harper ran his government, and in many ways the entire country, like his private fiefdom. He shut out the press, refused to engage his critics, muzzled his cabinet and showed unvarnished disdain for so many of the values that Canadians hold dear. And yet despite this, the unwavering Conservative with the husky-dog stare quietly held on to power for nearly a decade and was elected three times, twice with a clear majority. \nTrudeau campaigned on a platform of inspiration and change. And of course, after nine and a half years of Harper, this was something the country desperately needed. And change we got, in the form of a beautiful, idealistic young man and his glowing French-Canadian wife, their three young children wielding light sabres as the crowd roared in jubilation at the sight of our handsome, shiny new first family – such beacons of optimism and the “sunny ways” of Canadian politics of the past . \nThe mood, I couldn’t help but feel, was not dissimilar to the glow surrounding the last big royal wedding – the effective coronation of William and Kate in the hearts and minds of the Canadian public, a public whose earnest, unquestioning adoration for “our royal family” is unchallenged among Commonwealth nations. \nDespite the dynastic overtones, the spectre of a second Prime Minister Trudeau in our lifetime was not a cause for concern among the Canadian electorate. On the contrary, we are revelling in it. You might think Canadians elected Trudeau (or “Justin” as he encourages everyone to call him) in spite the fact that he is his father’s son but in fact the opposite is true. While Justin has undeniably proved himself as an MP, slogging it out for seven years in opposition, his pedigree – along with his poufy hair – was not the political Achilles heel the Conservatives had hoped it would be. \nWithin hours of his election, the national Trudeau nostalgia bath began. On social media, old black and white photographs were passed around: there was the one of Pierre Elliott Trudeau carrying his one-year-old son on his hip like a harried playground dad as a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer stands in rigid salute, and another one of Margaret Trudeau beaming as Fidel Castro dandles her infant on the asphalt outside a private jet. \nThere were the affectionate jokes on Twitter about how Trudeau would be the first leader to “really understand the younger generation” since he was, after all, moving back into his parents’ house. How it was the US president Richard Nixon who first prophesised Justin’s fate while giving a toast during a 1972 state visit to Ottawa. “Tonight we’ll dispense with formalities,” said Nixon at a gala buffet, gesturing to Pierre and Margaret Trudeau who had brought their newborn son. “I’d like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau.” \nEven the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation got in on the act. In a video released this week, Peter Mansbridge, Canada’s most trusted news anchor, does an interview in which he showed the newly victorious Trudeau a video of his father commenting on his own landslide victory “Trudeaumania” back in 1968. “You know this kind of popularity is easily lost,” Pierre Elliott Trudeau says with a blasé coolness his son conspicuously lacks. “Perhaps easily won. Easy come, easy go.” Watching the clip Justin is clearly moved. “It’s touching,” he told Mansbridge. “It’s the values he raised me with and it’s the values we live with and that I’m trying to pass on to my kids.” \nBut while Justin’s values might reflect that of regular Canadians his experience has been anything but. He himself has spoken of how he had a pretty normal childhood apart from “the days when we had to rush home from school to have lunch with the Queen”. \nWhile our American neighbours favour political dynasties for obvious practical and economic reasons (who else but Clinton and Bush actually have political apparatus and money required to launch a realistic presidential bid?), Canadians dream of our very own Camelot because, in truth, we are enchanted by the idea of a ruling class. \nIn 1977, Justin Trudeau’s father was famously photographed doing a cheeky pirouette behind Queen Elizabeth II , and we have carried his spirit forward by electing his eldest son. We might poke fun at the Queen occasionally but the truth is, Canadians wouldn’t have anyone else on the back of our quarters. In Justin Trudeau, we see both change and familiarity, inspiration and conservatism – and this is perhaps the most Canadian impulse of all. \nBut we mustn’t forget that it was this same sober restraint – and general unwillingness to challenge authority – that allowed a leader such as Harper to bend the country to his will for so long and with such regrettable consequences. We are, after all, a very well-behaved crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:08:41.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
