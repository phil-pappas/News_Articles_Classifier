Lawless violence and bloody insurrection are how Mckesson and his followers pursue their vision of so-called social justice.\nMckesson led a class that was discussing, “In Defense of Looting,” an essay by Willie Osterweil whose bio at the New Inquiry website describes him as “a writer, editor, and member of the punk band Vulture #.”\nJohnetta Elzie (who calls herself ShordeeDooWhop on Twitter and uses the handle @Nett ), who with Mckesson helped foment unrest in Baltimore, Ferguson, Mo., and other racial hotspots, live-tweeted the Oct. 3 lecture. The tweets suggest the talk was a mixture of black liberation theology, critical race theory, Marxism, and anarchism:\n“‘It is interesting this connection between capitalism and racism[.]’”\n“‘To not give, is to steal from the poor[.]’”\n“‘If you put me in a cage you’re damn right I’m going to break some glass[.]’”\n“‘Looting for me isn’t violent, it’s an expression of anger[.]’”\n“‘[T]he act of looting is political. [A]nother way to dissolve consent. [P]ressing you to no longer keep me out of this space, by destroying it[.]’”\nOsterweil’s pro-looting essay from 2014 is also instructive. He argues that stealing other people’s stuff in times of civil unrest is a “righteous” thing to do.\nFor most of America’s history, one of the most righteous anti-white supremacist tactics available was looting.\nAs protests in Ferguson continued unabated one week after the police killing of Michael Brown, Jr., zones of Twitter and the left media predominantly sympathetic to the protesters began angrily criticizing looters. Some claimed that white protesters were the ones doing all of the looting and property destruction, while others worried about the stereotypical and damaging media representation that would emerge. It also seems that there were as many protesters (if not more) in the streets of Ferguson working to prevent looting as there were people going about it. While I disagree with this tactic, I understand that they acted out of care for the struggle, and I want to honor all the brave and inspiring actions they’ve taken over the last weeks.\nRadicals who discourage looting in order to protect their leadership positions, “dampen resistance,” and take the ethical high road are misguided, Osterweil writes.\nIt is in solidarity with these latter protesters—along with those who loot—and against politicians and de-escalators everywhere that I offer this critique, as a way of invigorating discussion amongst those engaged in anti-oppression struggle, in Ferguson and anywhere else the police violently perpetuate white supremacy and settler colonialism. In other words, anywhere in America.\nSome “want to correct the media’s assertion that protesters were all looters for good reason: the idea of black people looting a store is one of the most racially charged images in the white imaginary [ sic ].”\nHe continues:\nWhen protesters proclaim that “not all protesters were looters, in fact, most of the looters weren’t part of the protest!” or words to that effect, they are trying to fight a horrifically racist history of black people depicted in American culture as robbers and thieves: Precisely the image that the Ferguson police tried to evoke to assassinate Michael Brown’s character and justify his killing post facto. It is a completely righteous and understandable position.\nOsterweil opines that the civil rights movement “won many battles” but “it lost the war.”\nRegurgitating tired old communist agitprop, Osterweil writes the proof that the Sixties movement lost the war is:\n[m]# incarceration, the fact that black wealth and black-white inequality are at the same place they were at the start of the civil rights movement, that many US cities are more segregated now than they were in the sixties: no matter what “colorblind” liberals would say, racial justice has not been won, white supremacy has not been overturned, racism is not over. In fact, anti-black racism remains the foundational organizing principle of this country. That is because this country is built on the right to property, and there is no property, no wealth in the USA without the exploitation, appropriation, murder, and enslavement of black people.\nHere Osterweil embraces the same line of reasoning adopted by small-c communist academic and community organizer Richard Cloward, co-originator of the infamous Cloward-Piven Strategy of orchestrated chaos that President Obama has been pursuing since his first day in office. The professor said poor people always need to be ready to seize unearned wealth. “Our strategy always was, grab what you can and run like hell,” Cloward said. Private property is unjust so take what you want.\nSounding like Rules for Radical author Saul Alinsky, Osterweil posits that looting is good for the cause:\nOn a less abstract level there is a practical and tactical benefit to looting. Whenever people worry about looting, there is an implicit sense that the looter must necessarily be acting selfishly, “opportunistically,” and in excess. But why is it bad to grab an opportunity to improve well-being, to make life better, easier, or more comfortable? Or, as Hannah Black put it on Twitter: “Cops exist so people can’t loot [i.e.] have nice things for free so [I don’t know] why it’s so confusing that people loot when they protest[.]”\nDeRay Mckesson and his comrade Johnetta Elzie think the same but they try to pretend they oppose the use of violence for political ends.\nBoth of these community organizers bounce between reverence for nonviolent action and a refusal to condemn violent activism, which reasonable people see as being tantamount to endorsing violent activism. This practiced ambiguity is a fairly standard left-wing cop-out like the claim by left-wingers during the Iraq War that they opposed the war but still supported U.S. troops.\nConfronted by Wolf Blitzer on CNN earlier this year, Mckesson shrugged off the violent , criminal acts committed by Black Lives Matter supporters.\nI think that the unrest, the uprising, whatever you call it, is again a cry for justice here and a cry for justice across the country because police continue to terrorize people. The terrorizing is actually deadly. Broken windows are not broken spines. People are in pain.\nThis lack of respect for the rule of law, property rights, and economic freedom is growing in American culture. Some militant blacks want to overthrow the U.S. Constitution.\nBlack Lives Matter leader Blake Simons wrote an article last month warning that “there will be bullets” if the U.S. doesn’t get a new national constitution soon.\nSimons, a Farrakhan supporter and student at the University of California at Berkeley, takes the bigoted view that the current U.S. Constitution can never serve the interests of black Americans because it was written by white men.\n“Our Black Lives Matter protests have stormed the country, yet cops continue to kill us daily, and the judicial system continues to justify our deaths with acquittals, non-indictments, and light sentences—all in the name of upholding the Constitution.”\nAfter months of demonstrating, Simons says he came “to realize that the Constitution is the root of virtually all our problems in America.”\n“The U.S. is a country that was founded on slavery, genocide, rape, and white male patriarchy,” Simons said, echoing Osterweil and small-c communist Bernie Sanders who claims the U.S. was founded on “racist principles.”\n“The colonizers that we condemn for enslaving Afrikans [ sic ] and murdering indigenous peoples are the same people that produced and upheld the document we use to govern our nation to this day,” Simons continued. “Our bloodshed is rooted in this nation’s founding document, The Constitution.”\nThis insurrectionist hostility to the rule of law runs deep through the groves of academe.\nShoplifting at Wal-Mart and Target shouldn’t be prosecuted, according to Everett D. Mitchell of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Mitchell, a black man, is the school’s community relations director, and a pastor and a lawyer.\n“I just don’t think they should be prosecuting cases for people who steal from Wal-Mart. I don’t think that,” Mitchell said at a “Best Policing Practices” panel discussion. “I don’t think that Target, and all them other places—the big boxes that have insurance—they should be using the people that steal from there as justification to start engaging in aggressive police behavior.”\nTo anarchists and communists, enforcing the law in a market-oriented society is itself aggressive police behavior.\nBefore that University of Wisconsin professors Karma Ch√†vez and Sara L. McKinnon wrote a letter to the editor of a Wisconsin media outlet that was assigned the headline “Request for no police interaction is reasonable.” They argued that police constitute an occupying force and have no legitimate reason to patrol certain neighborhoods.\nRead more at Canada Free Press:\nhttp://canadafreepress.com/article/75985", "external_links": ["https://tribkcpq.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/ferguson-looting.jpg", "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/256918/leaders-lynch-mob-matthew-vadum", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/10/yale-lecturer-and-blacklivesmatter-riot-leader-deray-mckesson-promotes-the-ethics-of-looting-to-class/", "http://twitchy.com/2015/10/03/todays-lesson-at-yale-from-blacklivesmatters-deray-mckesson-in-defense-of-looting/", "http://engine.newsmaxfeednetwork.com/i.gif?e=eyJhdiI6NzU2MDYsImF0IjoxMywiYnQiOjAsImNtIjozMTYxMjEsImNoIjoxNzg0MSwiY2siOnt9LCJjciI6NzY3MzIzLCJkaSI6ImUyMzY0MTM1N2JiMTRjMzBiZWJjMWU2YzY1MDEzYjM3IiwiZG0iOjEsImZjIjoxMjQxMTU2LCJmbCI6ODQyNzM0LCJpcCI6IjY4LjExMS4xODYuMzYiLCJrdyI6ImFnZTwyMCxhZ2UyMC00MCxhZ2U0MCxhZ2U2MCxhZ2U-NjAsYm90aCxmZW1hbGUsbWFsZSxhcG9saXRpY2FsLGNvbnNlcnZhdGl2ZSxkZW1vY3JhdGljLHJlcHVibGljYW4sZmluYW5jZSxwb2xpdGljYWwsaGVhbHRoLGVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQsc3BvcnRzLGRpY3Rpb25hcnksaW5jb21lbG93LGluY29tZW1pZCxpbmNvbWVoaWdoLGluY29tZS1hbGwsaW5j", "http://engine.newsmaxfeednetwork.com/i.gif?e=eyJhdiI6NzI4ODIsImF0IjoxMywiYnQiOjAsImNtIjozMTQyMTgsImNoIjoxNzg0MSwiY2siOnt9LCJjciI6NTQ0MTEwLCJkaSI6IjU0NjJlZjBiMDY3MzQ5OTNhN2VhZjFlZGVhODEwY2EyIiwiZG0iOjEsImZjIjoxMjIwNjgzLCJmbCI6ODI0NzY5LCJpcCI6IjY4LjExMS4xODYuMzYiLCJrdyI6ImFnZTwyMCxhZ2UyMC00MCxhZ2U0MCxhZ2U2MCxhZ2U-NjAsYm90aCxmZW1hbGUsbWFsZSxhcG9saXRpY2FsLGNvbnNlcnZhdGl2ZSxkZW1vY3JhdGljLHJlcHVibGljYW4sZmluYW5jZSxwb2xpdGljYWwsaGVhbHRoLGVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQsc3BvcnRzLGRpY3Rpb25hcnksaW5jb21lbG93LGluY29tZW1pZCxpbmNvbWVoaWdoLGluY29tZS1hbGwsaW5j", "http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/14/sanders-america-was-founded-on-racist-principles-thats-a-fact-video/", "http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/in-defense-of-looting/", "http://engine.newsmaxfeednetwork.com/i.gif?e=eyJhdiI6NzU2NzUsImF0IjoxMywiYnQiOjAsImNtIjozMTQ5ODAsImNoIjoxNzg0MSwiY2siOnt9LCJjciI6MTE1ODI0NSwiZGkiOiIyZTdhZTI2ZWM1ZDY0MTQwYjA2YjZjYTUxMTU2YWM1MCIsImRtIjoxLCJmYyI6MTIyNzk1MywiZmwiOjgzMDU3NCwiaXAiOiI2OC4xMTEuMTg2LjM2Iiwia3ciOiJhZ2U8MjAsYWdlMjAtNDAsYWdlNDAsYWdlNjAsYWdlPjYwLGJvdGgsZmVtYWxlLG1hbGUsYXBvbGl0aWNhbCxjb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUsZGVtb2NyYXRpYyxyZXB1YmxpY2FuLGZpbmFuY2UscG9saXRpY2FsLGhlYWx0aCxlbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LHNwb3J0cyxkaWN0aW9uYXJ5LGluY29tZWxvdyxpbmNvbWVtaWQsaW5jb21laGlnaCxpbmNvbWUtYWxsLGlu", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/10/blacklivesmatter-leader-warns-us-needs-new-constitution-or-there-will-be-bullets/", "http://www.mrctv.org/blog/wisc-director-community-relations-suggests-shoplifting-not-crime#.heciax:1pKb", "http://canadafreepress.com/article/75985"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:44:29.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
