(AP) - The nonpartisan board that oversees elections in Wisconsin would be replaced with a partisan commission under a Republican-backed bill that’s up for a vote in the state Assembly. \nThe Assembly also plans to vote Wednesday on a Republican-sponsored bill overhauling the state’s campaign finance laws to increase donation limits and allow coordination between candidates and issue advocacy groups. \nDemocrats oppose both measures, saying they will lead to an increase in untraceable money into elections and result in ineffective regulation. \nThe Government Accountability Board is nearly eight years old and comprised of six former judges. The bill would create separate ethics and elections commissions made up of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats. \nBoth bills must also pass the Senate and be signed by Gov. Scott Walker before becoming law. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:13:07.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
