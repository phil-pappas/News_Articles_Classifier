I feel so excited that my heart is skipping a beat,\" he said.\nRosales' arrival and detention may help mobilise the opposition in the run-up to the December 6 parliamentary elections, which opinion polls show will be among the toughest ever for the ruling Socialist Party and a test for Maduro.\nThe attorney general's office warned Rosales that he would be detained on charges of stealing public money when he announced his plans last Friday to return home.\nHis lawyer, Jesus Ollarves, said Rosales had expected to be arrested but returned anyway at the request of his family and political party, and because he came to believe that \"exile is the worst prison\".\nPolls say the opposition is on track to win the December elections, potentially dealing the first decisive ballot-box defeat to the socialist party in 16 years.\nSource: Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:25:13.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
