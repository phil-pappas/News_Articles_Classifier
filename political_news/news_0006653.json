We'll have to be careful,\" Meechai Ruchupan, chairman of the CDC, said before its meeting yesterday. The meeting follows the CDC's session last week with four independent organisations, including the Election Commission and the National Anti-Corruption Commission. The CDC has to be careful about granting power to them because their authority could overlap and that would lead to conflicts among them. The CDC would figure out how to balance everything, he said. The independent bodies have called for the CDC to ensure they at least keep the same power as under the previous charter of 2007, but that is not unusual because anyone wants what favour him or her, he said. However, the CDC has invited the units to provide information so that the drafters could consider their suggestions. There were many points poking drafters' minds, so they were forming \"something new\", he said. The press will learn about it after it is done, he said. Since people have grown accustomed to the current organisations, there might not be any need to abolish some of them. However, Meechai will try to build people's trust in these bodies, he said. Last week, Thanin Kraivichien, a privy councillor and former prime minister, gave his personal opinion that the new charter should weed out corrupt politicians and prevent them from returning to politics. Meechai said that had already been outlined in Article 35 of the provisional charter. Such a suggestion was commonly heard among the people and the CDC would work on it, he said. The panel is absolutely open to public views, Meechai claimed. Many have already been submitted. Although the CDC cannot write everything into the charter in line with people's wishes, it is good that they are forthcoming with their ideas, as it allows the drafters to acknowledge people's thoughts, he said. The drafters have also been indirectly inspired by society's interest in the charter's content, he added. Amorn Wanichwiwatana, spokesman for the CDC, said the committee was still working on Chapter 3 of the new charter. At least 28 articles have been finished, he said. The constitution will only stipulate sanctions and leave out the rights and freedoms people can enjoy, he reiterated. 333 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:43:04.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
