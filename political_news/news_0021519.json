In this case, we've hit that balance as we look at sustainably managing the Mackenzie River basin.\"\nA significant component of the agreement will be the creation of bilateral committees involving First Nations representatives that will provide a forum for ongoing discussions on cross-boundary resource management, said Polak.\nLands Director Lana Lowe said members of the Fort Nelson First Nation are pleased with the consultation that has taken place thus far.\n\"We're really looking forward to playing a meaningful role in implementing this agreement,\" she said by phone from Fort Nelson.\nThe Liard and Petitot watersheds -- both tributaries of the Mackenzie -- run through the heart of Fort Nelson First Nation territory.\nThe Mackenzie River watershed covers an enormous swath of Canada's Northwest, draining a staggering 1.8-million square kilometres, or nearly 20 per cent of the country's land mass.\nIt is Canada's longest and largest river, with tributaries that reach into B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Yukon.\nIn 1997, those four jurisdictions -- plus the N.W.T. -- established the Mackenzie River Basin Board in recognition of the need to work collaboratively to manage the basin.\nB.C. has similar agreements in the works with Alberta and Yukon, which are expected to be completed within the next few months.\nLand-use agreements in the region have not been without controversy in recent years.\nIn early 2014 a coalition of conservationists and First Nations took Yukon's government to court, arguing the territory's decision to open a chunk of Canada's North to mining and development ignored an established land-use plan.\nThe Yukon Supreme Court ultimately agreed with them, ruling that the territorial government had violated the land-use planning process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:52:19.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
