Apparently, US President Barack Obama has now offered him some comical advice in case the rapper is serious with his plans of running for the White House seat. \nIf at all, in any degree, the president displayed an impressive sense of humor and surprising knowledge about West. Either he is very close to West or the president is very much updated with the news in the entertainment industry. Like Us on Facebook \nSpeaking at a DNC fundraiser in San Francisco, where West is also performing, Mr. Obama told his audience: \"A little bit later you're going to hear from a guy who I hear has been talking about launching a potential political career.\" \n\"You may have heard of this, Kanye... is thinking about running for Speaker of the House,\" the president joked as seen in the video first posted by ABC7 News . \"It couldn't get any stranger... But in case Kanye is serious about this whole POTUS thing or as he calls it 'peezy' I do have advice for him,\" the president continues. \nMr. Obama then dragged Kim Kardashian into the joke, saying West should know that as president he will be spending a lot of time dealing with some strange characters who behave like they're on a reality TV show. \"So you've gotta be cool with that,\" Mr Obama said. According to E! Online , Kardashian attended the event with their 2-year-old daughter North West. \nThe president then advised West to work on being better at keeping on message. Referencing West's album in 2010, Mr. Obama said: \"This is the second important tip -- saying you have a beautiful dark twisted fantasy -- that's what known as 'off message' in politics. You can't say something like that.\" \n\"Do you really think this country is going to elect a black guy from the south side of Chicago with a funny name to be president of the United States? That is crazy!\" the president joked, evoking laughter from the audience. \nMeanwhile, Kardashian took to her Instagram account to share photo of two boxes of shoes from West's Yeezy Boost 350 and 750 collections. The boxes had sticky notes on them which read \"Obama.\" Her photo caption reads \"special delivery #yeezys.\" One pair is a size 11 and ½ and the other pair is a size 12. \nDuring today’s DNC fundraiser in San Francisco, President Obama offered three pro tips to Kanye West, who recently said he wanted to run for president.
