Exports shrank 3.7 percent, though that was an improvement from the previous month's 13.8 percent decline.\nWeakness in trade has fueled doubts Beijing can hit its economic growth target this year of about 7 percent.\nMuch of China's slowdown over the past five years was self-imposed as the ruling Communist Party tries to steer the economy to more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption. But the past year's unexpectedly deep decline has raised fears of politically dangerous job losses.\nThe government has cut interest rate five times since November and pumped money into the economy through spending on public works construction.\n\"Import growth appears to have come in weaker than expected,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report.\n\"This suggests that domestic demand may have softened,\" though part of the decline is due to a drop in global commodity prices, which makes foreign goods cheaper, he said. \"Import volumes are holding up much better.\"\n___\nGeneral Administration of Customs of China (in Chinese): www.customs.gov.cn\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
