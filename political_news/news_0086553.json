U.S. based manufacturers receive new orders every month worth close to a half-trillion dollars. To underscore the health and prospects of this economic sector, today is the fourth annual Manufacturing Day, with activities staged across the country by American companies. The focus is a series of open houses to show the breadth and vitality of American manufacturing innovation and quality, and illustrate the need for skilled employees. Currently, over 11 million Americans work in this sector. The 2012 Economic Census found over 297,000 manufacturing establishments in the U.S., doing nearly $5.7 trillion of annual business. The economic census, the most comprehensive survey of our economy, is taken at five-year intervals and dates back in several forms to the year 1810.
