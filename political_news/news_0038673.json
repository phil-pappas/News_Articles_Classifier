Weight-loss and energy products were the most common supplements named.\nUnsupervised kids were the next most affected, followed by adults ages 65 and older. In seniors, choking and swallowing problems were most common, most often related to vitamin and mineral supplements .\nStudy estimates came from 2004-to-2013 data from 63 emergency departments across the U.S. Those visits resulted in an estimated 2,154 hospitalizations each year.\n\"This is very disheartening,\" Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research, told The New York Times . \"What we're seeing from this study is that the system has failed.
