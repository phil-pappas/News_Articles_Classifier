Strickland, who was critical of the lack of women in the previous administration, has said his team would reflect the city’s diversity.\nStrickland, a City Council member who handily defeated incumbent Mayor A C Wharton in the Oct. 8 election, met with city officials Tuesday to talk about the transition.\nJack Sammons , chief administrative officer under Wharton, said officials gave Strickland updates on ongoing issues like police staffing and response times, and the city’s financial health.\nSammons reiterated that Wharton had committed to making the transition an easy one for Strickland, who takes office Jan. 1.\n“We’re all going to live here, and we want him to be enormously successful,” Sammons said.\nFollow more politics and policy coverage from the InforMemphis team on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*300/Mitch+Graves_Headshot.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*280/Emily+Greer_Headshot.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*301/Rosie+Bingham_Headshot.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/Mitch+Graves_Headshot.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/Rosie+Bingham_Headshot.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/Emily+Greer_Headshot.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:10:11.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
