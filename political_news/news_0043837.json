PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A former child-soldier from Sierra Leone has been released after over two years of immigration detention in Minnesota. \nA U.S. magistrate judge this week ruled Nelson Kargbo should go free. In a statement released Friday, Kargbo says he just wants to walk outside with his four children and play with them at the park. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, the Center for New Americans at the University of Minnesota Law School, and the Dorsey & Whitney law firm challenged his detention, saying he was victimized as a child soldier before coming to the U.S. as a refugee in 2000. \nImmigration authorities detained him in 2013 and moved to deport him for convictions from several years earlier. But an immigration judge ruled he couldn’t be returned to Sierra Leone. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:31:52.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
