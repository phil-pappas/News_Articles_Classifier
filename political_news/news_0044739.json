Quote: A former investigator with the House Select Committee on Benghazi is accusing the Republican-led panel of carrying out a politically motivated investigation targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead of the thorough and objective fact-finding mission it was set up to pursue. Maj. Bradley Podliska, an intelligence officer in the Air Force Reserve who describes himself as a conservative Republican, tells CNN that the committee trained its sights almost exclusively on Clinton after the revelation that she used a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. That new focus flipped a broad-based probe of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, into what Podliska describes as \"a partisan investigation.\" Podliska, who was fired after nearly 10 months as an investigator for the Republican majority, is now preparing to file a lawsuit against the select committee alleging that he lost his job in part because he resisted pressure to focus his investigative efforts solely on the State Department and Clinton's role surrounding the Benghazi attack. He also alleges he was fired because he took leave from the committee to fulfill his military service obligations, which would be an unlawful firing. The committee strongly disputes his claims. Watch Podliska's exclusive TV interview with CNN Sunday at 9 a.m. ET on \"State of the Union.\" Get complete coverage of breaking news on CNN TV, CNN.com and CNN Mobile.
