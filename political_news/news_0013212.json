Apple says it does not tolerate underage labor and is dedicated to the ethical sourcing of minerals.\nThe president, who will mark his first year in office next week, will also visit Google's headquarters and discuss improving wireless Internet access to Papua and other remote Indonesian regions by using smart balloons.\nWidodo, who is also expected to meet executives from Facebook and Microsoft, wants the tech giants to team up with Indonesian universities to establish education centers that will help make the country a regional tech hub.\n\"We see a positive change in direction and mood of the government toward a more open investment environment,\" said Lin Neumann, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, after a closed-door meeting with Indonesian ministers before the president's U.S. trip.\nIn Washington, Widodo will meet executives from U.S. mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc, which is lobbying Indonesian officials to revise a law that would allow new contract negotiations to take place much earlier than currently allowed.\n\"Invest in Indonesia, but you have to also respect the regulations in the country,\" Pandjaitan said. \"We don't want to disturb any existing contract. But when the contract expires, then it belongs to us.\"\nWidodo will also meet U.S. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders to discuss rising tensions in the South China Sea and the fight to contain Islamic State.\n\"Indonesia can play a significant role on the IS issue and be a mediator in conflicts involving Muslim countries like Palestine,\" Pandjaitan said.\n(Editing by Andrew Roche )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:01:30.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
