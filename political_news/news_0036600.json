Joshua L. Wheeler of Roland, Oklahoma, who died of his wounds Thursday.\nCarter gave a fresh description of the battle involving U.S. troops transporting Kurdish troops to the scene aboard U.S. helicopters. He said the plan was not for American troops to enter the prison compound or to get involved in direct combat. Carter said that when a firefight ensued, Wheeler responded, enabling the mission to succeed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:05:43.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
