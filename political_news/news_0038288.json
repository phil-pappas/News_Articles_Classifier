Tate is the founder of the America's Liberty PAC. \n\"God is great,\" Benton told reporters outside of the courthouse in Des Moines, the Des Moines Register reported. \nBenton was campaign chairman for the presidential run of Rand Paul's father at the time. The Super PAC Benton currently heads has raised more than $3 million for Rand Paul. \nRand Paul applauded the decision related to Benton on Thursday. \n\"I am happy that justice has been served,\" Rand Paul told CNN in an email Thursday. \nBenton has deep connections to the Paul family and is married to Rand Paul's niece. \nAmerica's Liberty PAC has not responded to CNN's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:20:04.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
