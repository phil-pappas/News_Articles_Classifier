He wants to privatize Social Security, gut Medicare, criminalize abortion and shut down the government — just because.” \nThe answer could be Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera , Congressman Ron Desantis or Congressman David Jolly , all early on contenders for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat open after Marco Rubio’s run for Senate. \nOne of our opponents is a Republican masquerading as a Democrat. He voted for the Benghazi Committee anti-Hillary witch-hunt; he wants “cuts across the board” (including Social Security and Medicare); and he is owned lock, stock and barrel by his Wall Street campaign contributors. \nThis is Grayson’s primary opponent in the Democratic primary Patrick Murphy, who he says “Sold his soul” for his fundraising lead and let Tea Party Republicans use the “Anti-Hillary Propaganda machine” Benghazi Committee hurt the former Secretary of State’s Presidential Campaign. \nOne of our opponents is a fascist masquerading as a libertarian who supports eugenics, is committed to starting a second Civil War, and once dismembered a goat and drank its blood… At a campaign fundraiser. (Just kidding about that last part.) \nThat would be Augustus Sol Invictus , the controversial Libertarian candidate, which has split the state party after admitting to participating in a ritual that involved sacrificing and drinking the blood of a goat. \nGrayson then ends the message with a call of action to donate to his campaign. With still over a year until the general election, all of the candidates have been lobbing regular attacks at the other party.
