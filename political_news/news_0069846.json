The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016, if it passes state regulatory approvals and other requirements. The merged insurer would cover 53 million members and leave only three major players in the insurance industry.\nIn the same month, Aetna agreed to buy Humana for $37 billion. The new company will have more than 33 million members.\nRead More Clinton said these companies \"bear the heavy burden of demonstrating that consumers will benefit.\"\nAs president, Clinton said she would \"strengthen the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and appoint aggressive regulators to take on troubling concentration wherever it occurs in the health care industry, among other sectors.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:09:15.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
