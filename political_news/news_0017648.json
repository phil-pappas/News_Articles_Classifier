The primary reason people use e-cigarettes is to quit or cut back on smoking conventional cigarettes,” said Mr Satchell. \nThe NZ Vaping Alliance believes that a vaping ban is a step in the wrong direction, and is calling on Otago University to reconsider its vaping ban as the move risking causing more harm than good. \n“Increasingly the evidence is showing that more and more New Zealanders are quitting smoking by using e-cigarettes, which has to be a good thing. But putting barriers in their way by way of vaping bans is certainly not welcomed nor warranted,” Mr Satchell said. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:42:36.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
