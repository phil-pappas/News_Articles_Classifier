But with strict rules and constant hovering by North Korean officials, the brief reunions have often ended with deep regrets over questions not asked and future meetings never to come.\nParticipants from democratic, wealthy South Korea travel with a guidebook warning about what not to say to relatives from impoverished, authoritarian North Korea: nothing about food shortages and economic malaise; nothing that questions the competence of three generations of Kim dictators.\n\"I just looked at their faces and asked questions like how many family members were still living in the North,\" said Jang Choon, 83, who was reunited with his younger brother and sister at the last round of the reunions before this week's. \"We should have been given more time,\" said Jang, who still weeps whenever he thinks about the siblings he saw in February of last year but knows he'll likely never see again.\nAfter the tears and hugs, genuine conversation is often tough, maybe impossible, during the reunions at North Korea's Diamond Mountain resort.\nHere's a look at what past participants say happens when the journalists covering the reunions, which end Monday after two three-day rounds, leave and long-lost families from two starkly different countries have time to themselves:\n__\nSOUTH KOREAN RULES\nSouth Koreans often want to ask whether their North Korean relatives have been well fed despite the North's chronic food shortages. But the guidebook issued by South Korea's Red Cross, which organizes the reunions with its North Korean counterpart, warns that could provoke the North.\n\"It's desirable to avoid an expression that North Korea might misunderstand ... even though you are curious,\" said the guidebook issued before last year's reunions. Seoul says this year's participants received essentially identical warnings.\nIt said South Korean participants must understand that \"political comments, like criticism of North Korea's leadership and economic situation, may put your family members in a difficult situation.\"\nIt went on to advise South Koreans to try to \"naturally\" change the topic when their North Korean relatives sing propaganda songs or make political comments.\n___\nNORTH KOREAN SURVEILLANCE\nSouth Koreans who attended last year's reunions said their North Korean relatives appeared to be watched constantly by North Korean officials at the reunion center.\n\"I stifled some questions that I wanted to ask,\" said Kim Se-rin, an 86-year-old South Korean.\nJeon Ho-yeon, an 82-year-old South Korean, said his 79-year-old North Korean brother tried to preach to him about the benefits of North Korea's socialist system. Jeon said he awkwardly tried to change the subject to family topics at the time.\nJeon said they later went to a hotel room to get away from reporters and TV cameras. But he still worried about what he said in the room because South Korean officials had earlier told him that even those conversations might be monitored.\n\"I had a lot of things I wanted to ask, like about how my father and mother had lived before they died, but I couldn't because I had to be sensitive about everything,\" Jeon said.\nPark Chun-jae, 73, said his North Korean nephews, whatever the topic, seemed determined to tell him of the high quality of their lives in North Korea. \"I wondered whether they were taught to say that, although it wasn't a bad thing to hear,\" Park said.\n__\nSTILTED WORDS, FLEETING TIME\nSome South Korean participants said it was difficult to have genuine, in-depth talks because of the South Korean-imposed restrictions, worries about monitoring and intense media coverage.\n\"We didn't have any talks worth remembering,\" said Jeon said. \"I saw his face, learned that my parents were dead, but that was it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:02:36.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
