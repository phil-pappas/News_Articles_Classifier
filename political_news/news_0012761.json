Other applicants included Consumer NZ, Greenpeace, Oxfam, New Zealand Nurses Organisation, the Tertiary Education Union, and Ngati Kahungunu. \nIn a judgement released today, the High Court has quashed the Minister’s decision in relation to six of the categories of documents requested by Auckland University law Professor Jane Kelsey, who has led the legal challenge on behalf of the applicants. \nThe judgement says: \n“When the Minister refused Professor Kelsey’s request, neither he nor his officials assessed each piece of information requested against the criteria in the Act for withholding official information. Instead, the Minister adopted a “blanket approach” to the request based upon his knowledge of the categories of documents requested by Professor Kelsey. I have concluded this approach did not comply with the Act.” \nIan Powell says this is a significant finding against the Minister. \n“Throughout the negotiations we’ve seen a contempt for openness and accountability, which is unacceptable given the concerns expressed by a wide range of groups and individuals about the potential effects of the TPPA,” he says. \n“Maybe now that the negotiations have been concluded, perhaps we will finally get a chance to see what we’ve been signed up to.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:03:37.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
