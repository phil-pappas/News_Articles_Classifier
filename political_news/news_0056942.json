Show Caption Previous Next \nTonight's Democratic debate probably won't be as widely viewed as the Republican debates — the field is smaller and there's less personality amongst the four declared Democrats running for president than there is in just the single Republican front-runner. \nBut that means if you do watch the debate, our BINGO card will keep you entertained through the predictable questions and answers and hopefully we'll get a couple surprises for our time. \nOur BINGO card also has a live fact-check element - you'll be able to see some of the statements the candidates have made on these topics and how our partners at PolitiFact have rated their claims. \nPOVERTY \nBernie Sanders has said that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth.
