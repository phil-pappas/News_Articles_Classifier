The whole community gathers in the synagogue to hold it for a few minutes, passing it around to each and every member. Community members are then called up to read the Torah — even youngsters under the age of 13 that never participate in community duties — are called up on their own to partake in the readings. The highlight of the festivities is the Kol HaNe’arim reading, which features children who cannot make the Bracha on their own for the Torah. Fathers take the children under a canopy and make the blessing together, all while reading for them. The community then blesses the children. \nJP Updates wishes you all a safe, joyful holiday. \nOn Wednesday, we’ll be back to bringing you a daily round-up of news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:16:52.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
