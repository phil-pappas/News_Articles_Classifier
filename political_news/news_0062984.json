Vice President Joe Biden expected to make his 2016 decision any day now UPDATED 11:11 AM PDT Oct 20, 2015 Photos Pool/Getty Images News \nIf he pushes it to the absolute limit, Vice President Joe Biden has only nine more days to make and announce his 2016 decision -- if he wants to be a serious candidate who is on all ballots. \nVice President Joe Biden's associates are setting up interviews for potential staff positions on a Biden presidential campaign, a source familiar with the process tells CNN. \nThe interviews come as the political world waits for a decision from Biden o... Post-Debate, Hillary Clinton remains tops \nWith the first Democratic debate in the books, a new CNN/ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night, but her strong showing hasn't boosted her standing in the race for the party's nomination. \nClinton st... Biden counts on labor support -- but should he? \nPresident Obama's 2016 dilemma, a higher profile for Candy Carson, and Elizabeth Warren's next move were part of Sunday's trip around the \"Inside Politics\" table. \nPlus, whether Joe Biden can count on the union label, and a shiny new gift for the next... More \nIowa hosts the first Democratic caucus, but the first deadline isn't in the Hawkeye State -- it's in Georgia. Candidates have to submit a letter of their candidacy to the state parties by October 29. The Georgia primary is Super Tuesday, March 1, which is critical if this becomes a delegate fight. \nThen, several other deadlines are looming in November: For example, Alabama is November 6 at 5 p.m. Candidates must submit 500 signatures from across all Congressional districts. \nArkansas is November 9, followed shortly after by Texas, Michigan and New Hampshire. South Carolina isn't until December. \nHe could, of course, wait and allow these deadlines to go by. But that would be a critical mistake if this becomes a delegate fight -- like the 2008 Democratic primary did. \nQualifying for the ballot, however, is not always simple. Most states have requirements to get signatures from all congressional districts. Some states are easy -- just send a check -- others are more complicated. (In 2007-2008, Hillary Clinton's campaign almost missed Virginia's deadline because they didn't have enough signatures.) \nIf Biden is serious about running, he needs to express his interest before the end of next week. \nWhat if he decides to not decide now and jump in later? It would be a risk, but it's possible: Iowa caucuses have no deadline. He would miss other delegates, but could still be a candidate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:25:30.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
