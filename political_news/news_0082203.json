Out.\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 8, 2015 | 5:15 p.m. EDT + More House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race for speaker on Thursday, the day of the scheduled leadership selection in the House Republican conference. The California congressman delivered the news to a reportedly shocked group of Republican House members. Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana said of the announcement, \"We were all just thun­der­struck.\"\nFollowing the closed-door meeting, McCarthy told reporters the GOP needed \"a new face\" to lead the party. He reiterated the sentiment in a statement released soon after, saying, \"Over the last week it has become clear to me that our Conference is deeply divided and needs to unite behind one leader.\"\nCurrent Speaker John Boehner said he will continue serving in the role until a replacement is elected. A date is not yet set for that election.\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on Congress ]\nBut why now? It's simple, wrote Russell Berman at The Atlantic: \"McCarthy knew he was still short of the threshold he needed on the floor, knowing that Democrats would vote as a bloc against him.\" He may have had the votes for a simple majority, but not enough to unite the fractious Republicans. The tea party-aligned conservative Freedom Caucus, about 30 members strong, \"was threatening to block his ascension unless he agreed to empower its members through committee and leadership slots, procedural reforms, and possibly even legislative promises that he would be unable to keep.\" (Instead, they chose to endorse Florida Rep. Dan Webster.) Add to this the calls from constituents of \"rank-and-file\" Republicans to ditch McCarthy. Clearly, Berman concluded, McCarthy's support was in danger, and he knew it.\n[ READ: McCarthy Drops Out of Speaker Race ]\nMatt K. Lewis at The Week blamed the same party infighting for McCarthy's departure but offered alternative theories, too. \"McCarthy, of course, stumbled badly over his recent Benghazi comments,\" he wrote, referring to the majority leader's suggestion last week that the congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks was meant to damage Hillary Clinton politically. But just this morning, McCarthy was pitching himself as speaker, he noted, suggesting there may be something else afoot. One possibility, he offered up, is an unsubstantiated rumor of an alleged affair, likely made worse by a letter to the Republican conference chairman from Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., which asked speaker candidates to withdraw \"if there are any misdeeds he has committed.\" Whatever the reason, Lewis wrote, Thursday's events are no good for the GOP: \"Could Republicans have imagined a more nightmarish series of political events a year out from a presidential election?\"\nBut pinning McCarthy's departure on one theory, wrote The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza, is misguided, and it glosses over the bigger truth . \"There is a revolution happening within the Republican [P]arty right now,\" he wrote. \"The establishment's hold on power is more tenuous than it has been at any time in recent memory.\" Establishment-approved Boehner resigned in \"sacrifice to the tea party right,\" he argued, and the party's top three presidential primary candidates have never held office. \"If you are Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio or John Kasich, what happened on Thursday in Washington should put a lump in your throat,\" he wrote. \"This threat to the establishment from the conservative activist base is real.\"\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on the Republican Party ]\nSo who will be the \"new face\"? \"Definitely not Paul Ryan,\" wrote The Atlantic's Marina Koren, pointing to the Wisconsin congressman's clear refusal to take the reins. \"Maybe Jason Chaffetz,\" she said, even though until recently he'd been considered \"a long shot;\" the Utah congressman declared Sunday he was running for the post. But the Internet has suggestions, too, including GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, Vice President Joe Biden … and Drake. It's not nuts, she wrote. \"The Constitution actually does not require the speaker to be a member of the House.\"\nTAGS: Republican Party Congress McCarthy, Kevin", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20House%20Speaker%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/mccarthy-its-best-we-have-a-new-face/2015/10/08/ffd58c2e-6dde-11e5-91eb-27ad15c2b723_video.html", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/katherinemiller/whoa-kevin-mccarthy-drops-out-of-house-speaker-race", "https://twitter.com/PRyan/status/652162738270027776", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/08/kevin-mccarthys-implosion-signals-that-republicans-have-a-revolution-on-their-hands/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20House%20Speaker%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/10/house-speaker-mccarthy-chaffetz-boehner-webster/409714/", "http://theweek.com/articles/582127?", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20House%20Speaker%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20Kevin%20McCarthy%27s%20abrupt%20departure%20from%20the%20House%20speaker%20race.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0nyb%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/kevin-mccarthy-drops-out-of-speakers-race/409708/", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/84224/kevin-mccarthy-suddenly-drops-his-bid-speaker-house"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:29:59.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
