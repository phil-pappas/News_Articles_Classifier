Most economists believe the Bank of England will wait for the Fed to move before nudging up borrowing costs in the U.K., since tightening policy before the U.S. would likely appreciate the pound further--a strength that has already hampered British exports.\nHowever, officials at the BOE have so far shrugged off concerns about emerging economies, due to the small exposure of U.K. companies to those markets. During her speech Friday, Ms. Forbes suggested \"the U.K. economy is unlikely to be immune\" to a global slowdown, and said many emerging nations are making \"beneficial transitions toward more sustainable and balanced growth.\"\nDespite this hawkish turn, Ms. Forbes was at one point is considered a dovish member of the Bank of England's rate-setting panel, the Monetary Policy Committee, and since her appointment in July last year has never voted to increase interest rates from their current record-low 0.5% level--where they have stayed for over six years.\nHer views are consistent with comments made by most other BOE officials, who have so far signaled interest rates are likely to start rising around the beginning of next year. But investors are gloomier about Britain's economic prospects and are expecting a rate increase by late-2016 or even 2017.\nRecent economic data has suggested the U.K. economy slowed during the third quarter of the year, while annual inflation was negative in September--far from the central bank's 2% target in the medium term. While such figures might suggest policymakers still have much wiggle room to leave rates low without fear of stoking inflation, strong gains in unemployment and wages could also indicate the economy is ready for a small increase in borrowing costs.\nWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:35:22.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
