That behind all the bluster, beneath the weird hair, is a guy who just might be able to clean out the Augean stables of the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party that continues to cling to power in Washington.\nThe Democrats — with their eminently indictable presumptive nominee, Hillary Clinton — don’t like the idea of fundamental change any better than the Republicans. They prefer GOP opponents who don’t fight back, lose gracefully, and keep their seats at the national trough.\nThe odds are still against Trump. But long-suffering voters of both parties staring at a possible Clinton-Bush flashback, might be forgiven for thinking that this year, maybe, just maybe, things could be different. And all the rats in the world won’t change their minds.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3gShHwGqnSo", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rv82a05_KFM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mC8NEgPBJdw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJxWyuUj898", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9S13p39rIA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/n97LohAw-1s", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHzqMoSR0vY", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/17/the-plot-against-donald-trump/?AID=7236", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/FMfxt4Ib5MQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v8qIybuUkI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi0TULJM2dM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IrZoF3YVAQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2y3qBJvb7I"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:01:30.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
