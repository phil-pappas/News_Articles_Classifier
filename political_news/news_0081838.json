In an effort to create a point of difference with our bid, the Council is proposing to create a Digital Development Fund,\" says Mr Stevenson. \"This Fund would be primarily used for co-investment with either the Government or other service providers and would be repaid over time as people connect up to faster broadband,\" he says. \nMr Stevenson says the DDF will help the Council achieve its vision for the district’s digital services , As Far As Possible As Fast As Possible. \n\"The Fund will help build a high quality, open access, backhaul fibre network along all parts of SH3 and SH45 that fall within our district. This fibre network will then allow existing service providers to provide enhanced broadband and mobile coverage into our rural areas via wireless and other technologies,\" he says. \n\"The Council believes improving mobile cell phone and internet connections is the single most important thing it can do to enhance regional economic development. Good digital services have economic and social benefits and enhance the health and safety of our residents.\" \nMr Stevenson says the Digital Development Fund would be created by ring fencing up to $1 million from the Council's Long Term Investment Fund. By using this funding source, the Council can ensure there is no impact on rates. \nMembers of the public can give the Council feedback on its proposed Digital Development Fund until Sunday 8 November, either by going to Council’s website www.southtaranaki.com/consultation, emailing ruralbroadbandworkingparty@stdc.govt.nz or calling Claire Symes on 0800 111 323. \nThe Council will make its final decision on the Digital Development Fund at its meeting on 14 December. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
