This includes our plans to develop unused real estate for sale or rental as opposed to disposing of sites to commercial developers. \n“We will look at many of the sites on this list to see if we can get a higher rate of return by developing them ourselves.” \nChief Constable Shaun Sawyer said: “As a Force we face challenging budget reductions set by the government and the subsequent need to reduce our workforce over the next four years. It is only right that we review our estates and only keep those buildings that are not in need of significant modernisation and those needed to ensure we can continue to deliver a professional police service. \n“We are planning for the future by dispensing with buildings which are costly in terms of maintenance while investing in newer and more efficient premises where needed. \n“We are not removing ourselves from our communities, we are being more efficient and organised around where we base our people to ensure we continue to deliver the best service we can. Police officers and staff solve crime and keep our communities safe, not buildings. \n“The vast majority of frontline officers already spend their time out in communities either responding to incidents or engaging with the public. Our police stations are primarily used as a base for officers to work where they can carry out administrative duties, receive briefings and access welfare and hygiene facilities.” \nIn most cases new smaller stations could be built or officers moved to share facilities with other public agencies. It is designed to saved £1.05m a year. \nThe offices contained on this list detail the planned changes to the police estate over the next five years. \nYear Location Plan \n* Barnstaple West Pilton Police office closure – lease surrender – relocation to existing estate \n* Bovey Tracey Police office closure – lease surrender and relocation to Newton Abbot \n* Callington Police station closure – provision of community base in council office \n* Dartmouth Police station closure – provision of community base \n* Exeter - Multi-Agency Services Hub Lease surrender – relocation to County Hall and existing Exeter estate \n* Exeter – leased unit Lease surrender – relocation to existing Exeter estate \n* Liskeard Provision of replacement police station – potential tri-service location \n* OPCC office move Lease surrender – relocation to HQ \n* Plympton vehicle workshop Partnership co-location with city council and relocation of other functions to existing Plymouth and Plympton estate \n* St Blazey Police station sale – provision of community base co-located with town council \n* Torpoint Police station closure – provision of community base \n2016-17 \n* Beacon Park Police station closure – relocation to existing estate \n* Braunton Police station sale – provision of community base co-located with town council \n* Camborne traffic centre Options include relocation to existing estate and potential partnership co-location \n* Crediton Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base \n* Dawlish shop front Lease surrender – relocation to Teignmouth \n* Holsworthy Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team or community base \n* Ilfracombe Provision of replacement police station – tri-service opportunity \n* Redruth Lease surrender – provision of community base \n* Seaton Lease surrender – potential provision of community base \n* Torrington Police station closure - provision of neighbourhood team base or a community base \n* Truro shop front Lease surrender – partnership co-location and relocation to Truro station \n2017-18 \n* Exeter - Heavitree Road Police station closure - provision of neighbourhood team base following south side development of Middlemoor and relocation of staff \n* Exmouth Provision of replacement police station \n* Looe Police station closure - provision of neighbourhood team base \n* Plymouth property store Lease surrender and provision of new central store \n* St Ives Police station closure – provision of community base \n* Wadebridge Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base \n2018-19 \n* Bude Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base \n* Helston Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base \n* Okehampton Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base \n2019-20 \n* Launceston Police station closure – Provision of replacement police station (dependent on review of custody provision in Cornwall) \n* Ivybridge Police station closure – Provision of replacement police facility \n* Plympton Police station closure – provision of neighbourhood team base", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:48:12.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
