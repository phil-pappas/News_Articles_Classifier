On October 15, the walls of Gallery 7 will be adorned with works by Ram Kumar, M.F. Husain, S.H Raza, K.G Subramanyan and many other veteran artists. What's more, there will also be five selected works by children from the Mentor Me India NGO to be auctioned for charity. The NGO, which operates on a mentor-mentee concept, helps children in low-income communities grow to their full potential by supporting enduring one-to-one relationships with strong role models.\nAs part of their CSR activity, the art gallery has joined hands with the NGO and part of the profits of the exhibition 'Painting Dreams, Colouring Lives' will go directly towards supporting the Mentor Me India programme to expand their horizons to 200 new mentor-mentees.\nPasses can be bought for the closed event on the 15th while the exhibition will be open to the public October 20 onward for a month.\nSpeaking about their association with the NGO, Nicholai Sachdev from Gallery 7 says that he was approached by some of the mentors who happen to be his friends. \"The initial drive for me to support this cause was the fact that I have a seven-year-old daughter and I realise the impact that an educated role model can have on a child's life,\" he adds.\nApart from veteran artists, the 150 works at the exhibition will also include works by emerging and contemporary artists, such as Smita Kinkale, Nayanjeet Nikam, Prakash Waghmare among others. \"It's a nice amalgamation of senior artists as well as some of the contemporary ones. It's a broad collection meant to bring together all these artists. We have also kept the price factor in mind and the maximum price is around Rs15-16 lakh. You can buy a Jogen Chowdhury for Rs55,000, which you won't find anywhere else in the market,\" says Sachdev. Not only will the proceeds from the exhibition help the NGO, it will also give a chance to new collectors to build their collection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:09:07.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
