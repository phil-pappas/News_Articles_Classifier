Oz said there are some efforts to make the drug available over the counter, even saying that it should be available in the Capitol.\nA direct correlation to the rise in heroin abuse is the growth of prescription drug abuse, as public health experts say that prescription drug abusers turn to the cheaper heroin after they can't get more painkillers.\nOz's reputation as a health professional took a hit earlier this year after a group of surgeons wrote to Columbia University asking that the cardiothoracic surgeon be removed from its medical faculty. The surgeons said Oz peddled unsafe supplements on his television show.\nOz responded on his show that the surgeons were attacking his freedom of speech.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump warns of bigger threat to U.S. than immigration The billionaire candidate decries currency manipulation and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/06/15 6:46 PM \"We provide multiple points of view, including mine, which is offered without conflict of interest,\" according to a statement reported by USA Today in April. \"That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts.\"\nOz has been to Capitol Hill before, although under different circumstances. He testified before a Senate panel last year on the weight loss supplements he promoted on the show, which did not work.\nSeveral senators spoke before Oz at Tuesday's event, discussing legislative efforts to address the opioid epidemic.\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., criticized the Food and Drug Administration for not scrutinizing new opioid applications enough and wondered \"why they bring so much stuff to the market.\"\nManchin was especially critical of the agency's decision more than a year ago to approve the long-acting painkiller Zohydro without abuse-deterrent properties that make the product harder to abuse.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sanders works to peel union support away from Clinton Sanders has positioned himself as a champion of union workers.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/06/15 6:34 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:17:05.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
