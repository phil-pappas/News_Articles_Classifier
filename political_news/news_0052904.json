Advisory Proposal", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": " NexPoint Advisors, L.P.\nDALLAS , Oct. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- NexPoint Advisors, L.P. (\" NexPoint \") announced today that it has commenced litigation in the United States District Court in Connecticut against TICC Capital Corp. (the \" Company \" or \" TICC \") (NASDAQ: TICC), its Board of Directors (the \" Board \") and the President of the Company based on what we believe are clear violations of Maryland law and federal securities law to ensure that stockholders will not be stripped of their voting rights and denied the opportunity to vote on NexPoint's director nominees at the October 27 special meeting of stockholders (the \" Special Meeting \").\nIn addition, NexPoint is further enhancing its proposal to assume management of TICC to include support for a tender offer or share repurchase program of between $50 million and $100 million in the event NexPoint's management proposal is implemented by the Company and its stockholders. This matches the support announced by Benefit Street Partners (\" BSP \") resulting in our proposal continuing to offer considerably better economics for stockholders, including $45 to $50 million of incremental value over the next 10 years[1].\nWe view BSP's recent press release as a desperate attempt to divert stockholder attention from the key issue at hand, which is that, under BSP's management proposal, initially as much as $132 million and now at least $60 million (which was solely reduced as a result of our superior bid in favor of stockholders), in our estimation, is being paid to current management of the Company, rather than to the proper beneficiaries: the Company's stockholders. In contrast, our proposal offers stockholders $45-50 million in savings over the next 10 years 1 compared to the BSP proposal and does not involve any payments to the current management, which we believe is the source of their enmity towards our proposal and refusal to meaningfully engage us in discussions.\nWe continue to be gravely concerned with the ongoing deception and misconduct of the Company and the Board in our view. On September 11 , we validly nominated a competing slate of six highly qualified director candidates for election at the Company's Special Meeting. We previously reported how the Secretary of the Company attempted to evade service of our nominations in an apparent effort to disenfranchise stockholders. Finally, on October 5, 2015 , the Company outrageously informed stockholders that our director nominees were ineligible and that voting for our slate would be \"wasting their votes.\"\nIn our view, the Company and its insiders are attempting to steal the election by refusing to recognize our valid and highly qualified alternative slate of independent board candidates. Moreover, we believe they have attempted to rig the election so that their director nominees are guaranteed to win, because even a single vote cast in favor of the management slate will ensure its election in an uncontested race. We have commenced litigation against the Company, its Board and President because we believe the Company's actions clearly and deliberately violate Maryland law and Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\" Section 14(a) \").\nWe believe the Company and its insiders are engaging in a campaign of election fraud to ensure stockholder approval of a transaction structured to personally enrich several of them at the expense of stockholders by as much as $60 million . To complete that transaction, the Company and its insiders need to both have their candidates elected to the Board at the Special Meeting, and to have stockholders vote to approve the transaction.\nThe Company and its directors have also, in our view, made materially false statements and omissions intending to unfairly secure stockholder approval of the transaction. The Company and its insiders are asking for stockholder approval of the transaction without disclosing the massive financial interest certain insiders have in the transaction, and without disclosing why the directors decided to reject a competing offer from NexPoint which creates more immediate and long term value for stockholders. These misstatements and omissions also violate Maryland law and Section 14(a) in our view.\nWe see this as boiling down to self-interested corporate insiders colluding to manipulate the electoral process to implement a transaction that fleeces and disenfranchises stockholders under the guise of a sham approval process where freedom of choice is eliminated and essential information is withheld. As one prominent industry analyst observed, facts are \"grossly misstated (at best)\" in the Company's recent presentation to stockholders, and this analyst further concluded that \"presentations like the one provided by TICC's board make us sad for the BDC industry. And our hope is this will change, and change for the better.\"[2] NexPoint Advisors is striving to effectuate that change at TICC by protecting stockholder interests through all available means and offering a proposal that is focused on delivering value to the stockholders of the Company.\nWe firmly believe that the Company's and its insiders' continued misconduct cannot stand, and through our continued advocacy we plan to be the harbinger of change. We remain fully committed to defending the interests of, and maximizing the value for, TICC's stockholders, and urge stockholders to protect their interests and the value of their shares by voting:\n\"AGAINST\" the Company's proposals related to the BSP transaction; \"FOR\" each of NexPoint's six director nominees; and \"AGAINST\" the Company's proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting in the event that a quorum is present and the Company's proposals do not receive sufficient votes.
