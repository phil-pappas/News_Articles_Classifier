(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) By Editorial Board October 8 at 8:18 PM MAJORITY LEADER Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) threw the House into chaos Thursday by announcing that he would not seek to become speaker, leaving the GOP caucus without a clear leader and deepening worries that Congress will be incapable of performing basic functions.\nWould it be fairer to blame the so-called Freedom Caucus that opposed Mr. McCarthy, a few dozen hard-core Republicans who apparently didn’t come to Washington to govern but to tear the place down? How about the many House Republicans who are more civic-minded but who shrink from making the principled case for compromise and order? Or perhaps Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), who couldn’t or wouldn’t tame his restive caucus over the past five years, leaving a mess for whoever succeeds him?\nEveryone on this list may deserve blame, but at this point we hope members of Congress will shift from pointing fingers to thinking seriously about the good of the country and the dangers it faces. Even before the leadership crisis, the House had failed to face facts on the budget, the debt ceiling, immigration and many other issues. Now dysfunction could produce outcomes that would seriously harm the nation and the world, starting with default and shutdown. This isn’t a question of right wing vs. left but of nihilism vs. a willingness to govern. Legislators who care about the national interest must find the courage to forge governing coalitions, even with willing Democrats, if that’s what it takes to sideline a faction that abhors compromise.\nThat willingness must start with Mr. Boehner, stymied for now in his desire to retire.
