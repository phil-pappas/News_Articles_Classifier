Mahama is going for an endorsement since he is standing unopposed. \nPolitical watchers believe his vice president Kwesi Amissah-Arthur is an automatic choice, having sent him to pick his nomination forms. \nSpeaking on the issue, Mahama said he cannot reveal his running mate when he is not yet a candidate. \n“You can’t have a running mate when you are not yet a candidate,” Mahama told Twin-City Radio Monday. “We have worked sufficiently and looking for maximum endorsement. You can’t go over 100%. I’m going round and talking to them and asking for their mandate.” \n“You have to be endorsed first then you can announce who your running mate should be. There is a procedure for naming a running mate.” \nThe president was optimistic he is still “going for a one touch” victory in a bid to retain power. \nHe said: “I’m confident that God is on our side.” \nThe NDC will go to the polls on November 7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:30.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
