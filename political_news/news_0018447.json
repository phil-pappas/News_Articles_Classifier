Protestors in the back of the crowd couldn’t even see the candidate, but her voice echoed through a speaker system above loud cheers.\nShe told the crowd that they have the right to organize and the right to a living wage.\n\"That means saying no to Donald Trump,\" she said, referring to the presidential candidate who owns the hotel.\nMore than 300 workers from the Culinary Union, the American Postal Workers Union and the Trump International Hotel lined up on Fashion Show Drive to protest the hotel’s no-union policy.\nMounted police and dozens of officers on foot closed off part of the road while the more than 250 protesters gathered to bash Trump and continue the effort to unionize his hotel.\nThe Culinary and the Trump property have clashed over unionizing for about a year. About 500 Trump International employees are working with the Culinary to unionize the hotel's labor pool.\nMaria Elena Durazo, a six-year Trump International Hotel Employee, spoke to the crowd while union members waved flags and held signs that read “no contract, no peace.”\n“Mr. Trump says, 'Make America great again.' Well, the Trump workers say, ‘Start here,’” she said.\nDemocratic Rep. Dina Titus also attended the event, saying, “Señor Trump, can you hear us. We are Culinary strong.\"\nIn Tuesday’s debate, Clinton will square off against her current rival and union supporter in the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders. The 74-year-old Vermont senator is nipping at Clinton’s heels in the polls, raising millions, drawing large crowds to his events and championing unions.\nThe Culinary Union has yet to endorse any candidate. Its support would position Clinton to win the Nevada caucus, the nation’s third presidential nominating contest that takes place Feb. 20.\nWith 55,000 members, the Culinary Union is Nevada’s largest labor group and one of the state’s political power players. In past elections, it has bused employees to polls, mobilized grass-roots support and raised money for candidates.\nWhile the quick stop sparked excitement for the Culinary, the union didn't publicly endorse Clinton immediately after.\n\"We welcome Hillary Clinton to the streets of Las Vegas where workers are fighting for justice and respect at the Trump Hotel,\" said Culinary spokeswoman Bethany Khan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:22:03.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
