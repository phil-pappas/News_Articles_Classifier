What investors don't know is that the person or company touting the stock owns a large amount of it. As more and more investors buy shares, the value skyrockets. Once the price hits a peak, the scam artist sells their shares and the value of the stock plummets. Investors are left holding worthless shares.\nInvestors, and in particular users of messaging applications, should ignore any promotional spam they receive and report it to their provincial or territorial securities regulatory authority. For more information on how to spot and avoid investment fraud on the Internet, please visit the Canadian Securities Regulators (CSA) here .\nInvestors are also encouraged to visit securities-administrators.ca for more information and resources on understanding investments and recognizing fraud. @CSA_News will also be sharing tips and links throughout Investor Education Month.\nThe CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada's provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.securities-administrators.ca/uploadedFiles/General/pdfs/Investment%20fraud%20on%20the%20internet.pdf", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C7470&Transmission_Id=201510201100CANADANWWEB______C7470&DateId=20151020", "http://www.twitter.com/@CSA_News"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:42:33.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
