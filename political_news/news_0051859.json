That alone should make one rub their chin and go, \"H ????\" Why, H ???? Seems to me to make perfect sense. There's no denying that the overwhelming majority of Democrat voters are the very same low-income people (minorities, young people and seniors) \"targeted\" by this type of tactic. Since the Democrats promise these people free stuff, while all the Republicans have to offer them is personal responsibility, it's really no mystery why these people vote for the politicians they vote for. After all, if they took responsibility for themselves in the first place they wouldn't need Republicans telling them that they need to, nor would they be so enamored of Democrats promising them free stuff. Since you can't fight free stuff offering things like personal responsibility, strong moral values, hard work ethic, or religious faith the only thing to do is cut them numbers of freeloading losers actually going in to a voting booth. All's fair in love and politics... \"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.Â” - President George W.
