Mr Brennan had spent years at the CIA in various posts, and was also director of the National Counterterrorism Center in George W Bush’s administration. \nEarlier this week, an unnamed high school student told the New York Post he hacked into Mr Brennan’s personal AOL email account. The alleged breach reflects the challenges that government officials and agencies face in protecting their networks from hackers . \nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been under fire for using a private email account when she was secretary of state, which she has said was a “mistake.” \nWikiLeaks said it would post more Brennan emails in the coming days. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the alleged breach of his email account. \n“The hacking of the Brennan family account is a crime and the Brennan family is the victim,” a CIA spokesman said, adding that the family’s private messages had been “plundered with malicious intent”. He added: “This attack is something that could happen to anyone and should be condemned, not promoted. There is no indication that any the documents released thus far are classified.” \nIn what appears to be an unfinished draft report on the “Conundrum of Iran” that WikiLeaks said Mr Brennan wrote for Mr Obama, Mr Brennan said the war on terror by the Bush administration led to a “gratuitous labelling” of Iran as part of the “axis of evil”. \n“Whoever takes up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2009 will need to ‘hit the ground running’ on Iran,” the document from November 2007 said. \nThe US eventually did negotiate directly with Iran over a deal to roll back Iran’s nuclear capabilities, which was agreed to in April amid intense criticisms by Republicans. \nThe 2007 report said a direct dialogue with Iran was necessary given its strategic importance to the US and to stability in the Middle East. Besides Mr Powell possibly leading those dialogue efforts, the document suggested former Vice-president Al Gore or former secretary of state Madeleine Albright as other potential candidates to be the envoy to Iran. \nWikiLeaks also posted Mr Brennan’s 2008 application for a background investigation needed for his new appointment in the Obama administration. \nIn another 2007 paper on meeting the intelligence challenges of the 21st century, Mr Brennan recommended that the positions of CIA director and Director of National Intelligence be 10-year appointments. The posts do not have fixed terms. \nAt the end of that document, there is a section to address “damaging leaks of classified information,” but that portion was not filled out.
