The decisions displayed passionate, sometimes barbed, disagreements and suggested some bruised feelings among the nine judges. \nThe first case before the court involves a woman who lost her legs in a horrific accident after she fell while attempting to board a train in Innsbruck, Austria. The issue is whether she can sue the state-owned Austrian railway in American courts. The court also is expected to reject hundreds of appeals that piled up over the summer.
