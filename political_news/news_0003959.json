It’s just that I’ve been waiting for Back to the Future Day—October 21, 2015, when Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel to the future from 1985—pretty much my entire life.\nMy family rented the first Back to the Future film on VHS sometime in the late 1980s. When the movie ended, and I learned there was a sequel that I couldn’t immediately watch, I burst into tears. It’s not my fault Back to the Future is a near-perfect film.\nA near-perfect film with a sequel that didn’t perfectly predict the past 30 years of technology, okay, but who could have?
