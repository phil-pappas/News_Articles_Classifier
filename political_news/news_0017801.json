She said she's in the early stages of studying the issue. \n\"We are literally researching how does this operate, who does this reach, what is it,\" She said. \"Even the definition isn't clear.\" \nDaily fantasy sports participants put together virtual teams based on real players and compete for points based on the players' statistics. Paid contests cost as little as $1 to enter, but some players wager tens of thousands of dollars on each matchup. \nDemocratic state Attorney General Maura Healey is reviewing DraftKings. She said daily fantasy sports is a new and rapidly growing industry and her office has been looking into the practices of the companies to better understand how they operate. \n\"Neither federal law nor Massachusetts state statutes prohibit fantasy gaming,\" Healey said in a statement. \"My focus is on ensuring that there are proper consumer protections in place.\" \nHealey said she's concerned about recent reports about insider activity that would have put average players at a competitive disadvantage. \n\"I want to know that there are safeguards to level the playing field for all users and to protect kids,\" she added. \nDraftKings has said its executives are happy to work with Healey to answer her questions. \nDraftKings and another leading fantasy sports website, FanDuel, are being investigated by New York's attorney general following media reports a DraftKings employee may have had access to unfairly valuable data before winning $350,000 in a FanDuel contest. DraftKings and FanDuel, which is based in New York, have said nothing is more important to them than the integrity of the games they offer. \nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker said on Boston Herald Radio that Goldberg should focus on the lottery. He also said he was skeptical about the idea of the lottery running fantasy sports games. \n\"The lottery has a fundamental purpose and a defined role, and it has been reasonably successful at doing that,\" he said Wednesday. \nGoldberg said the lottery commission's fundamental role will continue to be running a healthy lottery. She said any expansion into online fantasy sports would require legislative approval. \nBaker also said he doesn't think \"anybody ought to do anything until after the attorney general makes some decisions on that.\" \nTraditional sports betting is barred outside a handful of states, but daily fantasy sports are allowed in most of the country.

JANET REPORTS THIS ALL COMES AS MASSACHUSETTS CONSIDERS GETTING IN ON FANTASY FOOTBALL. DRAFTKINGS C.E.O. JASON TOLD ESPN TODAY THAT THEIR EMPLOYEE WHO WON $350,000 LAST WEEK FROM THEIR COMPETITOR FAN DUEL HAS NOT DAMAGED THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME. THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT WAS BASED ON COMPLETE MISREPRESENTATION, BAD REPORTING, FRANKLY, AND WE'VE FINISHED OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. WE'VE ALSO HIRED AN INDEPENDENT LAW FIRM TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF ETHICAL WRONGDOING. TWO HOURS LATER MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID THERE ARE NO LAWS PROHIBITING THESE SITES FROM OPERATING BUT SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERYONE. WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THE COMPANY TO ASK THEM TO COME IN AND FAN DUEL AS WELL TO COME IN AND TALK ABOUT THEIR PRACTICES AND THEIR POLICIES. AWAITING HER FINAL REPORT, STATE TREASURER, SWHUGTED HER LOTTERY DIVISION MIGHT BE BETTER SUITED TO RUNNING FANTASY FOOTBALL GAMES. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY PROFIT DRIVEN WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE ARE. I'M ASSUMING THEY ARE TRYING TO BUILD THESE COMPANIES REALLY FAST AND PROBABLY SELL THEM. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THAT ISN'T GOOD FOR MASSACHUSETTS. BUT GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER SAID IN A RADIO INTERVIEW HE DOESN'T THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. THE LOTTERY HAS A FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE AND A DEFINED ROLE AND IT'S BEEN REASONABLY SUCCESSFUL AT DOING THAT, AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM FOCUS ON THAT. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THE LOTTERY COMMISSION TO REALLY LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT IMPACTS THE LOTTERY.
