No offence meant. Personally find both men charming.\" \nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said he didn't know whether Obama was aware of the tweet. \n\"I did note that Mr. Murdoch tweeted an apology this morning. I also noted that a Fox corporate spokesperson was asked about this and said something like 'I'm not going to quote on Mr. Murdoch's tweets.' And I'm not going to either,\" Earnest said Thursday. \nCarson, interviewed on CNN, said he considered the controversy \"much ado about nothing.\" \n\"I know Rupert Murdoch,\" Carson said. \"He's not a racist by any state of the imagination. He's just expressing his opinion.\" \nAsked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer whether he considered Obama a real black president, Carson replied, \"Well, he's the president, and he's black.\" Pressed again, Carson said it was an issue of semantics. \"I'm the last person who wants to deal with semantics and political correctness.\" \nFormer Obama aide and current CNN commentator Van Jones, said on that network that he found Murdoch's tweet \"outrageous and disgusting,\" and said that Fox News had done more to undermine Obama than any news organization had ever done for a president. \n\"This president has done everything he could do in the face of Rupert Murdoch,\" Jones said. \"If Rupert Murdoch cares about black people, he should tell the people at Fox News he does so, because you can't get that from watching Fox News.\" \nFox had no immediate comment. \n___ \nAP White House reporter Darlene Superville contributed to this report. \non Twitter on Wednesday when he wrote: \"Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide?\" \nHe also recommended a New York magazine article asking whether Obama has done enough for the African-American community. \nMurdoch, who founded Fox News Channel, apologized Thursday and tweeted that he \"personally find(s) both men charming.\" \nThe 84-year-old Murdoch has praised Carson on Twitter before, calling him \"irreproachable on background, achievements, character, vision.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:39:58.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
