Therefore, the Committee on Government Assurances seeks accountability for the Ghanaian people through their elected representatives,' he explained. \nMr Kwami Ahiabenu, President of Penplusbytes, explained that the forum has been designed to create a structured engagement mechanism between citizens and parliament to enhance their ability to hold duty bearers accountable through increased interaction between them and Parliament.' \n'This forum is the fourth of its kind undertaken by Penplusbytes this year, and it provides opportunities for a diversity of voices to be heard on issues that matter to people, and fosters a sense of mutuality, belonging and a sense of empowerment, all of which strengthens our burgeoning democracy.' \nParticipants at the forum called for more of such interactions to enable them meet their MPs more regularly, while serving as a platform that would offer them the opportunity to express their opinions on legislations and government policies which affect them. \nThey said such a forum would also enable them to share in decision-making, thereby assuming more ownership of solutions and more responsibility for their implementation. \nThe CGA together with Penplusbytes would hold the next citizen forum at the University of Cape Coast after undertaking verification of some projects promised by the Government, which includes the Cape Coast Stadium and the construction of a new market at Kotokroba. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:04:17.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
