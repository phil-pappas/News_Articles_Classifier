Lynch said Thursday that she agreed with that position and would continue to uphold that pledge. \nHolder had assembled a working group of media organization representatives in response to concerns about Justice Department actions, such as issuing secret subpoenas for telephone records of Associated Press reporters and editors in a leak investigation. \nThe Justice Department subsequently released new guidelines for leak investigations.
