The retired neurosurgeon, at a speech and question and answer session at the press club's Washington, D.C., headquarters, repeatedly took shots at the national media, which he said, \"don't like\" him because he's \"not politically correct.\"\n\"I don't necessarily care whether the press likes me or not and therefore I'm not going to conform to all their little requirements,\" Carson said.\n\"I mean, you guys are down there with used car salesmen,\" he said later.\nWhen Carson was asked about his recent remark that the Holocaust would not have been as deadly if more German Jews were armed, he hit the media again.\nRepublicans mull 'Plan C' for speaker By Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\n\"Well the Holocaust issue, that's just the left-wing press trying to stir up controversy,\" he said. \"And which I expect of them. Because that's what they do. But basically what I said is that when tyranny occurs traditionally around the world, they try to disarm the people first and that's exactly what happened in Germany in the mid to late 30s. They started a program of disarming the people and by the mid 40s it would've happened. And it's happened in a number of countries as well.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:23:34.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
