It's double what Florida Sen. Marco Rubio raised during the same period. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul brought in $2.5 million between July and the end of last month.\nHowever, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's campaign amassed $20 million in that time.\nThe Associated Press learned of Cruz's figures from a campaign aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share fundraising numbers before they're officially released.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:42:22.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
