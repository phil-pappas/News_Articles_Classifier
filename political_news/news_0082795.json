Several national polls have her sitting in second place behind front-runner businessman and fellow Washington outsider Donald Trump. Fiorina is the only woman seeking the Republican nomination, after serving as vice president with AT&T and then as CEO of the Hewlett-Packard Co., among other ventures. In 2010 she ran for the U.S. Senate in California, winning the GOP primary but losing in the general election. She told the gathering of S.C. College Republicans on Friday some of her background, including that she briefly flirted with becoming a lawyer. “I hated law school,” she said. “I quit after a single semester.” Fiorina mostly stuck to her standard stump speech, saying the Obama administration has been weak on national security, singling out her disagreements with the recent nuclear agreement with Iran and on handling the aggressive movements by Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the bigger part of her message was that an “inept” Washington has too long been governed by “a professional political class” that prefers not to do anything about it. “We need a leader in the White House that actually will challenge the status quo,” she said. Fiorina’s message was well-received by the group. “I think it’s time we had a woman in office,” said Shelby Hoovler, a student at Charleston Southern University, who said she definitely will be voting for Fiorina. She’s “what American needs.” Earlier in the day Fiorina was in Aiken appearing with U.S. Sen. Tim Scott in his presidential town hall interview series he’s doing with all the candidates. She met with reporters and referenced Thursday’s mass shooting at an Oregon community college. She says more must be known about the alleged shooter before rushing to judgment on whether universal background checks could have prevented the massacre. “We need to know more about this particular shooter, but it would appear that he is one of those individuals who should not have had access to a gun,” Fiorina said. “Before we start calling for more laws, I think we ought to consider why we don’t enforce the laws that we have.” The Associated Press contributed to this story.
