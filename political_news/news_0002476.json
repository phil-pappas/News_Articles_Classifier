Steve Glazer , who defeated her in the 7th State Senate District ’s special election earlier this year. \nIn a Facebook post Monday morning, Bonilla, D-Concord, indicated she doesn’t want a do-over of that ugly race. \n“I believe our efforts are best spent in uniting our collective voices to help achieve a better quality of life for our entire community,” she wrote. “Having our community experience a negative and divisive election based on lies, personal attacks, and defamation of character is harmful and damaging for our community. Running for public office should always be focused on a debate of ideas and values that will help our community and not tear us apart.” \n“Therefore, in order to ensure that all of our collective efforts remain focused on building a stronger foundation for the next generation of families, I am announcing that I will not run for State Senate in 2016,” she wrote. “I hope we can continue to work together for the betterment of our state, community, and our families as I complete my term in the Assembly in December 2016. Together, we can ensure the next generation of Californians will achieve their dreams by having high quality schools, good paying jobs, and safe communities in which to raise their families.” \nGlazer, D-Orinda, beat Bonilla by 9 percentage points in the May special election to fill the vacancy left by Mark DeSaulnier ’s election to Congress last year. The contest between the centrist Glazer and union-backed liberal Bonilla saw tremendous independent spending and a corresponding avalanche of negative advertising that soured many of the district’s voters. \n[You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.] JohnW \n“Having our community experience a negative and divisive election based on lies, personal attacks, and defamation of character is harmful and damaging for our community…” \nShe seems to be saying that, if she did run, we WOULD have an election based on those things. But if she doesn’t run, we WON’T have an election based on those things. What does that say about her?
