The June opening of a \"racino\" just across the state border in Plainville, Mass., has not siphoned away as much Rhode Island casino business as feared. The Ocean State is on a \"legitimate upward trend.\" And there you have it: the skinny on the latest state revenue report covering the first quarter of the budget year. \"It appears that we may have been too pessimistic about the impact that the opening of the racino in Plainville, Mass., would have on the Twin River Casino in nearby Lincoln, but I would caution that it is still early in the fiscal year to know for sure,\" said Acting Director of Revenue David M. Sullivan, following the release this week of the new report. Overall revenue collections are running $21. 8 million ahead of the projections on which this year's $8.7-billion state budget was based. With collections through the first quarter of the budget year that began on July 1 continuing to \"outpace expectations,\" Sullivan said Rhode Island is now \"verging on a legitimate upward trend.\" Sullivan acknowledged some concern that personal income tax withholding payments are underperforming expectations slightly. But sales and use tax collections are up 1.3 percent, and the state's share of the overall gambling revenue generated by the Twin River casino, the Newport Grand slots parlor and the sale of more traditional lottery games, such as scratch tickets, is up 7.6 percent over projections. Putting this in perspective, the previous budget year that ended on June 30 netted $56.9 million for the state from the lottery games, $312.3 million from video-gambling activity, and $12.8 million from the table games. Fearing the worst from the opening of the Plainridge Park Casino, Rhode Island budget writers lowered their expectations for this year to $54.9 million for the state from scratch tickets, Powerball and other lottery games; $263.3 million from the acres of video-slots at both Twin River and Newport Grand, and $13.5 million from the table games at Twin River. The Plainridge slots parlor and harness racing track, which opened in June, only offers slots and electronic table games, not live table games. The first revenue report, in August, showed sales up a dramatic 200 percent from the $75,000 generated during the same period last year when Plainridge offered only harness racing. But gambling revenue at Massachusetts' first casino slipped significantly in September, marking the second straight monthly decline since the facility opened on June 24. Beyond the relatively good news on the gambling front, Sullivan said: \"Adjusted business corporation tax revenues are 43.6 percent more than the enacted fiscal year 2016 estimate on a year-to-date basis through September 2015, a significant difference that bears further watching.\" The state's number-crunchers are now a week away from the start of the last of the two \"revenue and caseload estimating conferences\" this year. It starts on Oct. 26 with an update on the state's Medicaid and cash-assistance caseloads, and ends Nov. 10 with a new revenue projection by the top fiscal advisers to the House, the Senate and the governor. Page 2 of 2 - The consensus adopted at this conference will provide the baseline for the new state budget the governor proposes to state lawmakers in January. This run-up to this annual budget exercise has already begun behind the scenes, with the state budget office estimating that the state-funded portion of the budget would cost about $129 million more — or a total of $3.68 billion state dollars — to provide the same level of services next year as this year. Agency directors have been asked to produce alternative plans that cost 2.5 percent, 5 percent, and 7.5 percent less than their current services level budget. kgregg@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:21:04.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
