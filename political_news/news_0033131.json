Taylor Elementary School at Sea Lab in the South End. “This is a long time coming,” New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said of the 26,000-square-foot project. The mayor said funding needs elsewhere, in recent years, have delayed projects such as the sorely needed replacement for the Taylor school. The city traded Massachusetts School Building Authority elementary-school funding for a federally-mandated environmental cleanup near the site of the new Keith Middle School. The original Taylor school was built in 1898. The MSBA is providing $12.5 million — 90 percent of the cost — for the new school, which will be located in the Sea Lab Marine Science Education Center on Portland Street. The expansion will include a gym, media center and more, in addition to two classrooms per grade. About 300 students in kindergarten through fifth grade will attend the new school. City Councilor-at-large Linda Morad spoke Tuesday on behalf of Ward 6 Councilor Joe Lopes, who couldn’t attend the groundbreaking, and indicated just how long a new Taylor school has been in the works. “When Councilor Lopes was (first) elected, this was the first meeting he attended, in 2009,” Morad said, referring to a Taylor school planning meeting. The city has spent a combined $36 million in recent years for cleanup efforts at sites near Keith Middle School and New Bedford High School, according to data from Mitchell’s office. The EPA mandated the cleanup after the city, under the administration of former Mayor Frederick M. Kalisz Jr., decided to build the new Keith school on a contaminated ball filed. Mitchell said while those costs and others have long hindered the city’s ability to finance other school projects, a 2013 capital plan for school construction now has several projects moving forward. “I think we’re back on track,” Mitchell said Tuesday. Construction of the new Taylor school will begin while the design phase is under way for another South End school, the new John Hannigan Elementary School on Emery Street. The Sea Lab facility has housed John Hannigan since the school’s roof collapsed in 2006. The new, 74,000-square-foot school will enroll about 400 students and replace the old school, built in 1919. The MSBA voted in August to approve funding for 80 percent of the Hannigan school’s estimated $37 million cost. MSBA executive director Jack McCarthy praised the city’s efforts to secure state funding for school projects. “I can’t say enough about what Mayor Mitchell has done since he arrived here,” McCarthy said. “Compared to a lot of other places, he has moved very fast.” McCarthy said state Rep. Antonio F.D. Cabral and state Sen. Mark Montigny, both New Bedford Democrats, had made numerous calls to MSBA in support of the Taylor school project. “Part of reforming education is having first-class facilities,” Cabral said.
