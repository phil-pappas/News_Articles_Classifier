He's talking about his policies. It's a very delicate situation but Dr. Carson has not suspended (his campaign),\" said Armstrong Williams, Carson's business manager. \nABC News reported earlier Thursday that Carson's communications director Doug Watts said the retired neurosurgeon is staying off the trail until Oct. 28. But Williams said Watts was likely expressing concerns about violating Federal Election Commission policies that require candidates to keep campaigning and business finances separate. \nCarson released his latest book, \"A More Perfect Union,\" earlier this month and has multiple upcoming book signings. He's scheduled to attend a forum Sunday in Plano, Texas. \nWilliams said even on a book tour, Carson still campaigns as very few questions are about the actual book. \n\"Whatever he's doing on tour, all the questions still center around him being on the campaign. His gaining closer ground on Donald Trump, so I understand that the campaign may have those concerns, but it doesn't change much for Dr. Carson,\" he said. \nLater Thursday, Carson tweeted a photo of his wife, Candy, on the campaign trail in Iowa -- reading to children. \n\"Candy is having a blast meeting supporters throughout Iowa -- best part is reading to Jordan Creek Elem. students,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:27:34.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
