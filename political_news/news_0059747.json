For those of us who want to see the United Kingdom continue it makes it all much more difficult.\n“It is extremely ironic that in Scotland we have [Tory leader] Ruth Davidson telling you that she and she alone can save the Union when in London David Cameron, a victim of his own right wing, is systematically undermining it and destroying it. The answer is a federal structure for the whole of the UK and we are the people that must lead this fight.”\nPromoted stories The Orkney and Shetland MP, who faces a court hearing next month over the phoney Frenchgate affair during the election, was speaking in a debate on a new federal treaty of union.\nEarlier, delegates rejected a proposal to go into the Holyrood election advocating an extra penny on income tax to raise more funds for health.\nPaisley councillor Eileen McCartin said the idea would be “bold”, honest with voters, and strengthen the party’s anti-austerity credentials.\nShe warned many voters no longer know what the LibDems stood for after five years of “compromise and pragmatic politics” in Coalition with the Tories at Westminster.\n“We need a clear policy. What we don’t need is a mibbes aye, mibbes naw policy,” she said.\nShare article However, activists backed Edinburgh Western candidate Alex Cole-Hamilton's amendment to water down the plan, making extra taxes a last resort not the first option.\nDelegates also called on the SNP Government to end its blanket ban on growing genetically modified crops in Scotland, calling for a scientific, evidence-based approach instead.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-25T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:09:57.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
