(AP) - A Charlotte state House member who has championed legislation that tightened abortion rules and eased gun restrictions won’t seek re-election next year. \nRep. Jacqueline Schaffer is now in her second term. She told fellow House Republicans of her decision Friday by email. \nSchaffer says increasing work opportunities with her family’s executive search firm and legal and consulting activities don’t allow her the flexibility to seek another term. She wrote she came to her decision six months ago and started telling some colleagues in August. She says the decision had nothing to do with political factors or potential 2016 opponents. \nSchaffer helped pass legislation this year that extended the abortion waiting period from 24 hours to 72 hours. Other sponsored bills that are now law broadened where concealed handguns are permitted. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:11:21.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
