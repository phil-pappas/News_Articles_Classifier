The forum took placxe at Moultrie Middle School. × MOUNT PLEASANT — The dozen candidates seeking one of four Town Council seats up for grabs on Nov. 3 spent two hours making their case Thursday at a forum sponsored by Save Shem Creek. Not surprisingly, most of the questions revolved around growth — specifically how the town was handling the quality and quantity of it, the very issue that caused the nonprofit group to form recently. The candidates disagreed sharply over whether the town government was transparent. Former Councilman Nick Collins said many residents were blindsided by the town’s plans to support a new office building and parking garage at Shem Creek. “What’s missing is your input,” he said. “You’re the ones who have to deal day to day with the traffic that developers bring.” But auctioneer Julio Avendano noted residents can learn so much about their town government just by checking their smartphone. “Transparency has never been better in this town,” he said. “What we need are our citizens being better engaged.” Planning Commissioner Bob Brimmer said the town has made efforts to be more transparent but still could do more, including moving its committee meetings from the middle of the workday to a “time that people can actually go to the meetings.” They also sparred over traffic. Businessman Jim Owens said the town should divert its money from a planned roundabout at Chuck Dawley, Coleman and Ben Sawyer boulevards to widening S.C. Highway 41. Businessman Rodly Millet had a different take on addressing traffic. “We are the traffic. We are a car-centric community, and there are no alternatives now to move people,” he said. “We need sidewalks. We need bike paths, and we need public transportation in Mount Pleasant.” As far as widening Highway 41, planning commissioner Ben Bryson said, “It’s a leadership question I think. I think Highway 41 could have been improved a long time ago if the leadership was there to lobby for it.” Former councilman Joe Bustos said the town should consider making developers pay more for roads. “Traffic is bad in Mount Pleasant. I don’t think there’s anything disguising that,” he said. “A lot of developers have become very wealthy at the expense of Mount Pleasant, and I think it’s time for them to give back a little bit.” Incumbent Councilman Chris O’Neal said the best thing the town can do to strike the right balance between residential and development interests will take place before the election. “Tuesday night we get a chance to vote on the growth management plan,” he said. “Let’s pass it.” But newspaper columnist Will Haynie rattled off criticism of town leadership, mistrust and perception issues identified by a recent Urban Land Institute report, adding, “If that’s what you like and that’s what you want, then vote for incumbents and vote for the status quo.” They also disagreed over whether the town should switch from its current form of government to a strong-mayor system like Charleston and North Charleston, though most at least expressed a willingness to consider a change down the road. Businessman Christian Bramson praised Mayor Linda Page and said the town’s current form has worked well for the 15 years he has lived here, adding, “As it stands right now, I think it’s fine.” Incumbent Chris Nickels said he tries to find middle ground or “the sweet spot,” adding, “My theme has been independent leadership ... I have no friends to reward. I have no enemies to punish.” Incumbent Ken Glasson agreed, saying he heard some interesting things, but not all issues are black and white. “There are also some gray areas that have the rest of the story,” he said. “You can’t just say, ‘We’re going to stop the developer’ ... You either defend them in their property rights or you don’t.” Town Council’s elections are at-large, so the top four vote-getters on Nov. 3 will be sworn in on Nov. 10. Those present also heard briefly from the three Mount Pleasant Water Commission candidates, including incumbents Mac Jenkinson and Diane Lauritsen and challenger Dodge Hindman. At least one more forum is on tap. The Mount Pleasant Business Association is holding a forum at noon Oct. 15 at the Mount Pleasant Holiday Inn. Reach Robert Behre at (843) 937-5771.
