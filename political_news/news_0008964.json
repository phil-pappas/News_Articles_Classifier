When CNN's Anderson Cooper asked Sanders whether he considers himself a capitalist, the Vermont Senator replied: \"Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little, by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't.\"\"I believe in a society where all people do well,\" he continued, \"not just a handful of billionaires.\" Cooper then asked the panel: \"Is there anybody else on the stage who is not a capitalist?\" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responded with a vague defense of the capitalist system.

But still, it was a remarkable moment last night that reflects the new moment of inequality we find ourselves in.\" To deny capitalism, or this \"Free Market\" is NOT destroying this nation is to be a fool with a tin foil hat; or a 1%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:40:24.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
