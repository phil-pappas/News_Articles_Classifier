They are now calling for a world wide ban on “climate denial.” What’s scary is that the current US administration probably agrees that this would be a good thing.\nWe might think that a semi-secret, international conference of top judges, held in the highest courtroom in Britain, to propose that it should be made illegal for anyone to question the scientific evidence for man-made global warming, was odd enough to be worthy of front-page coverage.\nLast week I mentioned that the Prince of Wales had sent a message to this conference calling for the UN’s forthcoming climate meeting in Paris to agree on “a Magna Carta for the Earth”. But only a series of startling posts by a sharp-eyed Canadian blogger, Donna Laframboise (on Nofrakkingconsensus ), have alerted us to what a bizarre event this judicial gathering turned out to be (the organisers even refused to give her the names of those who attended). (snip)\nThe purpose of this strange get-together was outlined in a keynote speech (visible on YouTube) by Philippe Sands , a QC from Cherie Blair’s Matrix Chambers and professor of law at University College, London. Since it is now unlikely that the world will agree in Paris to a legally binding treaty to limit the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees C from pre-industrial levels, his theme was that it is now time for the courts to step in, to enforce this as worldwide law. (snip)\n“The most important thing the courts could do,” he said, was to hold a top-level “finding of fact”, to settle these “scientific disputes” once and for all: so that it could then be made illegal for any government, corporation (or presumably individual scientist) ever to question the agreed “science” again. Furthermore, he went on, once “the scientific evidence” thus has the force of binding international law, it could be used to compel all governments to make “the emissions reductions that are needed”, including the phasing out of fossil fuels, to halt global warming in its tracks. ( Read More )\nGee, I wonder how they all got themselves to and from the strange get together. I’ll bet they didn’t ride bicycles and sailboats.\nWilliam Teach pointed out that this isn’t a surprise at all , considering the source.\nNo one should be surprised by this in the least, being the logical extension of the whole “the science is settled” screeching from members of the Cult of Climastrology (who they themselves refused to practice what they preach). Warmists demand that the only science to be taught in schools is one sided, being more akin to indoctrination than scientific inquiry. They refuse to follow the Scientific Model. They band together and assail any scientist who refuses to bow to the CoC. ( Read More )\nJust as a side note, last week we were informed at the 6th grade curriculum night that the kids were going to spend 2 weeks learning about global warming in science class. I’ll have to let my son know that what he’s being taught is just a theory and there are quite a few scientists who disagree with it, and there’s a lot of data that refutes it. But of course he won’t be able to put that down on a test. I won’t even start on what my 9th grader is learning in global history. Something about how an advantage of a communist economic system is everyone is taken care of. Do you blame me for skipping his curriculum night? I’ve considered home schooling, but the Democrats – who are big proponents of climate change hysteria – drove up the cost of health insurance so much that I have to work. It’s almost like it’s by design.\n Read more at LonelyConservative.com\nFollow The Lonely Conservative on Twitter – twitter.com/lonelycon", "external_links": ["http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/facebook.png", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/share_save_256_24.png", "http://lonelyconservative.com//feed/https://www.addtoany.com/share_save#url=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;title=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/pinterest.png", "http://nofrakkingconsensus.com/", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/stumbleupon.png", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/11924776/Judges-plan-to-outlaw-climate-change-denial.html", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/print.png", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/stumbleupon?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/email.png", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/twitter.png", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/world-court-should-rule-on-climate-science-quash-sceptics-philippe-sands", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2015/10/11/cult-of-climastrology-wouldnt-look-to-actually-ban-climate-denial-would-they/", "http://lonelyconservative.com/wp-content/plugins/add-to-any/icons/google_plus.png", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/print?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Flonelyconservative.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fclimate-hysterics-want-world-wide-ban-on-climate-denial%2F&#038;linkname=Climate%20Hysterics%20Want%20World%20Wide%20Ban%20On%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:20:01.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
