By Michelle Everhart The Columbus Dispatch • Monday October 5, 2015 9:10 AM Want to know what’s happening in Ohio government and politics from Columbus to Washington, D.C.? We’ve got you covered. Gov. John Kasich has gone from second to seventh in GOP presidential polls in New Hampshire. “Kasich trailed only tycoon Donald Trump in the survey last month. After the second debate in California, in which Kasich got relatively little face time after choosing not to mix it up with the others on the stage of the Reagan Library, five candidates have slipped by him. And the governor's percentage has dropped from 12 to 6,” Dispatch Public Affairs Editor Darrel Rowland writes. *** Who is ahead of Kasich : Donald Trump still leads the poll followed by Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. *** Some possibilities : Besides the rise of anti-establishment candidates such as Fiorina and Carson, Northeast Ohio Media Group’s Henry Gomez writes, “Bush, the former Florida governor who had once been the field's frontrunner, could be seeing results from his television advertising push in New Hampshire .” *** Headline from the weekend : From the Boston Globe: “Kasich says ‘it’s over’ if campaign fails in N.H.” “We’ve got about 128 days to go until the NH primary,” said Kasich told a group at the opening of his New Hampshire campaign headquarters. “We do well here, we’re moving on. We do terrible here, it’s over. No confusion about that. This is very, very important to us.” *** Where the governor is today : Kasich will have a town hall meeting at the University of Richmond in Virginia.

Kasich also plans to attend private meetings with GOP senior aides and lawmakers on Capitol Hill and to headline a town hall in Richmond, Va,” POLITICO’s Ann Palmer writes. “The Washington swing, just days after the third quarter fundraising deadline, comes as Kasich is facing questions about his long-term viability in the GOP primary. After a strong first debate performance and subsequent surge, he's been hobbled lately by falling poll numbers, which has made raising cash even harder.” ***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:17:52.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
