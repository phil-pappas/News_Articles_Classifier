(AP) - Former President Bill Clinton said struggling rural regions like coal-dependent southern West Virginia should be the focus of new energy investments and infrastructure improvement.\nClinton's 41-minute speech at the state party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner Friday night focused more on rural issues than on promoting his wife, presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nHe questioned why there aren't assembly companies for windmills and solar plants investing in the state's coal-dependent reaches.\nHe blasted Republican presidential hopefuls for criticizing government, calling Donald Trump a \"master pranker.\"\nClinton's appearance is one of his first stops as he becomes more active on the campaign trail for his wife.\nHe recently headlined fundraisers in Chicago, Atlanta and suburban Kansas City. He'll headline one in suburban Detroit this month.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:01:46.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
