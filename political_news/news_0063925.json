The Britain Stronger in Europe (BSE) campaign will launch a poster and video based on Mr Cummings’s comments, made at a Spectator debate last week. The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg claimed in a television debate last year that the UK would lose 3.1 million jobs as a result of a Brexit – an argument that has since been discredited. However, think-tanks have shown that these jobs are linked to trade with the EU, so some are likely to be lost should Britain leave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:29:54.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
