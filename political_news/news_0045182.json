(Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press) October 16 at 5:45 PM Regarding the Oct. 12 editorial “ Making moves on gun laws ”:\nIn the editorial, Hillary Clinton is Quote: d recommending that those who sell a “significant number of guns” must obtain federal firearms licenses.\nI tried to offload an inherited firearm via a Web site. I could sell it out of state only through a licensed dealer who would convey the gun to another dealer and then to a buyer who had undergone a background check. That doesn’t infringe on the Second Amendment. So what is “significant”? Other legislative language does not impede this approach.\nIf one crazy person with a gun kills one child, is it significant? What if the victim is an adult? A veteran? What number of guns sold by one person without a proper check of the people who buy them is significant? Buyers who fail the check are properly infringed, so all sellers must be responsible for making sure that these people do not get a gun.\nThe number of people who have already killed and who would have failed a background check is on our heads. Just one gun is a significant number. I urge the president not to quibble on this.\nHugo Blasdel , Solomons, Md.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:54:01.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
