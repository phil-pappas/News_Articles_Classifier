Modi addressed a rally in Bhabua near Sasaram today.\nBJP had opposed the demand and dubbed it as an attempt to scuttle democracy.\n\"How can you ensure that telecast is not shown in areas going to election...many parties hold campaign. But we see that in their campaign they do not address the voters or issues of constituencies going for poll on that particular day,\" an EC official said.\n Bihar assembly elections BJP Election Commission nation Also Read Government has no intention to trouble any club: House Committee Chairman A Manju Doordarshan struggling to maintain professional freedom: Narendra Modi tweets Andhra Pradesh boy contests against Arvind Kejriwal Delhi snaps water, light to Mohd Azharuddin", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/election%20commission%201_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/election%20commission%201_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/no-legal-bar-campaign-outside-poll-going-constituencies-ec", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:12:52.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
