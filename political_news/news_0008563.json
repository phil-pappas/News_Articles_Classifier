She's popular. He's populist. Tonight, we learn the difference. How to watch: http://t.co/A9hseGwYJW #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/MCAUXii5fX â€” CNN (@CNN) October 13, 2015 \nIt is the first of six scheduled debates, following back-to-back heated exchanges among Republican candidates. \nWhereas Republicans left an impression of a dysfunctional family, the first Democratic debate is expected to be a meeting of the minds. But regardless of party, the podium is an even playing field where bold rhetoric can build a powerful following or tarnish a legacy. \nTuesday marks the return of a seasoned politician, a test for a fiery senator who's risen beyond expectation, and a national introduction for candidates with the hopes of a debate-fueled rise in the polls. \nDNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said all are qualified to serve as president. \n\"Our candidates have a variety of different ideas, but they are all different approaches ot the same set of goals\" she said. \nThe first Democratic debate is squared-in on Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \nThe Vermont senator is riding a wave of grassroots support. They 74 year-old is the oldest presidential candidate, but inspires younger voters who turn out in a rock concert style of support. \nJonathan Capehart with The Washington Post said Sanders still has to prove he's the real deal. \n\"The challenge for Senator Sanders is to make people understand that he's not just a fad. That he's not just the Democrats' version of anger in the way that Donald Trump is being portrayed on the Republican side.\" \nThe pressure is also on for Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee, who have the challenge of being memorable, possibly mirroring Republican Carly Fiorina's catapult to the top of the polls. \nBut the candidate with the most to gain or lose is the former Secretary of State, facing relentless attacks on her private email server, with the threat of Vice President Joe Biden lurking in the shadows. \nWith 13 months to the finish line, the race to the 45th President of the United States is anyone's game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:09:33.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
