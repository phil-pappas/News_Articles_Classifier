Gorham High School Principal Chris Record sent a letter to parents and students explaining the cancellation of school dances. \"It is by no means the students' fault, but the dancing they have witnessed on MTV/VHS/movies involves primarily only sexually suggestive grinding,\" Record explains in the letter. He says school administration, dance chaperones, some students, and some parents have struggled with the, \"modern dance culture.\" Record details to parents exactly what grinding entails, and says it's making dance chaperones uncomfortable. \"Grinding basically involves a girl having her back and buttocks pushed up/pulled up against the boy's groin with the boy's hands on her hips and other places,\" he writes. He also says younger students have complained about being pressured to participate in grinding. Last year, most students walked out of a homecoming dance after being reminded that grinding was prohibited. \nAccording to the principal there was virtually a student protest movement to allow “grinding.” \nSome students are upset, according to Newser , that dances are being entirely banned rather than simply kicking out the students who “grind.” \n(The article also suggests that the principal might have misspelled “VH1” when he referred to VHS. \nBut who wants the headache of policing kids from simulating public sex and getting resented for it? It would be one thing if all the parents would back the teachers, but I doubt they support the teachers facing these problems. \nI’m not an advocate of banning dances, but I can understand why a principal would decide they are more trouble than they are worth. \nThe culture has reached the point where an adult has no way to reach a young kid raised on who knows what kind of degenerate fantasies through the internet. \nIn fact, many adults who should know better are encouraging such indulgence and irresponsibility. When Michelle Obama is publicly lauding Beyonce as a “role model” for youth , it shouldn’t be surprising that our teen dancing has become obscene and sexualized. \nNewser reports that other schools have had to ban dances due to obscene gyrations, but my real concern is that there might be a lot of other schools that ought to have taken action and are not bothering to do anything about the “dirty dancing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:42:27.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
