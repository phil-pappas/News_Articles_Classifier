Luis Gutierrez calls on NBC to dump Trump from SNL Rep.

Luis V. Gutierrez, Illinois Democrat, joined a growing list of elected leaders and immigrant rights activists that want NBC to dump Mr. Trump from his scheduled Nov. 7 appearance on SNL. \n“I think I speak for a lot of Americans, especially immigrant Americans and Latino Americans, when I say that if SNL is allowed to proceed, it would be a huge corporate blunder,” Mr. Gutierrez said in the letter sent to Brian Roberts, chairman of Comcast Corporation, and Stephen Burke, president of NBC. \nMr. Gutierrez and other immigrant rights groups have argued that Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, and his plan to fix the nation’s broken immigration system, has been insensitive to immigrants. \nSome conservatives, meanwhile, have celebrated Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration. \nFor his part, Mr. Trump says the that the uproar over his hosting SNL is going to assure one thing: great television ratings. \n“I thin that Gutierrez and everyone else is driving the rating through the roof,” Mr. Trump told The Washington Times Tuesday. “It will be the highest rated SNL ever.” \nMr. Trump also described Lorne Michaels, executive producer of SNL, as “a professional that knows what he is doing.” \nThe Gutierrez letter comes after America’s Voice, a leading Hispanic advocacy group, and MoveOn.org, a liberal advocacy group, launched a petition for NBC to drop Mr. Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:47:18.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
