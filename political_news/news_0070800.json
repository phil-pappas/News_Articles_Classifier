(Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSEATTLE -- For six straight days, Staci Smith has had signs in front of the building she helps manage in the Central District. They are campaign signs for Pamela Banks, who is running for Seattle City Council in District 3. \nBut for six straight nights, the signs have been taken. The last three thefts were caught on surveillance cameras, the most recent Wednesday night. \n\"That's literally taking people's voices away,\" said Smith. \"It seems so malicious.\" \nVideo clearly shows a man in a hooded sweatshirt pulling the signs out from the ground and running off. \nPerhaps coincidentally, the thefts happened at the corner of 14th and Yesler, in front of the building that houses the Urban League of Seattle, of which Banks is president. \n\"I would think that this is one place where you should be able to say, you know what, this is your spot,\" said Smith, also a Banks supporter. \nBanks is running against incumbent Kshama Sawant, who's campaign denied any involvement in the sign stealing. A spokesperson said campaign staff and supporters are told to refrain from taking political signs from private property, especially since it is technically a crime. \n\"We'd like to find the person doing this and tell them to stop,\" said Sawant spokesperson Jess Spear. \nSpear added that Sawant signs have been stolen frequently as well. While sign stealing is often a part of politics, both the Sawant and Banks campaigns said it's happening more in this race.  //www.king5.com/story/news/local/seattle/2015/10/02/security-camera-seattle-political--sign-thief/73189074/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:18.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
