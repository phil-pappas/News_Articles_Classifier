Trump has previously appeared before he formally entered politics. \nTrump this summer called undocumented Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"killers\" as he launched his presidential bid, quickly drawing a mixture of ire and support as he pushed on with his presidential campaign. \n\"These groups are out for themselves,\" Trump said Monday morning on Fox News, before adding that he is \"leading in the polls with Hispanics\" and has \"thousands of Hispanics who work for me.\" \nNBC previously severed its business ties to Trump by backing out this summer of its broadcasting role for the Miss Universe pageant amid Trump's controversial comments about undocumented Mexican immigrants. \nTrump added that SNL's ratings would be \"through the roof\" on the night he appears on the program. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
