The Metropolitan Police will also give evidence on the the same day.\nThe committee firmly believes that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which the Home Secretary has established under the chairmanship of Judge Lowell Goddard, is the most appropriate channel for these very important matters to be examined.\nOur evidence session is therefore intended as a continuation of the regular series of very helpful regular updates which the committee received from the Metropolitan Police in the last Parliament and to hear evidence on a particular case.\nThe committee fully appreciates that ongoing operational activities are a matter for the police and these areas will not be discussed during the session.\nâ€“ Keith Vaz, chair of Commons Home Affairs Committee Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:46:04.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
