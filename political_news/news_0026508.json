The clip originally played this past weekend during New York Comic Con, and after a 90-second hype train highlight reel of the first season, it features fleeting looks at villains, allies, and of course the official Daredevil suit that made its first appearance at the end of last season.\nIn contrast to the Marvel films, Daredevil presented a darker, grittier take, anchored largely by two actors: Charlie Cox as lawyer-by-day, vigilante-by-night Matt Murdock, and Vincent D'Onofrio's wounded performance as the crime lord Wilson Fisk. Last season ended with (spoiler alert and shame on you for not watching this already) Fisk in police custody, and while there's no glimpse of him in the new footage we certainly hope he's there in the new season to continue to make things hard for Murdock. At the very least, we know that Elektra (Elodie Young) and The Punisher ( The Walking Dead 's Jon Bernthal) will be around to keep things interesting when the new season premieres next year.\nSeason 1 was awesome. Watch the @Daredevil #NYCC sizzle... Season 2 looks epic! http://t.co/Ce7EJjhZkT https://t.co/Ak03ebZIJq\n— App Store (@AppStore) October 12, 2015", "external_links": ["https://t.co/Ak03ebZIJq", "https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/653651186835304448", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYCC?src=hash", "http://t.co/Ce7EJjhZkT", "https://twitter.com/Daredevil"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:27:06.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
