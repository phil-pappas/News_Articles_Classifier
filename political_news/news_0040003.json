Kris Lane, professor of colonial Latin American history at Tulane University, busts five myths about the explorer. (The Washington Post) By Kris Lane October 8 As Columbus Day gives way to “fall break” and drops off many workers’ calendars altogether, it has become easy to overlook a perennial teaching moment. When Christopher Columbus does come up in the media or the classroom, he is usually simply bashed or praised, depending on the viewpoint of the speaker. In either case, he remains more myth than man. Let’s revisit some of the biggest misconceptions about the man Monday’s federal holiday is named for.\n1 . Columbus proved the “flat Earth” theory wrong.\nKris Lane holds the France V. Scholes chair in colonial Latin American history at Tulane University. In an early scene in the 1992 Ridley Scott film “ 1492: Conquest of Paradise ,” Columbus, played by Gérard Depardieu, gazes out at the Atlantic Ocean with his son. He tells the boy the world is like the orange he is peeling: round, not flat. In this traditional rendering, Columbus is an enlightened scientific figure, a pre-Galileo surrounded by obscurantists determined to scuttle his plans. We owe this myth to Washington Irving, who Americanized Columbus in a best-selling 1828 biography . Already known for Rip Van Winkle and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” Irving was a dedicated Hispanophile who researched Columbus’s life and voyages while living in Spain in the 1820s. Despite careful scholarship, Irving peddled the “all American” idea that Columbus was a hands-on seafaring man willing to challenge immobile academics who couldn’t see past the horizon.\nIn reality, that the Earth is more or less spherical was not news in Columbus’s day. The question was size, shape and how much of it was covered by oceans. Columbus would eventually opt for a smaller, pear-shaped world vs. the rounder orange.\nFlorentine mathematician Paolo Toscanelli is credited with inspiring Columbus’s voyage, but neither Toscanelli nor Columbus could convince Portugal’s court of its feasibility. Spanish cosmographers were similarly unmoved when Columbus met them in 1486, but the Catholic monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, were intrigued. They gave Columbus a stipend and kept him on hold. Portugal was pushing east to Asia by rounding Africa. Would Spain be left out? The monarchs granted Columbus another audience in early 1492. In April, an agreement was signed in the shadow of the Alhambra. Columbus was now “admiral of the ocean sea.”\n2 . Columbus was Italian.\nThe National Italian American Foundation calls the Columbus Day parade in New York “the most visible and accessible manifestation of our Italian American Pride,” and Italian Americans have led efforts to oppose changes to the holiday’s focus nationwide.\nBut when Columbus lived, there was no such thing as an Italian; Italy did not exist until 1861. The best evidence suggests that the explorer was born in a village near Genoa, which is part of Italy today. To his deathbed, he proudly claimed Genoa as home. In Columbus’s lifetime, Genoa was a fiercely independent republic with its own language , currency and overseas colonies. Its commercial ties to Castile and Aragon, in modern-day Spain, were intimate. Genoese trading colonies in Seville, Barcelona and Lisbon were sizable. Some Genoese who married locally were naturalized Castilian, Catalan or Portuguese subjects.\nThose cozy relationships helped give rise to a crop of Columbus “birthers.” Catalan , Majorcan ,", "external_links": ["http://www.niaf.org/culture/march-with-niaf-in-the-columbus-day-parade-in-nyc/", "http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lij", "http://medievalnews.blogspot.com/2009/10/christopher-columbus-was-catalan-and.html", "http://www.josemariacastillejo.com/en/christopher-columbus-was-mallorcan/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0095JHB3G", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLAnlt_DF4Y", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/5616ae1ce4b020e74175cd8d/20151008_columbus_myths.jpg", "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2014/10/08/italian-americans-plan-push-back-on-dumping-of-columbus-day/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:59:06.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
