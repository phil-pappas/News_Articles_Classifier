But central bank officials, including Fed Chair Janet Yellen, have stressed that the rate hikes are likely to be very gradual, meaning rates will remain near historic lows for some time.\nMany had expected the first rate hike to occur in September, but minutes of that meeting released Thursday revealed concern among Fed officials about a significant slowdown in China, which roiled markets in August. The thought was that China's problems could have a more severe impact on the U.S. economy than they had forecast. The Fed voted 9-1 at that meeting to keep rates unchanged.\nLockhart said that trying to interpret the recent twists and turns in the economy has been like riding a roller-coaster.\n\"The ambiguity of the moment reinforces the need to closely watch the vital signs of the economy over the coming weeks to determine if the outlook has changed,\" Lockhart said.\nBefore the December meeting the Fed will have data on the October and November employment numbers, inflation data for September and October and the first two estimates for overall economic growth in the third quarter, Lockhart said.\nData on consumer spending, he said, will be the most important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:18:45.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
