Shinkman Oct. 22, 2015 | 1:00 p.m. EDT + More An American commando was killed in a joint U.S.-Iraqi rescue mission in northern Iraq that liberated dozens of Kurds from Islamic State group captivity , though the full scope and purpose of the raid remains unclear.\nThe fatality marks the first time a U.S. service member has been killed in action during the ground fight against the Islamic State group. The U.S. soldier was wounded during the raid in the town of Hawija and later died, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement. A special operations source speaking on the condition of anonymity tells U.S. News the service member was reportedly from a support wing of the Joint Special Operations Command headquarters in Kurdistan, and likely not a direct-action operator like those who serve in covert units such as SEAL Team Six or Delta Force.\nRELATED\nThe Syrian Refugee Crisis: What Would That Mean for the U.S. in the 'Wild West'? The mission involved American helicopters and troops in support of Kurdish special operations forces who led the raid, Cook said. They freed approximately 70 hostages, most of whom were Kurds, though the group also included more than 20 Iraqi security forces members who were being held at a prison run by the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.\nThe mission was requested by the Kurdistan Regional Government and planned after the Defense Department received intelligence that the prisoners were about to be executed.\nFive Islamic State group fighters were detained and \"a number\" were killed, Cook said.\nThe special operations source says this kind of mission is indicative of intelligence that showed there was high-level Islamic State group leadership nearby, which would allow U.S. commandos to peel off and snatch those targets while the Kurds focus on the primary objective. Hawija's close proximity to Kurdistan also allowed many more troops and supplies to move in quickly, compared with other missions the U.S. has conducted in the past from farther afield.\nStrict policies from the White House have formally prohibited any U.S. combat operations on the ground in Syria and Iraq, though occasional covert rescue missions and direct strikes have been reported in recent months.\nThe prisoners the commandos rescued likely included Kurdish forces the Islamic State group captured during its onslaught on Kirkuk earlier this year. The extremist network released video footage shortly after showing pickup trucks with cages holding peshmerga fighters, designed as a propaganda tool to discourage other Kurds from fighting.\nIraqi security forces and Sunni volunteer tribal fighters stand guard after clashes against Islamic State group in the eastern suburbs of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's Anbar province, on Oct. 15, 2015.\nThe mission represents one of the largest publicly reported joint operations against the extremist network, which still controls massive swathes of Iraq and Syria radiating out from its headquarters in the Syrian town of Raqqa. Most of the U.S.-led campaign to retake ground from the Islamic State group has involved airstrikes in support of ground forces like the Kurds and formal security forces in Iraq, as well as a yet-undefined band of Arab fighters in Syria.\nMore recently, Russian troops have entered the fray in Syria, purportedly against the Islamic State group and in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and have signaled they would like to contribute to airstrikes in support of the Iraqi government. Russia announced last month it had already secured an intelligence-sharing agreement with Syria, Iran and Iraq.\nMarine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed during a visit to Iraq this week that Baghdad would not seek out Russia for air support.\nThe former Soviet power's recent actions complicating U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State group also likely prompted U.S. forces to demonstrate the kind of success the local government can have if it continues to rely on its American partners.\n[ READ: U.S. Ends Failed Syrian Training Program, Starts Arming Rebels Directly ]\n\"This allows the ambassador and the generals to come in and go, 'Look at what we accomplished here doing this. Stay the course with us. We're the guys who can do this at the strategic level,'\" Jim Reese, a former Delta Force commander with extensive experience in Iraq, says of the joint rescue mission. \"This is what we should be doing around the country.\"\nThe kind of support mission the U.S. is conducting in Iraq should involve training, assisting and then in-person mentoring on actual operations, Reese says, adding that troops in Iraq should have more leniency to perform that third task, as they did in this latest operation, if they are to have any success.\nRELATED\nObama Will Keep 5,500 Troops in Afghanistan\n\"When you go out, even if it's a small group and you lay back, their confidence goes up 10-fold,\" he says. \"When they run into trouble and Delta brings in the AC-130 [heavy artillery gunship], they go, 'Whoa.' And our guys say, 'Keep moving. You got to keep moving.'\"\nSuch missions could succeed with the number of U.S. forces already on the ground in Iraq, Reese says. And they should be allowed to operate that way more often, before countries like Russia increase their presence even further.\nEarlier this year, U.S. commandos launched a successful raid in eastern Syria and killed an Islamic State group leader named Abu Sayyaf. In the summer of 2014, U.S. special operations forces attempted to rescue James Foley and other American hostages they believed were being held in Syria. Shortly after Foley was executed, the White House revealed none of them were at the target site.\nTAGS: national security Islamic State Kurds Navy SEALs military special forces", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=U.S.%20Commando%20Killed%20in%20Joint%20Raid%20to%20Rescue%20ISIS%20Hostages", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/22/middleeast/isis-crisis/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=U.S.%20Commando%20Killed%20in%20Joint%20Raid%20to%20Rescue%20ISIS%20Hostages&summary=The%20mission%20shows%20the%20U.S.%20can%20be%20effective%2C%20but%20results%20in%20the%20first%20American%20soldier%20killed%20in%20action%20in%20the%20anti-ISIS%20fight.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-special-ops-attempt-hostage-rescue-in-iraq/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefvhc%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=U.S.%20Commando%20Killed%20in%20Joint%20Raid%20to%20Rescue%20ISIS%20Hostages"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:30:22.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
