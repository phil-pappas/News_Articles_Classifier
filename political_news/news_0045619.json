(AP) - Pledging to restore integrity on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court while shattering records for campaign spending, seven judges are vying for an unprecedented three open seats in the Nov. 3 election. \nThose candidates and six others eliminated in the May primary raised $10.5 million and spent $8.3 million through Monday. They have stepped up their efforts in a battle increasingly dominated by TV attack ads, such as those aired by Pennsylvanians for Judicial Reform, an in-state political committee that supports Democrats, and the Washington-based Republican State Leadership Committee on the opposite side. \nBetween Jan. 1 and Monday, Supreme Court candidates spent roughly $3.5 million to air ads on broadcast television in Pennsylvania, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of political advertising data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a media tracking firm. \nAlso, Pennsylvanians for Judicial Reform, which aired attack ads against the three Republican candidates earlier this month, spent about $350,000 for 300 airings, the analysis shows. \nAmong the candidates, the biggest spender was Democrat Kevin Dougherty, who paid roughly $1.3 million for 2,753 airings of his campaign ads during the period, the analysis showed. \nTwo of the vacancies on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court resulted from the resignations of disgraced former justices - a Republican convicted of using her taxpayer-paid staff to do political work and a Democrat implicated in a pornographic email scandal. The other open seat belonged to former Chief Justice Ronald Castille, who was forced to step down last year after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. \nFour of the candidates sit on the state’s two intermediate appellate courts and the others are county judges. All seven were evaluated by the Pennsylvania Bar Association’s Judicial Evaluation Commission and assigned one of three ratings: highly recommended, recommended or not recommended. \nThe candidates appeared together in only one general-election debate - on Oct. 14 in Harrisburg. \nSketches of the candidates are below: \n___ \nANNE COVEY \nAt the Supreme Court candidates’ debate, Covey didn’t bring up her status as the only one with a “not recommended” rating from the bar panel, but later she played down its significance. \n“The PBA admitted I am a good judge, they criticized me for exercising my right to free speech,” the Commonwealth Court judge said through her campaign spokesman this week. \nIn issuing the rating shortly after the Republican State Committee endorsed Covey, the panel said that during her 2011 campaign for her present post she violated a signed pledge not to run misleading ads. Covey publicly protested the action, but the panel stood by its decision. \nCovey, 55, of Bucks County, was elected to the state bench in 2011. Previously, she practiced law for more than 20 years, specializing in labor and employment cases, including a decade as a member of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board. She holds a law degree is from Widener University Law School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:46:37.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
