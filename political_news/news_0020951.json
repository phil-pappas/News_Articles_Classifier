Every trip to the porch, the end of the driveway or the apartment's mailbox cluster between now and Nov. 3 may bring a flyer promoting or attacking a candidate running for a local House or Senate seat. Especially in the House of Representatives, where a member represents 24,000 people, direct mail is one of the most effective ways to communicate with voters. The districts are typically so small that most people who see local television and radio ads don't live in the district. Increasingly, campaign finance reports reflect spending on Facebook and other online ads, although even those can be hard to target down to a legislative district. But the mainstay of campaigning, besides knocking on doors, is the mail.
