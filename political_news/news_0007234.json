Jean Jacques Fouda, Cameroon's official in charge of military hardware, said Saturday that the vehicles given during a visit Friday by Gen. David Rodriguez could \"fight against mines\" and are some of the best the country had ever acquired. He did not specify how many were donated.\nThe White House announced this week that 90 U.S. troops are headed to Cameroon, which has been regularly targeted by the Nigeria-based extremists and is contributing to a regional force to fight them.\nThe Americans, the vanguard of a group that expected to reach 300, will conduct airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in the region.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
