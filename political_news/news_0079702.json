First, the sedative midazolam is injected, followed by pancuronium bromide, a paralytic. The third drug, potassium chloride, is then used to stop the heart. But according to the autopsy records, Oklahoma used vials of potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride in Warner’s lethal injection. The state’s execution protocol only allows the use of potassium chloride.\nThe drug mix-up first came to light when Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin issued a last-minute stay of execution for Richard Glossip on September 30 after corrections officials discovered they had purchased potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride. On October 2, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals imposed an indefinite stay on all executions at the request of the state attorney general as investigations proceed.", "external_links": ["http://newsok.com/article/5450801", "http://newsok.com/article/5452084"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:58:29.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
