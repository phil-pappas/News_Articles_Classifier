In Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called it \"a major outcome not just for Japan but also for the future of the Asia-Pacific.\" \nIn addition to the United States and Japan, other TPP countries are Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, Australia, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, and Canada. \nNot included in the deal: China. For years, Obama and aides have promoted the TPP as a way for the U.S. and its allies to counter China's economic power in Asia. \nIn more than five years and talks, the U.S. and other countries worked through innumerable disputes over tariffs and trade rules for any number of international products, from automobiles to textiles, agricultural products to medical patents, dairy products to intellectual property. \nThe proposed trade deal may also play a role in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. \nCandidates in both parties — including Republican front-runner Donald Trump and as well as Sanders — have criticized past trade deals, saying they have encouraged U.S. employers to move jobs overseas to take advantage of lower wages and a lack of pollution restrictions. \nCritics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership pounced quickly, saying it will encourage employers in the U.S. and other advanced nations to move jobs to nations with lesser labor and environmental standards. \nArthur Stamoulis, executive director of the Citizens Trade Campaign, predicted that Congress would reject the deal, especially on the eve of an election year. \n\"Heading into 2016 and beyond, Congress members know that American voters are not going to accept a massive trade agreement with undemocratic countries that offshores jobs and drives down wages,\" he said. \nAsked about the politics of ratification, Froman said Monday's announcement as \"an important first step.\" The administration will now speak with congressional lawmakers and others about the details, he said, and \"we're confident that people will see this is a very strong deal.\" \nOne advantage for the Obama administration: a vote earlier this year requiring Congress to vote up-or-down on the entire agreement, without any amendments. \nIn pledging to work with Congress on evaluating the agreement, Obama says the pact includes \"the strongest commitments on labor and the environment of any trade agreement in history\" and removes trade barriers that have blocked U.S. products. \n\"This partnership levels the playing field for our farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers by eliminating more than 18,000 taxes that various countries put on our products,\" Obama said, calling the TPP \"an agreement that puts American workers first and will help middle-class families get ahead.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:21:21.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
