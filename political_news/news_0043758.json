Wade overturned. Presidential contender Ben Carson compared abortion to slavery Sunday, calling the procedure, even in cases to save the mother’s life “perverted” and that he would “love” to see Roe v. Wade overturned.\n“Think about this,” the retired neurosurgeon said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “During slavery … a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, ‘I don’t believe in slavery. I think it’s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do?’ Where would we be?”\n“I'm a reasonable person. And if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I'll listen,” Carson, who has overtaken Donald Trump in polls for the GOP 2016 nomination in the key early-voting state of Iowa, said.\n“In the ideal situation, the mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby. You know, things are set up in such a way that the person in the world who has the greatest interest in protecting the baby is the mother,” Carson said during the wide-ranging interview.\n“We’ve allowed the purveyors of the vision to make mothers think that that baby is their enemy and that they have a right to kill it. Can you see how perverted that line of thinking is,” Carson asked, adding that, “ultimately, I would love to see” Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized many abortions in the U.S., “overturned.”\nCharlie Neibergall/AP Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson greets audience members after speaking at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Carson, surging in many national polls as well, has been no stranger to controversy throughout his upstart campaign. He has, at different times, said people who “go into prison straight” exit gay, compared Obamacare with slavery and claimed that the Holocaust may have been avoided if Jewish people in Europe at that time had more guns — a bizarre remark he again defended Sunday.\n“In the last several weeks, I've heard from many people in the Jewish community, including rabbis, who said, “You’re spot on. You are exactly right.” And I think, you know, some of the people in your business quite frankly who like to try to stir things up and try to make this into a big, horrible thing,” Carson said.\n“Look at the whole context in which I have said that and which I have written about that. I wrote about societies, before tyranny was able to take root, that the tyrants tried to rid the people of the mechanism to defend themselves. So it was said in that context,” he added. “ And I think it is generally agreed that it’s much more difficult to dominate people who are armed than people who are not armed. You know, some people will try to take that and, you know, make it into an anti-Jewish thing, which is foolishness.”\nTags: 2016 election , ben carson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:39:45.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
