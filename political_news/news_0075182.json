Shortly before she began testifying on Friday morning, the Clinton campaign released a statement saying it was not clear why the committee wanted to question Ms. Abedin, because she knew little about the attacks.

A Republican member of the committee, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who attended the interview, said the panel needed to question Ms. Abedin because she was a senior State Department official at the time of the attacks. The committee’s top Democrat, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, gave a lengthy statement to reporters, citing remarks made this month by Republicans — including one by the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California — who said the panel was designed to undermine Mrs. Clinton. “When you have the No. 2 person in the Republican Party who comes forward — the person who makes plans with the speaker, and the person who is one step away from becoming the speaker — to tell you it’s all about a taxpayer-funded political effort to derail the campaign of Hillary Clinton, ladies and gentlemen, that is a problem,” Mr. Cummings said. Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to testify in a public hearing before the panel on Thursday. The committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who has attended many of the interviews conducted with Mrs. Clinton’s closest aides, was not in Washington on Friday and did not address the news media. A day earlier, Mr. Gowdy found himself on the defensive after Representative Richard Hanna, a moderate Republican from upstate New York, told a Utica radio station that Mr. McCarthy had told the truth when he said that a drop in Mrs. Clinton’s poll numbers had been a result of the committee’s work. “Sometimes the biggest sin you can commit in D.C. is to tell the truth,” Mr. Hanna told the radio station. “This may not be politically correct, but I think that there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:15:08.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
