These people are so twisted. Grow up. Thanks from Camelot and goober Location: massachusetts Posts: 4,370 The video was altered, you don't have much when your case is based on something that is altered, like cutting out the parts where the Planned Parenthood person explains that Planned Parenthood cannot profit from harvesting fetal tissue for researchers, that the fees are designed to cover the costs, and that's it, they cut that out.... This is all about someone's imaginary friend, and what they imagine their imaginary friend wants them to do. Last edited by goober; October 10th, 2015 at 07:10 AM . Talent on loan from god Location: Ohio Posts: 17,959 The Republicans have no interest in governing. Why should we be surprised that they've totally politicized Benghazi and Planned Parenthood ? These same people use these despicable tactics on each other. McCarthy just had to step out of the race as Speaker because these cannibals threatened to out his affair with a Tennessee congresswoman. These creeps have no ethics nor right to govern. Posts: 15 think of the faked PP videos as the impetus to have hearings. This is another colluded effort by the same gang that brought you Benghazi #7...The Email Edition. How convenient was it to have the fake videos released right before the Continuing Resolution vote? Defunding of Planned Parenthood became an all so important issue as to shut down the government over? Really? ...and so quickly. This is just more colluded \"misdeeds\" by the GOP. Location: Minnesota Posts: 726 Thing is, what is going on in Congress is a two-pronged attack on the opposition. 1) They want to get control of the White House in 2016, because that will give them control of the Federal Treasury AND the power to turn back the clock on the recent direction of the Supreme Court. 2) They want to gain broader control of the lower house, and take back control of the Senate, by discrediting the opposition in any way they can. And jerking the heart-strings of centrists is one way they believe will accomplish that. It's pretty simple. If all abortion is sanctioned murder of innocent children, and the democratic party supports Planned Parenthood, which helps fund abortions--along with 1,000 other services that women may need but can't afford--then all democrats are accessories to an ongoing infanticide carried out to line the industry's pockets with profit. Abortion doctors are high paid hit-men, and all democrats are paid accomplices. So... if you are a moral person with any sense of right and wrong, if you oppose the slaughter of innocent children for profit, then you are compelled as a matter of conscience to vote Republican and put a stop to the horror. See? That's the thinking. Abortion is the \"silent holocaust\" , and they are on the side of what is morally right. That is how they justify all the shenanigans they are willing to pull to gain support by putting a skewed version their agenda in the public eye. Bandwagon tactics always begin with soliciting a public mandate for change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:19:44.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
