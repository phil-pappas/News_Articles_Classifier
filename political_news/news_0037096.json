(AP) â€” A man who shot and killed an accused car thief in what prosecutors called a case of \"vigilante justice run amok\" has been sentenced to 50 years in prison.\nPierce County prosecutors say 34-year-old Christopher William Olsen was sentenced Friday for the February 2014 killing of 24-year-old Robert Ward .\nOlsen reportedly told two friends that Ward had stolen his truck, prompting the trio to set up a phony drug deal to attack Ward and take the car back.\nBut prosecutors say when Ward arrived Olsen pulled up behind him and started firing shots. As Ward attempted to drive away, Olsen fatally shot him.\nA jury convicted him of first-degree murder earlier this month. Prosecutors say Olsen has 16 prior felony convictions.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:19:54.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
