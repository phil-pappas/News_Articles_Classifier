That trend was a rise in gun purchases, demonstrating that the massive anti-gun propaganda push is entirely backfiring. The more the government makes people feel unsafe due to gun violence and unsafe because of the threat of prohibiting the acquisition of firearms, the more the people are embracing the exercise of the right recognized in our Second Amendment. \nAccording to the Washington Free Beacon , this trend is continuing now: “ September Sees Record Gun Sales .” The Federal Bureau of Investigation processed a record number of background checks in the month of September, indicating that gun sales were at an all time high for the month. The FBI’s National Instant Background Check System processed 1,795,102 applications to buy a firearm in September. That represents a new record: 335,739 more checks than the previous September high set in 2012, or a 23 percent increase. The number of checks done in a particular month is considered a reliable gauge of how many gun sales have occurred since background checks are required on all sales made through licensed firearms dealers. The actual number of sales is likely higher since multiple firearms can be sold to the same person by a dealer under a single background check. The numbers also do not account for sales between private parties that do not require a background check. September is the fifth month in a row to set a record for background checks. May, June, July, and August all produced record numbers. The summer of 2015 has seen the most gun sales on record. \nSo, once again, we see that, despite a concerted campaign to demonize gun ownership and justify gun prohibitionism, the public is not convinced. Every time we have a mass shooting event, or we have politicians braying for mass disarmament in response to a mass shooting event, we find the public buying more guns. \nOn the issue of the Second Amendment, we are obviously on the right side of history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:05:48.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
