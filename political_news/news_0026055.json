From corruption of its senior leaders on more than one account to failure to properly clean up oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, it seems we always hear about what the EPA does wrong. Here's another to add to the list. \nA landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri, (not far from Lambert International Airport in St. Louis) has been burning slowly for the past 5+ years. The EPA has regularly told residents and businesses in the area that there is no reason to worry about negative effects of the fire. Yet school districts an municipalities continue to offer warnings and to hold community meetings to discuss the dangers of this ongoing fire and smoke. \nSince 2010 a slow burning fire has consumed its way towards World War II nuclear material at the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri. Reports have shown that the radioactive waste has already contaminated nearby trees and groundwater on the perimeter of the landfill. Of course the EPA is involved . \nOnce again, the EPA fails to do one of the very things they were created for--to protect the people from the consequences of environmental disaster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:42:14.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
