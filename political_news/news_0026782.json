We hope that transacademia gives people the chance to speak up about the work they're currently doing, whether that's on queer and trans issues or unrelated topics.\" \nTransacademia will include presentations, skillshares, and workshops, and is open to submissions from academics, undergrad, postgrad, and past students. \nTrans on Campus has been active at the University of Auckland since August 2014, and has successfully campaigned on issues such as bathroom access and the university's preferred name system. \nThe symposium is happening as part of Transgender Week of Awareness, an event co-hosted by Trans on Campus, Rainbow Youth, and GenderBridge. The week runs from the 14th to the 20th of November, with transacademia on the Wednesday the 18th. \nTransgender Week of Awareness Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/1510914555894181/ \nTransacademia Facebook Event:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:19:28.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
