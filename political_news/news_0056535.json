Besides them, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lodged cases against seven private firms, RK Associates Pvt Ltd, Satyam Caterers Pvt Ltd, Ambuj Hotel and Real Estate, PK Associates Pvt Ltd, Sunsine Pvt Ltd, Brandavan Food and Food World. \nThe two accused rail officials held the position of Chief Commercial Manager, had showed undue favour to these firms in supply of inferior packaged drinking water rather than Rail Neer, a compulsory component of premium trains. \nThe Railway Board had ordered IRCTC provide Rail Neer at Rs 10.50 per bottle to private caterers and that they be paid Rs 15 per bottle for supplying the same to passengers (in premium trains). \nHowever, to take undue advantage, private suppliers were allegedly supplying cheap packaged water, other than Rail Neer, at the rate of Rs 5.70 to Rs 7 per bottle, thereby making a killing for themselves and loss to the exchequer. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:36:43.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
