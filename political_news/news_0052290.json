Photo: Andrew Meares\nTurnbull government unveils changes to question time What better and more virtuous way to slow down national politics and take it off the front pages than to localise it, to bring representatives closer to real people while turning the hyper-combative question time into more of a parish-pump session?\nIt may not be his only motivation, but you can bet Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull regards making Parliament more parochial and thus reducing its \"reportability'' as a collateral advantage of changes that can otherwise be paraded as making it more responsive and accountable.\nIn the end, what Mr Turnbull has proposed isn't much. Photo: Andrew Meares\nHis government on Tuesday unveiled plans to dedicate the second half of the daily 75-minute session (once Parliament is sitting again from November 9) to genuine \"constituent\" questions. These would replace the scripted Dorothy Dixer questions passed to backbenchers by the very ministers who then answer them.\nAdvertisement Backbenchers would put actual questions-without-notice to ministers during the section of the parliamentary day bearing that name. They could focus on problems in their own electorates, and cover anything from obtaining funds for a notorious level crossing, to reducing local crime, or helping a struggling industry.\nTurnbull correctly judges that the pantomime of confected outrage and faux scrutiny, to which his predecessor was so committed, has been a big turn-off in the lounge-rooms of Australia.\nThe Liberal National Party's Ewen Jones looks pleased after asking a Dorothy Dixer on Tuesday. Photo: Andrew Meares\nIt may even be the enemy of social harmony and a dampener of consumer and investor confidence.\nYet for all its feel-good attractions, what has Turnbull really proposed?\nThe answer is, not much. There is no change needed to the parliamentary standing orders and thus no reason why he cannot simply invite his backbenchers to free-form right now.\nThe opposition will not be bound by the changes either, meaning it can either continue using its frontbench heavies to probe the government, or it can also wheel out more backbenchers.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-21T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:50:23.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
