The nine justices will be hearing arguments concerning gay marriage restrictions imposed in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, four of the 13 states that still outlaw such marriages. \nA group of 64 legal experts and scholars have signed a statement calling on Americans to oppose the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. \nThe Washington, DC-based American Principles Project posted the legal experts' statement Thursday on their website in which they denounced the 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges . \n\"The Court's majority opinion eschewed reliance on the text, logic, structure, or original understanding of the Constitution, as well as the Court's own interpretative doctrines and precedents, and supplied no compelling reasoning to show why it is unjustified for the laws of the states to sustain marriage as it has been understood for millennia as the union of husband and wife,\" declared the statement. \n\"The opinion for the Court substituted for traditional — and sound — methods of constitutional interpretation a new and ill-defined jurisprudence of identity — one that abused the moral concept of human dignity. The four dissenting justices are right to reject the majority opinion in unsparing terms.\" (Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst) A protester, angry with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last week that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to wed, carries a sign in front of the court building in Washington June 29, 2015. County clerks in Texas who object to gay marriage can refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite last week's landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling requiring states to allow same-sex marriage, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Sunday. \nQuoting James Madison and Abraham Lincoln regarding their views on the Supreme Court, the legal experts argued that \"all federal and state officeholders\" should \"refuse to accept Obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case.\" \n\"To recognize the authority of states to define marriage, and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions,\" continued the statement. \n\"[All federal and state officeholders should] open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which Americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evident in Obergefell .\" Free Sign Up CP Newsletter!
