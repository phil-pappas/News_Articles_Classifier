Price rises aside, the Collection has grown the scope of its red wine offers (all 2013), adding Bin 169 Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon at $350, Bin 150 Marananga Shiraz $80, Bin 8 Cabernet Shiraz $45, Bin 9 Cabernet Sauvignon $30, and the revived Bin 2 Shiraz Mataro $30.\nBut there is another side to Penfolds’ reputation as Australia’s foremost maker of red wines, all indelibly stamped with a house style built on a triptych of fruit, oak and tannins. It stemmed from a decision by former CEO Ross Wilson that there should be a white wine to stand alongside Grange. The focus group research that followed included a convocation of wine writers assembled from all parts of Australia to consider the claims of semillon, riesling and chardonnay. Despite the greater longevity of top class semillon and riesling, the choice fell on chardonnay. In retrospect it might seem blindingly obvious, but back then the devil was in the detail.\nThe first vintages of Reserve Bin A Chardonnay and Yattarna were 1994 and ’95 respectively, and the Penfolds winemaking team learnt rapidly over the following years. While Yattarna (like Grange) is not entered in wine shows, Reserve Bin A Chardonnay, Bin 311 Tumbarumba Chardonnay and Bin 51 Eden Valley Riesling are, Reserve Bin A with an outstanding show career. No chance of all the eggs in the one Bin.\n2014 Penfolds Reserve Bin A Adelaide Hills Chardonnay\nHand-picked and pressed straight to French barriques (82% new); wild fermentation and 9 months’ maturation. The impact of the bouquet is immediate, with a perfectly judged struck match/flint; the palate takes it to another plane; imperious drive and tenacity to its unsweetened grapefruit and white peach flavours. 12.5% alc, screwcap. 97 points, drink to 2024, $100\n2012 Penfolds St Henri Shiraz\nIncludes 3% cabernet, the grapes from Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale, Adelaide Hills, Robe and Clare Valley; 13 months in 50yo oak vats (1460l). A chequerboard of savoury/smoky black fruits; firm but polished tannins. A great St Henri that will come into its own in 10 years’ time. 14.5% alc, screwcap. 96 points, drink to 2047, $100\n2013 Penfolds Bin 28 Kalimna Shiraz\nSourced from the Barossa, McLaren Vale, Padthaway and Langhorne Creek; matured 12 months in used American hogsheads. Deep colour, rich bouquet with licorice, spice, dark chocolate and blackberry. Savoury/inky/graphite impact on the very long, balanced medium to full-bodied palate. Could be one of the great Bin 28s. 14.5% alc, screwcap. 94 points, drink to 2033, $40", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:56:57.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
