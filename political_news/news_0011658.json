Hall October 15 Follow @KevinH_PhD\nObesity has been on the rise worldwide for decades, putting people at risk for developing diabetes, heart disease and several forms of cancer. Today, two thirds of adults and one third of children in the United States are overweight or obese . As the numbers on the scale get bigger, so does the diet and weight-loss industry, which is now worth tens of billions of dollars. What doesn’t seem to be increasing, though, is people’s understanding of obesity and how to lose weight. Here are a few of the myths clouding the facts.\nKevin D. Hall is a Senior Investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, where he is Chief of the Integrative Physiology Section and creator of the NIH Body Weight Planner. 1 . Body mass index is useless.\nThe body mass index, or BMI, is a simple and widely used method for classifying whether a person is overweight or obese. It’s calculated by dividing a person’s body weight by height squared, which helps account for the fact that taller people weigh disproportionately more than shorter people if they have the same percentage of body fat.\nBMI is often criticized because it doesn’t differentiate muscle from fat. Muscular people can therefore erroneously be classified as overweight, such as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo , whose BMI makes him borderline obese.\nIs your body mass index a useful measurement? Kevin Hall, creator of the NIH Body Weight Planner, dispels some myths about shedding pounds. (The Washington Post) But despite its limitations and notorious counter-examples, BMI is highly related to body fat and correctly categorizes people as having excess body fat more than 80 percent of the time. Additional simple measurements such as waist circumference may be even more informative because they provide information about where fat is distributed in the body.\n2 . All people with obesity are unhealthy.\nThe idea that people with obesity can’t be healthy has been repeated widely. CNN told readers that there’s “ no such thing ” as healthy obesity. Forbes called it “a myth.” “You can’t be fit and fat,” Time reported .\nBut in reality, fat’s location in the body may be more important for health than the total amount of fat. People who are “pear-shaped” tend to store fat in their buttocks and flanks and are at less risk of disease than those who are “apple-shaped” and tend to accumulate fat around the belly. Especially bad is the “visceral fat” around the organs as well as the fat in the liver. So being obese but pear-shaped may be less risky than being overweight or normal weight but apple-shaped, which carries the increased proportion of visceral and liver fat. This realization has led to the recent concept of “ metabolically healthy obesity .”\nGenetics primarily determine where fat is stored in the body. Men, especially those with South Asian ethnic backgrounds, have a greater proportion of the dangerous visceral fat than women. Targeting the loss of body fat from one region to another is difficult, but overall weight loss results in", "external_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm", "http://healthland.time.com/2013/12/02/you-cant-be-fit-and-fat/", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/5209/tony-romo", "http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/03/study-theres-no-such-thing-as-healthy-obesity/", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/561ffd03e4b0f67134939ae6/20151015_weightloss_myths.jpg", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2015/01/06/is-healthy-obesity-a-real-thing-not-likely-study-says/", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/summer-of-science-2015/latest/how-often-is-bmi-misleading?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur", "http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/overweight-and-healthy-the-concept-of-metabolically-healthy-obesity-201309246697", "http://www.livescience.com/39097-bmi-not-accurate-health-measure.html", "https://twitter.com/@KevinH_PhD"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:55:36.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
