Syrian Vulnerable Persons scheme Launched in January 2014, the Syrian Vulnerable Persons scheme is the first resettlement programme run by the UK to target support for refugees specifically on the basis of their vulnerability. So far we have taken 216 people to date under the scheme, which is based on need rather than fulfilling a quota. Gateway Gateway, together with UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees), is one of the oldest and largest resettlement programmes in the EU. The current commitment is to resettle 750 refugees per year - usually people who have been displaced for more than 5 years. Mandate Mandate has operated since 1995. It's designed to resettle individual refugees from anywhere in the world if they: have been recognised as refugees by UNHCR, and judged by them to be in need of resettlement have a close family member in the UK who is willing to accommodate them Aid The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the Syria crisis. The Prime Minister announced a further £100 million on 4 September, taking our total contribution to over £1 billion since 2012 to help vulnerable people in Syria and refugees in the region. In addition, DFID has allocated £9.5 million from the UK Conflict, Stability and Security Fund to support local capacity and build longer term stability. Our support is reaching millions of people and has saved lives in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. On 14 September the Prime Minister visited Lebanon and Jordan to see the impact of UK aid in the region. He also announced the appointment of a new minister to coordinate work across government to resettle Syrian refugees in the UK. as well as new education funding for refugees in Lebanon.

HMS Enterprise remains in the Mediterranean alongside the Border Force cutters and together with HMS Bulwark, they have now rescued more than 6,700 people. The Prime Minister said: Britain will act with our head and our heart, providing refuge for those in need while working on long term solutions to this crisis. As I said earlier in the week, that means bringing to an end to the conflicts that are driving so many to flee, including the bloodbath that has engulfed Syria.
