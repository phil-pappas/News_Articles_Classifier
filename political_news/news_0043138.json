The New York-based company was recently mailed a component of a zoning questionnaire from Pocono Township that they must complete and file with the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, township secretary Pam Finkbeiner said. The file is one of a few the company must complete with the township’s zoning board in order to complete its planning module and move on to more tangible steps. “We don’t even have a land development plan in yet,” Finkbeiner said. “It’s just one piece of paper in a large process.” The project is still due for traffic studies and other tests as the company prepares to meet with the township commission at a meeting on Monday, Oct. 19. The meeting will be at the Northampton Community College Monroe Campus. Finkbeiner said the township’s council meeting on Tuesday night, which included an update on the potential redevelopment project, was not “anything special.” She acknowledged that, as in previous discussions regarding Spa Castle, there was a group in opposition and a group in favor. The primary public concern for the project has been in the growing volume of Route 611 traffic and the additional affects construction of a tourist location would add to it. Spa Castle representatives speculated in June the attraction would add 5,500 vehicles daily to current traffic. However, Finkbeiner attributed these current issues to the ongoing road maintenance construction on the highway.
