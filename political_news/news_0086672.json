Today it gave its final advice on the proposed changes to the TB Plan to the Minister for Primary Industries, Hon Nathan Guy. The changes build on the significant progress made by OSPRI under the current TB Plan. \nThe Plan Governance Group considered a range of technical and scientific advice, and strongly believes that the eradication of TB from New Zealand is both feasible and economically justifiable. The proposed changes to the TB Plan were consulted on with farmers, local communities, and other stakeholders in June and July this year. Over 400 quality submissions, covering a wide range of issues, were received on the draft Plan proposal, and the Plan Governance Group took them into account as it prepared its final proposal to the Minister. \nChris Kelly, the independent Chair of the Plan Governance Group, says, “We were pleased that most submitters supported our proposed amendments to the TB Plan. We have proposed that the TBPlan should focus on eradicating bovine tuberculosis from the country, with farmed cattle and deer being clear of the disease within around a decade. It will take longer to clear TB from possums and other vectors in remote back country, but it is important that our farming sector can be rid of this serious disease as fast as possible”. \nAfter the Minister makes his decision on the Plan proposal, it will be available on the tbplanreview.co.nz website, along with all the supporting material such as the submissions analysis. If the Minister agrees with the proposal, the amended TB Plan is expected to come into effect on 1st July 2016. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:27:23.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
