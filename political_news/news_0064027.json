Our leading candidate is now suggesting we allow Russia to destroy ISIL. That we're outsourcing the defense of the American homeland to Putin. That's beyond crazy.\"\nTrump has repeatedly said that the U.S. should let Russia fight ISIS.\n\"The one thing I can tell you is Mr. Trump's statements about Afghanistan, his statements about ISIL are chillingly dangerous to me.
