Claire Cohen explains why her intervention was a mistake Donald and Ivanka Trump Photo: Getty By Claire Cohen , Deputy Women's Editor 8:00AM BST 17 Oct 2015 Comments \n“There was blood coming out of her eyes; blood coming out of her wherever”. \nThese now notorious words were spoken by Donald Trump back in August, after Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly hauled him over the coals in the first Republican debate of the US Presidential race. \nThe world largely agreed: Trump was implying that Kelly’s tough questioning was down to her being on her period . Classy. \nFast-forward a few weeks and 69-year-old Trump was at it again, this time about his rival Carly Fiorina : \n“Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?” he blasted. \"Can you imagine that, the face of our next next president? I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?\" \nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina Photo: AP \nIt would take a tough woman to defend the billionaire businessman in the face of such overwhelming sexism . \nStep forward Ivanka Trump: his 33-year old daughter. \nThis week, Ivanka spoke to CNN and attempted to shake off her father’s words, largely by blaming the press (because reporting someone’s actual sexist words is all our fault, natch). \n\"I think a lot of the sensationalism around this was orchestrated largely by the media,” she explained. \"It’s one step removed from the betrayed wife, standing silently by her husband as he apologises for a sexual indiscretion.\" \n\"Look, my father is very blunt. He's very direct. He is not gender specific in his criticism of people, and people that he doesn't particularly like or people that he does like but thinks they're wrong on a particular issue. \n\"So I don't think that he's gender-targeted at all. Like I said, I wouldn't be the person I am today, I wouldn't be a high-level executive within his organisation if he felt that way.\" \nReally? This from the offspring of the man who once said: “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.” And told Rolling Stone magazine last month : \"Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...\" \nShudder. \nDonald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Photo: Getty \nI always find it rather sad, mortifying even, when a daughter feels she has to publicly stand up for her father. It’s just one step removed from the image of the betrayed wife, standing silently by her husband as he apologises for a sexual indiscretion. \nYet it happens again and again. Sepp Blatter’s daughter Corinne, jumped to his defence in the wake of the Fifa corruption allegations earlier this year, calling it a ‘conspiracy’. She said: “Nobody is without fault but all the things he has done so far, he's not the person who is taking money.” \nWhile Bob Diamond’s daughter Nell defended the former Barclay’s chief on social media in 2012, following his resignation after the Libor scandal. \n‘George Osborne and Ed Miliband can #HMD’ she tweeted (that’s ‘hold my d***’ for the uninitiated), before swiftly deleting the message. \nHere, at least, was an unvarnished, territorial roar. A tiger daughter prepared to speak up for her dad, regardless of his actions. What it lacked in finesse, it made up for in honesty. \n&lt;noframe&gt;Twitter: Nell Diamond - George Osborne and Ed Miliband you can go ahead and &lt;a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=HMD\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;#HMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noframe&gt; \nIvanka’s response this week was altogether different. Hers was a polished performance, perfectly in line with her conservative persona. \nPerhaps it was an inevitability of her position at the forefront of her father’s Presidential campaign – she was on stage when The Donald announced he was running and is reportedly his go-to sounding board. \nWhile his supermodel wife Melania stays in the shadows, it’s Ivanka who’s chosen to take a more prominent role. \nFormer supermodel Melania Trump Photo: Rex \nAnd she does have a choice. After all, Ivanka hasn’t always played the Trump game. In a family where fierce loyalty and American apple-pie positivity reign, she’s the one who has broken ranks and spoken openly about her childhood and her parent’s divorce, which was plastered all over the newspapers at the time ( ‘The best sex I ever had’ screamed the New York Post ). \n“You can’t control for other 12-year-old girls bringing a copy of the newspaper to school. People knew. They heard their parents talking about it at the breakfast table, so they would ask me,” Ivanka told Politico recently. “I actually view it, all in all, as a thing that obviously was negative.” \"It’s a tough sell: hearing a woman who claims to be set on shattering female stereotypes defend this man.\" \nHere, then, was a glimmer of humanity behind the glittering Trump façade – how refreshing that seemed in contrast to her CNN interview. \nWhen asked what her father would do for women as President, she said this week: “He'd be amazing ... He's starting to articulate his positions; it's not my place to articulate those for him. I'm not part of the campaign. I'm very busy, and he has kept me very busy, working alongside my brothers.\" \nIt was a politician’s answer, one that did neither Trump much credit. It made Donald seem too grand to personally climb down over his sexist comments and suggested hypocrisy where Ivanka is concerned. \nIvanka Trump After all, she’s a supposed woman’s woman. When not doing business, Ivanka runs an initiative aimed at changing perceptions of modern working women. \nIt’s a pretty tough sell: hearing a woman who claims to be set on shattering female stereotypes defend the man who once said Arianna Huffington was “unattractive both inside and out\". . @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:26:20.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
