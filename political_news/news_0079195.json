One of his very best.\nEnjoy.\n“One day a canoe touched at the island. A good-looking foreigner landed. He tasted and commended very much the produce of [Robinson Crusoe’s] garden, and before taking leave of his entertainers, spoke as follows:\n“‘Generous islanders, I inhabit a country where game is much more plentiful than here, but where horticulture is quite unknown. It would be an easy matter to bring you every evening four baskets of game, if you will give me in exchange two baskets of vegetables.’ ”\n“At these words Robinson and Friday retired to consult, and the debate that took place is too interesting not to be reported in extenso.\n“FRIDAY: What do you think of it?\n“ROBINSON: If we accept the proposal, we are ruined.\n“F.: Are you sure of that? Let us consider.\n“R.: The case is clear. Crushed by competition, our hunting as a branch of industry is annihilated.\n“F.: What matters it, if we have the game?\n“R.: Theory! It will no longer be the product of our labor.\n“F.: I beg your pardon, sir; for in order to have game we must\npart with vegetables.\n“R.: Then, what shall we gain?\n“F.: The four baskets of game cost us six hours’ work. The foreigner gives us them in exchange for two baskets of vegetables, which cost us only three hours’ work. This places three hours at our disposal.\n“R.: Say, rather, which are subtracted from our exertions. There is our loss. Labor is wealth, and if we lose a fourth part of our time we shall be less rich by a fourth.\n“F.: You are greatly mistaken, my good friend. We shall have as much game, and the same quantity of vegetables, and three hours at our disposal into the bargain. This is progress, or there is no such thing in the world.\n“R.: You lose yourself in generalities! What should we make of these three hours?\n“F.: We would do something else.\n“R.: Ah! I understand you. You cannot come to particulars.\nSomething else, something else—that is easily said.\n“F.: We can fish, we can ornament our cottage, we can read the Bible.\n“R.: Utopia! Is there any certainty that we should do either the one or the other?\n“F.: Very well, if we have no wants to satisfy we can rest. Is repose nothing?\n“R.: But while we repose we may die of hunger.\n“F.: My dear friend, you have got into a vicious circle. I speak of a repose which will subtract nothing from our supply of game and vegetables. You always forget that by means of our foreign trade nine hours’ labor will give us the same quantity of provisions that we obtain at present with twelve.\n“R.: It is very evident, Friday, that you have not been educated in Europe, and that you have never read the Moniteur Industriel . If you had, it would have taught you this: that all time saved is sheer loss. The important thing is not to eat or consume, but to work. All that we consume, if it is not the direct produce of our labor, goes for nothing. Do you want to know whether you are rich? Never consider the enjoyments you obtain, but the labor you undergo. This is what the Moniteur Industriel would teach you. For myself, who have no pretensions to be a theorist, the only thing I look at is the loss of our hunting.\n“F.: What a strange turning upside down of ideas! But . . .\n“R.: No buts. Moreover, there are political reasons for rejecting the interested offers of the perfidious foreigner.\n“F.: Political reasons!\n“R.: Yes, he only makes us these offers because they are advantageous to him.\n“F.: So much the better, since they are for our advantage likewise.\n“R.: Then by this traffic we should place ourselves in a situation of dependence upon him.\n“F.: And he would place himself in dependence on us. We should have need of his game, and he of our vegetables, and we should live on terms of friendship.\n“R.: System! Do you want me to shut your mouth?\n“F.: We shall see about that. I have as yet heard no good reason.\n“R.: Suppose the foreigner learns to cultivate a garden, and that his island should prove more fertile than ours. Do you see the consequence?\n“F.: Yes; our relations with the foreigner would cease. He would take from us no more vegetables, since he could have them at home with less labor. He would bring us no more game, since we should have nothing to give him in exchange, and we should then be in precisely the situation that you wish us in now.\n“R.: Improvident savage! You don’t see that after having annihilated our hunting by inundating us with game, he would annihilate our gardening by inundating us with vegetables.\n“F.: But this would only last so long as we were in a situation to give him something else; that is to say, so long as we found something else that we could produce with economy of labor for ourselves.\n“R.: Something else, something else! You always come back to that. You are at sea, my good friend Friday; there is nothing practical in your views.\n“The debate was long prolonged, and, as often happens, each remained wedded to his own opinion. But Robinson possessing a great influence over Friday, his opinion prevailed, and when the foreigner arrived to demand a reply, Robinson said to him:\n“ ‘Stranger, in order to induce us to accept your proposal, we must be assured of two things:\n“ ‘The first is, that your island is no better stocked with game than ours, for we want to fight only with equal weapons.\n“‘The second is that you will lose by the bargain. For, as in every exchange there is necessarily a gaining and a losing party, we should be dupes, if you were not the loser. What have you got to say?’”\n“ ‘Nothing,’ replied the foreigner; and, bursting out laughing, he got back into his canoe.”", "external_links": ["http://www.sabhlokcity.com/2015/09/not-all-french-economist-are-like-piketty-they-have-some-super-smart-ones-like-bastiat-as-well/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:40:21.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
