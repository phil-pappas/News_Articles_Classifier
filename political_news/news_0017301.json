Over that time, the CIA has trained an estimated 10,000 fighters, although the number still fighting with so-called moderate forces is unclear.\nMore @ Zero Hedge", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dfe1547ba36f4f968deee227d467dc08/officials-russian-bombs-cia-rebels-had-syrian-gains", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-10/damascus-debacle-how-cia-handed-over-syria-putin-silver-platter", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-03/largest-us-foreign-policy-blunder-vietnam-complete-iran-readies-massive-syrian-groun", "http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/putin_against_obama_stupid_bin.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:46:47.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
