Corker considering subpoena for Kerry", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Sen. Bob Corker is considering issuing a subpoena for Secretary of State John Kerry, reflecting growing frustration among Republicans that Kerry is stonewalling the panel in an effort to avoid testifying about the Syrian civil war. Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations committee, also alleges the State Department isn't being truthful about Kerry’s schedule to avoid a panel appearance.\nCorker (R-Tenn.) has been trying to secure a Kerry visit to discuss the brutal Syrian civil war for more than a week, sources said, but the chairman now claims that Kerry won’t return his phone calls, wants to send “underlings” to testify in his stead and is sending Congress signals that he is out of town when he is not.\nNow, Corker says he’s mulling more serious action.\n“I don’t know what steps to take, subpoenaing a secretary of state is certainly an extraordinary step and one that needs to be thought about,” Corker said at an unrelated committee business meeting on Thursday. \"I don't know what to do when you have the biggest crisis, people flooding into Europe, 100 percent change taking place on the ground.”\nThe GOP chairman has worked closely with the administration and Senate Democrats on processing some of Kerry’s nominees through his panel and has worked in tandem with the White House on several legislative initiatives, like a State Department reauthorization and expanding utilities in Africa. But Corker sharply rebuked Kerry in July over the Iran deal, saying he got “fleeced” in the negotiations with Tehran, and the Tennessee Republican ended up becoming one of the nuclear agreements biggest opponents after biting his tongue for weeks.\nKasich's Ohio approval rating hits record high By Nick Gass\nNow, it appears that Corker and Kerry’s relationship is getting even chillier, as Corker and other committee members seek more information about Russia and Iran’s role in Syria as well as the exodus of Syrian refugees from Kerry.\n“We heard this week he was out of town, but I know that not to be true. I know he’s meeting with people today at the State Department,” Corker said of Kerry. “Therefore we asked that he come next week. Won’t return phone calls. And underlings have been suggested to come up and talk with us … for the secretary of state to be unwilling to come here, I find very problematic, especially with a committee like ours that has worked with the administration in the manner that we all have in a very bipartisan way.”\nA State Department official did not immediately return a request for comment. The Senate is scheduled to be on recess next week.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:46:29.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
