(AP) â€” Washington State University has launched a new program designed to help more students pay for college.\nUnder the program, more than 400 students can open a savings account with an interest rate of up to 400 percent and use the funds to pay for college.\nStudents who save $1,000 throughout the year will receive $4,000 in matching funds. All the money will go toward educational expenses at WSU.\nThe program is open to 85 students per year over five years. Matching funds will be provided by WSU under a $1 million federal grant.\nThe program is designed to boost student retention among low-income students.\nWSU says it is the first college in the country to develop this student retention model.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:34:42.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
