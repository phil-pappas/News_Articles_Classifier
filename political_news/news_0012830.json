But campaign finance reports released this week reveal one indulgence they can't seem to live without – chartered jets. In the third quarter alone, private jet costs totaled more than $2.5 million, according to POLITICO's analysis.\nJeb Bush, whose campaign recently proclaimed it was cutting back, was by far the biggest spender on luxury air travel. His campaign spent nearly $1 million on private flights from July to September, the analysis shows.\nAlthough Bush used a variety of companies, his favorite by far was Air Charter Team, a company that bills itself as delivering “white glove service.”\nHow much the 2016 contenders have raised By Kyle Cheney\nBush beat out billionaire Donald Trump by about $200,000, the reports show, with the Republican real estate mogul spending about $726,000 on charter flights. Trump owns the company he flies with, Tag Air Inc., and often talks about his extravagant 757. The jet includes two bedrooms, a shower and gold-plated seat belt buckles and bathroom faucets, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign shelled out nearly $560,000 to Executive Fliteways a private charter company that has bases at multiple New York airports. While the number isn't huge compared to her giant fundraising haul and $33 million in cash on hand, Clinton's rate of spending could be a concern over the long-haul, according to a POLITICO analysis of the numbers. Both she and Bush have a burn rate of approximately 85 percent.\nConservative super PAC America Rising slammed Clinton’s use of charter flights, noting that campaign earlier touted its use of cheap buses to save campaign money.\n“Clinton spent $559,653.22 on Executive Fliteways, her preferred private jet company. That’s 933 times more on private jets than on Bolt Bus ($599),” a press release said.\nThe PAC was referring to Bolt Bus, a budget transportation company that the campaign said it utilized to cut costs. Chairman John Podesta was profiled taking a Vamoose bus between New York and Washington to prove the campaign was cutting costs. According to her filings, Clinton spent thousands on bus companies combined.\nFormer America Rising spokesman Tim Miller, who is now Bush's communications director, and a spokesman for the Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to comment.\nMinutes after Bush’s SEC filing was released Thursday, Marco Rubio’s campaign fired off a press release pointing out his smart spending. The campaign touted its use of budget airlines and the ride service UberX and said that he had more cash on hand than Bush.\nBut Rubio wasn’t always flying in the cramped middle seat – he spent nearly $270,000 on chartered flights. Most of it went to a company called EJCR LLC DBA Advanced Aviation Team, but he also spent $13,000 with a charter service run by Koch Industries.\nA Rubio spokeswoman did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nRick Perry, who exited the presidential race in early September, spent $125,000 on charters while he was still in the race.\nSen. Lindsey Graham was the only candidate who won't indulge.\n“There are excellent commercial flights right into Manchester,” Graham press secretary Brittany Bramell said to Politico referring to the New Hampshire city.\nAll totals represent approximate sums based on self-reported numbers.\nNoah Weiland and Christina Animashaun contributed.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/09/how-cheap-is-hillary-clintons-campaign-this-cheap/", "https://www.americarisingpac.org/clinton-2016-a-poll-driven-private-jet-flying-campaign-funded-by-her-enemies/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-big-boost-his-own-air-fleet-1441382605"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:09:18.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
