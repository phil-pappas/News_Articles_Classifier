Go Back to Tehran.” \nT he roots of Russia’s bold intervention in Syria—which began in earnest on Wednesday with airstrikes against opponents of President Bashar al-Assad’s government near the city of Homs—extend to the beginning of the Arab Spring in early 2011, when Vladimir Putin served as prime minister nominally under his protégé and hand-picked successor, Dmitri Medvedev. Many in Russia and beyond had placed in Medvedev their hopes for a steady, if slow, political transition away from Putin’s authoritarian instincts during his two terms as president. Putin seemed even to have retreated from the day-to-day business of the state, especially in foreign affairs. The uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, however, disturbed Putin profoundly. So did Medvedev’s handling of yet another American-led military operation in the region. Russia’s abstention from the United Nations Security Council vote authorizing the use of military force to stop the slaughter in Libya in 2011 forced Putin’s hand and set the stage for his return to the presidency the next year—and a far more confrontational posture to the United States and Europe, one that resonates in the Russian bombs exploding in Syria today. *** \nOnly days before his trip to Davos in January 2011 for the annual conference there, Dmitri Medvedev had pushed a new nuclear arms agreement he had negotiated with Barack Obama through the Duma. It was a sign that the “reset” in relations that the Americans had sought with Russia was beginning to bear fruit in the three years in which Medvedev had served, formally at least, as Russia’s most powerful official. While in Switzerland, he pledged to revive the talks to enter the World Trade Organization that his temperamental predecessor, Vladimir Putin, had upended unexpectedly in 2009 after negotiators had nearly cinched the deal. With the election of a new parliament scheduled for the end of the year and the presidential election three months after that, Medvedev increasingly presented a competing path for the future, and the insiders in the Kremlin and the government gravitated either toward his or toward Putin’s. Story Continued Below \nThe first question Medvedev faced at the Davos conference was one he had not addressed in his remarks—and one that would prove decisive. It was about the Arab Spring, which had begun in Tunis in December 2010 and inspired protests that swept through the Arab world, toppling Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and threatening Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya. Medvedev replied not only that he recognized the democratic aspirations of the thousands who had poured into Tunisia’s streets to protest corruption, poverty and lack of political rights, but also that governments had a responsibility to address those grievances. He went on to emphasize the importance of the relationship between governed and government in ways that could have applied equally to Russia, where the will of the people had been managed out of the electoral process. “When governments fail to keep up with social change and fail to meet people’s hopes, disorganization and chaos ensue, sadly,” Medvedev said, apparently warming to the theme. “This is a problem of governments themselves and the responsibility they bear. Even if governments in power find many of the demands made unacceptable they still must remain in dialogue with all the different groups because otherwise they lose their real foundation.” \nThe protests in the Arab world had galvanized Russia’s beleaguered opposition, at least in the still safe space of the Internet, and Medvedev’s remarks sounded sympathetic to things that Putin feared most. Medvedev, while hardly endorsing protests at home, sounded irresolute. The American vice president, Joseph Biden, even had the audacity to quote him during a speech at Moscow State University in March 2011, in which he declared that Russians should have the same rights as anyone else. “Most Russians want to choose their national and local leaders in competitive elections,” Biden said in what amounted to an endorsement in the undeclared campaign taking shape. “They want to be able to assemble freely, and they want a media to be independent of the state. And they want to live in a country that fights corruption. That’s democracy. They’re the ingredients of democracy. So I urge all of you students here: Don’t compromise on the basic elements of democracy. You need not make that Faustian bargain.” \nBehind the scenes, Biden used his visit to press Medvedev to support a United Nations Security Council resolution to authorize a military intervention in Libya, where peaceful protests had turned into an armed insurrection against the country’s dictator, Muammar al-Qaddafi. The United States, its NATO allies, and some Arab nations wanted to establish a “no fly” zone over the country to prevent the bloody suppression of the rebels. Medvedev agreed, persuaded by the humanitarian case for intervention, despite the opposition of the Foreign Ministry and other security officials who saw the prospect of a NATO-led campaign outside its border as an extension of American hegemony to another part of the world. He had drifted dangerously far from Putin’s path, making a confrontation seem inevitable. \nOnly weeks before, Putin had warned that the uprisings in Libya and other countries would fuel the rise of Islamic extremists allied with al-Qaeda, aided and abetted by shortsighted sympathizers in the West trying to overthrow autocratic leaders. He was not wrong about the rise in extremism, which would later consume Libya and exacerbate a grinding civil war in Syria, a far more important ally of Russia in the Middle East. Putin’s support for the autocratic dictators of Libya and Syria was widely viewed through the prism of Russia’s geopolitical interests, including energy projects and a contract to build a railway linking Libya’s coastal cities (negotiated by Putin’s friend, Vladimir Yakunin), massive arms sales and, in the case of Syria, Russia’s only military base outside the former Soviet Union. In truth, his wariness ran much deeper. There existed a dark association in his mind between aspirations for democracy and the rise of radicalism, between elections and the chaos that would inevitably result. “Let’s take a look back at history, if you don’t mind,” Putin said in Brussels in February. “Where did Khomeini, the mastermind of the Iranian revolution, live? He lived in Paris. And he was supported by most of Western society. And now the West is facing the Iranian nuclear program. I remember our partners calling for fair, democratic elections in the Palestinian territories. Excellent! Those elections were won by Hamas.” Reflexively, instinctively, he imagined the uprising in Libya as simply another step toward a revolution being orchestrated for Moscow. \nPerhaps it was because he was younger, perhaps because he never served in the security services, perhaps because of his convivial nature, but Medvedev did not share this bleak distrust of the West, of democracy, of human nature. He had spent the first three years of his presidency wooed by Barack Obama’s administration, and now not only the United States but countries with much closer relations to Russia, including France and Italy, were appealing to him to help prevent a slaughter of civilians in Libya. And so, on his instruction, Russia abstained when the Security Council voted on United Nations Resolution 1973 on March 17, authorizing the use of military force to stop Qaddafi’s forces from moving on the insurgents’ stronghold in eastern Libya. \nMedvedev’s decision provoked a revolt among Russia’s diplomats and security officials. Russia’s ambassador to Libya, Vladimir Chamov, sent a cable to the president warning against the loss of an important ally. Medvedev fired him, but the ambassador returned to Moscow and declared publicly that the president was acting against Russia’s interests. When NATO launched its first airstrikes two days later—a far more punishing initial barrage to destroy the country’s air defenses than many expected—Medvedev seemed to many in Russia to be complicit in yet another American-led war. ***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:38:38.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
