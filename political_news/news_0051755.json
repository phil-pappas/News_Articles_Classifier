Additionally, a GMO-free certification program will provide consumers who choose to purchase non-GMO items a reliable means of doing so.\nThe fly-in, organized by the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, featured men and women from 22 states who represent the entirety of the nation's food supply chain: farming groups, co-ops, seed producers and food companies. In total, the group had more than 140 meetings on Capitol Hill Wednesday.\nParticipants in the fly-in expressed the urgent need for action by the Senate soon on the critical issue.\nDelaware farmers rely on GMOs to help them grow more crops on less land while using fewer pesticides, less irrigation and limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In 2014, 93 percent of the corn and 94 percent of the soybeans grown in Delaware were genetically modified.\n\"As a soybean farmer, I've been using genetically modified seeds for nearly two decades because they are a safe way of improving agricultural yields while still protecting natural resources,\" said Richard Wilkins , first vice president of the American Soybean Association and a farmer from Greenwood , DE. \"I told member of Congress that foods made with my crops should be labeled accurately and consistently in Delaware , Maryland and Pennsylvania and all 50 states and in every grocery store in the country. To do that, we need them to pass a uniform, national food labeling standard this year.\"\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act in July by a significant 275-150 bipartisan vote, with 45 Democrats voting yes. That legislation would ensure that consumers have access to the same science-based information regardless of which state they shop in instead of different state mandates. It would also create a national GMO-free certification program that would provide consumers who prefer GMO-free foods a consistent means of identifying those products.\nThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is committed to passing a reasonable, common sense labeling standard this fall and will continue to advocate for food labeling policies that keep prices down and provide reliable and consistent science-based information.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delaware-members-of-cfsaf-tell-congress-of-urgent-need-for-uniform-national-food-labeling-standard-300157401.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delaware-members-of-cfsaf-tell-congress-of-urgent-need-for-uniform-national-food-labeling-standard-300157401.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH24907&Transmission_Id=201510091509PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH24907&DateId=20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:01:32.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
