(Photo: File) 10 CONNECT 6   \nArizona's Republican legislative leadership is calling members back to the Capitol starting Monday for briefings on a major school-funding plan. \n12 News has learned the plan involves an agreement to settle the long-running school-funding lawsuit, as well as Gov. Doug Ducey's proposal to funnel $2 billion to schools by tapping the state land trust fund. There could be several pieces to the proposal. \nSenate President Andy Biggs' email to his caucus indicates Ducey could call a special session to vote on the plan as soon as midweek. \n\"It's an agreement in principle,\" said one lawmaker familiar with the plan, who asked to remain anonymous. \"It looks pretty good.\" \nIf state land trust fund money is involved, both the Legislature and Arizona voters would have to approve the deal. \nBiggs and House Speaker David Gowan both emailed their respective GOP caucuses Saturday, alerting them to a deal and, in Biggs' case, the possibility of a special session this week. \nHere is Biggs' email Saturday: \nGood morning everyone. Word has just reached me that there is a strong chance that we will be going into a special session mid to late next week. I would like to brief everyone and provide draft documents as soon as possible. I will begin meetings late Monday morning and go as long as we need to Monday. If you can't make it down to the capital sometime Monday, please let me know and we'll arrange to do a phone conference. This is a big issue, there are a number of complexities that you need to be aware of. I look forward to hearing from all of you on these issues. \nHere is Gowan's email: \nDear Members:Some major developments in negotiations have taken place. Please plan to attend a Caucus meeting on Tuesday morning for an important update on the education funding lawsuit. \nI know this is short notice. I urge you, however, to arrange your schedule so that you can attend any meetings on Tuesday, as well as be available the rest of the week. This meeting will enable you to have timely information concerning the likelihood of a special session, it will also give you an important opportunity to ask questions of both policy staff and the legal team working on the lawsuit. \nThank you for your flexibility. God bless.David \nThe Associated Press first reported on Biggs' call to his caucus on Saturday evening. \nLast year, a Maricopa County judge ordered the Legislature to pay Arizona schools more than $300 million immediately, with the possibility of more than $1 billion in backpay, for illegally underfunding K-12 education. \nSeven months of settlement talks this year led nowhere. Earlier this month, an appeals court said the state didn't have to pay the money immediately. \nIn the meantime, elected officials have had to deal with parents and educators outraged over state spending cuts that have dropped Arizona to the bottom of national rankings on school spending. \nDucey unveiled his school-funding plan in June. If approved in its original incarnation, it would have delivered more cash to schools -- about $300 per student -- by the end of 2016 or early 2017. \nBut the governor decided to act with more urgency over the summer, to hasten a statewide vote on the plan that would get money to schools faster. His staff has been negotiating with GOP leadership for several weeks on a special session that would set in motion a process that gets the money to schools faster. \nGov. Ducey's office did not respond to a request for comment. The parties to the school-funding lawsuit, which include the Arizona Education Association, also did not respond to requests for comment. 10 CONNECT 6   Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1S4kYr9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:38:24.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
