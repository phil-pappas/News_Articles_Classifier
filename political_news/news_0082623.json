I would suggest this is a problem that relates particularly to the single black and white silver fern flag,” he said. \nSome organisations with a similar silver and black fern logo include New Zealand Global Limited, Cellnet Limited, Quality New Zealand Limited, New Zealand Trade And Enterprise, and the NZ Tourism Board. \n“With the exception of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, I would be curious to know if the flag consideration panel took into account the potentially hundreds of already registered silver fern trademarks?” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:55:21.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
