Election night: Follow CBC's live results page \n\"It's a message that I'm proud to deliver here with a big smile, as a Liberal, as a Trudeau, and as a Quebecer,\" he declared, underlining the significance of the party's decision to hold its final events in Alberta. \nA political gap has existed between Western Canada and Central Canada since the days of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. That sense of alienation harboured by the Prairie provinces was a major driver of Conservative Leader Stephen Harper's move into politics. \nThe younger Trudeau, who's running for re-election in Montreal, addressed that national divide today. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau was in Edmonton and Calgary for part of the final day of the election campaign. His message to supporters? Alberta matters. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) \n\"You see, every part of this country matters. People in Quebec need to know that Alberta matters, that our country needs Alberta to succeed. But so, too, do Quebecers need to be reminded that our country needs them to engage too.\" Western resources, eastern votes \nTrudeau, who has been drawing large crowds of supporters in the days leading up to Monday's vote, hopes the election will help the Liberals find their way out of the political wilderness in Alberta. \nThe party hasn't had an MP in the province since Anne McLellan lost her Edmonton seat in 2006. \nThe Liberal leader repeated his message in Calgary. \n\"I will never use western resources to try and buy eastern votes,\" he said. \nThe Liberals have been riding high in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign. \nAccording to CBC's Poll Tracker, a number of polls suggest election day will go to the Grits , installing Trudeau as Canada's next prime minister. However, favourable polls today don't rule out the possibility that the Conservatives could eke out more seats tomorrow. \nTrudeau winds down his campaign in British Columbia later today, before flying back to Montreal. Trudeau says he won't use western resources to buy eastern votes 2:29 With files from The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:17:58.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
