The plan, BlueCare Direct, is the first of its kind in Illinois for individuals and families, in particular, those who may be highly cost-sensitive healthcare consumers.\nThe new, high-performing network combines the strength, expertise and reputation of two of the state's leading organizations. Advocate is the largest health system in Illinois and BCBSIL is the largest health insurer in the state with 8.1 million members. BlueCare Direct will be the insurer's lowest-cost insurance offering, with low monthly premiums and low out-of-pocket costs, BCBSIL leaders say. It will be offered both on and off the Get Covered Illinois exchange, the official Health Insurance Marketplace for individuals and families. It will also be available for small group customers.\nBlueCare Direct also provides patients with access to more than 4,000 Advocate primary care and specialty physicians across Cook , DuPage , Lake , Kane and Will counties. The BlueCare Direct network includes over 250 sites of care, including nine hospitals and a children's hospital with two campus locations, largest home health and hospice companies, and one of the region's largest medical groups.\n\"Five years ago, BCBSIL and Advocate entered into a landmark arrangement that created the nation's largest Accountable Care Organization (ACO) designed to improve care quality and cost of care. BlueCare Direct is a product that builds on the successes of that collaboration,\" explained Opella Ernest, M.D., divisional senior vice president of Health Care Delivery and Chief Medical Officer for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois .\nBlueCare Direct offers access to a vast network and flexibility with appointments. The member chooses a primary care physician (PCP) who'll help navigate and coordinate the patient's care and refer to appropriate specialists. BlueCare Direct patients will have access to the entire Advocate network of specialists, and can coordinate with their PCP for access to those specialists.\n\"The launch of BlueCare Direct reaffirms Advocate's and BCBSIL's steadfast commitment to offering the communities we serve a more affordable health care option,\" said Lee Sacks , M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer of Advocate Health Care. He added, \"What we believe is most notable, though, is the level of care members will have access to through the plan. Lower costs and high quality care can, in fact, go hand in hand. We are extremely pleased to be Blue Cross' partner in this critically important and necessary initiative to improve care coordination and outcomes for our patients.\"\nBlueCare Direct is the newest innovative product BCBSIL will offer both on and off the Illinois Health Insurance Marketplace. Open enrollment for 2016 begins on November 1 st and concludes on January 31 st , 2016.\nAbout Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois (BCBSIL)\nWith over 8.1 million members, BCBSIL, a division of Health Care Service Corporation, a Mutual Legal Reserve Company, is the largest health insurance company in Illinois . Begun in 1936 in Chicago , BCBSIL remains member owned rather than publicly traded, and is committed to promoting the health and wellness of its members and its communities, fostering greater access to care, and working to lower the overall cost of care while improving care quality and patient outcomes.
