(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By Editorial Board October 8 at 8:00 PM THE GRADUATION rate for the D.C. public school system this year jumped six percentage points over last year. It is a significant gain that followed three years of incremental increases and is yet another encouraging sign that the hard work of education reform in the District is paying off.
