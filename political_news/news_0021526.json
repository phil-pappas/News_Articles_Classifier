D’Andrea-Terreri, who finished third in the Republican primary for Lockport 1st Ward alderman last month, has announced she will not campaign on the two minor-party lines she has and announced her endorsement of GOP primary winner Joseph P. Oates.\nD’Andrea-Terreri will not be able to get her name off the ballot, however, and it will appear on the Conservative and Independence party lines. Edward W. Tracy is the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 3 election.\n“The 1st Ward voters have spoken and they want Joe Oates,” D’Andrea-Terreri said. She also solicited suggestions on donating her leftover election funds – $778.52, according to her last Board of Elections filing – to a charitable organization.
