His speech will come alongside a formal bank report on the subject. More Osborne demands more welfare cuts \nThe BoE’s intervention has been encouraged by Downing Street and is designed to set the scene for the referendum debate over the coming months as David Cameron seeks to renegotiate Britain’s terms of membership. \nMr Carney likes to take part in big national debates that have implications for the BoE’s policy functions. In January 2014, he travelled to Scotland to explain the difficulties of running a single currency for two independent countries. Last month, he lectured the insurance industry, telling them how important it was to consider climate change in their underwriting standards. \nOn the fringes of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Lima this month, the governor said he would limit any comments he made on Brexit to the issues that were relevant to the bank’s operational work on monetary policy and financial stability. \n“Clearly in terms of the issues around Britain’s place in Europe, the only thing we will say on that as an institution is to provide a perspective of the impact of being a member of the European Union, how that affects the keeping of our objectives, which are monetary and financial stability, which is quite a narrow but important foundational item,” he said. \nOn Wednesday evening, he will give the Cairncross memorial lecture at St Peter’s College, Oxford on the effects of the EU on the BoE’s functions and Brexit. Mr Cameron has encouraged the governor to speak out in a clear way, according to sources close to Downing Street. \nThe BoE’s work on Brexit — considering the potential freedoms from EU financial regulation, regulations that might be imposed from abroad were Britain to leave and possible financial instability associated with the uncertainty of exit — was initially a secret within the central bank. \nThe BoE blew its own cover in the summer by accidentally emailing the details of “Project Bookend” to a Guardian journalist, after which the BoE switched off auto-complete functions on all computers in the bank. \nThe “Project Bookend” work was led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor, and the former top British official in Brussels, something that might prompt eurosceptics to question whether the analysis will be the product of an inside Brussels job. \nAt the time the project was revealed, the BoE issued a statement saying: “It should not come as a surprise that there are a range of economic and financial issues that arise in the context of the renegotiation and national referendum. It is one of the Bank’s responsibilities to assess those that relate to its objectives.” \nThe BoE highlighted the similarity of its work on Brexit with that of the Scottish referendum, which was also closely guided and supported by Downing Street. \nBank officials thought the governor’s intervention at the start of the Scottish referendum debate had been decisive in keeping Scotland in the union even though it had little noticeable effect on opinion polls and played little role in the debate when the public became interested months later.
