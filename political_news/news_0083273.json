When they become partisan, which they are, they distort the system as it was supposed to work. And they allow the side that they pick to get away with all kinds of things.\"\n  Trump builds team of rivals' former backers Most of the billionaire's latest hires have worked for the targets of his antagonism.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/09/15 4:52 PM \"[I] think there's still hope for the press,\" said Carson, who sits second in the Washington Examiner 's latest power rankings . \"I think it is possible that some of them will recognize that it's almost a sacred obligation that they have to the people to be honest.\"\nBut, Carson added, \"The more they attack me the better we do.\"\nCarson rattled through a series of recent controveries in which he's been embroiled.\n\"This is the level of insincerity that we see and it really is kind of embarrassing to see that,\" Carson said. \"Everything needs to be looked at in its context. And when news media pick one word or one phrase, and they run with it, and they try to characterize people like that.\"\n\"I gotta tell you guys, that's why people don't trust you anymore,\" Carson said. \"I mean, you're down there with used car salesmen.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner NY Times hails Hillary's honed debate skills Report recounts how Clinton showed early in life as a \"dutiful student\" her supposed skill for debate.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/09/15 3:40 PM In the Q&A session, Carson said he wanted to \"expose\" the media.\n\"I just want to mention — many in the press will say that I'm sensitive, and that should not be thinking about running for office because I get offended by what they do,\" Carson said. \"Of course they'll say that.\"\n\"But the reason that I expose the press is because I want the people of America to understand what they are doing,\" Carson said. \"So it's not because I'm sensitive. I will continue to expose them every time they do something because as more people understand who they are and what they are doing, it will negate their effect.\"\nThe Examiner asked Carson why he chose to go off on the media while at the National Press Club.\n\"Because they've gone after me this week more so than usual. This was a good week to have plenty of examples. Every little thing that comes out of your mouth really,\" Carson replied. \"Because they pick sides. You don't see them going after Hillary or Biden for a little thing like that. It's pretty obvious.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Chaffetz as speaker could revive Internet tax Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist sent a letter to lawmakers singling Chaffetz.\nBy Rudy Takala • 10/09/15 4:29 PM After a week of non-stop media appearances to promote his new book, Carson will be in South Carolina and Georgia over the weekend.\nTop Story Book: Valerie Jarrett got Joe Biden 'psychiatric help' for 2016 Ed Klein's book claims   hard for Biden to enter the race.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/09/15 1:43 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:02:34.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
