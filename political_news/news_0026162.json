In the presidential race, the party would select a dull, but competent candidate—Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan, Rick Perry, or Scott Walker—to take out Hillary Clinton. \nAs the capital enters Columbus Day weekend, all of those hopes are in ruin. And it really shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Story Continued Below \nIndeed, a sad reality is settling into Washington these days: the propensity of the Republican establishment, when given a chance, to make the worst possible decisions. What other explanation is there for their current travails in the selection of a Speaker of the House? Or their bewilderment over the same? \nFairly or not, their outgoing leader had won the enmity of nearly every Republican not on K Street. Speaker Boehner, often underrated by conservatives, wisely recognized this, saw a revolt coming, decided he had better things to do with his life, and stepped aside. \nSo what did a majority of Congress plan to do in response? Settle immediately on a successor who was just like him. Except more gaffe-prone and politically clueless. \nAfter their consensus choice for speaker handed Hillary Clinton the priceless gift of seeming to confirm that the Benghazi investigation is a politically motivated witch hunt against her—PR damage that will never be repaired—a vast majority of the conference still insisted that this was the guy they needed on television during a critical election season. For no apparent reason other than he simply was next in line for the job. To a party demanding revolutionary change, they offered essentially “more of the same,” except a little bit worse. Not exactly a rallying cry. \nHow naïve can any group of people be? Is Congress populated by Matt Damon’s PR team ? Are they moonlighting as Justin Bieber’s chaperones? Did they all serve on the OJ Simpson jury? \nIn a twisted way, House Majority Leader (for now) Kevin McCarthy should be a joyful man today. He’s not going to have to play the part of Dan Quayle for the next two years in Washington, D.C. Nor is he going to have to take on the thankless task of being called a phony, liar, and sellout by his colleagues, the D.C. punditry and a fed-up grassroots. \nThe Republican majority in the House should be gleeful by the latest turn of the events as well. But of course, they aren’t. Like kids who finally figured out their parents are getting a divorce, they are bewildered, confused and apparently prone to crying fits when things don’t go their way. \nLet me repeat that: Grown men and women who are representing this nation in a time of terrorism and very real economic anxiety actually wept because Kevin McCarthy won’t lead them into another round of voter discontent, hatred and recrimination. \nWhen our members of Congress rise up from their fainting couches, it might finally dawn on them that what’s going on now isn’t really about John Boehner or Kevin McCarthy. It’s about a much bigger problem inside the GOP—one that’s been obvious to every single person in the world, but them. \nFor months on end the GOP establishment has continued to ignore all the signs of its impending doom. It’s been living in a delusion—thinking that they were in charge even as all the evidence made clear that their grasp of reality was not much better than Randy Quaid’s. Sure, their supporters are mad at them. But they’ve been mad before, like when they bailed out Wall Street in 2008, while the rest of the economy tanked. It will all blow over. \nBut it won’t. And largely this is a problem of the establishment’s own making. Time and again, the GOP and its consultant class has overpromised to win votes and then underperformed once the votes were won. In 2014, every elected official running on the GOP ticket vowed to do all in their power to repeal Obamacare—and yet Obamacare seems here to stay. They vowed to fight a raise of the debt ceiling without spending reforms—and the debt ceiling was raised anyway. They railed against gay marriage, an issue about which they secretly care little, even when they knew the Supreme Court would rule against them—making them look bigoted, hypocritical and ineffective to boot. Leaders savaged President Obama for an Iran deal that they’ve told voters will lead to World War III—and yet brushed aside real efforts to challenge the administration on it. The Republican majority has decried Planned Parenthood, and yet rejected efforts to block federal funding for the organization. On key occasions, the Republican leadership in the House has forged majorities with Democrats against the wishes of their own conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:02:59.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
