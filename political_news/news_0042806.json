It was the latest violence in a week in which bloody attacks left four Israelis dead. Five Palestinians were also killed.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's move to try and calm the situation appeared to put the Israeli leader on a collision course with hard-liners within his own governing coalition. They have been putting intense pressure on Netanyahu to respond to the surge in violence with a tough crackdown and increased settlement activity.\nBut Netanyahu is also wary of angering the American administration and risking another full-fledged uprising with too tough a response that could lead to a higher number of casualties on both sides.\nThe Jerusalem hilltop compound lies at the heart of recent tensions. It's revered by Muslims as the spot where Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven and by Jews as the site of the two Jewish biblical Temples.\nMany Palestinians believe Israel is trying to expand Jewish presence at the site, a claim Israel adamantly denies and considers slanderous. Under a longstanding arrangement administered by Islamic authorities, Jews are allowed to visit the site during certain hours but not pray there.\nThe latest Israeli-Palestinian unrest began about three weeks ago as Palestinians repeatedly barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, located at the sacred site, and hurled stones, firebombs and fireworks at the police.\nThe violence later spread to Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem and to the West Bank, and on Tuesday there were disturbances in Jaffa, a largely Arab area of Tel Aviv.\nEven with Thursday's stabbing attack, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not allow his people to be \"dragged\" into more violence with Israel. Speaking to business leaders in the West Bank city of Ramallah, he said he was committed to \"peaceful popular resistance\" though he backs the protesters who have barricaded themselves inside Al-Aqsa and clashed with Israeli police.\nHe insisted the Palestinians are not interested in a further escalation but that his \"hands are with those who are protecting Al-Aqsa mosque.\"\nAlong with the four Israelis killed in stabbings by Palestinian attackers and a roadside shooting in the last week, five Palestinians, including three of the attackers, have also been killed. On Wednesday, new stabbings occurred outside a crowded mall in central Israel, in a southern Israeli town and in the Old City of Jerusalem.\nAccording to an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations, Netanyahu ordered the ban on the holy site because he was concerned that any high-profile visits there could spark further violence.\nIn 2000, then-opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount — known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary — shortly before the second Palestinian intifada erupted.\nIn a statement from Geneva on Thursday, the U.N. human rights chief appealed for calm, warning that \"more bloodshed will only lead to more hatred on both sides\" of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.\nZeid Raad al-Hussein said he was \"deeply concerned at the increasing number of reported attacks\" by both Israeli settlers and Palestinians, following reports that at least 134 Palestinians have been injured by live ammunition and many more hurt by rubber bullets or tear gas. \"The high number of casualties, in particular those resulting from the use of live ammunition by Israeli security forces, raise concerns of excessive use of force,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:41:50.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
