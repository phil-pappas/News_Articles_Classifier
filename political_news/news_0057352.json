The bill would require prosecutors to prove a defendant claiming immunity from trial under Stand Your Ground wasn’t acting in self-defense. \n“This adds an additional burden on the state to prove the innocence of the victims and the guilt of the shooters,” McBath said, noting Dunn had to be tried twice before he was convicted and sentenced to jail. \nMcBath invoked lawmakers in the name of her son and Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot by George Zimmerman in Sanford in 2012 in a case that grabbed national headlines and a new spotlight on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Zimmerman initially was not charged by Sanford police, but was later arrested and acquitted of Martin’s murder at trial. He did not claim a Stand Your Ground defense but simple self-defense, although stand your ground parameters were included in jury instructions. \n“The jurors are confused and it puts a whole different spin on what they’re expected to adjudicate over,” McBath added. \nThe bill passed through the committee on a 4-1 vote, with Sen. Audrey Gibson, D-Jacksonville, the only dissenting vote. \nBut Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fleming Island, sponsor of SB 344, said he’s only trying to impose the original intent of the Stand Your Ground law passed in 2005, which declared a person doesn’t have a duty to retreat in the face of a physical threat. The Florida Supreme Court ruled this summer that defendants claiming stand your ground have the burden of proof in a pre-trial hearing. \n“I happen to think who better to define legislative intent than the Legislature?” Bradley said. \nThe bill has kindled opposition from anti-gun activist groups opposing the Stand Your Ground law, but representatives of criminal defense attorney groups and public defender groups spoke in favor of the bill. \n“(Prosecutors) should bear that burden of proof through the entire case,” said Stacy Scott, board member of the Florida Public Defender’s Association and the public defender for the 8 th Circuit, which includes Gainesville. \nThe committee narrowly passed a separate bill, SB 300, allowing licensed gun owners to openly carry firearms in public places that currently allow concealed carry. The vote was 3-2, with Gibson the other Democrat on the panel, Sen. Jeff Clemens of Lake Worth, outvoted by Republicans. \nBradford County Sheriff Gordon Smith spoke in favor of the bill, saying he’d rather know who in a crowd is carrying a gun. \n“Some people don’t like guns, I’m okay with that. Get a can of wasp spray if it works for you,” Smith said. \nOther police groups, however, oppose the bill, arguing it would make their jobs more dangerous if they can’t ask questions of someone openly carrying a firearm. Javier Ortiz, president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, name checked the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman case in arguing against the bill. \n“Unfortunately, people want to be police officers like George Zimmerman. We don’t need George Zimmerman to walk around with firearms exposed,” Ortiz said. \nMeanwhile, by a 5-3 vote along partisan lines the Senate Higher Education passed SB 68, allowing licensed gun owners to carry handguns on college campuses. The bill is opposed by some university presidents and campus police groups. But students from both sides of the issue also spoke for and against the bill. \nGibson, though, is worried about the cumulative effect all of the gun bills, along with the Stand Your Ground legislation, would have on public safety in Florida. Thanks to a law passed in 2011 by the Legislature, local governments can’t pass new ordinances restricting guns, meaning urban municipalities couldn’t stop citizens from openly carrying guns in public places. \nToo much time is being spent on gun bills in the lead up to the legislative session, she said. \n“I think that’s all we’re doing this session. Maybe that’s why there are hardly any bills filed in the Senate. If you don’t have a gun bill, it’s not going anywhere,” Gibson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:00:29.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
