But officials said Friday that the fire that began Tuesday and grew big enough to waft smoke into downtown Austin, some 40 miles away from the fire, now appears to be getting under control.\n\"Barring some totally unforeseen circumstance, we're on the downhill side of this fire,\" Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape said.\nNo deaths or serious injuries have been reported. The Hidden Pines Fire is 40 percent contained, , up from 15 percent on Thursday.\nAbout 200 firefighters from across Texas have battled the blaze during daylight, and on Friday, a DC-10 jet tanker flown in from Tennessee dropped nearly 12,000 gallons of retardant on the smoldering area.\nThe fire has been fueled partly by hot, dry weather, but a cool front moved into Central Texas on Friday.\nThe fire is chewing much of the same area that was devastated in 2011 by a far more massive wildfire that wiped out 1,600 homes and killed two people. But this time, winds have paled to the 50 mph gusts that overwhelmed firefighters four years ago.\nPape said a preliminary investigation found that an accident during a \"farming operation\" may have caused the fire. He told the Austin American-Statesman that a rancher was pulling a shredder through grass when an overheated bearing ignited grass clippings. A line of fire was created before the rancher discovered what had happened.\nAbout 400 homes have been evacuated since the fire began. Most of the structures destroyed are believed to be houses.\nAbout 200 residents have checked into local shelters, though authorities say few have stayed overnight as most slept in motels or the homes of friends.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:25:06.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
