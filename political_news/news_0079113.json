Perry Walker Sr. High School, 1984 Graduated from Southern University at New Orleans with a bachelor's degree in business administration Political\nDemocrat Philosophy and platform\nIntegrity in Government: Work to restore ethics, integrity and accountability in government. Fiscal Responsibility: Provide leadership on exercising fiscal responsibility and restraint on State spending and budgetary matters. Prioritize Key Infrastructure Initiatives: Evaluate funding and appropriate budget allocations for key infrastructure improvements projects, including, tunnels, state highways and local streets and thoroughfares. Access to quality early, elementary, secondary and higher education: I firmly believe that education must be a top priority if Louisiana is to continue to grow and remain competitive. An educated workforce attracts new businesses to the State, results in higher paying careers and professions, and improves the per capita income of our State. Louisiana is in a better position to witness such growth by giving parents options to choose high quality schools that are best suited for their children's talents and future aspirations. The same vision applies to higher education, as Louisiana citizens and leaders need to work collectively to ensure access to higher education through affordable and convenient trade and professional schools and colleges and universities. Crime Prevention: Move for an innovative and fresh review of state law to evaluate how certain state law enforcement agencies can work collaboratively with local West Bank law enforcement agencies to reduce crime. ROY GLAPION\nPersonal\nRoy Glapion Website: www.RoyGlapion47.com 54, born in New Orleans Divorced Vice president and business development strategist at The Beta Group, for 2 and 1/2 years Graduated from St. Augustine High School, 1979\nGraduated from the University of New Orleans with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, 1987 Political\nDemocrat Philosophy and platform\nBetter Schools: An estimated 40 percent of New Orleans residents are unable to complete a job application, which, in communities of color, only compounds the 52 percent unemployment rate among black males a key demographic in our city if we are to change our economic fortunes. In short, we are failing our children. If children fail to achieve literacy by the age of eight, their chances for criminal activity increases exponentially. A super-majority of prison inmates are unable to read effectively. We must have schools that serve as a firewall between criminal behavior and having a career. Blocking further cuts to higher education is the perfect place to start on the state level, ensuring that community colleges and universities that serve students with remedial needs have needed funding. Common Core is a controversial subject gripping education in our state and beyond. High national standards are critical for educational mobility. Students educated in one part of the country should not be beyond or ahead of students in another part of the country. Whether we adopt the name Common Core or not is rather irrelevant, we must maintain quality, national standards to educate a 21st Century workforce to compete with the world. The long term goal for all school districts in the state is to return them to local control, but this must be done through a process that establishes criteria and standards. Safer Streets: Violent crime is a perennial issue in the metropolitan area, knowing no home or particular migration pattern. Some call for more cops, others for civilian patrols, and still others more state troopers. But each of these approaches is but one ingredient in the still unfinished recipe of what will make our city safe. We mustn't wait on state troopers, we can't afford to wait for beefed up NOPD patrols and we cannot relegate our safety to albeit outstanding efforts our friends and neighbors as patrolmen. I am committed to finding hyperlocal solutions to combating violence so that a young man from Landry-Walker can get into an argument with his friend over an X-Box and not end up losing his life. Police Training is without a doubt an integral part of crime reduction. Taking apart the state budget to locate dollars to fund better training programs for community policing and relations will build trust, integrate law enforcement officers into the hearts and minds of neighborhood residents and put criminals on notice that residents have close ties with the men and women in blue. Communities are safer when officers know residents' names and vice versa. Drug Proliferation is one of the main contributors to crime in the 7th Senatorial District. On day one, I plan to convene law enforcement leaders in the District; religious and neighborhood leaders; and parent and school booster groups to develop a response to local crime. Police officers, pastors, community members and parents are all first responders and must work together to be on the first line of defense against criminal activity. This project is unique to the 7th Senatorial District and is an example of community policing. Economic Development: Now, more than ever, the metropolitan area is experiencing an influx of new talent and job opportunities making the metro area one of the fasting growing in the county and a hub for industries, like technology, not often linked to our area. It is vital that we capitalize on this exciting time by ensuring that local residents are put to work in these fields to head off economic downturns in the tourism industry. We can do this by providing state funding for programs that teach young adults coding skills, and other skills connected to the field of technology and beyond. Geographic Positioning is perhaps the greatest asset for economic development in the 7th Senatorial District. The District is well positioned to take advantage of planned megaport for the area and extend development to retro-fitting the Avondale Shipyard and the long-shuttered Federal City. Using the master plan, not politics, to guide waterfront development is a top priority for increasing job opportunities, tax revenues and quality of life. Health Care: Louisiana ranks 48th in the nation for policies that improve health care outcomes a failing grade by any standard. Our state struggles with high incidents of infectious disease transmission, a high prevalence of low birth weight and a high rate of preventable hospitalizations, increasing health costs. Thirty-eight percent of children in New Orleans live in poverty, affecting their access to health care. More than 50 percent of black men of working age are unemployed, affecting their access to health care. Our state can and must do better. Improving health outcomes is vital for economic success. Medicaid Expansion is the fastest, and most obvious way, to put our state on the fast track to better health care. In the next seven years, Louisiana will lose more than a billion dollars in Medicaid dollars from the federal government and it continues to leave an estimated 430,000 residents uninsured for no reason other than politics. The state Legislature must pass a bill to override the governor's decision to not accept except expanded Medicaid funding. Our tax dollars support the Medicaid program and the residents of Louisiana are, at this moment, paying for a health care system that they are unable to access - this must stop! Health Clinics are the first line of defense in communities that are underserved by health care providers. Building a financial infrastructure to support new health clinics under the University Medical Center should be a top priority for the New Orleans delegation to the Legislature. Environmental Protection: Funding for Coastal Restoration is a key component in preserving our economic and cultural way of life in southeast Louisiana. In 2017, more than $170 million will be made available for coastal restoration in Louisiana. The Obama Administration, however, has expressed an interest in redirecting these dollars to other states, leaving Louisiana with a smaller part of this federal expenditure. The Legislature must work with our state's congressional delegation to maintain this funding for Louisiana. The 7th Senatorial District is certainly the beneficiary of this funding and working with our representatives in Congress is essential.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:49:13.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
