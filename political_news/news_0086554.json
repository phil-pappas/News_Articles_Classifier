China is a big part of it … and the shift of the Chinese leadership to focus on the ‘qualitative’ features of its economy, presents a huge opportunity for Australian businesses.”\nSimilarly, at a speech to the Australia-US Leadership Dialogue earlier in the year, Mr Turnbull said the “rebooting of India, economic rebalancing in China, structural reform in Japan and continued liberalisation of trade and investment” were all “vitally important issues for the Asia-Pacific”.\nMonumental changes across Asia will be critical to Australia’s future prosperity. We need to design an economy that is adaptive and dynamic and responds to key drivers for change.\nYesterday, the Prime Minister met with leaders of the National Reform Summit to seek their views on an agreed reform agenda. If Australia is to set out a path for growth, jobs creation and economic prosperity, this path needs to lead to embracing the opportunities presented by Asia.\nEquipping business with the skills and knowledge to seize on Asia’s opportunities should be central to our economic transition.\nOver the past month, Asialink Business, the National Centre for Asia Capability, has engaged more than 500 organisations across Australia to mainstream understanding of Asian markets and raise awareness about an innovative new tool developed to help Australian businesses.\nFrom grain growers in the west selling high quality wheat for Japanese udon noodles, to premium fruit growers in Victoria and Tasmania that command a premium in China and architects and accountants in Queensland and New South Wales, business in all sectors have said they are eager to tap into the opportunities of a changing Asia.\nThey are keen to seize a bigger slice of Asia’s ever growing pie.\nRecent research by Asialink Business demonstrated that if we invest in building the right skills and knowledge now, Australian services exports alone to Asia could be worth over $160 billion and create more than 1 million jobs, by 2030.\nBut the reality is, small- and medium-sized businesses still constitute only a tiny slice of Australia’s total merchandise and service exports.\nABS data from 2013–14 showed that of Australia’s two million companies, only 45,000 exported goods overseas. And of these exporters, 338 companies were responsible for the export of more than $233bn (or 85 per cent) of Australia’s $273bn of goods exports that year.\nThese figures refer specifically to goods exports, the dominant form of our exports to Asia, and are indicative that many Australian companies are not maximising the potential of Asia’s growing markets.\nTo succeed, timely information and insights are key.\nThat is why Asialink Business is releasing Country Starter Packs -- a comprehensive and publicly available national resource to help more Australian organisations enter or grow in Asia. Each pack highlights the different approaches needed to understand Asia’s diverse markets, acknowledging the nuance that exists not only between countries but also within countries.\nTake a sector like food and beverages for example.\nIn Korea, Australian businesses are in a strong position to meet the high dependence on foreign food imports. But Australian exporters need to keep abreast of changing tastes and evolving distribution networks, with social media marketing, for example, now an essential, given nearly eighty per cent of Koreans actively use smart phones.\nIn Indonesia, Australian food exporters need to take detailed mandatory labelling requirements into account, such as halal certification and requirements to register products with the Food and Drug Control Agency.\nIn the Chinese market, new comers looking to capitalise on Australia’s enviable reputation for ‘safe, clean and pristine’ food products still need to be mindful that, with a population over 50 times that of Australia, profound differences exist from region to region in China. China’s booming e-commerce can offer an innovative avenue for sales and marketing, with the number of online shoppers expected to reach 350 million people this year and be worth $840bn by 2020.\nThis is just a glimpse into the way deep and diverse market insights are needed to succeed in Asia.\nThe Country Starter Packs -- also available as a shareable app -- will arm more businesses with the tools needed to understand and tailor offerings for Asia’s 500 million diverse middle class consumers.\nIf Australia’s economy is to transform and diversify, now more than ever, it is critical that businesses of all shapes and sizes take up these tools and step up their Asia skills and knowledge.\nMukund Narayanamurti is the CEO of Asialink Business, which is releasing a series of Country Starter Packs, a new national public resource for all businesses looking to expand into Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:14:19.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
