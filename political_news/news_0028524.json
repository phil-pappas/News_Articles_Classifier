It’s now time for us to implement that plan.\" \nMs Glavish is full of praise for the two MÄori Party Co-leaders and the party leadership who have consolidated support throughout 2015. \n\"Our two MÄori Party MPs play a critical role in Parliament. Through their endeavours we’ve secured significant gains in housing, WhÄnau Ora and support for the development of MÄori land as well as advocating on key issues.\" \nShe believes the \"dynamic mix\" of Te Ururoa Flavell and Marama Fox is helping boost support for the party. \n\"It is an exciting and satisfying time to be part of the MÄori Party\", she says. \nThis year party delegates at the AGM will debate remits on MÄori representation in the 2016 local government elections, its candidate selection process and the relationship between Mana and the MÄori Party. It will also be the first opportunity to promote the recently established MÄori Party Rangatahi Council. \nMs Glavish says the party leadership is firmly focused on rebuilding the party and ensuring it is seen \"as an enduring political voice for MÄori aspirations\". \nThe AGM programme begins on Friday 5pm with a pÅhiri at Te Åhaaki marae and finishes on Sunday morning. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:26:52.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
