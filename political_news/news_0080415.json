Chuck Schumer, joined forces for the second time in New York City to urge residents to take action through social media and traditional advocacy to help tighten gun laws. The senator and his famous cousin appeared outside City Hall in Manhattan on Sunday to promote their “crusade against guns,” the Associated Press reported. The two pressed the public to write, call and use Twitter and Facebook to help halt the nation’s rate of gun violence.\nThe relatives first held a press conference in New York in August to showcase the senator's draft proposal intended to stop violent criminals, abusers and those with mental illnesses from obtaining guns.\nSen. Schumer enlists famous cousin Amy to pitch guns bill By Seung Min Kim\nThe initial conference followed the gun violence at a movie theater in Lafayette, Lousiana earlier in the summer at the showing of “Trainwreck,” a movie in which Amy Schumer starred.
