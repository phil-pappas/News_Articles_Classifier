We need your help more than ever to reach hearts and minds on college campuses and within the church . I look forward to seeing you on the 17th. Additionally, if you purchase a general admission ticket you will get a free copy of Trent Horn’s book Persuasive Pro-Life. \nJason Walsh, Executive Director", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:45:44.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
