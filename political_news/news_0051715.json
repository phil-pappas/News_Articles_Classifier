Ghana has an Electoral Commissioner that is independent and does not consult the president to do anything. \n\"It is a relatively young register because we have only used it for only one election and it was a register that has been biometrically compiled. \n\"And what we have done in the past is that when we have a young register we clean it up but one party says they want it scrapped completely and a new register compiled. \n\"We have to look at whether they have a case and that is why they are supposed to present their view but they are not only presenting view they are holding demonstration and so on. \n\"It is for the EC to decide what to do,\" he said.
