The ranking can be viewed here: http://www.nonprofitcollegesonline.com/rankings/best-online-doctorates-in-nursing/\nThe award was created to recognize colleges and universities that put \"education before the bottom line,\" especially in the wake of much bad publicity surrounding online programs and the exposure of exploitative practices of for-profit education institutions. The Online Doctorates in Nursing Students Before Profits Award ranks the top 50 colleges and universities offering fully online or hybrid doctoral level programs in nursing according to their affordability. This ranking was limited to schools that are regionally accredited by one of the six regional accrediting bodies for colleges and schools, and that have lower than average tuition rates.\nThe ranking highlights both programs leading to a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and programs leading to a PhD in Nursing. Both doctoral degrees are terminal, but differ in a few key ways. Both degrees are suitable for pursuing faculty positions at universities, though the PhD may provide more marketability for these positions, especially at research-intensive universities.\nThe lead editor of this ranking, Brett Gershon , says that, \"the field of nursing has a very high demand due to a record high in shortage of nurses. Many positions are available in a wide variety of settings and these openings are only expected to grow in the coming years.\" Gershon goes on to state, \"additionally, nurse educators at the college and university level are needed now more than ever. Because of the record shortage in nurses throughout the US, an estimated one million new and replacement nurses will be needed by the year 2020. Yet, nursing programs are turning qualified nursing candidates away each year because there aren't enough nursing educators to maintain strong training programs.\" Nurses with a terminal degree should have no trouble finding work as educators or administrators in healthcare settings, so pursuing a DNP or PhD can be a very smart move for practicing nurses. This ranking should serve as a valuable resource for locating flexible and affordable, quality programs of study which don't require practicing nurses to stop working or relocate to pursue a degree.\nComing in first in the ranking is the University of Arkansas with a low tuition of $14,500 - $15,600 for its MSN to DNP track. Indiana State University holds the second position in the ranking with a $15,132 estimated tuition for its DNP program. The University of South Alabama comes in third with a total estimated tuition of $15,630 .\nOther colleges and universities that made the ranking are listed below in alphabetical order.\nBradley University - Peoria, Illinois\nChatham University - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nCollege of Saint Scholastica - Duluth, Minnesota\nConcordia University - Mequon, Wisconsin\nDrexel University - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nDuquesne University - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nGeorgia Southern University - Statesboro, Georgia\nGraceland University - Lamoni, Iowa\nHampton University - Hampton, Virginia\nIdaho State University - Pocatello, Idaho\nLa Salle University - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nLiberty University - Lynchburg, Virginia\nLoma Linda University - Loma Linda, California\nLoyola University - Baltimore, Maryland\nMaryville University - Saint Louis, Missouri\nMedical University of South Carolina - Charleston, South Carolina\nMercer University - Macon, Georgia\nNew Mexico State University - Las Cruces , New Mexico\nNortheastern University - Boston, Massachusetts\nNova Southeastern University - Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nPennsylvania State University - State College, Pennsylvania\nRegis University - Denver, Colorado\nSaint Louis University - St. Louis, Missouri\nTexas Woman√≠s University - Denton, Texas\nUniversity of Alberta - Edmonton, Alberta\nUniversity of Central Florida - Orlando, Florida\nUniversity of Colorado-Colorado Springs - Colorado Springs, Colorado\nUniversity of Colorado Denver - Denver, Colorado\nUniversity of Kansas - Lawrence, Kansas\nUniversity of Maryland - Baltimore , Maryland\nUniversity of Massachusetts-Amherst - Amherst, Massachusetts\nUniversity of Michigan - Flint - Flint, Michigan\nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center - Jackson, Mississippi\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City - Kansas City, Missouri\nUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas - Las Vegas, Nevada\nUniversity of North Dakota - Grand Forks , North Dakota\nUniversity of Northern Colorado - Greeley, Colorado\nUniversity of Pittsburgh - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch - Galveston, Texas\nUniversity of Texas-Tyler - Tyler, Texas\nUniversity of Utah - Salt Lake City, Utah\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee - Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Oshkosh - Oshkosh, Wisconsin\nWalsh University - North Canton, Ohio\nWashington State University - Pullman, Washington\nWest Virginia University - Morgantown , West Virginia\nWilkes University - Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania\nContact:\nBrett Gershon\nEditor, NonProfit Colleges Online\nhttp://www.nonprofitcollegesonline.com\n763.503.0162\n releases/students-before-profits-award-best-online-doctorates-in-nursing-ranked-by-nonprofit-colleges-online-300165406.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nonprofitcollegesonline.com/rankings/best-online-doctorates-in-nursing/", "http://www.nonprofitcollegesonline.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH36866&Transmission_Id=201510260835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH36866&DateId=20151026", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/students-before-profits-award-best-online-doctorates-in-nursing-ranked-by-nonprofit-colleges-online-300165406.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:24:28.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
