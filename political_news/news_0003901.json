The Republican presidential contender said on Fox News Sunday that he's \"extremely, extremely tough on immigration,\" which may have thwarted the 9/11 terrorists. \"There's a good chance that those people would not have been in our country,\" says Trump. (The Guardian , however, notes that all of the terrorists legally entered the US on tourist or business visas—except one, who used a student visa.) \"I'm not blaming George Bush,\" adds Trump. \"But I don't want Jeb Bush to say, 'My brother kept us safe,' because September 11 was one of the worst days in the history of this country.\" Cue the reactions: \"My brother responded to a crisis, and he did it as you would hope a president would do,\" says Jeb Bush on State of the Union . \"He united the country, he organized our country and he kept us safe. ... And I don't know why [Trump] keeps bringing this up.\" \"I would probably ask [Trump] what he meant by that. I seriously doubt that he’s saying that—that George W. Bush is to blame for [9/11],\" says Carson, per ABC News . \"I certainly—I certainly don’t think so.\" And Jeb recently fired back at Trump (who's been attacking the Bush brothers on Twitter ) with a video that mocks Trump as a foreign-policy lightweight while fanciful clarinet music plays in the background.
