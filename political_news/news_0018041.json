Germany, Austria, Italy, Czech Republic and the Netherlands have opened theirs to a limited extent.\n\"Today's agreement on the fourth railway package paves the way for better efficiency, performance, value for money and quality of rail services in the EU,\" said Violeta Bulc, EU Transport Commissioner.\nThursday's agreement means negotiations can start with the European Parliament to agree on a final compromise.\nEuropean train companies will be allowed either to set up commercial activities to compete with operators in other countries or to bid for public-service contracts that are awarded by governments on lines that are not as profitable.\nCommercially viable lines, usually high-speed networks, will be open to competition from 2020. The majority of lines subject to public-service contracts will be liberalised 10 years after a new law takes effect, expected in 2016.\nItaly, for example, has already opened up its high-speed network. It now has two operators competing, Italo and state-owned Trenitalia.\nBut the majority of domestic rail lines, over 90 percent according to the Commission, are operated under public-service contracts.\nCountries often directly award rail contracts to the local incumbent, which is either compensated or granted exclusive rights on the line.\nThe original proposal would have introduced mandatory competitive tendering for such rail contracts. Opposition from member states means that governments will be able to directly award contracts where the geographical characteristics are such that it would result in service improvements, or where they do not receive enough bids.\nThe reform also strengthens the independence of track owners from railway companies by making them responsible for all functions concerning the network such as investment plans and maintenance.\nIt does not prohibit vertically integrated structures such as that recently introduced in France, where the track owner RFF and the railway company were brought into the same holding company. But it does introduce safeguards against the transfer of funds between the two.\nIn the UK, the new leader of the Labour opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, has pledged to re-nationalise rail franchises privatised under the administration of Conservative prime minister John Major in the 1990s, although critics have debated whether this would be permissable under EU law.", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/619_640x431_634215806_555x373.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:29:05.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
