This transitional council would be in place for the 2016-2019 electoral term, leading to a fully elected council in 2019. \nThe Environment Canterbury (Transitional Governance Arrangements) Bill would also allow for alternative Resource Management Act processes in place since 2010 to continue until 2019. These largely affect regional planning in regards to the management of fresh water. \nChair of the Local Government and Environment Committee, Scott Simpson MP, said “This legislation will impact on all Cantabrians and we look forward to hearing their views on the transition towards full democracy in their region.” \nSubmissions to the Local Government and Environment Committee are due by 19 November 2015. The committee will report back to Parliament in February next year. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:21:01.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
