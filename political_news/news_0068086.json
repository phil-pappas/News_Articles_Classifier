(AP) - A judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit by a man who claims Hopewell police violated his rights when they arrested him for carrying guns while displaying an “Impeach Obama” sign on a highway overpass. \nU.S. District Judge John Gibney said Wednesday that he needs more facts to flesh out Brandon Howard’s complaint against former Hopewell Police Sgt. John Hunter. \nHoward alleges that his 90-minute detention in September 2013 violated his free-speech rights, as well as his rights to bear arms and to be free of unreasonable search and seizure. He carried an AR-15 rifle and a .380-caliber pistol during his protest. He wasn’t charged. \nHunter has said in court papers that he is entitled to immunity because it was reasonable to believe that the public was in danger. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:27:03.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
