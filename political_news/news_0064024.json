Mike Pompeo, who sits on the Benghazi select committee, accusing Clinton of receiving \"most of her intelligence\" at the State Department from her longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal, rather than government officials.\n\"That is factually untrue,\" Mitchell said at the time. \"Relied on Mr. Blumenthal for most of her intelligence?\"\n\"Take a look at the email transcripts,\" said Pompeo.\n  Obama defends DOD veto as a move against 'gimmicks' \"I'm going to be sending it back to Congress; and my message to them is very simple: Let's do this right.\"\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/22/15 5:47 PM Mitchell shot back, \"I cover the State Department. That is just factually not correct.\"\nThe video was shown by Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, who said it \"defies all logic\" and that Mitchell \"correctly called him out on something that was a falsehood.\"\nClinton repeated Mitchell, \"Well, it was factually untrue.\"\nMitchell did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner media desk on whether she took exception with being used to defend Clinton.\nDuring the hearing on Thursday, Pompeo questioned Clinton on why her emails leading up to the 2012 terrorist attack on an American consulate in Benghazi show more direct correspondence from Blumenthal on the matter than with government officials or Libya Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attack.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Here's why I didn't fire anyone over Benghazi debacle Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., was the first to ask why no one has been fired yet.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/22/15 1:26 PM Clinton said at one point during the hearing that much of her official business was not conducted over email but in secure phone calls, private meetings and through classified paper documents. She also said that she did not believe Stevens had her email address, though she has consistently described him as a \"friend\" in the past.\nTop Story Gowdy scolds Benghazi Dems for focus on 'money,' not 'heroism' Gowdy tore into Democrats at the Benghazi hearing for complaining about the $5 million price tag Thursday.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/22/15 4:34 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:01:37.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
