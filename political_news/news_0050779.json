The Australian National University in Canberra follows at 52, the University of Sydney at 56 and the University of Queensland at 60.\nAdvertisement The University of NSW rose from 109th place last year to 82nd this year, while Monash University rose from 83rd to 73rd.\nAustralia was the seventh most represented country in the rankings, which this year were expanded to include 800 universities.\nThe University of Melbourne is ranked 33rd.
