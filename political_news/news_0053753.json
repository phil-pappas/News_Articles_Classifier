James McGovern is backing legislation that would boost Social Security benefits by 2.9 percent next year, after the government said there would be no increase in 2016. Officials announced last week that there would be no increase for Social Security because the cost of living for Americans fell slightly in 2015. Congress has tied Social Security increases to a Consumer Price Index for workers, which considers the costs of a broad range of consumer goods and services. “Last week’s announcement that seniors won’t see a COLA increase for 2016 means that we need to act quickly to do the right thing for America’s seniors,” said McGovern. McGovern has signed onto a bill authored by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., that would change the way Social Security benefit increases are determined. Rather than using the broad CPI-W to determine inflation, they would rely on a measure that more accurately reflects the spending habits of the elderly. Proponents note that seniors spend a greater percentage on food and health care than the general population, and spend a smaller percentage on transportation. This year’s slight decrease in the CPI was attributed mostly to a sharp drop in gasoline prices. Social Security has increased on average 2.2 percent annually since 1975 when cost-of-living adjustments were tied to CPI, and only twice in 40 years have there been no benefits increase. About 65 million retired and disabled workers, spouses and children collect Social Security benefits every month, the equivalent of about 1 in 4 households. Another 15 million are disabled veterans, federal retirees and their survivors, and those on Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for the poor.
