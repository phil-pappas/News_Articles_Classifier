She took a ride home from school with a motorbike-taxi driver, and he raped her, she says. Traumatized, humiliated, and afraid the rape would mean expulsion from school, she didn't tell anyone. When she found out she was pregnant, she took pills, hemorrhaged, and called her neighbors for help. They ratted her out to the police, who first took her to the hospital and then took her to jail. She didn't have a lawyer.\n Rachel was one of more than 300 Rwandan women jailed for terminating a pregnancy, the sexual and reproductive health and rights group Ipas found in an investigation they conducted from 2013 to 2014. In a new report , the group identified 313 women and girls locked up in five Rwandan prisons, the result of a law criminalizing abortion.\nAbortion has long been outlawed in Rwanda. In 2012, the country liberalized its laws slightly , allowing terminations in cases of rape, incest, forced marriage, fetal anomaly, or risk to the pregnant woman's health, but the procedure remains nearly impossible to obtain legally — a woman seeking an abortion has to get permission from two doctors and a judge, a high barrier for any woman to clear, but especially difficult in a country with just one doctor for every 17,000 people and where abortion remains stigmatized.\n There are an estimated 60,000 abortions in Rwanda every year, nearly all of them illegal. That means for every 1,000 women in the country, 25 have abortions every year — a higher rate than in the U.S. And every year, some 24,000 Rwandan women have abortion-related complications so severe they require medical treatment. In 2012, complications for 18,000 women cost the Rwandan government $1.7 million — 11 percent of the nation's total spending on reproductive health. And when women go to their neighbors for help, they sometimes find themselves reported to the police.\nMost abortions don't end up with the woman going to prison. But when women go to prison in Rwanda, they often go because of abortion.\n\"It was the sheer numbers that were striking to us,\" Gillian Kane, senior policy advisor at Ipas and author of the report, told Cosmopolitan.com. \"About 25 percent [of female inmates] were there for abortion-related crimes. That's significant.\"\nRwanda is a nation still scarred by colonialism and the 1994 genocide it led to, when an estimated 800,000 to 1 million Rwandans , mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered mostly by members of the Hutu majority in a 100-day period while the rest of the world looked on and did little. Today, the country is a development success story: It has the largest proportion of women in parliament in the world due to its gender quota system, corruption is low , child mortality is way down , and street crime is negligible . It also has an authoritarian leader presiding over a state in which opposition politicians sit in jail and journalists sometimes wind up dead. But the nation remains a beneficiary of Western governments and donors, in part out of a desire to not see it return to its ugly history, in part because it's so stable and economically prosperous , and in part because of how effectively the government trumpets its successes in gender equality, with its 64 percent representation of women in parliament.\n\"They have these gender quotas which they observe very mindfully, and post-conflict they've made a huge commitment to gender parity at the congressional level,\" Kane said. \"But it hasn't necessarily translated into progressive policies or supportive policies for women.\"\nWhen one sets foot in Rwanda, there's an immediate sense of extraordinary orderliness — tidy red-roofed houses line the capital's wide well-lit and sidewalked streets, and any plastic bags you bring into the country will be confiscated at the airport so you don't litter and foul up the place. It's sometimes called \"the Singapore of Africa,\" a reference to another tiny, tidy, amazingly orderly, and particularly authoritarian nation. After the genocide, Rwanda became, for good reason, a nation of rules and laws and policing. Breaking the rules often comes at a big cost. But that, advocates say, may contribute to women going to jail for ending their pregnancies.\nThe very systems put into place to help women may also contribute to their imprisonment. Sexual violence and systematic rape were used as tools of war during the genocide, and in the years that followed, violence against women continued. The government responded by forming Community Policing Committees, which are tasked with being accountable to the communities they operate in, and are specifically trained in dealing with gender-based violence and child abuse. But when women break the law by having abortions, those readily available police in communities where breaking the law is taken very seriously can be do more harm to women than good.\n\"After the conflict in Rwanda, there was a really big problem with gender violence, and so they set up these community policing mechanisms, and what these were intended to do was support and safeguard women in the community by partnering with the police,\" Kane said. \"But Rwanda is such an authoritarian place — there's so much fear of breaking the law, and there are good reasons why. I do think having this policing mechanism created a sense of fear that 'here's this criminal activity, I should report it,' instead of, 'here's this woman who is hurt, I need to take her to the hospital.'\"\nAnd it's not wealthy or well-connected women who are being reported, Kane says. It's poor women, sex workers, and other women who are perceived as not comporting themselves properly.\nBut, Kane says, while the numbers of arrests are shocking, it's also important to recognize that compared to the volume of abortions, only a tiny number of women actually face legal penalties — meaning the laws outlawing the procedure are largely impotent.\n\"The important piece to look at is actual abortions versus arrests — that's low,\" Kane said. \"That's the same all over the world. That says two things to us: One, that laws are not actually working, and two, that they aren't being enforced.\"\nBut there are significant due process issues when they are enforced. Some of the women Ipas interviewed should have had access to a legal abortion, because they were raped or because they were minors (in Rwanda, any sex act with a girl under 18 is legally rape), but they didn't know a legal procedure was an option and so had an illegal one. Many others didn't have a lawyer, despite being entitled to one by law.\nRwanda isn't the only country where illegal abortion means women go to jail. Thousands of women have been investigated, arrested, and imprisoned around the world for the crime of ending a pregnancy. But many more than that interface with police and don't actually go to jail but are publicly humiliated. That, Kane says, happens across societies and continents.\n\"It's like it's to teach women a lesson,\" Kane said. \"You bring them in, slap them on the wrist, give them a fine. There's not a commitment to enforcing the law, not really. They're going after women, and in a lot of really terrible circumstances, they go to prison, but mostly they just get shamed.\"\nWhat Ipas is trying to do is generate some legal change, encouraging Rwanda to release the women in custody, eliminate legal barriers to abortion, create a transparent and simple way for women who do qualify for legal abortions to obtain them, invest in preventative measures including contraception and sex education, and allow nurses and midwives instead of only doctors to perform abortions. It may be working: The Rwandan government just announced it may take steps cut through much of the bureaucracy women seeking abortions currently face. ​\nAt the very least, Kane says, the report sheds light on an issue that touches every corner of the globe: the necessity of legal and accessible abortion.\n\"My hope for this report is to at least change the conversation a little bit from the idea of a health issue to a rights, and a rights violation, issue,\" Kane said. \"What does it mean to have abortion be in a criminal code as opposed to a health code? There is no other medical procedure that's regulated through the penal codes at all. It's kind of outrageous.\"\nFollow Jill on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://survivors-fund.org.uk/resources/rwandan-history/statistics/", "http://www.police.gov.rw/news-detail/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1165&cHash=6c431d301b573dfe70ee0ee60d5c2f6d", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3cdd59b0-ded5-11e4-b9ec-00144feab7de.html#axzz3o2yUiN7X", "http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-10-09/193332/", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/paul-kagame-rwanda-success-authoritarian", "http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/which-country-has-highest-proportion-women-parliament", "https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-Abortion-in-Rwanda.html", "http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-09-27/192944/", "https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-10726324", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-32438104", "http://www.ipas.org/en/News/2015/September/New-report-calls-for-release-of-Rwandan-women-and-girls-unjustly-imprisoned-for-abortion.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
