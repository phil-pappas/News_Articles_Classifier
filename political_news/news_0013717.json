What they're saying Joe Biden In this Sept. 16, 2015 file photo, Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Anaheim, Calif. Biden's summer of uncertainty is turning into a fall of indecision, creating doubts about whether he could still be a serious candidate for president in 2016. (Christine Cotter / AP) Comments \nVice President Joe Biden won't be at tonight's Democratic presidential primary debate in Las Vegas, but he'll be part of it anyway. \nA one-minute ad urging Biden to jump into the race began running today on CNN and other national networks, and it may run tonight during the debate coverage. Just saw a \"draft Biden\" commercial on CNN that was more powerful than any candidate's ad I can remember: https://t.co/lhQt02SQPo — Hope Dellon (@hopedellon) October 13, 2015 \nBiden, still grieving for his son Beau, is still undecided about running for president. His staff is researching primary filing deadlines to see if he has more time. The indecision is earning him comparisons to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, known as \"Hamlet on the Hudson'' for all his agonizing over whether to run. \nMaggie Haberman and Peter Baker wrote about Biden's dithering in The New York Times: Mr. Biden has acknowledged that he may be waiting too long. \"I just have to be comfortable that this will be good for the family,\" he told America magazine last month. \"It's not quite there yet and it may not get there in time to make it feasible to be able to run and succeed, because there are certain windows that will close. But if that's it, that's it. But it's not like I can rush it.\" \nSome of those windows begin to close within weeks as filing deadlines approach. But his advisers have concluded that rules in several early primary states are sufficiently flexible that it would be enough if someone on Mr. Biden's behalf notifies them that he might run, not that he formally declare his candidacy. That would allow him more time to make a final decision. \nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, said Monday that she thinks Biden will run. Gillibrand was asked about it at Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women Summit : Q: Do you think Joe Biden will get into the race? \nA: If I was a betting woman, I'd say he would. I think he's always aspired to it. He's been a vice president for a long time. He's been a wonderful public servant who cares deeply about issues, and he's a champion and he wants to fight for his values and his goals for America. \nFive Democrats will be on stage at tonight's debate: frontrunner Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Baltimore mayor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. \nCNN has an extra podium in case Biden shows up. CNN's Jim Acosta tweeted a photo of it. In case of Biden break out podium number 6. Here it is folks. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/27B7ij3IEO — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 12, 2015 \nCBS \"Late Night'' host Stephen Colbert made fun of CNN's \"Joe Biden fever.'' \nBiden is polling well even though he hasn't declared his candidacy. He's running third to Clinton and Sanders in RealClear Politics tracking poll, though Clinton still has a big lead over both. \nBut national polls have Biden winning the general election in matchups with Republicans Donald Trump , Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio , according to RealClear Politics. \nPolitical scientist Daniel W. Drezner, writing in The Washington Post , is throwing cold water on Biden's chances. He offers three reasons: Clinton is not imploding, the media is starting to tire of the Biden story, and Biden can't win. Remember when Rick Perry entered the 2012 race in August, and it was clearly too late for him to do so? Remember Fred Thompson doing the same thing in 2008? And Wes Clark doing the same thing in 2004? Biden would be entering the race much later than that, and at a much more decided disadvantage. Clinton has already won the invisible primary. The moment Biden were to actually become a candidate would be the moment that Democrats and the media remember all the Biden baggage. \nBiden is about as traditional a politician as there is in Washington, D.C. He's not going to run for an office knowing that he cannot win. And he can't win the Democratic Party nomination. Not now. \nMore Biden chatter from Twitter: Draft Biden camp looking a little desperate 12 hours before the first Democratic Debate begins. pic.twitter.com/GW6kBb9C0i — Cypher Ex Machina (@FraaRex) October 13, 2015 Staffers put lives on hold waiting for Joe Biden to make a decision on a presidential run http://t.co/3e634CIbQh pic.twitter.com/Ai1f84yR7G — New York Post (@nypost) October 13, 2015 I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if Joe Biden just decided whether or not to run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:01:46.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
