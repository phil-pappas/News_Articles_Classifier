Electronic media -- including television and radio reporters -- will need to arrive by 9:30 a.m. Thursday and consent to have their equipment screened. Any journalists without electronic devices need to arrive by 10:15 a.m. \nAll reporters will need to enter the building through its entrance for administrative offices (Door 6), on the south side of the IU Auditorium, 1211 E.

Richard Lugar, who served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former Rep. Lee Hamilton, who chaired the House Committee on Foreign Relations and co-chaired the 9-11 Commission. \nThe first part of the luncheon will be open to the media.
