Thakkar | October 12, 2015, 22.59 pm Aamir Khan Aamir Khan’s production house AK Films has so far been synonymous with content-driven films and all of them have been box office successes. From Lagaan to Talaash, Aamir has always ensured that he delivers something new. We hear that recently, he liked a script penned by a new writer Aditi Rao and he has bought it too.\nA source close to the production house told us, “There are a lot of scripts that come to the production office and there are heavy discussions on which ones should reach Aamir’s desk. Aamir read Aditi’s script and really liked it. He wanted to buy it from her but the writer was also keen to direct. Aamir did not agree to that and so it didn’t work out. But we have bought the rights to Aditi’s script and she will also work with the team during the making of the film.”\nIt’s not decided when the film will go on floors. “It will happen organically, we are in no hurry. We also have to lock a director and a cast. Everyone is tightlipped about the story. The film is tentatively titled Barf.”\n entertainment Bollywood Aamir Khan Talaash Also Read Sonakshi Sinha mixes work and play in Houston Happy to work with my friends: Deepak Parambol Ram Charan brings in father Chiranjeevi's 60th birthday with friends and family US court summons Amitabh Bachchan in connection with 1984 anti-Sikh riots", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/13267581.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/13267581.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151012/entertainment-bollywood/article/aamir-khan-buys-script-new-writer", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:59:27.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
