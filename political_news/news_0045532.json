Lincoln Chafee sparked controversy in 2011 when he referred to the greenery in the State Capitol as a 'holiday tree.' Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee is now referring to the festive greenery at the State Capitol in Providence as a Christmas tree but he isn't going to attend the lighting of the tree this year.\nChafee gave in to calling it by the traditional title after the public outcry last year for his insistence in referring to it as a \"holiday\" tree, following precedent set by previous governors who promoted the state's tradition of religious plurality.\n\"Because I do not think how we address the Statehouse tree affects our 'lively experiment,' this year's invitation calls the tree a Christmas tree,\" he now says about avoiding a scandal in 2013.\nChafee says the secular term for the symbol \"became a focal point for too much anger,\" and he has stepped away from the ritual entirely by tasking Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis with lighting the 2013 State House Christmas tree on Thursday.\nChafee and his wife will be out of town for the occasion. The governor will be speaking at Princeton University.\nGuests from the Statehouse — including members of the governor's staff and employees from the Secretary of State's Office — will be present for the occasion, Mollis' office said.\nThe 2013 tree is a Blue Spruce that stands 17-foot-6, donated by Sal and Nancy DeFazio of Western Cranston, R.I.\nThe small state has been the center of a huge controversy over a seemingly simple custom also practiced at the U.S. Capitol, the White House, Rockefeller Center and town squares across the country.\nChafee, a Republican turned Democrat, made a point to highlight the different ways the season is celebrated without making mention of the word \"Christmas\" in the announcement of the event in 2011 .\nThe failure to include Christmas in the celebration sparked protests at the 2011 affair.\nSteven Senne/ASSOCIATED PRESS Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee says not using the term 'Christmas tree' caused too much anger — and he still doesn't think it matters what the tree is called. Though \"Christmas\" wasn't included in his statement, he and his wife, Stephanie, did ensure Santa and Mrs. Claus were represented.\nIn 2012, Chafee stood by his guns and again referred to the symbol generically as a holiday tree but given the controversy, the Statehouse did not host an official tree-lighting event and instead invited local children's choirs to perform.\nIn 2013, the local government decided to resurrect the ritual — sans Chafee.\n\"Secretary of State Mollis has offered to light the tree, and I have accepted his gracious offer,\" the governor said about the 2013 festivities.\nBishop Thomas Tobin, head of the Diocese of Providence, publicly asked the governor in 2012 to refer to it as a Christmas tree, and he commended Chafee for the change of heart this year.\n\"Hopefully the presence of a 'Christmas tree' at the Statehouse will speak the true meaning of this special season and will allow us all to enjoy the blessings of peace, joy and fellowship with one another,\" Tobin said in a statement.\nThe Rhode Island pol, who previously served in the U.S. Senate, insists that starting in the '90s, Rhode Island governors referred to the \"holiday\" tree as a nod to the state's founder, protestant theologian Roger Williams, who is heralded as a \"champion for religious freedom.\"\nChafee, 60, is not running for re-election when his term ends in January 2015.\nllarson@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories White House Christmas Tree arrives by carriage Rick Santorum’s first film debuts in theaters Families will go light-crazy on ABC's 'The Great Christmas Light Fight'", "external_links": ["http://www.ri.gov/press/view/15309"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:08:48.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
