Featuring screenings and discussions, the forum will bring together experts and audiences to examine the state of narrative and documentary history film as vehicles for teaching and interpreting history. Tickets are available beginning Oct. 9 .\nThe inaugural History Film Forum will ask the question \"When do films offer 'good' history?\" and examine the boundaries of history as entertainment. The forum will include screenings of Ron Howard's latest film In the Heart of the Sea and Ric Burns' new documentary The Pilgrims , as well as a discussion with writer/director Gary Ross ( Hunger Games , Seabiscuit ) and historians about Ross' upcoming feature film, The Free State of Jones, a Civil War story about relatively unknown historical hero Newt Knight , who led the secession of Jones County, Miss. , from the Confederacy. Other discussions will include examining the legacy of The Birth of a Nation on its 100th anniversary with public radio's \"BackStory with the History Guys.\" A full schedule and ticket information are available at http://historyfilmforum.si.edu .\n\"Millions of people enter history through movies and other entertainment,\" said John Gray , director of the National Museum of American History. \"The History Film Forum will examine how history filmmaking reveals both truth and myth and how we as a society view ourselves.\"\nThe forum was made possible through an agreement between the Smithsonian and NEH. NEH has provided $309,000 to produce two film forums in 2015 and 2016.\n\"Over the last 50 years, NEH has supported nearly 800 films,\" said NEH Chairman William Adams . \"We strongly believe that documentary films have the power to bring us closer to the past and, in their own way, create new history. We are proud to partner with the Smithsonian on the History Film Forum to explore how films have shaped our nation and ourselves.\"\nIn addition, forum attendees will have the opportunity to see additional first-run documentaries from producer Stanley Nelson , the Smithsonian Channel and Yahoo News, as well as participate in discussions. The forum also will include a teacher workshop aimed at offering tools and tips for more effectively incorporating movies in the study of history for middle and high school students.
