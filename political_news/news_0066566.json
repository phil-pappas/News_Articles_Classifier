After three years of campaigning, a coalition of activists, celebrities and civil society representatives crowded into the Brazilian Congress last week. They were there to submit a bill calling for an end to deforestation—for good.\nMore than 70 coalition members poured into Congress. Behind them, a mural made up of thousands of photographs of people who were part of the campaign declared “Zero Deforestation Now!” But this group was just a tiny fraction of those behind the bill.\nThe coalition was there to represent the 1.4 million Brazilians who co-signed in support of Zero Deforestation.\nSubmitting this legislation to Brazilian Congress marks an important step towards attaining zero deforestation in Brazil . But why is such a mass movement needed?\nWhy we need Zero Deforestation\nEven though the Amazon is home to more than 24 million people, including many Indigenous Peoples, it is still being deforested at a rapid rate. Right now, 700,000 football fields-worth of forest trees are cut down every year.\nAnd the effects of deforestation stretch beyond the boundaries of the Amazon. Deforestation can even change rain patterns .\nThe destruction and degradation of the forest, hand in hand with climate change, could also lead to prolonged droughts. In fact, if deforestation continues at its current pace, agricultural production in Brazil could suffer losses of up to R $7.4 billion (€1.7 billion) by 2020. Rainfall shortages could also affect the supply of water to cities.\nThere is no need to rip apart this critical ecosystem. Brazil has enough square footage to double agricultural production without cutting down any more trees. And it’s clear the costs are high to farmers and urbanites alike. Still, deforestation continues.\nThe future of the Amazon\nDespite all the evidence showing the dangers of clearing the Amazon, deforestation is still allowed by law.\nBut there is hope. This bill symbolises the start of a crucial discussion for Brazil, a unified front from all sectors of society, and an agreement to stop viewing the forest as an obstacle to development but rather as essential for the future the planet, the country and the climate.\nJoin the 1.4 million Brazilians who co-signed this landmark bill, and support an end to deforestation in the Amazon.\nMaïa Booker is a Multimedia Editor for the Americas at Greenpeace.", "external_links": ["http://news.mongabay.com/2014/12/tropical-deforestation-could-disrupt-rainfall-globally/", "http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/forests/amazon/"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:16.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
