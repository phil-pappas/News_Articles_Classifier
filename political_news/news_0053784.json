Veteran Senator Isabel Allende said she preferred the idea of a plebiscite giving the population the chance to decide what mechanism they prefer.\nThe political opposition, however, accused Bachelet of seeking to divert attention away from her historically low approval rates , which dropped to 22 percent in August, and warned that drawing up a new constitution could unsettle the country.\n\"The recurring issue about legitimacy rooted in the constitution's undemocratic origin is not enough,\" senator Hernán Larraín told a local news channel. \"Writing a new constitution would generate institutional instability that would be very harmful.\" Larraín is the president of the Independent Democratic Union Party whose founder was among the designers of the 1980s constitution.\nRelated: The Soldiers Who Set Two Chilean Protesters on Fire in 1986 Will Finally Face Charges\nPolitical analyst Kenneth Bunker told VICE News that the constitutional project was too big a challenge for Bachelet to successfully tackle in the current political climate.\n\"It would be better for Bachelet to leave this task for the next government,\" he said. \"She has too much on her plate now, and she does not have the support to do it by herself.\"\nBachelet's popularity problems are associated with a slew of corruption scandals involving most political parties, businessmen and the president's son.\nAttorney General Sabas Chahuán decided in February to personally lead the investigations into corruption and has subsequently put several important politicians in pre-trial detention.\nThe scandals have also helped ensure that trust in all Chile's political parties is even lower than President Bachelet's approval ratings, scraping just 3 percent in a poll carried out in August this year.\nPresident Bachelet created the Anti-Corruption Presidential Advisory Council last March in an effort to show she was taking the scandals seriously. One month later the council presented proposals to change the way political parties are funded and guard against corruption, but these have faced opposition in Congress.\nÁlvaro Castañón, a member of the Council, told VICE News that it would be a mistake to draw up a new constitution before the new regulations are in place.\n\"The legitimacy of our current Congress is at rock bottom,\" he said. \"A reform [of the political party regulations] is needed to tackle the crisis of confidence in order for the process of creating a new constitution to be carried out well.\"\nRelated: Chile's Bachelet 'Redirects Attention' From Corruption Scandals With Call For a New Constitution\nFollow Nicolas Rios on Twitter: @nicorios", "external_links": ["http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/archivo_6053_3756/EncuestaCEP_Agosto2015.pdf", "https://www.df.cl/noticias/economia-y-politica/gobierno/cadem-aprobacion-de-bachelet-consolida-un-cambio-positivo-respecto-a-su-punto-mas-bajo/2015-10-13/092554.html", "https://twitter.com/nicorios"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:59:07.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
