Long-Shot Candidate Aims to be Businesswoman-in-Chief Carly Fiorina Speaks at CPAC. Getty Images By Dustin Hawkins \nIn 2010, Carly Fiorina made a long-shot bid for the US Senate against 3-term incumbent Barbara Boxer in hopelessly liberal California. Though she lost 52-42%, she cut Boxer's margin of victory in half from her previous general election victory in 2004. That was Fiorina's first flirtation with electoral politics. Her second? The United States Presidential election in 2016. \nBusiness Career \nFiorina became the first woman CEO of a Fortune 20 company when she took over the top spot at Hewlitt-Packard in 1999. She remained the chief executive until she resigned in 2005. Prior to that, Fiorina spent two decades working from the bottom to close to the top at AT&T and Lucent. Fiorina's business experience would have both positives and negatives in a campaign. On the plus side, her hard work got her to the top. Though she has never held political office, her experience as CEO gives her as much executive experience as her potential rivals with \"Governor\" preceding their names. \nBut her business experience isn't necessarily a plus, as 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney learned . Unfortunately in politics, the bad always gets more press than the good. And when you are a danger to the narrative - a strong independent Republican woman, for instance - the bad will be made to seem much worse than it is. The media will trot out endless former employees and co-workers who will call her tenure a disaster. There will be attacks on her views on globalization, the off-shoring of jobs, and every minor squabble will be revealed. It's a shame about modern politics: the more successful you are, the more ammunition people have against you. \nCountering Hillary \nThe 2016 Republican field is set to be the most diverse political field ever. Current and likely existing candidates include Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz, Ben Carson , Bobby Jindal, and Carly Fiorina. They will possibly join honorary Hispanic Jeb Bush, the college degree-free Scott Walker, and conservatarian Rand Paul for the right to take on Hillary. So far, Fiorina is the only major female candidate expected to enter the race, with governors Nikki Haley and Susana Martinez apparently taking a pass. \nEarly on, Fiorina has been one of the more passionate critics of Clinton, noting that collecting titles isn't really an accomplishment. She has also attacked the lame War on Women narrative that the Democrats are hoping to cling to through at least 2016. She will be able to go where many of her fellow Republicans might not be able to. After all, the media and left has already switched gears from calling any critics \"racist\" to \"sexist\" because some things never change. \nWhere she stands \nRight now, Fiorina has a long ways to go to break the glass ceiling. She is generating some positive buzz with her fiery and pointed attacks on Hillary Clinton, but has been crowded out by the field at large. There is quite a bit of noise that she may be auditioning for the role of vice-president as much as she is for president. Predictably, the left has already tried to pin her down as \"the next Sarah Palin.\" But the same negatives that would be used against her as a presidential nominee would make her an unlikely choice. \nThough she may neutralize the gender factor against a candidate Hillary, she also minimizes some of Hillary's negatives. She will be one of the older candidates in the Republican field at a time when many voters have a desire to go younger and where youth could be an advantage. She will also easily be the wealthiest candidate, having amassed a small fortune. This, combined with the other real-or-imagined \"baggage\" of running a major company, could neautralize many of the negatives also associated with Hillary. \nPath to the Nomination \nFiorina will gain some exposure for being the only woman in the field. What will be difficult for her is to peel away voters from one of the most impressive and diverse fields in history. On the more establishment side, Jeb Bush has locked down all of the Bush loyalists. The rest on the establishment side are likely already deciding between Walker, Christie, Rubio, and Governor John Kasich of Ohio, who has some regional advantages in early primary states. \nOn the conservative grassroots side of the aisle, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Scott Walker, Ben Carson, and Marco Rubio are all battling for votes . It just seems like a very tough environment from a political unknown with no political experience to breakthrough. Anything can happen - especially in Iowa - but she would need to land some serious knock-out punches in the debates to make a breakthrough. \nNo matter what, Fiorina is poised to make the 2016 race a little bit more interesting. With many unique voices with different experiences showing off the reinvigorated Republican Party, Fiorina is sure to be a welcome addition to the field.
