Rubio, a first-term U.S. senator from Florida, outlined plans to cut personal and business taxes, repeal and replace Obamacare and reform Social Security and Medicare for non-seniors. “If we can do these things … we’re not going to have an economic recovery, we are going to have an economic renaissance,” said Rubio, 44. “That’s the promise of this new economy. It’s disruptive … but so was the industrial revolution.” Roughly 130 people attended the town hall event, which was Rubio’s first campaign stop in Dover. He was introduced by Johnnie Koromilas of Dover, who compared Rubio to former President Ronald Reagan. Rubio opened the event with a 20-minute speech focused on rebuilding the American economy and protecting the American dream. The speech also touched on his personal story as the son of Cuban immigrants who moved to the U.S. in 1956. Afterward, he took questions for about 45 minutes. He described his tax plan, which would cut taxes for businesses and allow companies to write-off certain investments. Under the plan, personal income taxes would fall to 15 percent for most people and 35 percent for the wealthiest Americans. “The end result is over 90-some-odd percent of Americans will see a substantial reduction in their taxes, and every taxpayer across every bracket would see an increase in their after-tax income under our plan,” he said. Rubio criticized the Obama Administration on several fronts, particularly the nation’s “confusing” foreign policy. He said cuts to the military threaten national security and show weakness to our enemies. If elected, he promised to revamp the U.S. Army and solidify our place as the world’s military superpower. Rubio, who lives in Miami, acknowledged rising sea levels, but said leading climate change prescriptions would not solve the problem. He wants the U.S. to lead in renewable energy as well as oil and gas production, and believes American innovation can find solutions to climate change. “What I am not for is unilateral American policies or global policies for that matter that hurt our country economically, because then we are hurting people who are trying to make it,” he said. On immigration, an area in which he has faced criticism from some Republicans, Rubio called for a three-step plan that starts with securing the border to stem illegal immigration. Secondly, he wants to modernize the legal immigration system to make it easier for people who can contribute to the economy to move here. The third piece would create a work permit program for many of the 11 or 12 million undocumented people who already live here. These people would need to pass a background check, pay a fine and agree to learn English to qualify. After a decade or more, work permit holders could apply for permanent resident status. “We can’t even get to that third spot until we have done the other two things,” he said, adding that immigration reform cannot be dealt with all at once. Rubio said systemic changes are necessary to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent for younger workers. These could include raising the retirement age and replacing Medicare with private insurance. He does not support cuts to current retirees. Rubio wants to replace Obamacare with a new nationwide system of private insurance that moves away from employer-sponsored plans. Instead, companies could give workers pre-tax money to buy health insurance from any U.S. company. Despite recent consolidation among major U.S. health insurers, Rubio said this would lead to innovation and competition in the health insurance industry. Meanwhile, states or the federal government would create a high-risk pool for the sickest Americans. Rubio also called for reforms to address the rising cost of prescription drugs, particularly steps to bring more generic drugs to market. He also said Americans should be able to take effective drugs from overseas that are not yet approved by the U.S. government. Recent poll averages show Rubio running in fourth place nationally and in third or fourth place in New Hampshire, which holds its presidential primary in February. Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina lead the GOP field in most polls. Although many who attended Wednesday’s event are still making up their minds, Rubio seemed to make a good impression. Dover resident Dawn Harding likes Trump, but is intrigued by Rubio’s candidacy. She considers Rubio to be hardworking and genuine. Julie Brown of Rochester appreciated that Rubio seemed to answer questions honestly. “When you ask him a question, he tells you the truth,” she said. “That’s what you want to hear.” Rubio met with voters and posed for photos from behind a retractable barrier. He also signed baseballs and copies of his memoir. And, he suggested this won’t be his last visit to the Seacoast. “Here’s the good news: It’s October. It’s New Hampshire. I’ll be back quite often,” he said. By Casey Conley", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:41:39.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
