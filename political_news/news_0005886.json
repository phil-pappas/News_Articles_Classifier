Proponents of the law say it's needed to protect minorities.\nSome members of Congress have tried updating the law, but those efforts have stalled in the Republican-led Congress.\n\"There's been dramatic improvement in access to voting -- exponentially better improvement,\" Bush said. \"I don't think there's a role for the federal government to play in most places -- there could be some -- in most places where they did have a constructive role in the '60s, so I don't support reauthorizing it as is.\"\nHillary Clinton has blasted Republicans opposed to the law's reauthorization.\n\"And it is just wrong -- it's wrong -- to try to prevent, undermine and inhibit Americans' right to vote,\" Clinton said in June. \"What is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people and young people from one end of our country to the other.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:32:17.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
