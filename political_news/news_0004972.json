Broadcaster NTV said it had come 3 km (1.9 miles) into Turkish air space.\n“It’s a drone. We are trying to identify its nationality,” a senior Turkish government official told Reuters .\nA US official told Reuters that Washington suspected it was a Russian drone, but said the information was still preliminary and declined to give any more details.\nRussian jets violated Turkish air space on two occasions earlier this month and Turkey has warned it will respond if the incursions are repeated. \nRussia’s air strikes in Syria mean that Russian and Nato planes are now flying combat missions in the same air space for the first time since World War Two, heightening concern that the Cold War enemies could fire on each other.\nThe Russian air force officially informed the Turkish military on Thursday about the violations by Russian jets earlier this month, and about steps it would take to prevent a repetition.\nTurkey has also reported unidentified aircraft and Syria-based missile air defence systems harassing its warplanes several times in recent months.
