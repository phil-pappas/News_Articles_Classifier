Photo: Vin Diesel\nLast week, the tabloids sneered at Vin Diesel when he was photographed shirtless on his hotel balcony, smoking a cigarette. They didn't sneer because of the smoke — they took issue with his physique, joking that he was \" showing his softer side. \" We knew what it was: a dadbod .\nVin Diesel giving off dad bod vibes pic.twitter.com/dzjU60kWYk\n— Emily Kern (@EmilyKern5) October 7, 2015 Vin — ever the #happycreative optimist and deep soul — would not have it. On Instagram yesterday he teased us with a photo of himself fully clothed (a preview, if you will), saying, \" It is amazing the response from the journalists who I have been talking to for the last two days in New York. Today one wanted to see the dad bod. Haha. I am wondering if I should show the picture ... Body-shaming is always wrong! What do you think? #LastWitchHunter.\"\nThen we all chanted, \"Show us. Show us. Show us !\"\nAnd above we have an updated, slightly painted-on look from Vin to prove that all bodies are good bodies.\nSo Vin stands up for the dadbods, but wants us to know that he still has a #radbod. We can live with the contradiction.", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/p/8tT1RcGPnf/embed/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3262544/Vin-Diesel-48-shows-softer-whips-shirt-Miami.html", "http://t.co/dzjU60kWYk", "https://instagram.com/p/8rqAf-mPuh/", "http://instagram.com/p/8rqAf-mPuh/embed/", "https://twitter.com/EmilyKern5/status/651549317422034944"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:28:37.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
