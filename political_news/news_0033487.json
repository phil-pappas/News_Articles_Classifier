Do you have any idea or links as to when Global Warming will effect the United States ? It better hurry up. cc2012 and kelly4 like this. The satellite view of the storm is amazing and nerve-wracking at the same time. Click to expand... OddBall1st Well-Known Member Robot A said to Robot B, Do you know what Global Warming was ? Robot B replied,.... It was the 30 year period when the Earth warmed slightly before cooling for 30,000 years and wiping humans out. abandonconflict Well-Known Member Oddball spamming because the strongest hurricane ever recorded is about to hit Mexico and he doesn't know what else to say. 5 posts in a row, complete meltdown. ttystikk Well-Known Member When I was a kid I'd visit my grandparents in south Texas. I'd track the hurricanes every summer... some of which ended up hitting our house. Contrary to the assumptions of those who've never experienced one, a hurricane is far from over when the wind stops blowing. It can take months to clear streets, repair plumbing infrastructure and return electrical service- during which time residents are either on their own or evacuated and unable to do anything at all. Hurricanes are scary headline makers, but I promise that it's the aftermath that really sucks about them. Just ask Katrina victims. green217 , ginwilly and 757growin like this.

Not so with cold core storms. You must mention that because the people in Milwaukee are scared to death of one.
