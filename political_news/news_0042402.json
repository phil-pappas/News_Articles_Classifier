The supervisors and Sheriff Laurie Smith had announced the \"Blue Ribbon Commission on Improving Custody Operations'' after the three guards were charged with murder in the death of 31-year-old inmate Michael Tyree and with assaulting another inmate. \n\"We do not believe the Blue Ribbon Commission meetings are the appropriate forum to hear specific complaints about treatment in the county's correctional facilities,'' the report posted on the board's meeting-agenda website states. \"Former inmates and their family members will be afforded the opportunity to connect privately with the appropriate county staff as such complaints have the potential to result in criminal and/or personnel investigations and should not be discussed in an public session.'' \nCounty Executive Jeff Smith said the administration is acting responsibly by recommending a prudent course, leaving it to the supervisors to make the final call. \n\"We're trying to figure out how to do the public-information collection and not create a huge number of lawsuits,'' Smith said. Advertisement \nA spokesman for Sheriff Laurie Smith said she opposes the ban. \n\"I support a blue ribbon commission that is investigatory in nature, has outside independence and legal advice, and is a forum for all stakeholders to voice any issue or concern with our custody operations,'' Smith said in an email. \"It is only then that this independent commission can make meaningful recommendations for policy makers to act. \nThe proposal was roundly rejected by civil rights activists. Calling the proposal \"ludicrous,'' LaDoris Cordell, a retired Superior Court judge and San Jose's former independent police auditor, urged the board of supervisors to veto it. \n\"How can the commission recommend policy when they won't know the nature of the complaints,'' Cordell said. \"If they set it up this way, this won't be an independent blue-ribbon commission. It will be a political whitewash, just a public relations ploy.'' \n\"This is ridiculous,'' said Raj Jayadev, coordinator for the social justice group De-Bug. \"If this commission is to have any integrity, the commissioners have to hear the actual experiences of the people complaining.''
