You know, there haven't been a lot of people that have gone on from speaker to the White House, so I'd hate to lose him as a potential contender down the road for the White House. But he is such a man of such talent and such integrity and character that he's a real resource for the country,\" Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"\nJUST WATCHED Will Paul Ryan run for House speaker?

The battle could possibly go on for weeks with no clear front-runner to get the 218 votes needed on the floor to become speaker\n\"From my own standpoint, I see Paul as one of the people coming along that has the potential to lead our country. And if he became speaker of the House in the near-term, that's also a crucial role,\" Romney said.\nBut he said suggestions that Ryan is too liberal aren't ultimately helpful for the Republican Party in the long run.\n\"There are some in our party who think the best approach is throwing bombs. The problem with bomb-throwing so far is that most of the bombs have landed on our own team. That doesn't help,\" he said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-large-169.jpg", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151009110224-paul-ryan-congress-medium-plus-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:14:58.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
