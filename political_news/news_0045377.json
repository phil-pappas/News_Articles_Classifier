A Twitter account supposedly under the teen’s control further threatened this afternoon to “release cia workers, social security numbers, names and phone numbers” once its reaches 200 followers.\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm whether they think the claims are genuine or how recently Brennan has used an AOL account. But the claims emerged amid continuing worries about breaches of federal data and disputes about whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server compromised national security.\nThe alleged hacker told the New York Post he also got into the online Comcast account of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The Twitter account has linked to the purported call logs of Deputy National Security Advisor Avril Haines and Brennan's AOL contact list .\nBrennan’s email account supposedly contained a 47-page application for a top-secret clearance, as well as the “Social Security numbers and personal information of more than a dozen top American intelligence officials,” the Post said.\nThe CIA is “aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities,” a spokesman said. DHS spokesman S.Y. Lee said the department has seen the reports, but “as a matter of policy, we do not comment on the Secretary’s personal security.” The FBI had no comment.\nVerizon said it is “aware” of the report.\nThe Post said the “hacker” described himself as an American high school student who is not Muslim, but who is motivated by opposition to U.S. foreign policy and support for Palestine.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://cryptbin.com/suNQhy#d5021186ddb95fa44c34a3164872aa92", "https://pastee.org/m9nwa", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/18/stoner-high-school-student-says-he-hacked-the-cia/", "https://twitter.com/_CWA_"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:47:44.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
