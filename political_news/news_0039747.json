Where? It seems like pretty much everyone has been talking about the federal election since August, both in real life (ahem, IRL) and on social media, and we've got the hashtags to prove it. Which hashtag were you? \nFirst Nations #RockTheVote \nWhat started as an effort to raise voter engagement on Whitedog reserve in northern Ontario has become a national conversation to engage Indigenous voters. Deanna Carpenter and Kirk Cameron started holding voter registration clinics together, helping their community with community outreach, collecting promotional materials from candidates themselves, and helping first-time voters along the way. First Nations, Metis, and Inuit voters have been encouraged to join in and post on social media using #rockthevote, along with post-vote selfies, of course. #RockTheIndigenousVote and #fnpoli have also been active I'm Nlaka'pamux and I am voting! #FNRTV \n— Bevin Avlier (@MrsAvlier) September 10, 2015 Thanks to @Jbthefirstlady for this important message. Your vote matters! https://t.co/2fkO1tqqfQ #RockTheIndigenousVote #elxn42 \n— A4W Live (@A4WLive) October 15, 2015 We just voted, and you should too. In advance or on Oct 19 #elxn42 #voteTRC #RockTheIndigenousVote #youthvote pic.twitter.com/PmO5RcHUO5 \n— Wab Kinew (@WabKinew) October 9, 2015 #GoVote \nEarly adopters united on the Thanksgiving long weekend to vote in advance polling, and couldn't resist documenting their voting pride on social media to give others voting FOMO. The results were spectacular – 3.6 million people voted in four days.

Even though they're under the legal voting age, that hasn't stopped them from participating in mock elections. Only time will tell if their results mirror the rest of the country’s. #studentvote15 Friday was a great day for students to experience democracy. There was a lot of excitement in the air pic.twitter.com/R0nSBOi888 \n— Andre Kozak (@mganhdi) October 18, 2015 We are not sure if adults get this excited to vote...but they should! #studentvote15 # ugdsb @TaylorEvansPS pic.twitter.com/q5XDre54GW \n— 7A - Taylor Evans PS (@7ATweets) October 16, 2015 Thanks to @studentvote the students are busy running our classroom polling station! #studentvote15 @gecdsbpro pic.twitter.com/cGuxERCxw7 \n— J.Authier (@MsAuthier) October 16, 2015 \n#Elxn42 Speaks Volumes \nAs the defacto election hashtag, #elxn42 is bursting with all aspects of the voting conversation. But we all know wit triumphs over all. By weighing in using 140 characters or less, Canadians made the Internet equivalent of micdrops across social media. The absence of your vote for what you believe in amplifies the impact of a vote representing something you don't believe in. #ELXN42 \n— Rocky Jain (@ShadesOfJain) October 16, 2015 Go ahead, throw your vote away! #elxn42 pic.twitter.com/zBcGTXwJCw \n— Jeremy Barker (@PoppedCulture) October 18, 2015 It's a few minutes to shape the next four years. #elxn42 #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/19B9ZKckDK \n— HuffPost Canada (@HuffPostCanada) October 12, 2015 \n(Aw, c'mon, we had to!) \n#Elxn42VoterPickupLines \nWhat campaign would be complete without some suave one-liners? @laurby what does that mean \n— CPC, NDP, no!

Reynolds (@ModernGinger) October 14, 2015 I'd like to plant a sign on your lawn #elxn42pickuplines \n— Peter Friesen (@friesenp) October 14, 2015 You're first past the post...in my heart. #elxn42pickuplines \n— Ben Johnson (@Ben_T_Johnson) October 14, 2015 \nThere's sure to be more hastag fun post-election. #HappyVoting, Canada!
