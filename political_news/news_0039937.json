Harry Reid (D-NV) and a coalition of deep-pocketed liberal groups, including a pair of super PACs backing Hillary Clinton have been holding strategic meetings for months examining the 2016 map and plotting attacks against the powerful Koch brothers network, according to Politico. A key organizer of the effort, David Brock will present his findings tomorrow, using polling and research, to the Senate Democratic Caucus. The Koch brothers network of conservative mega-donors plans to spend a staggering $889 million for the 2016 presidential race. Brock believes that highlighting the massive political spending of the Koch brothers network is a critical component of boosting Democratic candidates, including Clinton, in 2016. In August, the billionaire brothers held a donor conference in California, in which several of the top presidential candidatesformer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (who has now withdrawn from the race) and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorinaflocked to the event to seek donations. This led Donald Trump to call these candidates puppets of the Koch brothers. Weve proven in the long run that theyre interested in one thing: Their bottom line. Theyre trying to buy the country, they want to become Americas oligarchs, Reid told Politico. Reid has repeatedly called out the Koch brothers for buying elections and being one of the main causes of climate change. The Koch brothers have launched a so-called war on renewables, using their advocacy groups, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), to try and pass bills in states that repeal renewable energy standards. Theyve had some success in West Virginia, Ohio and Kansas. It's about time we took out the Koch Brothers. We don't want them to be our Kings anymore than we want Born again evangelism to be our only religious cult.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:42:13.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
