The technology is outpacing the mainstream consumer market, but the industry remains hopeful. A trade show attendee examines various MakerBot 3D printers at the International Consumer Electronics Show on Jan. 8, 2014, in Las Vegas.\nBy Tom Risen Oct. 16, 2015 | 1:01 p.m. EDT + More The fields of medicine, space travel, manufacturing and education are being transformed by the ability to create low-cost machine parts and products with 3-D printers, but it could be a long while before the devices end up in homes across America.\nThe ability to create three-dimensional objects using the printers has taken a leap forward in recent years, as binding solutions have made it easier to create metal machine parts or plastics. MakerBot Industries, which launched in 2009, is among the companies that began selling machines the size of a desktop computer to businesses and individual consumers alike during the past decade.\nThe Brooklyn-based company now has offices in numerous countries and hopes to create more uses for the printers – but demand for the machines is “not growing as fast as expected,” says MakerBot spokesman Johan-Till Broer. After failing to meet its sales goals, MakerBot had significant layoffs in April and again early this month, when it shed 20 percent of its staff. The company does not disclose its official number of employees.\n[ READ: 3-D Printing Makes a Mark on Engineering Education ]\n“The layoffs were the absolute last resort for us and are painful for everyone,” Broer says. “MakerBot over the last couple of years has grown very, very fast. In that process we have also become very fractured as an organization. … Part of this restructuring is to realign the team.”\nMakerBot is not the only company that's been hurt by the lack of mainstream demand for the novel technology. In 2013, numerous publicly traded 3-D printing companies – including ExOne, 3D Systems, Organovo Holdings, Voxeljet and Stratasys, which is MakerBot’s parent company – saw their share prices rise, only to watch them steadily decline and lose more than half of their value starting in early 2014.\nDespite that apparent bubble-burst, the growth of the 3-D printing sector is still very real, says Tim Greene, a research director at the International Data Corporation. Greene predicts sales of the machines will grow around 30 percent per year in the U.S. between 2014 and 2019. Gartner, another market research firm, predicts that shipments of 3-D printers will double each year between 2015 and 2018.\nThe technology holds promise for a host of industries. Hospitals, for example, can employ 3-D printers to make model hearts for surgeons to practice on, or to create prosthetic limbs for handicapped patients. NASA, meanwhile, has used a printer on the International Space Station to make a wrench, showing the potential for space agencies to use the technology in lieu of the $10,000 per pound it costs to send something into orbit.\nThese and other capabilities have led to the creation of at least 160 3-D printer companies worldwide, with more than half of them competing in the U.S., Greene says.\n(Click to enlarge). On the flip side, however, Greene says he is “not a big believer in the 3-D printer consumer market,” as mainstream users consist mainly of designers and hobbyists making art projects like figurines. While printer companies tout the possibility of using a machine at home to create replacement parts for appliances like lawn mowers or refrigerators, Greene says he's skeptical the average Joe or Jane will buy in.\n“Is there such a need for it that you wouldn’t just go buy a part at Home Depot instead, or have them print one out for you if they have a machine?” he asks.\n[ ALSO: 3-D Printing Becomes Accessible for High School Teachers ]\nThe industry is working to lower the price of 3-D desktop printers to help them gain mainstream acceptance. But repeat sales could be a challenge along with affordability, Greene says, as the machines don’t need to be constantly replaced. Printers for the home can cost anywhere from $300 to $3,000, but MakerBot sells its Replicator Mini printer for $1,375, which is a common price range for entry-level models sold by the industry.\nMany companies also sell machines able to use various kinds of material that can be molded by the printers into plastic, ceramic or even metal objects, and are not tailored to one specific company's machine.\nBut that means they're potentially missing out on more revenue, Greene says.\nRELATED\nHow 3-D Printing Will Revolutionize Prosthetics “Over time, I think we are going to see a lot of companies that are open start to close up [the ability to use supplies from other businesses] so they can capture some of the polymer supply revenue,\" he says.\nOne company that seems to be growing faster than the rest of the industry is Colorado-based Aleph Objects Inc., which has worked to be open-source and remains optimistic about the potential to sell to everyday consumers. The 90-employee startup is the parent company of the LulzBot 3-D printer product line and has seen its total revenue grow 800 percent during the past two years, company spokesman Harris Kenny says.\nAleph’s industrial customers include Fortune 500 companies like automakers that “are gradually rolling out our machines in more of their departments,” Kenny says. But while the firm counts individual consumers as 47 percent of its sales base, he admits “we don’t know yet what a mainstream user looks like.”\n“Is the 3-D printer going to evolve like a microwave, which everyone has, or a lawn mower, which some people use?” he ponders.\nMakerBot predicts that the market for 3-D printers will grow like personal computers did through the 1980s, when Broer says schools were early adopters that taught kids how to use them before they eventually became a more convenient household device.\n“We are already in more than 5,000 schools in the U.S.,” Broer says. “We think the education market will help us get to consumers.”\nTAGS: technology space space station NASA hospitals", "external_links": ["http://3dprint.com/73359/aleph-objects-lulzbot-revenue/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=3-D%20Printing%20May%20Save%20Lives%2C%20but%20Can%20It%20Make%20Money%3F", "http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3117917", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=3-D%20Printing%20May%20Save%20Lives%2C%20but%20Can%20It%20Make%20Money%3F", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=3-D%20Printing%20May%20Save%20Lives%2C%20but%20Can%20It%20Make%20Money%3F&summary=The%20technology%20is%20outpacing%20the%20mainstream%20consumer%20market%2C%20but%20the%20industry%20remains%20hopeful.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2015/10/08/makerbot-reorganizes-to-adapt-to-market-dynamics-and-prepare-for-the-future?siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-QmUVZvx8uP53ILqchysyeg&ls_affid=TnL5HPStwNw", "http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25958315", "http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2887417", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ykk%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:26:43.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
