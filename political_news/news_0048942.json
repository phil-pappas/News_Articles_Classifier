The report says four out of every 10 people in the world, particularly those in Africa and Asia , do not have clean water to drink.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278618-INFO\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278617LOGO\nToday, Water For Life ( bewaterforlife.org ) announces its campaign to raise funds and awareness to support its global clean water initiatives to bring sustainable access to clean water by delivering high-tech water filters to families, schools, orphanages and entire villages.\nWater For Life has partnered with Sawyer to provide Personal MINI water filters for pledges that provide Family filters to suffering families, through Indiegogo . In its first few days, Water For Life has already achieved its initial goal of $25,000 to deliver 500 filters to Cambodia and is working on securing funds to send filters to Kenya and India as additional goals.\n\"Clean water is a basic human need, but not available to 1.4 billion people around the world,\" says Water for Life founder, Rudy Shaffer . \"I have traveled to many countries where children are in desperate need of safe drinking water. This high-tech filter is a sustainable solution to supply clean, safe drinking water and directly affects the children that are dying each day from water borne diseases. We see the immediate difference and impact in people's lives from this amazing technology.\"\nThe Personal MINI filters available in the campaign are perfect for hiking, camping, traveling and for emergency use during natural disasters. These are the lightest, smallest and most efficient water filters on the planet. Each Personal MINI filter can purify up to 100,000 gallons of clean drinking water from any freshwater lake, river or stream, filtering out 99.9 percent of water borne diseases.\nA single Family filter has the same filter technology as the MINI with the capability of purifying 150 gallons of water per day for up to 10 years, also removing 99.9 percent of water borne diseases.\nContributions for this campaign start at $1 to raise awareness for clean water initiatives starting with pledges at $35 to send Family filters to provide safe, clean drinking water to children and families in developing countries.\nAbout Water For Life\nWater for Life is a volunteer run, non-profit 501c3 organization focused on providing lifesaving water filters to third-world countries at no cost. The organization is making a global impact by already shipping over 4,000 Family filters to 16 third world countries over the last five years.\nWater For Life is a Guidestar exchange member demonstrating its commitment to transparency.\"\nMedia contact:\nRonjini Joshua\n562-735-0071\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/water-for-life-launches-sustainable-water-filter-campaign-to-make-clean-drinking-water-accessible-to-developing-countries-300162844.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.guidestar.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH33125&Transmission_Id=201510200941PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH33125&DateId=20151020", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://bewaterforlife.org/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278617LOGO", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/water-for-life-launches-sustainable-water-filter-campaign-to-make-clean-drinking-water-accessible-to-developing-countries-300162844.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278618-INFO", "http://igg.me/at/waterforlifefilters"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:19:19.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
