All times local:\n3:35 p.m.\nAuthorities say 16.47 percent of eligible voters had cast their votes in Poland's general election at noon.\nThe head of the State Electoral Commission, Wojciech Hermelinski, says that 4.9 million of Poland's 30.9 million eligible voters had cast their ballots by noon on Sunday, in the voting for 460 Parliament members and 100 Senators.\nExit polls and preliminary turnout are expected when the polls close at 9 p.m. local time (2000GMT.)\nOpinion polls have consistently showed the conservative opposition Law and Justice party ahead of the ruling Civic Platform.\n___\n11:05 a.m.\nVoters in Warsaw are voicing criticism of the establishment while declaring support for an array of new, small right- and leftwing parties.\nRetired physicist Adam Jadacki and his wife, Janina, say they voted for the modern party, Nowoczesna \"because it is the only sensible and rational party, free of emotions and of political infighting.\"\nThe couple say they believe the party has \"sound economic plans, not some empty promises\" like the ruling Civic Platform party.\nNowoczesna is a new force founded by an economist who focuses on creating sound state finances.\nLawyer Katarzyna Bielska says she supports a coalition of left-wing parties in order to end Civic Platform's eight-year-rule while not backing the favored conservative Law and Justice party.\nInterpreter Slawomir Krantz says he voted for Civic Platform because he fears other parties might spoil the stability Poland has achieved.\n___\n11:05 a.m.\nA fire has broken out at a polling station in Poland, forcing officials to move the voting station to a nearby school.\nWojciech Hermelinski, the head of the state electoral commission, says the fire broke out Sunday morning in Biskupin, near the northern Polish city of Bydgoszcz, after only six people had voted in a small wooden building. He says nobody was hurt and officials were able to secure all the documentation.\nPoles are voting to pick 460 lawmakers to the lower house of parliament and 100 to the Senate. Whichever party wins the most votes gets the chance to form the next government.\nOpinion polls in recent days show that the expected winner is Law and Justice, a socially conservative party that favors greater welfare spending to help the poor.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:36:18.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
