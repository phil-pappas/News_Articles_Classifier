Only 9 seats would have scheduled voting from 7 a.m to 5 p.m.\n\nA total of 86,13,870 electors are expected to decide the fate of 456 candidates, 32 out of whom are women. There are 9,119 polling stations.\n\nA total of 993 companies of Central paramilitary forces and state police have been deployed to ensure peaceful voting. Drones and five helicopter/UAV would keep surveillance to ward off any untoward incidents.\n\nFor faster movement of security personnel and avoid greater casualties in the event of Naxal attacks, the security forces have decided to use motorbikes in large numbers. A total of 719 bikes would be in service for today's polling.\n\nWhile the contest in all the seats is intense, the battle at Imamganj (reserved SC seat) would be keenly watched, where former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi of Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) is locked in a straight contest with the Speaker of the outgoing Assembly Uday Narain Chaudhary of JD(U).\n\nChaudhary is a five-term MLA from the constituency. Manjhi is trying his luck from Makhdumpur seat in Jehanabad too.\n\nSenior BJP leader and former minister Prem Kumar (Gaya Town), former state unit chief of the saffron party Gopal Narayan Singh (Nabinagar) and state minister Jay Kumar Singh (Dinara) are among prominent names in this phase.\n\nThe stakes are high for the anti-BJP alliance in this phase as most of the 32 seats had gone to the JD(U) in the last elections.\n\nIn 2010, the JD(U) had won 19 seats followed by BJP 10, RJD 2 and Independent 1. This time the JD(U) and the RJD are contesting 13 seats each, while Congress has its candidates in six seats.\n\nHalf of the seats in this phase are being contested by BJP's allies in the NDA - LJP (Lok Janshakti Party), HAM and RLSP (Rashtriya Lok Samata Party).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:28:52.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
