Board President Thomas Sposato did not file for reelection.\nMeanwhile, Brenda Sherman is seeking the unexpired term of Ken Reilly, who resigned in April. The board selected her to fill the seat for the remainder of this year. Voters will decide if she continues for another year, although she is uncontested.\nThe board of education election is Tuesday, Nov. 3.\nThe following are candidate statements provided to the Sun. The candidates are in alphabetic order.\nSalvatore Balsamo \nI am a lifelong Nutley resident and a graduate of the Nutley Public School system. After graduating, I worked to earn a bachelor’s degree in history from Rutgers College and a master’s in the art of teaching from Montclair State University. \nThis is the start of my 11th year as a teacher, and I am well aware of the issues and challenges in education. \nIn this capacity I have worked collaboratively with others to write curriculum, conduct professional developments and create assessments. Therefore, I understand how policy impacts learning. \nLike many, I enjoyed growing up in Nutley, and benefited from the education that I received and the friends that I have made here. That is why we have chosen to raise our family here. I have two children in the Nutley Public School system. \nAs a parent, teacher and homeowner, I believe I can add a unique perspective as a member of the Nutley Board of Education.\nRyan Kline \nRyan Kline is seeking reelection after serving on the Nutley Board of Education for the past three years. \nA father of two children who attend Spring Garden Elementary School, he would like to continue to advance the district in the areas of curriculum, technology and community involvement.\nRyan is an educator, who currently is employed as a director of special services for the Belleville school district. \nSince serving on the Nutley Board of Education, he has been proud of the adoptions of a five-year curriculum review cycle, resulting in new math, language arts, PE, world language and science programs. Additionally, the district has seen significant technological advances in the form of devices, programs and data-driven instruction. These additions, coupled with an increase in instructional and administrative staff, have seen Advanced Placement scores rise in the district for three straight years. \nFiscally, the budget has seen an increase in surplus and has been maintained below a 2 percent tax increase annually. \nWith the district now facing significant overcrowding, he has the experience and workmanship to collaboratively exercise effective short and long-term solutions, which will benefit the community academically and fiscally. \nFor additional information on his candidacy, visit his Facebook page, Reelect Ryan Kline for Nutley BOE.\nDebbie Russo \nAs a two term incumbent and resident for 25 years, I have been an active member of the community for more than 18 years.
