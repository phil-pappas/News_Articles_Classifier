Sudhakshina | October 05, 2015, 19.53 pm Gionee F103 Many smartphones today are extreme devices, price-wise and spec-wise. Some have enough battery life to last you on a deserted island for months, a few have cameras that are at par with SLRs. Some are made with aviation-grade metal frames. The list goes on. And then comes a down-to-earth phone, which attempts to balance style and specs, finding the much-needed middle path.\nThe Gionee F103 is a mid-range smart phone featuring a 7.95 mm plastic body with glossy finish, and a 5-inch HD IPS capacitive touch screen with 1280x720 pixels resolution.\nRunning on a 1.3 GHz quad core processor with 2 GB RAM, the Gionee F103 does not leave room for performance complaints. It is one of the few mid-range devices in the country that supports 4G connectivity. App navigation and multi-tasking is smooth on the Android 5.0 Lollipop along with Gionee’s own Amigo 3.0 skin.\nThe dual-SIM device comes with an 8 MP rear autofocus camera with LED flash and a 5 MP front camera, with 16 GB in-built storage that is expandable up to 32 GB.\nThe F103 is ideal for people looking for a little bit of this and a little bit of that, an almost perfect blend of style and performance. Priced at Rs 9,999, the F103 is currently available across retail and online stores in India.\n— IndiaTechOnline.com\n Phone Review Gionee F103 4G Connectivity Android 5.0 Also Read Moto G 3rd Gen review - The 'Rahul Dravid' of phones Product Review: Phicomm Energy 653 - A pocket rocket", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151005/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/phone-review-gionee-f103-functional-fashion", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/new%20gionee%20new.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/new%20gionee.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Gionee%20F103_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Gionee%20F103_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:19:25.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
