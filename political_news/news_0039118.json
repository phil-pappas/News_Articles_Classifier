The decision not to bring charges against Lerner, the former head of the IRS Exempt Organizations units and a central figure in the controversy over whether the IRS improperly targeted conservative political groups, will not sit well with Republicans.\n“Poor management is not a crime,” Kadzik wrote in the letter to the House Ways and Means Committee. The tax-writing panel took the extraordinary step of referring Lerner to Justice for criminal prosecution in April 2014 on a party-line vote.\n“In order to bring criminal charges, we must have evidence of criminal intent,” Kadzik wrote.\nJustice opened its probe of the IRS in May 2013, after an inspector general audit found the agency had used inappropriate criteria to weed out political groups applying for tax-exempt status.\nObama: Death penalty 'deeply troubling' By Nick Gass\n“We found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution,” Kadzik wrote. “We also found no evidence that any official involved in the handling of tax-exempt applications or IRS leadership attempted to obstruct justice.”\nLerner infuriated Republicans by refusing to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, invoking the Fifth Amendment after proclaiming her innocence. The House approved a criminal contempt resolution against Lerner in May 2014, but Justice said this spring that it would not bring contempt charges against Lerner for her refusal to testify.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:25:48.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
