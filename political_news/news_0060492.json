Technology offers plenty of ways for runner to train and improve their speed and endurance, or at least to feel bad about not reaching their goals. Take a look at some of the wearables and apps that can make training for a marathon more fun (or at least survivable). \nTrue Form True Form \nA local startup, True Form developed a wearable resistance band system to help runners train. The bands connects to a belt and special shoes to let users run with the bands adding tension to their run. It helps train endurance and speed without the limitations of being in a gym or in terms of freedom of movement. \nLynxFit \nAlexandria-based LynxFit is a kind of virtual fitness coach for use in Google devices, including Google Glass. The virtual coach can help motivate you, organize workout sessions and otherwise train. It also lets you stream fitness related videos, connect in real-time with friends or connect with an real-life trainer. The data it collects about your workouts can be used to formulate future workout goals too. \nVoyce Voyce \nYou won't see any dogs running along this weekend (if only because they are way too smart to think running that far is a good idea), but that doesn't mean you can't run with your dog while you're training. Voyce, created by i4C Innovations in Chantilly-Va., lets your dog train alongside you, with a wearable collar that tracks the dog's vitals the way FitBit does for humans. You can then use that information with insight from veterinarians to get your dog in peak physical shape the same way you are doing for yourself. \nLifeFuels \nReston-based LifeFuels is a \"Personal Fueling System\" that combines a health tracking app with a water bottle that dispenses vitamins and other supplements into your water as needed. Founded by serial entrepreneur Jonathon Perrelli, the smart water bottle injects vitamins and other supplements into the water as needed based on data from fitness apps and wearables. \nNetflix \nOf course, even if you're not running this weekend or training for another race, you can use tech to have a Netflix marathon while you're waiting to cheer people on at the finish line. Sure, you may not get a medal, but you can have the bragging rights of watching every episode of House of Cards in one go.
