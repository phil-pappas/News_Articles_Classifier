Boston Scientific on October 16. The matter was remanded from the Multi-District Litigation venued in West Virginia and heard in District Court in North Carolina .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278692LOGO\nMs. Carlson received an implant of an Uphold pelvic mesh device designed to treat her pelvic organ prolapse (POP). She still complains of chronic pain, incontinence, and the inability to have sex. Ms. Carlson's Complaint alleged the material used to make the product was negligently designed and was/is unsafe for use in medical procedures.\nThe trial lasted for 10 days but the jury disagreed with Ms. Carlson's contentions as their verdict was reached within a day. A copy of the verdict sheet can be found here .\nEssentially, the jury found that Ms. Carlson did not prove that Boston Scientific defectively designed the product that caused her injuries. This finding, despite the admitting of evidence about the 510(k) clearance procedure of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that allows pelvic mesh to make it to market with little scrutiny for safety, is yet another blow to the approximately 20,000 mesh plaintiffs pursuing justice against Boston Scientific for injuries caused by their mesh products.\n\"This case and the recent reduction in the Barba decision are significant blows to mesh victims throughout the country,\" said Paul Coppola , President of pelvic mesh lawsuit funding firm, Fair Rate Funding. \"Plaintiffs can still remain confident that they will be compensated however.\"\nThe Barba decision reduced a $100 million verdict to $10 million earlier this month and was a major disappointment to victims of pelvic mesh products. Judge Mary Miller Johnstone found that the verdict amount \"shocked the court's conscience and sense of justice.\"\nFair Rate Funding provides pre settlement cash to plaintiffs involved in pelvic mesh or other types of lawsuits.
