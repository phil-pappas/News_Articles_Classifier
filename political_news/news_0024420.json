The goals are universal, applying to both developed and developing countries. \nNew Zealand, along with its Pacific neighbours, is expected to incorporate the goals into policy and practice, and to measure and report on progress against set targets. \nRed Cross Secretary General Tony Paine says the adoption of the Global Goals is a positive step, as they address many of the challenges faced by Pacific Island countries. \n“Goal 13 on climate action is particularly important for the Pacific. With devastating impacts of climate change already being felt in the region, Pacific leaders are calling for stronger action on climate change to be agreed to at the Paris climate talks in December.” \nEvery day, Red Cross National Societies in the Pacific work to help populations affected by these issues. By supporting these societies through training, development and funding, New Zealand Red Cross is already working towards the aims of the Global Goals, Mr Paine says. \n“We’re connected to our Pacific neighbours not only by geography, but also through kinship. It’s crucial we continue to work together, to help strengthen community resilience and development across the whole Pacific region.” \nHumanitarian organisations, such as the Red Cross, have a valuable role to play in supporting governments to achieve these goals, Mr Paine says. \nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has also welcomed the move, with Secretary General Elhadj As Sy praising the strong focus on building and strengthening resilience in the 2030 Agenda. \n“The risks of disaster, humanitarian crises, and global health epidemics have the potential to reverse hard-won development gains,” Mr Sy says. \n“These issues, as well as forced displacement, migration, violence, peace, and human rights and human dignity must be addressed if we are to achieve sustainable development.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:57:47.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
