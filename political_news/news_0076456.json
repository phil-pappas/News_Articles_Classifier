She says, \"What I know about it as of today, I am not in favor.\" \nThe free trade deal backed by the administration has been opposed by liberal Democrats and labor unions. \nClinton helped lay the foundation for the deal as Obama's secretary of state. \nShe joins Democratic rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley who warn it could lead to lost American jobs. \nThe pact is central to Obama's attempt to engage with Asia to offset a rising Chinese influence in the region.
