After all, they see it happening all around them; a hostile immigrant population that refuses to assimilate, brings violence and crime to their adopted countries and is determined to install Islam as the ruling authority no matter how long it takes.\nYet, it is Europe’s leaders, in their blind drive to bring diversity and multi-culturalism to their societies, who are chiefly responsible for ignoring the cries of their people. They are on their knees submitting to the jihadists and the leaders of the Islamic world. What they are doing is criminal.\nAnd what our own government is doing in bringing in tens of thousands of Somali and Arab “refugees”, most of whom will be able-bodied young men, to the US.\nMilitant and expansionist Islam can never defeat the US and the West by force of arms, notwithstanding all their terror tactics. They can conquer us without firing a shot, however.\nThat is up to us.", "external_links": ["http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5228/islamist-threat-europe", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Fousesquawk/~4/6k-o1pAzGkE"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:08.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
