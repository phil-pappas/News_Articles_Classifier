With apologies to Don McLean (and Madonna).\nPT1M7S 620 349 You can get away with a hell of a lot of wastage and breakage in that round-the-clock scuffle we fondly know as Federal Parliament. But get a fancy table involved, and you're on a one-way express train to Troublesville.\nIn the past couple of weeks, the fate of a one-metre-square piece of Italian marble, mounted upon a squat set of brass legs and functioning as a coffee table of 1980s vintage and a design best described as \"horrid\", has been the subject of extraordinary national attention.\nAlmost everyone now concedes that the table was unavoidably and regrettably danced on during an event that was, depending who you ask, either a sombre and respectful leave-taking by former PM Tony Abbott of his office, during which Mr Abbott may or may not have removed his shirt, or a grand old piss-up of epic proportions.\nSenator Penny Wong brandishes photographic evidence of the damaged marble table during a hearing with the Finance and Public Administration committee. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nLabor Senate leader Penny Wong, a woman known for her composure even at especially vexing and/or ludicrous points in her professional life, found herself arguing during Senate estimates with Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi about whether a marble table broken into bits could fairly be described as \"smashed\".\nAdvertisement \"Let's just refer to it as a 'damaged table',\" said Senator Bernardi, who wanted more information about whether there was perhaps some \"natural weakness in the stone\".\nIt is, to be fair to Senator Bernardi, a thoroughly intriguing possibility; that a marble table could spontaneously disintegrate on a night of high political intrigue, due perhaps to a combination of previously undiscovered structural instability and an principled unwillingness to carry the soyaccinos and chia smoothies of a Turnbull administration.\nIt's not broken, it's just resting – the Italian marble table that is no more.\nThe susceptibility of stonework to political hubris is a mortifyingly under-researched field. But at the subsequent cheery avowal of Senator Bernardi (one of the Parliament's most incendiary rhetoricians) that he would \"hate to see any inflammatory rhetoric work its way into this committee\", it is understood that several other coffee tables, two bird baths, a concrete outdoor setting and a minor Senate architrave crumbled into dust simultaneously. A full inquiry looms.\nBut the Marble Table joins a hallowed list of controversial furniture items in Australian political history; a Scandalous Table League Table, if you like, of four-legged wooden offenders.\nMost notable among them, of course, is the \"Thai Teak Table\" of Paul Keating's prime ministership.\nDissatisfied with the poky dining table at the Lodge, a Queensland maple affair which had been procured by Malcolm and Tamie Fraser in 1981, Keating commissioned a reproduction Regency dining table in 1993 but was subsequently obliged to return it to the manufacturer after everyone lost their minds at the expense.\nThat table was estimated at the time to have cost $25,000, and the Coalition felt the expenditure to be not only excessive but an irresistible demonstration of the 24th Prime Minister's marginal obsession with interior décor and his borderline-treasonous tendency towards artefacts of offshore manufacture.\nFive or so years later, once the Howards were ensconced in Kirribilli House, a wholesale renovation of the Sydney prime ministerial residence included the purchase of an $82,000 dining setting consisting of a large cedar table and 20 horsehair chairs. Curiously, this purchase excited much less comment than the Keating table. As for the Lodge, the poky Fraser original still bats on there, although a helpful soul at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed on Friday that it had recently benefited from the attentions of an experienced French polisher. Which seems only fair.\nThere is another controversial dining table available to Australian prime ministers, however, and it's found in Parliament House itself; the windowless private dining room opening discreetly off a reception area in the PM's own suite of offices. It was completed – like the building itself – in 1988 but has spent much of that time in disfavour owing to its cramped dimensions and its mirrors and silk wall hangings, features which combine to deliver a political panic-room vibe tinged with the vague threat of sexual misadventure. Some PMs have used it for storing boxes.\nIn 2007, the ageing Howard administration was poised to spend half a million dollars doing it up but abandoned those plans once they were exposed by Labor's Lord of Senate estimates John Faulkner, whose instinctive distrust of fancy tables has obviously been passed down to his successor, Senator Wong.\nFaulkner's finest hour, arguably, came in the months he spent earlier this decade pursuing hapless Parliament House bureaucrats over a pair of snooker tables that were auctioned online, only to be bought by Parliament House employees. The tables raised $5000. But the parliament spent nearly $100,000 on subsequent audits, investigations and independent reviews.\nAt this point, it would almost make economic sense to establish a permanent standing inquiry into controversial political tables.\nThe only problem would be finding a reliable chair.\nAnnabel Crabb is an ABC writer and host of ABC TV's Kitchen Cabinet , which returns this Wednesday at 8pm. @annabelcrabb", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@annabelcrabb"], "published": "2015-10-24T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:37:27.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
