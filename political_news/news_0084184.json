(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Marco Rubio is calling for a more aggressive approach to Russia, including new sanctions against major officials and companies. \nThe Florida senator calls Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"gangster and a thug.\" \nIn Iowa on Friday, Rubio said if he's elected, he'll seek additional visa bans, provide more assistance to Ukraine and limit diplomatic engagement with Moscow \"on issues not essential to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\" \nRubio says the U.S. is \"barreling toward a second Cold War.\" \nRussia began airstrikes in Syria this week. While Moscow officials maintain that they are targeting Islamic State groups and other extremists, U.S. authorities have questioned that, noting the areas hit were strongholds of rebels seeking to oust President Bashar Assad. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
