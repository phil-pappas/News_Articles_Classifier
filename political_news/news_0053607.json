Charles Rangel seeking to overturn his 2010 censure for financial wrongdoing.\nThe justices on Monday let stand an appeals court ruling that said House disciplinary proceedings against the congressman fell outside the jurisdiction of the courts.\nThe House voted 333-79 to censure Rangel for financial and fundraising misconduct.\nThe 85-year-old Democrat claimed that staff and members of the House Ethics Committee conducting the probe against him suppressed evidence of misconduct in the investigation.\nA federal judge ruled that courts had no authority over the House investigation. An appeals court in the District of Columbia upheld that decision, saying Rangel must seek vindication in the court of public opinion.\nRangel plans to retire at the end of his current term.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:53:37.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
