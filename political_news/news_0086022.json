Photo: Andrew Meares\nOn Wednesday, Kenyan high commissioner Isaiya Kabira said he had raised concerns with the Australian government about the abrupt end to successful development projects in his country. But he insisted Kenya would still talk to Canberra about future UN bids.\n\"We'd been trying to encourage the government to allow those projects to continue to their natural end instead of bringing immediate cuts,\" he said. \"[But] when the time comes we would be happy to sit with Australia and see how best to progress all of our intentions.\"\nThe previous Labor government landed Australia a seat on the 15-member Security Council for two years in 2013 and 2014 – a bid that the Coalition, including Ms Bishop , criticised at the time.\nHowever the seat proved a crucial platform for Ms Bishop to pursue Australia's interests, particularly after the downing of flight MH17.\nMs Bishop said in March she intended to bid again for a non-permanent Australian seat in the Security Council. On Monday she announced this bid would be for 2029-30, which is the first period in which there is a vacancy for which no other country is currently bidding.\nLabor foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek said the opposition welcomed the move. But she said the candidacy for the Human Rights Council would be complicated \"when we are actually going backwards on climate change, we've had the largest aid cuts in the history of Australia … and we've also had concerns around our treatment of asylum seekers\".\nThe Human Rights Council has been the subject of frequent criticism given its membership has often included countries responsible for abuses. Its current members include Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Congo and Kazakhstan.\nGillian Triggs, president of the Australian Human Rights Commission, said Ms Bishop was properly promoting human rights as part of Australia's international engagement.\nBut she said Australia's treatment of asylum seekers, and particularly the penalties for immigration detention workers who speak publicly, would be \"a major matter of concern to the human rights community and to the Human Rights Council itself\".\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:27:20.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
