Giant duck placed outside Congress in Brasilia to protest against increase in taxes, photo by José Cruz/Agencia Brasil. \nThe campaign, “Não vou pagar o pato” (loosely translated as “I will not pay the bill”), was started by the Federation of Industries of São Paulo (FIESP) to show officials that the increase in taxes is not the way to pull Brazil out of its current economic crisis. \n“We’ve seen this picture before,” says, FIESP president Paulo Skaf on a website created to garner signatures against the increase and the creation of more taxes . “Every time the government need to cover its costs instead of reducing expenses, it thinks its easier to pass the bill forward. Guess who pays the bill?” \nAccording to Skaff, to increase taxes and revival of the CPMF tax (tax over financial transactions) will force companies to reduce jobs. The executive says that the situation then becomes a vicious circle, with high unemployment leading to lower household consumption, which in turn leads to smaller revenues for companies, which in the near future will have to layoff even more workers. \nThe executive says the objective of the humorous campaign is to show that the private sector is in favor of a fiscal adjustment, but through the reduction of expenditures, and the decrease of wasted and ill invested revenues, not through the increase of taxes.

Organizers hope to receive more than one million votes and send Congressional representatives a message that the population is not happy and will not accept the actions taken by the Administration without a fight. The campaign, created by FIESP, is backed up by more than 160 companies from all sectors of Brazil’s economy. \nLast week Brazil’s Congress started to deliberate an amendment to the Constitution that would authorize the government to revive a 0.20 percent tax over all financial transactions (CPMF). According to Rousseff’s economic team , the revival of the CPMF was necessary to fund the country’s social security system.
