Lawmakers are running out of time to extend America's debt limit. A potential default could be disastrous. By Andrew Soergel Oct. 22, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT\n+ More The clock is ticking for Congress to make a decision on whether to raise America's debt ceiling before the country potentially defaults.\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew wrote a letter to Congress last week warning lawmakers that the U.S. Treasury Department will run out of borrowing authority on Nov. 3 if its $18.1-trillion debt ceiling isn't extended. Without an extension, America's creditworthiness would undoubtedly take a hit. Beyond that, however, nobody's entirely sure what would happen to the country, its citizens or its international debtholders. But it probably wouldn't be good.\n\"Operating the United States government with no borrowing authority, and with only the cash on hand on a given day, would be profoundly irresponsible,\" Lew wrote in his letter to Congress. \"In the absence of congressional action, [the] Treasury would be unable to satisfy all of [its] obligations for the first time in the history of the United States.\"\n[ READ: Ask an Economist: What's Wrong With Social Security? ]\nThis is hardly the first time Congress has let a debt extension go down to the wire. Back in 2011, a long-term deal was only finalized roughly 48 hours before deadline.\nBut could 2015's political polarization kill any chance of an extension? U.S. News recently spoke with Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, to hear his take on whether the government will extend America's debt limit and why it matters for U.S. citizens. Excerpts:\nWhat is the debt ceiling? How'd we get to this point?\nThe debt ceiling is this curiously American creation where the government will set up some sort of policy that brings in revenue, and they'll also allocate a certain amount to be spent. And they have a pretty good sense of whether they'll have enough money to cover it or not. In the process, they obviously pass a budget, and they'll imply a deficit, and things will go on.\nBut in the U.S., we have this thing where we also periodically reauthorize the government to issue more bonds up to a certain level of debt. Basically, everyone's already angry that we're going to do these things that are going to result in all this debt, but there's this bizarre short-circuit where the government can decide at the last minute that it doesn't want to issue the debt.\nTypically, that's a non-event, because you don't really want to default on your debt, especially if you have a lot of debt out there. You'd pay higher interest rates, and that's expensive.\nWhat happens if Congress doesn't extend the debt ceiling?\nThere's some debate about this. They went through this in great detail last time. There are some outlandish solutions where people have looked at the Constitution and said you could mint some coin of arbitrary value and this loophole would solve this debt problem. But both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department said that wasn't a legal option last time, and I think they still hold that view. So we're probably not going to see something quite that crazy.\nThe deficit as a percent of the federal budget is significant, but it's not all of it. So people have said maybe you could cut checks to Social Security recipients and issue I-owe-yous to all the government employees or all the people we owe money to for roads and bridges or something.\nThe last time we did this, that debate got pretty far along. But the mechanics of how the Treasury's payment system works stepped in and said the system was never designed to prioritize who gets paid when. At that point, it would basically be like a Russian roulette of bouncing checks.\n[ RELATED: Ben Bernanke Has Had It With Stupid GOP Economics ]\nYou could also pay bondholders first and everyone else in the federal government second in an effort to preserve our credit rating. But it doesn't seem like that's something you can do, and there wouldn't really be a way around defaulting on some of those bonds.\nThat's kind of a worst-case scenario. Your best case scenario is that everyone cools their jets and we get through this fine. I think that we're in a safer place than we were in a couple years ago. But the options if you don't pass this are not good.\nWhat would happen to other countries who are holders of U.S. debt? What would this look like on a global scale?\nThere's definitely a global dimension, because lots of countries hold U.S. debt for lots of purchases. But the bigger effect would actually be on the private sector. Debt ceiling hijinx aside, U.S. bonds are a remarkably safe investment, especially short-term ones. The risk premium people pay for that is so low – and the expectation of how likely that is to default is so low – that these are viewed as sort of the risk-free asset that's used to build up all kinds of transactions.\nAnd that works out great. We've built a lot of products on these as a foundation. But when you start messing with the foundation, weird things can happen. You did see a lot of financial firms looking really, really hard at ways to limit their exposure to all kinds of financial products the last time we were going through this.\nBut there are very few things that get used within the financial system where you can just get around a big problem with short-term U.S. debt. That ends up being a problem for governments around the world, but mostly for your banks, your insurance companies, your airline that's taking out some loan on spare parts that's somehow tied to Treasury assets.\nIf this debt ceiling is so crucial, what's the debate in Congress? Why is this even a question?\nHistorically, this has kind of been a messaging issue. Usually the party that's not in power will use this as a way to sort of shame the other party and say, 'Well, your policies are fiscally unsustainable.'\nThat's a bit of an oversimplification, but typically this is a messaging vote. Typically, some people who are vulnerable members or who are sort of up-and-comers will make a more prominent stand and say, 'Our government really should be living within its means, so I can't vote for this.'\nWhat was pointed out at one point was that [President] Barack Obama was one of the people who said no when he was a senator, although the Democrats passed a debt ceiling increase. And it's also probably true that that was part of the internal politics to make sure that someone who was a rising star in the party got that badge of fiscal courage.\n[ PHOTOS: The Big Picture – October 2015 ]\nSay we extend the debt ceiling. What happens then?\nTrust in institutions is not fantastic right now, and I think part of the reason this has become such a big deal is that nobody would have taken this threat seriously five years ago. But two years ago, it seemed fairly credible, and part of that was that people had lost faith in the branches of the federal government to get along.\nThere are two possible ways to go through this. We could get back to where we were, which is the debt ceiling becomes this nice thing people get to crow about if they want to bolster their political bona fides, but that transactionally, it just kind of happens and it's deweaponized. I think we're almost there. I think if we get through this again, hopefully this fever will have broken.\nBut if you get to the point that this is sort of blown over and isn't such a hot issue, maybe you'll see Congress say, 'Hey, maybe setting spending and revenues is enough, and we don't need this additional vote that's just kind of a possible short-circuit in the system.'\nWhat does this mean for the average American? What would happen if something isn't worked out?\nThere's a short-term, which would be you'd go to your bank tomorrow and it might be closed, because it turns out the bank was using short-term treasuries as some sort of collateral for cash or something.\nI think most people are still quite confident that we'll get through this. I don't think anyone really thinks the U.S. is going to default on its debt, have financial markets do all kinds of crazy things we can't predict, and we'll stay in that state of the world for weeks on end. I think people expect something will get hammered out quickly if something terrible like that happens. But the reason there's basically no risk premium we pay on our debt is because people are really confident we're never going to default. If we start defaulting and raise the amount of interest we pay on a not-small amount of debt, that has big implications in the long run.\nNo one's really going to know unless it happens. And on the one hand, that's a really useful force in terms of helping Congress get to a deal on it. But that's sort of the reason to take it seriously, even if it is something that really shouldn't be an issue. There are people out there who have convinced themselves they know what's going to happen, and that's what's dangerous about this.\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: economy global economy deficit and national debt Treasury Department Lew, Jack", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Ask%20an%20Economist%3A%20What%20Happens%20if%20Congress%20Doesn%27t%20Raise%20the%20Debt%20Ceiling%3F", "http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/October-2015-Debt-Limit-Letter.aspx", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Ask%20an%20Economist%3A%20What%20Happens%20if%20Congress%20Doesn%27t%20Raise%20the%20Debt%20Ceiling%3F&summary=Lawmakers%20are%20running%20out%20of%20time%20to%20extend%20America%27s%20debt%20limit.%20A%20potential%20default%20could%20be%20disastrous.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeerig%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Ask%20an%20Economist%3A%20What%20Happens%20if%20Congress%20Doesn%27t%20Raise%20the%20Debt%20Ceiling%3F"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:34:16.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
