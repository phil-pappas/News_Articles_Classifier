He didn't want to share a stage with him and didn't attend the debate. He issued a statement criticizing the Democratic candidates who did. \nDemocratic Assemblymen Tim Eustace and Joseph Lagana say voters are entitled to hear their views. They didn't mention Cappola's book. Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:42:44.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
