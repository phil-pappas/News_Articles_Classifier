Hillary Clinton so far is the only major character from the 2008 season, although superfans are going to wait to see if there’s any sort of cameo appearance by Uncle Joe. We hope they flesh out some of the more undeveloped characters early on, because having just two or three of them is going to get dull really quick. Don’t get us wrong, though; we’re still setting up a season pass regardless. \nIT’S WEIRD THAT THEY’RE ALREADY DOING THE VEGAS EPISODE \nSynchronize your iCalendars: Coverage of tomorrow’s debate on CNN will begin at 8:30 EDT, 5:30 PDT. Las Vegas won the right to the highly-coveted first debate, which should result in a bump in national awareness for the southern Nevada city that’s little known outside of the poker-playing community. So what’s the strategy for the five, possibly six candidates on the stage? For Hillary Clinton, it’s to move past the email controversy that has dogged her campaign for months , as well as present herself as warm and likeable; for Bernie Sanders, it’s to “ let Bernie be Bernie ” (although it wouldn’t kill him to stop reminding everyone of their irritable high school civics teacher); for the other three, there’s nothing they can do wrong. Wear a lime green suit. Live-tweet their own answers. Interrupt a rival candidate with a “that’s what she said” joke. Literally anything that’s going to remind votes they exist is going to be a net positive. USA TODAY’s Susan Page has advice for each candidate. \nYES / NO / MAYBE / NOT YET REPLIED \nOr maybe he’s going to show up just to videobomb the debate. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) \nUNLV already had to put down a deposit for a sixth podium at Sin City Debate Supplies, so at this point they’re ready for a last-minute Joe Biden surprise announcement . So will Joe throw his much-anticipated hat into the ring? With each passing hour it’s looking less and less likely (hey, if nobody’s using that extra podium, Larry Lessig says he’d like to have it ), but political reporters burned an entire weekend sitting outside his house anyway. On the positive side: Delaware cross-country meets and YMCA flag football received unprecedented media coverage. The (Wilmington, DE) News Journal ‘s Scott Goss provides coverage of his own coverage. So meta. \nIT’S ALL POLITICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND DAILY FANTASY SPORTS ADS FROM HERE ON OUT \nFILE - This Aug. 5, 2014, file photo shows corn plants in a field near Ladora, Iowa. It seems like a no-brainer for prospective presidential candidates: Come to Iowa to talk about agriculture. But not many of them do anymore. So a Republican donor with money and influence, Bruce Rastetter, is forcing the issue.

Hate hearing about candidates already? Even with the price increase , Netflix is looking pretty good for the next 13 months. But point and laugh all you want at the corn-and-butter crowd, because we’re all going to get hit with wall-to-wall political ads soon — and the purpler your state is, the worse it’s going to be. In some swing states, broadcast TV stations may run out of ad space altogether. So what happens then? One Iowa political consultant predicts political ads on cable TV, smartphones, and possibly in movie theaters. Quit ruining everything, democracy. Brianne Pfannenstiel and Jeffrey C. Kummer of The Des Moines Register break down the horrifying possibilities. \nMORE FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:51:10.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
