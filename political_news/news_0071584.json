(Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press via Associated Press) October 21 at 5:22 PM Kevin B. Blackistone asserted in his Oct. 18 Sports column, “ Major League Baseball races to maintain its code of conduct ,” that the criticism of baseball player Jose Bautista’s demonstrative “bat flip” in this year’s playoffs was a manifestation of racism. But a better explanation of the divide might be generational.\nWillie Mays and Ernie Banks never gloated over their opponents, whereas young players today of all races, Bryce Harper included, are often criticized by their elders for their excessive posturing. Actions that Mr. Blackistone called “celebrations” can also be characterized as unnecessary boasting, swaggering and humiliation of opposing players — things that Hank Aaron never would have done.\nPaul Boudreaux , Takoma Park", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:22:34.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
