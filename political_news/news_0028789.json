It is already the deadliest terrorist attack in Turkey’s history, and the death toll is expected to rise. The two explosions targeted an area outside of the city’s central train station on Saturday morning, where hundreds of ethnic Kurds and leftists were protesting the growing violence between the Turkish government and the P.K.K. Kurdish militant group. According to the Guardian , the Turkish government is so far saying that it was a suicide attack, but it’s not yet known which terrorist group is behind the blasts, if the bomber or bombers were affiliated with one. There are also reports that a suspicious vehicle and suspicious package were found at the scene and bomb disposal experts were brought in, so obviously the story is still developing.\nHere is a video of the moment the blast occurred:\n#Ankaradayız\nEmek, Barış ve Demokrasi Mitingindeki patlama anı videosu\n #dokuz8 / @meliketmbk pic.twitter.com/it3dodESKz\n— dokuz8 (@dokuz8haber) October 10, 2015 As seen above, protesters, carrying banners and flags, were chanting and dancing when the blasts struck. Following the attack, those same protest banners were used to cover the dead, who lay in two circles around where the blasts had originated.\nProtest banners and flags cover the bodies of some of those killed after twin explosions in Ankara on Oct. 10, 2015.

Said Erdogan, “I strongly condemn this heinous attack on our unity and our country’s peace. No matter what its origin, aim or name, we are against any form of terrorist act or terrorist organisation. We are obliged to be against it together.”\nAccording to the New York Times , many of Turkey’s Kurds are already blaming the Turkish state for the attack. Violence and tensions between the Turkish government and the P.K.K. have been on the rise for months following a resumption of hostilities after a recent, seemingly productive peace process. The new violence came as the Turkish government had simultaneously become a more collaborative ally in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, opening up military bases to coalition airplanes and conducting airstrikes itself, some against ISIS and some against the P.K.K. As the Times points out, the failure of the peace process also coincided with the dramatic electoral gains of Kurd’s political wing, the H.D.P. party, in elections last June. In addition, another 32 Kurdish activists were killed in July when a bombing targeted a cultural center in the southeast Turkey town of Suruc. The Turkish government blamed the attack on ISIS, but most Kurds doubted that claim. Prior to the attacks in Ankara, the P.K.K. had announced a cease fire in advance of the Turkish parliamentary elections which will be held in three weeks, and said they would only act in self defense during that time. Concerns over security in the run up to those elections had already been high before Saturday's attack.\nTurkey, once seen as a stalwart of stability in the middle east, has become increasingly unravelled amidst the neighboring conflicts in Syria and Iraq, an extraordinary influx of refugees, the threat of ISIS, and now, the renewed conflict with the P.K.K.\nThis post will be updated as more information becomes available.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/meliketmbk", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/turkey-suicide-bomb-killed-in-ankara", "http://t.co/it3dodESKz", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ankaraday%C4%B1z?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/dokuz8?src=hash", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/world/europe/ankara-turkey-explosion-deaths.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news", "https://twitter.com/dokuz8haber/status/652762388324872192"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:20:05.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
