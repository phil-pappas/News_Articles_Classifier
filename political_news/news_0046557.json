A Palestinian man throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with Israeli troops on Oct. 12 near Ramallah in the West Bank.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 20, 2015 | 10:02 a.m. EDT + More Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday the absence of a peace process cannot be blamed for the current campaign of sustained violence in the country.\nNetanyahu argued that escalated attacks were completely unrelated to stagnated peace talks.\n\"Some of the worst terrorism that Israel has experienced in its history occurred when the peace process was at its peak,\" Netanyahu told delegates at the Zionist Congress in Jerusalem. \"We had terrorism when there was a peace process; we had terrorism when there was no peace process. We had terrorism when there was an Israel; and we had terrorism when there was no Israel. We had terrorism when there were settlements; and we had terrorism when there were no settlements.\"\nRELATED\nWho Is Leading the Intifada? Netanyahu's comments come as another Israeli was killed Tuesday in the West Bank after being run over by a car. Witnesses report the man got out of his own car after Palestinians threw stones at it, and began hitting passing Palestinian vehicles with a large stick. He was then run over by a truck he had struck.\nThis incident brings the Israeli death toll to 10 from a series of stabbings and shootings across Israel.\nForty-two Palestinians have also been killed, some after being identified as assailants by Israeli security forces and others in clashes with those forces. An Eritrean national also died late Sunday after being mistakenly taken for an Arab and shot.\nSee Photos\nPhotos: Tensions Mount Between Israelis, Palestinians Netanyahu blamed Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas of being a \"steady inciter\" of the violence.\n\"He incites all time,\" Netanyahu said. \"He and his Fatah partners and the official websites of the PA incite day in and day out on social networks.\"\nThe Israeli prime minister said that the absence of a Palestinian state is also not the root of the problem. Netanyahu instead said that \"the Palestinians have repeatedly refused to accept a nation-state for themselves\" if doing so would require them to recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.\n\"That was and remains the core of the conflict,\" Netanyahu said.\nNetanyahu also denied, as he's done multiple times publicly, that Israel has any intention of changing the status quo on the Temple Mount. This rumor has fueled much of the continued attacks by Palestinians who fear Israel wants to allow Jews to pray at the compound. The site is considered holy by both Muslims and Jews, and is the current home to the Al Aqsa Mosque and was the prior home to the two biblical temples. Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the grounds, under an agreement administered by Jordan designed to keep peace at the site.\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon traveled to Israel Tuesday to meet with Netanyahu and Abbas, and victims of the recent attacks. Secretary of State John Kerry is also set to meet with Netanyahu, Abbas and Jordanian King Abdullah this week to discuss steps to reduce violence. Kerry has emphasized the need for clarity when it comes to the Temple Mount and has called on Israel to maintain the status quo. Both Israel and the U.S. oppose plans to place international monitors at the site.\nTAGS: Israel Netanyahu, Benjamin world news Palestine Abbas, Mahmoud Middle East", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Israeli%20Prime%20Minister%20Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20Decries%20Violence%2C%20Says%20Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Is%20to%20Blame", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Israeli%20Prime%20Minister%20Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20Decries%20Violence%2C%20Says%20Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Is%20to%20Blame", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Israeli%20Prime%20Minister%20Benjamin%20Netanyahu%20Decries%20Violence%2C%20Says%20Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Is%20to%20Blame&summary=Lack%20of%20a%20peace%20process%20and%20a%20Palestinian%20state%20are%20not%20the%20reasons%20for%20violence%2C%20Netanyahu%20says.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedjbb%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:59:14.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
