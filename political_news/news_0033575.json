Kirk Douglas is at his most powerful and hypnotic as Chuck Tatum, who’s been itching for an event like this to spread his name on America’s front pages. Douglas’ elastic face registers all the angles Tatum is working, including endangering the life of the poor man buried alive. Tatum persuades engineers to drill the cave from above (instead of shoring up the walls — a quicker way) because it will stretch out the number of days his stories run. Hundreds of people come to gawk, turning the site into a carnival (“The Big Carnival” was the movie’s alternate title). Wilder has created very few likable characters. The wife, played by Sterling, is ready to run off with Tatum. Even the innocent photographer who accompanies him soon imagines fame and fortune coming his way. Most critics didn’t like “Ace in the Hole,” and neither did the public. (SF Gate)\nTruth has that curious effect on people.Next to today’s yellow journalists and media smear merchants, Douglas’s character is a saint.\nAce in the Hole,’ Billy Wilder Special, With Kirk Douglas, Arrives at Globe Theatre\nBy BOSLEY CROWTHER, NY Times , Published: June 30, 1951\nA sordid and cynical drama of a corrupt newspaper man, set against a grisly panorama of mob morbidity, is delivered with all the stinging impact of an angry slap in the face by “Ace in the Hole,” the new picture from Billy Wilder which opened at the Globe yesterday. But, regrettably, in his demonstration of the tricks and deceits by which an unscrupulous newspaper reporter pyramids and prolongs a simple cave disaster into a nationally sensational tragedy, Mr. Wilder has let imagination so fully take command of his yarn that it presents not only a distortion of journalistic practice but something of a dramatic grotesque.\nBeyond any question, the director has done a spectacular job of visioning the monstrous vulgarity of mob behavior as influenced by a weird catastrophe. All of the callousness and cheapness of people as they swarm about the entrance of an old Indian cavern in which a man is trapped out New Mexico way has been pictured by Mr. Wilder in the sharp realism of truth. He has caught the ice-cold commercialism and the carnival atmosphere of a place in which crowds have collected to watch a slow race with death. And in a brilliant arrangement of visual cause and effect, he has shown how infectious and corrupting sensationalized news can be.\nIn this respect, Mr. Wilder has given us a masterly film which, indeed, is unique as a mirror of the morbid psychology of crowds and those strange social manifestations such as we’ve literally seen in such cases as the entombment of Floyd Collins and the burial of Cathy Fiscus in a well. The spectacle is revolting, but it is incontrovertibly true.\nFurthermore, Mr. Wilder, as director and producer of the film—as well as one of its authors, along with Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman—has revealed a picture of personal degradation that is disgusting and shocking to observe. His newspaper man, played by Kirk Douglas, is a double-dyed, unregenerate heel of the sort that offends all decent instincts and would put the teeth of a snake on edge. He is frankly a liar and a cynic, pathologically gnawed on and consumed by a selfish and vicious ambition for journalistic glory and power. And in his bald-faced connivance with a venal sheriff and with the wife of the man in the cave to monopolize and capitalize upon disaster, he spreads pollution wherever he goes.\nIn his sure-fire portrayal of this character, Mr. Douglas is superb, full of the arrogance and the cruelty of the desperately insecure. Likewise, Jan Sterling fills with venom the role of the victim’s trampish wife and Ray Teal plays the rascally sheriff with evil in his attitude and eye. Porter Hall as a newspaper owner, Bob Arthur as a hero-worshipping kid and Richard Benedict as the pitifully trapped victim are notable in the excellent cast.\nBut for all its revelation of scene and character, “Ace in the Hole” is badly weakened by a poorly constructed plot, which depends for its strength upon assumptions that are not only naïve but absurd. There isn’t any denying that there are vicious newspaper men and that one might conceivably take advantage of a disaster for his own private gain. But to reckon that one could so tie up and maneuver a story of any size, while other reporters chew their fingers, is simply incredible. Mr. Wilder’s exclusive machinator would have his head knocked off within two days.\nAlso, a man of such nature would not likely feel remorse at the eventual death of the victim whose grave he had figuratively helped to dig. At least, he would not feel repentant to the point of sealing his own doom. And when Mr. Wilder’s monster plunges piously to his death with shame in his heart and a stab wound draining tediously in his side, the whole yarn collapses limply and depressingly at the audience’s feet.\nACE IN THE HOLE, written by Billy Wilder Lesser Samuel; and Walter Newman; directed and produced by Mr. Wilder for Paromount.
