Related Content Tempers flare as lawmakers pass campaign finance bill \nThe Assembly passed the bill 60-36 on Tuesday. The Senate moved one step away from final approval of the measure earlier Tuesday. \nRepublicans introduced the measure after Gov. Scott Walker and conservative groups were subject to a John Doe investigation that the state Supreme Court ended in July. \nThe bill would allow John Doe probes to be used for some high-end felonies, like drug crimes and murder. But they would no longer be allowed to look into misconduct in office, like bribery and campaign finance violations. \nDemocrats say doing away with John Does will open the door to more corruption by politicians. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
