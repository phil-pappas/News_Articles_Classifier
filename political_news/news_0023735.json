He really does.\nBut the Ohio Republican is staying put, for now - and that could improve the chances for a debt limit increase by early next month to avoid a market-shattering government default.\nBoehner's continued presence also might help a bipartisan budget deal to head off a government shutdown in December.\nThe tea party forces that pushed Boehner to plan his exit after nearly five years in the top job now have less leverage against a man with nothing to lose. Conservative hardliners have caused further chaos by blocking the ascension of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\nYet there is no move afoot to hasten Boehner's exit as House Republicans decide how to fill the top job.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:55:15.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
