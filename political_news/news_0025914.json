The whole thrust of public service reform has been about giving more power to people at the front line and then holding them accountable for outcomes. \n\"The prison system is behind the curve. A great deal of what a prison governor does is constrained by very tight central regulation.\" \nMr Gove encouraged governors to get more businesses working with inmates, praising the work done by key cutting and shoe repair firm Timpson. \n\"We should definitely have more businesses going into prisons - you could have businesses running in prisons. Timpson in some cases train in prisons, in another prison I visited they have a call centre. Some are conducting market research or answering queries.\" \nMr Gove acknowledged that some central government involvement would have to remain in the system, on issues such as pay and security requirements. \n\"If the worst comes to the worst and something desperately bad happens - like a prison riot - there must be a national response.\" \nThe Justice Secretary also confirmed he was looking at plans to sell off inner-city jails on prime land for development in order to fund more modern prisons. \nMark Icke, the vice president of the Prison Governors' Association, said Mr Gove had not approached the organisation with details of his \"blue sky thinking\". \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are very much guided by policy and central government. Prisons themselves, and governors up and down the country, do feel frustrated at times being almost handcuffed to certain policies.\" \nHe said the education contract \"really does tie some governors up because, in their establishments, it may not quite fit the need to the men and women in custody there\". \nMr Icke said: \"The bit that's missing at the moment and is passing everbody by is that when these men and ladies come into custody it's not just education they need. These are complex individuals. \n\"It's not like academy schools and NHS foundation hospitals where people want to access the service. They don't really want to access our service.\" \nShadow justice secretary Lord Falconer said: \"Labour has long said that governors of successful prisons should be given greater autonomy so it is welcome that the Government has finally listened. \n\"We will look at the details of the proposals but it is important that this is introduced alongside a strengthened inspection regime, including regular, robust and unannounced inspections. \n\"The right conditions also have to be in place and prisons will never be able to rehabilitate offenders while understaffed, overcrowded and violent. \n\"Michael Gove must urgently address the crisis in our prisons.\" \nJuliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \"When it comes to devolving power locally, the most radical, and arguably the most effective, measure would be to devolve an area prisons budget to a metropolitan authority, say Manchester or London, so that informed decisions could be taken on how much to spend from a pooled budget on problem solving courts, community penalties, tagging and prisons alongside reinvestment in drug treatment and mental healthcare. \n\"More power and responsibility for governors could start to improve our struggling prison system. To maintain decent standards it would also be important to ensure adequate staffing levels, a properly independent prisons inspectorate, improved local monitoring of conditions and treatment and scope for prisoners to take more responsibility too.
