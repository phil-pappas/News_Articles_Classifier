The first responders were swift and professional in their response to the initial call, which avoided even more bloodshed,\" the resolution reads, according to a news release. \nThe resolution goes on to offer condolences to the families and friends of the nine who were \"murdered by an armed gunman\" and express hope for the \"swift and complete recovery\" of the nine who were wounded. \nThe Senate version of the resolution says that the legislative body \"remains committed to reducing the likelihood of this kind of event happening again.\" \nRon Wyden and Jeff Merkley represent Oregon in the Senate, and Peter DeFazio, Greg Walden, Kurt Schrader, Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici represent the state in the House. All but Walden are Democrats. \nWyden and Merkley also joined Senate Democrats on Thursday to push for gun-control legislation . \n-- Luke Hammill", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:43:02.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
