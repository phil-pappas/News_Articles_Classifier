Russia has ramped up its intervention in the region and the United States has sought to oppose ISIS without backing Assad, who is in the midst of a war with U.S.-supported rebels. \nCruz cast doubt on Russia's motives in its recent air strikes there, saying that \"anyone who believes Russia is fighting against terrorism, I got a bridge to sell 'em.\" \nAnd he blamed President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for creating a \"void in power\" that has allowed ISIS to gain strength in the country. \nAsked if he thought the Middle East would be more stable if leaders like Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi remained in place, Cruz said, \"Of course it would. Of course it would.\" \nIn the same interview, Cruz refused to say whether he believes Rep. Paul Ryan -- the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who Republican leaders are attempting to convince to run for speaker -- is a \"true conservative.\" \n\"That's a decision for House Republicans to make and for the American people to make,\" he said. \nPressed again, Cruz said: \"I have said consistently throughout that the question of House leadership is a question for the House Republican conference. And so I'm not gonna stick my nose into it as much as people want me to.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:11:48.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
