Given that qualification it was never clear how he could vote for the proposals from George Osborne, the chancellor. \n“I believe that we need to underline our position as an anti-austerity party by voting against the charter on Wednesday,” Mr McDonnell told Channel 4 News. \nMr Osborne picked up on the comments to attack the opposition party’s strategy: “Labour’s economic policy has lurched from chaos to incredibility. Two weeks ago ‎they said they were going to vote for a surplus — now we know they want to keep on borrowing forever. That would be a grave threat to the economic security of working people‎.‎” \nSince Jeremy Corbyn became the UK’s leader of the opposition a month ago, he has shifted stances on issues ranging from the EU to breaking up energy companies to tuition fees. \nOn Monday, Mr McDonnell wrote to Labour MPs, reversing his own stance and calling on colleagues to oppose the charter. “In the last fortnight there have been a series of reports highlighting the economic challenges facing the global economy as a result of the slowdown in emerging markets,” he wrote. More video \nMr McDonnell encountered a hostile meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party on Monday night where he received only a muted welcome from colleagues. John Mann, a Labour MP, criticised the policy reversal over the fiscal charter, calling it a “huge joke”. Another MP said the new leadership was “shambolic”. \nThe party had considered writing its own alternative to the charter. However, the clerks of the Commons have ruled out the idea of it tabling its own amendments along those lines. \n“We will rebuff any allegation of being deficit deniers by publishing for the debate our own statement on budget responsibility,” said Mr McDonnell. \nThe Scottish National party is also voting against the fiscal charter, it announced at the weekend. \nMr McDonnell’s U-turn comes as Mr Corbyn returned to the Commons this week after a hiking holiday in the Scottish Highlands that meant he missed his swearing-in as a member of the privy council. \nThe Labour leader is seeking to questions from the public for Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, just as he did at his first PMQs outing last month. Mr Corbyn is keen to get back on the front foot after a difficult first month following his unexpected victory in the summer leadership race.
