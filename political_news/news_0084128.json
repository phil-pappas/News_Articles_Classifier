Here’s The Guardian with more:\nRegional powers have quietly, but effectively, channelled funds, weapons and other support to rebel groups making the biggest inroads against the forces from Damascus. In doing so, they are investing heavily in a conflict which they see as part of a wider regional struggle for influence with bitter rival Iran.\nIn a week when Russia made dozens of bombing raids, those countries have made it clear that they remain at least as committed to removing Assad as Moscow is to preserving him.\n“There is no future for Assad in Syria,” Saudi foreign minister Adel Al-Jubeir warned, a few hours before the first Russian bombing sorties began. If that was not blunt enough, he spelled out that if the president did not step down as part of a political transition, his country would embrace a military option, “which also would end with the removal of Bashar al-Assad from power”. With at least 39 civilians reported dead in the first bombing raids, the prospect of an escalation between backers of Assad and his opponents is likely to spell more misery for ordinary Syrians.\nRegional powers have quietly, but effectively, channelled funds, weapons and other support to rebel groups making the biggest inroads against the forces from Damascus.

There is no indication what-soever that Riyadh will change this position,” said Mohammed Alyahya, associate fellow at the King Faisal Centre for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.\n“What is clear to Riyadh and its regional allies is that the recent Russian and Iranian escalation will only create a more unstable region and spill more blood,” he said.\n………..Of course that isn’t going to work.\nSay what you will about how successful guerilla/urban warfare can be when it comes to bogging down a conventional army (examples of this include Vietnam, the Soviet-Afghan war, and Somalia during the Black Hawk down debacle), but the disorganization of the Syrian resistance combined with the fact that Iran has its own well-armed militias on the ground that, in combination with Hezbollah, are providing the ground support for Russian airstrikes, means the situation is all but hopeless for the various Riyadh- and Doha-backed groups operating in Syria.\nThe only way to turn the tide here would be to intervene directly.\nBut just as Iran is unwilling to risk direct intervention on behalf of the Houthis in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Qatar will likely be unwilling to risk direct intervention on behalf of their proxy armies in Syria. The problem for Riyadh and Doha: Syria is a lot more strategically important than Yemen\nForeign-backed militants groups in Syria reject UN peace initiative\nIn Syria, surrender begins to look like a good plan\nhttp://fortruss.blogspot.com/2015/10/in-syria-surrender-begins-to-look-like.html\nTranslated from Russian by Tom Winter\nLatakia, Oct 3 – Seven hundred militants and men wanted by the government have surrendered with their weapons to the competent authorities in the province of Deraa in southern Syria in the past few days, according to the national news agency SANA on Saturday.\nIn Deraa, according to the agency, more than 450 militants, plus 250 people wanted by the government, have decided to lay down their arms and return to civilian life, in the framework of the national reconciliation program.\nThe militants surrendered turning in their automatic rifles, machine guns and sniper rifles.\nThe most striking example of success of the national reconciliation program, announced by the Syrian government, occurred last year in Homs. 1,500 fighters turned themselves in there after they had taken the center of the city.\nThe national program of reconciliation allows Syrian citizens to surrender their weapons and go through a rehabilitation process in order to return to civilian life.\nThe armed conflict in Syria has been going on since March 2011 and its victims, according to the UN, number more than 220 thousand people. Militias belonging to various armed groups oppose the government. The most active fighters are the extremist groups “Islamic State” and “Jebat Al-Nusra .”\n450 militants turn themselves in to Syrian authorities\nDid the “New” new World Order just emerge?\nhttp://fortruss.blogspot.com/2015/10/did-new-new-world-order-just-emerge.html\n…….. From discontent to New world order\nPutin’s speech was above all a call for re-establishing the founding principles upon which the United Nations were founded and it also was about proclaiming to the whole world that, like it or not, Multi-polarity is the condition we all live in today.\nAll of this would be only words in the wind if not backed by military presence and economic growth of the emerging powers, but above all they would mean little if the results of the Western political decisions in the last several decades were not fallowing:\nAbsolute neglecting of the international law in the case of NATO’s bombing of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. This was done without the UN security council mandate and it therefore became a precedent that broke the existing international order and set up a dangerous example that was not once repeated afterwards.\nThe result of the US aggression on Iraq in 2003 made the country become practically a territory divided along the sectarian lines and the most of it is controlled by the Iranian influenced Shia Arabs.\nThe Arab spring caused a chain of events that turned the most important country of the Arab world, and a traditional US allay – Egypt an allay of Russia once again, under the rule of general Sisi. French “Mistral” helicopter carrier ships that were supposed to be sold to Russia are now being sold to Egypt instead, which is rather an illustration or a symptom of a wider shift in the Middle-East.\nThe oil rich Gulf monarchies, Saudi Arabia before others, that were backing the Islamist militants in Syria, and involved in an illegal aggression on Yemen that is not going well for them, are now afraid for their own existence being aware that the so called Islamic State, a monster they’ve helped create, can turn against them while their traditional enemy Iran is getting more powerful then ever before especially after the nuclear treaty. Now all of these monarchies are trying to find a common language with Moscow in a pursuit to survive in the emerging world.\nThe United States is for a variety of reasons (one of them the US becoming energy independent), leaving the Middle-East and shifting its focus to the Pacific region.\nThe list goes on, but these reasons are a tip of the iceberg. One way or the other, days of “West’s” exceptionalism and self-given moral superiority above the “rest” are numbered. Other powers, before all Russia and China, showed that they are to be counted with. So the main remaining question is will the political West comply with the new state of affairs, and try to find a common language with other major powers, or prolong the struggle and cause even greater chaos. The near future will provide answer to this question, therefore to say times ahead of us are going to be very interesting would be an understatement.\nKirkuk mourns 10 Peshmerga fighters executed by ISIL\nMilitants Start Withdrawing Forces from Syria’s Idlib amid Russian Airstrikes\nGunmen from the Jeish al-Fatah coalition of extremist groups are pulling out their forces from Idlib and other towns in Northwestern Syria, media reports said.\nThe radical group started moving towards the Turkish border on Saturday after having experienced “the efficiency of the Russian aerospace forces’ strikes,” the As-Safir Arabic-language daily reported.\nThe coalition is led by al-Nusra terrorist group, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, which is sponsored by Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. The group seized the Idlib province this spring.\nThe report said field commanders fear at any moment the attack of Syrian forces supported by Russian warplanes on the key town of Jisr al-Shugour, on the Lattakia-Aleppo highway.\nAfter the intensive air raids, the gunmen stopped offensive on the al-Ghaab plain in the Northwestern Hama province. Syria’s army and people’s militias could launch a counterattack in this area in the coming hours.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has stressed that the operation of Russia’s aerospace forces in Syria, conducted since September 30 at the request from Bashar Assad, is aimed at battling terrorism and preserving the country’s integrity.\nRussian Air Force in Syria Smashes ISIL with Kh-29L Air-to-Surface Missile\nSome 700 Terrorists Give up Fight, Surrender to Syrian Authorities\nMilitary sources in the Southern Dara’a province said that over 450 militants from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and another 250 people wanted by the government authority have turned themselves into the Syrian Security Forces.\nThe sources said Saturday that a member of the militant group delivered a message, which specifically stated their intentions to surrender to the state government if they would be offered an amnesty hearing in exchange.\nThe Syrian forces inside the provincial capital of the Dara’a governorate were surprised by the huge line of militants from the FSA that were preparing to surrender themselves to the state government in exchange for an amnesty hearing offered by a civilian tribunal.\nAlso on Thursday, some 70 wanted Takfiri militants surrendered to the Syrian authorities to be pardoned as the army continues to advance against the terrorists.\nThey are from Damascus and its countryside, Homs, Dara’a and Idlib.\nHundreds of gunmen have been laying down their weapons and turning themselves in to authorities in areas across the country.\nThis number seems to be on the rise as the army has been making steady gains in the battlefield against the terrorist groups, recapturing an increasing number of regions, including strategic sites, which helped cut off many of the militants’ supply routes and forced them to surrender or run away.\nSenior Nusra Commander Killed in Syrian Airstrikes at Dara’a-Sweida Border\nSyrian, Russian Forces’ Operations Hit Militants in Homs Governorate\nHundreds of Takfiris Killed, Injured in Aleppo\nTens of Terrorists Killed in Clashes with Yemeni Popular Forces\nIran, Iraq, Russia, Syria to Set Up Joint Operations Room Soon\nA senior Iraqi politician revealed that his country along with Iran, Russia and Syria have set up an information exchange center which will pave the ground for the formation of a quadrilateral operations room in campaign against terrorism.\n“The information center has been formed some days ago after 6 months of discussions,” Political Advisor to the Head of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq Mohsen Hakim told FNA on Sunday.\nElaborating on the information exchange room, he said that the officer in charge is changed every three months but the reports are provided to the Iranian, Iraqi, Russian and Syrian armies’ joint chief of staff every day to update their information.\nHakim underlined that the information center can be a preliminary step to set up a joint operations room or Centcom.\nHe further reminded his country’s need to logistical aid and air backup, and said Iraq at present doesn’t need ground forces to fight against the terrorist groups.\nRussia is currently providing military and technical assistance to Damascus in its fight against the ISIL terrorist organization, urging other countries.\nSyrian officials have welcomed Iran and Russia’s military assistance in campaign against terrorism.\n“Syria welcomes Iran and Russia’s military partnership in fight against the ISIL in Syria and assumes the efforts made by these countries as legal, distant from the double-standards and in line with safeguarding our national security,” Jamal Rabe’eh, a senior Syrian legislator, told FNA in September.\nThe Syrian foreign minister also said early September that Damascus might ask Moscow to send troops to fight alongside the government forces against terrorist groups in the war-torn country if necessary.\nMoreover, Syria’s envoy to the United Nations said earlier that Russia had every right to carry out airstrikes against the ISIL on the country’s soil.\nAlso, Iran, Syria and Iraq have inked several defense cooperation agreements based on which Tehran gives consultations to Damascus and Baghdad in fighting against the terrorist groups.", "external_links": ["http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940712001179",
