West declared his 2020 presidential run in August at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) . Although it is not clear if West actually intends to run, a \"Ready for Kanye\" PAC was filed with the Federal Election Commission following the awards show. Both Obama and West attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser event in San Francisco Saturday, where both took the stage, Obama to give a speech and West to perform. To preface his speech, Obama nodded to West and his presidential campaign. Colbert Decries Billy Goat Curse, Predicts Cubs World Series Win \"In a little while you are going to hear from a guy who is thinking about getting into politics,\" Obama said before offering his advice \"in case Kanye is serious about this whole POTUS thing, or as Kanye calls it 'peezy.'\" The president then went on to humorously explain what it takes to be president as well as what it takes just to get there, noting the two have a similar history.

Although West was invited as a performer, not a politician, his past antics and statements on stage have drawn him into debates that extend beyond his music. President Obama himself spoke on West's actions before, calling him a \"jackass\" after the rapper interrupted Taylor Swift while she accepted an award for Best Female Video during the 2009 VMAs.
