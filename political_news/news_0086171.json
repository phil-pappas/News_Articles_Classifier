His claims to be motivated by safety concerns are laughable. This is pure prejudice and bigotry. According to Inside Higher Ed , Proponents of Texas’s new campus carry gun law say it could help save lives in an active shooter scenario, since those with guns could theoretically intervene or defend themselves. But that rationale has lots of critics -- many of them faculty members -- who say more guns won’t reduce violence and weapons have no place on college campuses. And the law itself has already led to one faculty casualty at the University of Texas at Austin, with the resignation of an actively teaching professor emeritus of economics who says being on a campus with untold numbers of firearms is simply not worth the risk. “As much as I have loved the experience of teaching and introducing these students to economics at the university, I have decided not to continue,” Daniel S. Hamermesh, the Sue Killam Professor Emeritus, wrote in a letter to university administrators this week. “With a huge group of students my perception is that the risk that a disgruntled student might bring a gun into the classroom and start shooting at me has been substantially enhanced by the concealed-carry law.” \nThis man is clearly a moron or a liar. I don’t know which option is the more respectful of him since we have to decide between his intelligence or his moral character. Guns were not permitted in the buildings at Umpqua Community College. Did that stop the shooter? Not at all. It merely guaranteed that his victims would probably not be able to return fire. \n“Disgruntled” students are not going to be deterred by a sign that says “no guns.” The only way to make a gun free zone work would be to have a huge contingent of armed security guards with all access points into the college or into every college building blocked by security checkpoints where students are searched or scanned. \nIs that what we want? \nMaybe that kind of prison system is this professor’s ideal, but it doesn’t matter. Colleges can’t afford it even if people would allow it. \nSimply telling people to carry or not carry as they wish is far cheaper and far more effective. \nThe fact that this professor is “emeritus” indicates he is not giving up much by his decision to stop teaching. This gives him a lot of notoriety at relatively low personal cost. \nThe story tries to back the professor by mentioning that Oregon is a “campus carry state,” implying that Umpqua Community College was not a gun free zone. Technically, that is true due to recent legal changes. But, reading Snopes , it is clear the college did what it could to convince people it was a gun free zone. The shooter knew the college and surely knew that many did not carry on campus due to the colleges policies. Furthermore, guns were banned from college buildings , which is precisely where the shooter chose to attack (big surprise). By the time armed students heard what was going on in the building, they had to worry about what might happen if they were seen by arriving police running across campus with guns. \nSo effectively, students were disarmed and students died. This professor is lobbying for more fatalities. There is nothing better that can be said about his idiotic statements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:16:43.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
