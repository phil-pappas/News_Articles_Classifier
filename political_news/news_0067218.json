Years before, Synn had been moved to give a word of prophecy to receiver David Tyree of the New York Giants while working for him in a professional capacity. \nTyree is a dedicated Christian, and Synn predicted Tyree would accomplish something that would allow him to spread God’s Word. Tyree went on to make perhaps the the most spectacular catch in NFL history in Super Bowl XLII. As a result, Tyree was propelled to a new level of fame and gave his own testimony in his book, “More Than Just the Catch.” \nCahn observed: “Because David Tyree wrote the book and mentioned this guy’s name, it put him in touch with the president of Charisma publishers, who then I get a contact from. Stephen Strang, the publisher, says: ‘We heard about what happened what happened at the airport. We heard about ‘The Harbinger.’ We have no idea what it is, but we’re interested.’ And that’s how ‘The Harbinger’ went forth to America, just by the hand of God.” \nSynn, author of the book “Tales of a Wandering Prophet,” had told Cahn his situation was like that of a man standing before a staircase. However, Synn prophesied, Cahn would not walk up the stairs but leap up. And sure enough, Cahn soon found himself on national television shows and was known around the world. \nAgain, Cahn maintains it wasn’t anything he did, but simply “the Lord getting the word out.” \nReflecting on the reception of “The Harbinger” and “The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,” Cahn marvels, “It has evoked so much response from leaders, Christian leaders I’ve known my whole life, hailing it, or inviting me on [their shows] or getting in touch.” \nSome of those who responded were members of Congress and presidential candidates. \nFormer congresswoman and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann read “The Harbinger” at the urging of a friend and recalled she “immediately” knew what she was reading was true. \nBachmann, author of “Core of Conviction: My Story,” said: “The words struck a chord of recognition in my soul, and that’s what Scripture does.” \nReflecting on the “tenor of the times,” Bachmann argued Cahn’s message was simple in its essence. \n“He was explaining to the country that we have two choices. Either pride, where we rise up in our own pride and defy a holy God and see ourselves cast down as a nation and go further into decline, or we can recognize we have fallen away from a holy God who loves us. And what we need to do then as a nation is confess our sins before Him, repent which means turn 180 degrees from our sin, and follow the path of obedience toward Him.” \nCahn is pleased to note his work has engendered messages from around the world informing him of prayers for America’s repentance, revivals and people giving their lives to Christ. \nHe explains in “The Harbinger Man” that he’s seen his life change in ways he could have never imagined. \nHowever, in the end, he has a simple explanation for the success of his message – it’s God’s message. \n“I believe that’s simply a function of the fact that the Lord wanted it out,” Cahn said. “It’s totally been His hand.” \nSee the “Harbinger Man” trailer:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:44:05.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
