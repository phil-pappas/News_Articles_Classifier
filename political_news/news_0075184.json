It seems that Frito Lay is now doing a fundraiser for the favored cause of the day--LGBT! So now when someone buys Rainbow Doritos, a donation is sent to the \"It Gets Better Campaign,\" a movement to give your homeosexuals a place to get courage and support in their lives. \nAccording to the group's website, \"The It Gets Better Project's mission is to communicate to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth around the world that it gets better, and to create and inspire the changes needed to make it better for them.\" \nAs someone who doesn't really get into the whole boycotting thing, I wouldn't boycott Frito Lay over this alone. I might personally choose not to purchase rainbow Doritos, but I would still buy Frito Lay's other products. The problem with this campaign from Frito Lay is that they have hired a man who regularly bashes Christians. His name is Dan Savage, who regularly gets in the face of Christians and harasses them for a variety of things. \"Savage is a far left wing bigot. He is the poster boy for the extreme hypocrisy that is so prevalent on the left. According to an article at Brietbart.com, Savage has a lengthy history of Christian bashing, Bible bashing and spewing nothing short of the most vulgar vitriol imaginable at any and all conservatives.\" \nHere's the big problem with this--if a notable conservative personality were openly bashing homosexuals, or environmentalists, or even just Democrats, no corporation in America would support such a person. There is a double standard prevalent in our culture that makes Christians the only unprotected class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:01:59.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
