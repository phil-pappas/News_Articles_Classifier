But the vote it would have is non-binding on the Government and Labour MPs could choose not to turn up. . @AngusRobertson confirms SNP will ensure there is an early debate and vote at Westminster on #trident . \n— The SNP (@theSNP) October 15, 2015 @AngusRobertson was the first to raise the refugee crisis at #PMQs & used first SNP op.debate to highlight the issue pic.twitter.com/VVF9vDZvaS \n— Catriona Matheson (@_cmatheson) October 15, 2015 \nAt SNP conference today, Mr Robertson told delegates: \"Labour weren't prepared to have a specific debate on Trident at their conference. I am pleased that the SNP is debating it here at our conference. \n\"I'm also happy to help Jeremy Corbyn and ensure that there is an early debate and vote at Westminster aimed at opposing Trident renewal. \n\"Hopefully Jeremy will join the SNP in the lobbies as he has often done in the past in opposing Trident, although I am not holding my breath that he can bring his colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party with him.\" \nMPs are due to vote on Trident renewal next year, but the Tories could hold a vote before Christmas in an attempt to take the issue out of the Scottish Parliament elections next May.
