That assumption may not be valid anymore: Not only is China’s economy losing momentum despite a range of policy measures last year but the imbalances appear more threatening than befo What will drive global markets? Financial markets have been on a wild ride since the year began. Prices of equities, bonds, currencies and commodities have fluctuated, sometimes wildly, and have confounded the forecasts of the best pundits. How does an investor make sense of this market turbulence?

The portents for the Singapore economy have been mixed of late. Despite a strong labour market buoying retail sales, other drivers of growth are flagging. The global economy has been disappointing, with weakness in the Eurozone, Japan and China offsetting a strengthening American economy.
