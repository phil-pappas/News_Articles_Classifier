Unable to bear the weight, the vehicle tilted and fell into the gorge near Dalsar area, said a police officer. \nFourteen persons were killed on-the-spot, while 30 others were grievously injured out of which the condition of 10 persons was reported to be serious. \n“Rescue work is still on. The work is proceeding at a slow pace as the accident took place in a remote area where there is lack of transportation,” he said. \n“We fear the toll may be increase as some more people are trapped in the vehicle and rescue operation is still going on,” said Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, deputy commissioner Udhampur . \nMeanwhile, the injured are being shifted to district hospital Udhampur from where the seriously injured have been referred to the Government Medical College (GMC) and Hospital in Jammu. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:45:57.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
