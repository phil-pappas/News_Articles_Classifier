He was 60.\nSaunders was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma in June and doctors called it \"treatable and curable\" when the Minnesota Timberwolves made the diagnosis public in August. He took a leave of absence from the team in September after complications arose during his recovery.\nSaunders went 654-592 in 17 seasons with the Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards.\nSam Mitchell has been named interim head coach of the Timberwolves and GM Milt Newton is heading the team's personnel department.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
