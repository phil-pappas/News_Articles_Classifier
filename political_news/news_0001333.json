Some of the findings include farmers agree efficient water management is essential, are aware there are new rules governing nutrient losses, and around 2/3 of the farmers interviewed said they were somewhat or very familiar with the CWMS. \nFollowing this, the committee will receive a presentation from Irrigation NZ on its SMART Irrigation campaign to raise public awareness of the need to use water wisely on-farm and at home. \nThe committee will also receive a briefing from Dairy NZ about their initiatives and activities in the zone, including the sustainable milk plan project and supporting local farmers with farm environment plans. \nAfter the meeting, the committee will hold workshops on the zone’s sub-regional planning process which will begin next year. The committee will discuss its priority outcomes and how they relate to the technical work that will be undertaken for the Waimakariri sub-regional chapter in the Land and Water Regional Plan. A series of meetings were held earlier in the year to ensure the community were involved in the process as early as possible. The committee will conclude with a short workshop to confirm future community engagement options. \nThe Waimakariri Zone Committee, formed in September 2010, operates as a joint committee of Environment Canterbury, and the Waimakariri District Council. It features five community members as well as two RÅ«nanga representatives and two from councils. \nThe zone includes the Ashley River catchment and shares the Waimakariri catchment below the gorge with the Selwyn-Waihora and Christchurch-West Melton zones. It includes Kaiapoi, Rangiora and Oxford. \nMeeting Details \nDate: 3:30pm, Monday, 5 October, 2015 \nVenue: Waimakariri District Council Chambers, Rangiora \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:10:40.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
