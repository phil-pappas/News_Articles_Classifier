This fall, tune into 'Likable Enough,'\" the narrator says, as clips of Clinton's past debate performances play onscreen.\nThe title, \"Likable Enough,\" plays off a remark made by then-Sen. Barack Obama during the final debate before the New Hampshire primary in 2008.\n  Obama's climate plan gets hit from the left Democrats in Republican bellwethers could make opposing the president's climate change a trend.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/13/15 12:01 AM \"You're likeable enough, Hillary,\" Obama said at the time — a message that appears to stand true this election cycle with Clinton maintaining her front-runner status despite low favorability ratings.\nAs a laugh track plays in the background, the video features clip after clip of Clinton's past Democratic opponents hammering her for flip-flopping on certain issues.\n\"Unless I missed something, Sen. Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes,\" former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards says in one clip taken from the 2008 cycle.\nThe video also mocks the Democrats' current \"cast of characters,\" dubbing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \"The Socialist,\" and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley \"Guitar Guy.\"\nClinton, Sanders, and O'Malley will join former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb on stage Tuesday evening. The debate will air live from Las Vegas at 8:30 p.m. ET on CNN.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Bush: JebCare better than 'special interest' Obamacare \"The one thing I know is this: We can't stick with the status quo,\" Bush said.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/13/15 11:23 AM American Rising plans to fact-check all five Democratic candidates during tonight's debate through live coverage on its website .\nTop Story Planned Parenthood to stop accepting cash for fetal tissue \nPlanned Parenthood will no longer accept payments  \nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/13/15 10:32 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:05:24.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
