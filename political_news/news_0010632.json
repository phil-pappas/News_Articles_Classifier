Now he's an underdog looking to Tuesday's debate to revive his candidacy. \nThe former Maryland governor says voters so far have been subjected to lots of rhetoric. But he tells CNN's \"State of the Union,\" ''it's not about words. It's about actions.\" O'Malley says on Tuesday he'll point to how he built consensus during his time as a governor and mayor on such issues as comprehensive gun safety, immigration and marriage equality. \nO'Malley also says he disagrees with Clinton's suggestion that the United States create a no-fly zone in Syria because of a potential clash with Russia. He warns that an accident \"could lead to an escalation of Cold War proportions.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:14:44.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
