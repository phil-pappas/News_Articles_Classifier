You know it matters when you have a mammogram, but did you know it matters where you get your mammogram? Identifying a breast center that has demonstrated the highest level of quality care to their patients, with a special focus on the female experience, will give you confidence that you’re getting the best care available.\nHere are five key factors to look for when choosing the right facility for your breast care:\nDr. Lynda Frye inspecting digital mammogram imaging. Accreditation\nYou should have mammography only at a facility accredited by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Accreditation by the ACR means that the radiologists and technicians are specially trained and certified in mammography and that the equipment meets standards and is inspected regularly.\nJupiter Medical Center’s Margaret W. Niedland Breast Center is not only accredited by the ACR, it is recognized as a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence because it has met rigorous standards and measures of excellence set by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC).\nDr. Lynda Frye, MD Board-certified radiologists, with fellowship training in mammography\nIt matters who reads your mammogram. Research has shown that specialty-trained breast radiologists find significantly more cancers, and at earlier stages, than general radiologists. Whenever you make an appointment for a mammogram, ask if the center has radiologists who have completed fellowships in breast imaging. At the Margaret W. Niedland Breast Center, all mammograms are read by board-certified radiologists who are fellowship trained in mammography. My colleague, Dr. Orna Hadar and I, we have more than 30 years of combined experience in interpreting these studies.\nAdvanced technology\n3-D mammography allows radiologists to examine breast tissue layer by layer, one millimeter at a time. Instead of viewing all of the complexities of breast tissue in a flat, 2-D image, fine details are more visible and are no longer hidden by tissue above or below. Research has shown up to a 40 percent reduction in women being called back for additional imaging with 3-D mammography, and it detects more than 41 percent more invasive breast cancers than 2-D mammography.\nIn 2014, the Margaret W. Niedland Breast Center became the first facility in the region with technology that offers women the full benefits of 3-D imaging coupled with a lower dose of radiation. You should also look for a facility that can do MRI, ultrasound or other imaging procedures in case it is necessary to get a more precise look.\nGenetic testing and counseling for cancer risk\nGenetic risk assessment and counseling makes it possible to predict a woman’s susceptibility to cancer and make her aware of her options to be proactive about prevention.\nOur team in the Niedland Breast Center’s Cancer Genetics and High Risk Program will work closely with you to map your family’s cancer history, determine your risk and develop a plan specialized for you to help lower your risk and possibly prevent cancer from developing.\nPatient navigators for personalized support\nManeuvering through the health care system can be daunting, especially if you’ve just been diagnosed with breast cancer or even if you’ve just received word of a suspicious finding on your mammogram. At the Niedland Breast Center, our health navigator is a trained oncology nurse who provides emotional support and helps guide patients through their experience, from diagnosis to recovery and beyond.\nOnce you choose a breast center you can trust, don’t compromise your health for convenience. Have your mammogram there every year. This way, your current mammogram can be compared with past mammograms to help detect subtle, abnormal changes.\nJupiter Medical Center’s Niedland Breast Center is committed to providing you consistent, high-quality service year after year, so you don’t have to shop around. We have set the standard for the best in breast health available to our community.\nTo schedule your mammogram, call 561-263-2000.
