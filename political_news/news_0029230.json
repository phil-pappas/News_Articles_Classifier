Paul Ryan is telling House Republicans privately he is considering running for speaker, several members say. U.S. suspending program to arm Syrian rebels \nThe U.S. is going to suspend its faltering Syrian rebel training program, U.S. officials said Friday. \nDefense Secretary Ash Carter said during a news conference in London that the U.S. \"remains committed\" to training forces in Syria against ISIS, but... \nTed Cruz said Thursday that he did not think Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee, his harshest criticism yet of a candidate he has assiduously avoided even brushing with judgment. \nAsked by WABC Radio's Rita Cosby whether he believed that \"eve... \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy shook up the House speaker's race Thursday when he announced he would drop out of the running -- and he had the highest chances to win on CNN's Political Prediction Market. \nThe Political Prediction Market experien...

Paul Ryan has repeatedly indicated he is not running for speaker of the House, even as heavy hitters --- including retiring Speaker John Boehner -- urge him to reconsider. \nBut Thursday night, it looked like Ryan may be changing his tune. \nSpeaking... More \nRyan informed several members on the House floor of his deliberations, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, told CNN. Stewart added that he urged Ryan to run, with the Wisconsin Republican replaying that he was \"thinking and praying on it.\" \nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who shocked Capitol Hill by deciding Thursday not to try and succeed retiring Speaker John Boehner, also said Ryan is weighing a run. \n\"Paul's looking at it but it's his decision,\" McCarthy said on CNN. \"If he decides to do it, he'll be an amazing speaker but he's got to decide on his own.\" \nRep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said that Ryan told him privately he is thinking about it as well. \"I think he's gone from a hard no to he knows he has to consider it,\" he said. \nPublicly, Ryan isn't tipping his hand. He didn't make a statement during the closed-door House Republican conference meeting Friday morning, and told reporters the same. \n\"I've got nothing to add, nothing to say,\" Ryan said outside his office. \nBoehner staying for now \nBoehner indicated he will stay as long as possible in the speaker's job, although he still wants to \"be out of here by the end of the month,\" Rep. Dennis Ross said, adding that Boehner urged members to \"hang in there.\" \nAnd addressing rumors that he might step down as majority leader, McCarthy told his fellow Republicans he plans to remain in the job, a source in the room said. \nThe meeting was centered on the rules and process going forward, members said. \n\"We are doing what needs to be done, said Rep. Scott Rigell, R-Virginia. \"And Kevin (McCarthy) spoke very eloquently this morning and said 'If this causes us to do what we need to do in terms of reforming the rules and the House rules. Then that's a good thing.\" \nAll about Ryan \nAs the surprise of McCarthy's decision not to seek the top job wore off Thursday afternoon, eyes turned to Ryan, the former vice presidential nominee and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Influential and well-respected throughout the GOP caucus, Ryan could be a peacemaker between the warring factions. \nDeputy Majority Whip Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, also wants Ryan in the job. \n\"I think eventually Paul Ryan will get into this thing, I really do,\" Cole said Friday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"I think we've had two guys fall on their swords for the good of the conference, in this case it's hard not to step up when there's an overwhelming demand.\" \nAnd for good measure, he added an appeal to Ryan's sense of duty. \n\"Paul's got a strong sense of doing the right thing,\" Cole said. \"I'm just so confident he'll make the right choice.\" \nBoehner and Ryan have a long relationship: Ryan volunteered for Boehner's campaign when he was a student at Miami University in Ohio in the 1990s, before launching his own political career. But Boehner has not publicly called on Ryan to replace him. \nOn paper, Ryan is a strong candidate. The Ways and Means Committee chairman and Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate in 2012 is respected throughout the conference and on paper could bridge the gap between tea party-linked conservatives and more establishment Republicans. \nBut his backing among the current House leadership could be a drag on his candidacy, as the conservative backlash against Boehner's team shows no sign of abating. \nConservatives do praise many of Ryan's policy positions, yet are already warning Ryan would need to agree to a series of demands to change House rules and agree to their policy agenda. \nRep. Charlie Dent, a moderate and critic of the Freedom Caucus, said more needs to change than just the man or woman in the chair. \n\"At the end of the day, it's not who we put in that job,\" Dent said on CNN. \"If we don't change the political dynamic, the next speaker will suffer the fate that John Boehner did.\" \n\"We must assemble bipartisan coalitions to pass any meaningful legislation,\" Dent added. \"That's the way this place has been operating. We have to accept that reality and move forward.\" \nDemocratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez on MSNBC called Ryan one of the smartest men in the GOP. \n'He would be good for the country, Gutierrez said. \"He would be good for the Republican Party. Paul Ryan is the kind of individual that would work with people on the other side of the aisle and that's what we need.'\" \nChaffetz won't run if Ryan does \nFriday morning, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican whose candidacy helped draw people away from McCarthy, said he would drop out of the race if Ryan runs, a sign conservatives are willing to rally behind the Wisconsin Republican. \n\"He's certainly in my mind the most qualified person to do it and I hope he'll do it,\" Chaffetz said on MSNBC. \nOther names that Cole said could be viable if Ryan stands firm and doesn't run, include Minnesota Rep. John Kline and Georgia Reps. Lynn Westmoreland and Tom Price. Westmoreland told CNN he was considering it. And Cole's own name has been floated by his peers -- something he said Thursday he wouldn't rule out, though he said there were \"better\" options than himself. \nAnd Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Florida, who won the Freedom Caucus' endorsement, also remains a candidate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:03:18.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
