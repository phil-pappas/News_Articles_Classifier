Bernie Sanders, whose campaign says it raised more than $24 million in that time. \nClinton's campaign says 93 percent of the donations were $100 or less. More than 60 percent came from women. \nSanders' campaign says it raised at least $1.5 million on Wednesday, the last day of the fundraising period. Campaign spokesman Michael Briggs says most of the contributions came online. \nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook says in a statement that she is \"thrilled and grateful\" for the support.
