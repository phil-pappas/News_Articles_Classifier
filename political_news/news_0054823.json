The white-water releases from the Nockamixon State Park dam provide suitable white-water boating conditions downstream through Ralph Stover State Park from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.\nWater releases begin at 4 a.m. Several hours later, the flow of millions of gallons of water moving down the waterway will create white-water conditions at Ralph Stover State Park, according to park officials. Suggested hours for viewing the release and boating activity are from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Ralph Stover.\nWater releases are eagerly awaited by white-water paddling enthusiasts, drawing skilled kayakers, canoeists and occasional rafters from throughout the Northeastern United States . Most launch their craft at Ralph Stover State Park, near Pipersville , Bucks County , and travel some four miles along the Tohickon Creek to its junction with the Delaware River at Point Pleasant .\nDCNR officials remind boaters that this is technical whitewater with Class 3 and 4 rapids that require boating skills. Boaters should be aware of and abide by the safety code of the American Whitewater Affiliation. Boaters must wear appropriate personal flotation devices, take appropriate precautions to prevent hypothermia, and use only craft designed for this type of water.\nThis popular event was cancelled in fall 2012 due to damage at Ralph Stover State Park from Hurricane Sandy; again in the fall 2013 due to a mechanical failure at the dam control tower in Nockamixon State Park; and subsequently due to replacement of a Route 32 bridge across the Tohickon Creek in Point Pleasant .\nAlthough bridge work is not complete, with the cooperation of PennDOT and its contractor, park officials say conditions permit a water release this fall. If high water does not provide sufficient clearance at temporary bridges for boaters to pass safely, boaters will exit at the Point Pleasant Community Park.\nFor more information, contact Nockamixon State Park at (215) 529-7300, or Delaware Canal State Park at (610) 982-5560.
