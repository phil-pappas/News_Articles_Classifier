The officers weren't told by a dispatcher that the caller said the man might be a kid and the gun might not be real.\nA surveillance video shows a police cruiser driven by Garmback skidding to a stop near Tamir and then Loehmann shooting the boy within two seconds.\nPolice officials have said Loehmann ordered Tamir three times to put up his hands before he shot him. A former police union official said the officers had no way of knowing Tamir was carrying an airsoft gun that only looked like a real firearm.\nThe grainy, choppy surveillance video has no sound that can verify Loehmann's contention he repeatedly told Tamir to raise his hands as the cruiser sped toward him with the passenger door open. And it doesn't provide a clear picture about where the pellet gun was when Tamir was shot, whether it was in the waistband of his pants or whether he had removed it.\nThose could be critical points for a grand jury to consider.\nRice family attorney Subodh Chandra said he wants to know whether McGinty's office, as is normal practice, will recommend to the grand jurors before their vote whether charges should be filed against the officers.\n\"They wear the jacket, tell the public what they think,\" Chandra said.\nMcGinty said no one should be surprised by the eventual outcome of the case. McGinty spokesman Joe Frolik said he \"suspects\" prosecutors will make a recommendation on charges but added: \"At the end of the day, the grand jury has the final say.\"\nThe Rice family has a lawsuit pending against Cleveland and the officers in federal court.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:00:10.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
