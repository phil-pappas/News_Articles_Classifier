By Daniel Beekman Seattle Times staff reporter \nCity Councilmember Nick Licata is calling on the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission to develop legislation barring people and organizations from using independent political spending to intimidate candidates in city elections. \nIn a letter to the commission on Tuesday, Licata cited reporting by The Seattle Times last week on an alleged shakedown of a City Council candidate by a real-estate developer. \nPosition 8 candidate Jon Grant accused Triad Capital Partners of attempting to use the threat of a big-money campaign against him to strong-arm him into helping end a lawsuit against the company. \nA Triad senior vice president, whom the company severed ties with after The Times reported on the matter, sent a text message to former Mayor Mike McGinn spelling out the quid pro quo and asking him to broker a deal. Most Read Stories \nThe news led Mayor Ed Murray to announce the city will end an agreement for Triad to purchase and build on property across from City Hall. \nGrant has filed complaints with the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, asking for an investigation. But Executive Director Wayne Barnett has said the Triad proposal lies outside its purview. Explore our election guide \nThe campaign in question was Seattle Needs Ethical Leaders, an independent expenditure committee. Such committees are barred from coordinating with candidate campaigns but have no restrictions on the size of contributions they can accept. \nBefore Grant went public about being approached by the Triad executive, a spokesman for the independent expenditure committee said it would spend $200,000 to oppose Grant in his race against Council President Tim Burgess. Seattle Needs Ethical Leaders has since shut down. \n“I find allegations reported in The Seattle Times deeply disturbing,” Licata wrote in the letter Tuesday. “It appears these alleged actions may not be clearly and unambiguously prohibited under the city Elections Code. If so, this loophole must be closed: Even an appearance of potential corruption deeply damages our civic life.” \nLicata suggested the code may be inadequate in the Triad case because, “Until recently, independent expenditures were not a prominent feature of Seattle elections.” \nBetween 1999 and 2007, independent spending in Seattle elections averaged less than $100,000 per cycle, Licata wrote. For the 2013 cycle, such spending totaled more than $570,000 and for the 2015 cycle, the number is already more than $490,000. \n“This trend in the size of independent expenditures suggests these alleged activities could be repeated, unless the city Elections Code is amended,” wrote Licata. \n“Current Seattle election law does not appear to address potential independent expenditures, and any potential quid pro quo that could result from those potential expenditures not being made,” he added. \n“Public trust is undermined by the lack of a clear, unambiguous prohibition in the … Elections Code of these activities that could be construed as unethical coercion at best, extortion at worst.” \nThe Seattle Ethics and Election Committee is an independent body with seven citizen, volunteer commissioners. Its chairman, Bruce Carter, and a commissioner, Brad Axel, didn’t immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. Daniel Beekman: 206-464-2164 or dbeekman@seattletimes.com .
