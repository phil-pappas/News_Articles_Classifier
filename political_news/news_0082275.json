Technically, we might not be in a world war, but little by little, the globe is becoming a chaotic jumble of military conflicts.\nSome conflicts are burning slowly, like that in Ukraine; others, such as those across the Middle East, are raging. Either way, governments around the world are seeing the need to arm up, if only to head off unwanted excursions from neighboring countries.\nIf spending does pick up, it could bring in some huge profits for those companies manufacturing the latest high-tech weaponry, smart bombs and warplanes. Specifically, it's companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp. (ticker: LMT), Northrup Grumman Corp. (NOC), Raytheon Co. (RTN), General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and Boeing Co. (BA) that should profit.\nSuch stocks have already done well over the past couple of years despite U.S. military spending cutbacks. In the last 24 months, each of those stocks, except Boeing, substantially outperformed the broad market, gaining between 46 percent and 79 percent, excluding dividends, versus 18 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index .\nNot bad, given Uncle Sam's spending has steadily declined since 2011. In 2010, the U.S. spent $843 billion, versus $738 last year, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. None of that takes inflation into account.\nStill, there are reasons to be more optimistic for the group to continue its rally. Some contractors are seeing \"urgent need demand\" due to conflicts in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Goldman Sachs says in a recent report. That means near-term revenue should be robust, at a minimum. It could be even better than that.\n\"Across the Middle East there's a sense that it's time to buy weapons, in the aftermath of the [Iran] nuclear deal,\" says Mark Moyar, a visiting scholar at the Foreign Policy Initiative, a nonpartisan think tank, and author of \"Strategic Failure: How President Obama's Drone Warfare, Defense Cuts, and Military Amateurism Have Imperiled America.\"\n\"I think there is going to be a spending surge,\" Moyar adds.\nThat's overseas. But the real money to be made in the defense business is when America starts buying.\n\"[U.S.] defense spending has only one way to go and that's up,\" says Mike Rocco, who covers industrial firms for PNC Wealth Capital Advisors in Philadelphia. \"Government funds will be made available; I don't see the world going back the way it was.\"\nThat actually emphasizes the key to this group doing well: government spending. Private citizens and corporations don't typically purchase missile systems or stealth bombers. That same factor also means there is less competition. You really don't buy the latest and greatest military equipment from your enemies. There are also relatively few countries that make sufficiently advanced arms.\nIn addition, Rocco says, there really isn't a currency risk â€“ the U.S. is still by far the biggest buyer of such equipment. On top of that, there isn't going to be a problem from cheap imports from emerging markets. That's not something that can be said about other industries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:10:42.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
