Chris Christie ’s veto of a gun control bill, the first time state lawmakers had mustered enough votes in more than 50 attempts at undoing one of his vetoes. An override, which still must pass the State Assembly, would dilute one of the claims Mr. Christie has repeatedly made while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination — that he has managed without fail to hold his party together in the State House. Democrats control both branches of the Legislature, but they need help from Republicans to override one of Mr. Christie’s vetoes. The governor said in a debate with other Republicans running for president that he had “vetoed 400 bills from a crazy liberal Democratic Legislature” and pointed with pride to the failure of every challenge. But his string of successes at thwarting lawmakers came to an end on Thursday when three Republican sponsors of the bill joined the Democrats in voting to override. “It’s presidential politics,” said the Senate president, Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester County who is considered a probable candidate for governor in 2017. “The only person that objected to this bill was the governor.” Photo A spokesman said Gov. Chris Christie liked a different bill. Credit Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press Mr. Sweeney said he believed Mr. Christie was playing to conservative voters in states with early primaries by refusing to put his name to a law that could be cited as a restriction of the right to bear arms. But the bill was really about mental health, not gun ownership, the senator said. It was a measure that had been requested by the courts to require the reporting of any attempt to expunge a gun buyer’s record of mental illness. There is no provision in existing law for local police to weigh in on whether an expungement should be granted. The bill had passed unanimously in the Senate and Assembly in June, before Mr. Christie conditionally vetoed it in August. Despite that broad support, the first attempt to override the veto failed, as most of the Republicans who had voted for the bill balked at defying the governor. Mr. Christie preferred a comprehensive approach to reforming New Jersey’s mental health system, said Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the governor, who called the vetoed bill a “half measure.” Mr. Christie supported a different bill that Thomas Kean Jr., a Republican assemblyman, had introduced, Mr. Roberts said. “Governor Christie is committed to a comprehensive approach, and he will continue to work with legislators of both parties to pass real mental health reforms which truly improve public safety,” Mr. Roberts said in a statement. Some Democrats and some advocates for people with mental illness have criticized aspects of Assemblyman Kean’s bill. Rather than wait to see how that bill fares, three co-sponsors of the vetoed bill — Christopher Bateman, Christopher J. Connors and Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr. — joined the 24 Democrats in a 27-to-12 vote, ending a string of 52 failed attempts to override one of Mr. Christie’s vetoes. Senator Connors said his decision was based on a desire to resolve the matter and was unrelated to whether Mr. Christie was running for president or Mr. Sweeney had hopes of being the next governor. If a similar vote in the Assembly receives the necessary two-thirds support, the law will require that the courts be notified of any request for the expungement of a mental health record for the purpose of obtaining a permit to buy a gun. In a statement, the Assembly speaker, Vincent Prieto, a Democrat from Hudson County, said” “It’s always a good day for New Jersey when elected officials put aside politics and do the right thing for the people. That’s what happened in the Senate, and I look forward to it happening soon in the Assembly.” Mr. Prieto added: “I see no logical reason why the Assembly wouldn’t vote to override this misguided veto and turn this bill into law.” A version of this article appears in print on October 23, 2015, on page A27 of the New York edition with the headline: New Jersey Senate Rejects Governor’s Veto of a Gun Control Bill.
