Several U.S. examples include:\nThe Davis School District in Utah comprises 59 elementary schools, 16 junior high schools, 11 high schools plus administrative facilities – more than 90 buildings and over 10 million square feet of space in all. Working with Schneider Electric's Building Management Systems, the district has seen its square footage grow 18 percent in two years – and its energy consumption reduced by 7 percent during that same period. North Carolina State University (NCSU) boasts an enrollment of 34,000 students. Schneider Electric was selected by NCSU to reduce energy consumption, drive the energy-related upgrades needed for campus buildings and ultimately save the university significant money in its annual utility costs. By using a combination of digital solutions, lighting upgrades, solar thermal heating, and an overall energy management system, these results are being realized – with the additional benefit of reducing NCSU's carbon footprint by 37 percent.
