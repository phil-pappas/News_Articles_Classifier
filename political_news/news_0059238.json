Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nReaching well back into the Howard period, his federal win-loss record stands at a very creditable 2-2.\nAdvertisement Mind you, he prefers two wins, one loss, and a draw - that being the woeful 2010 election which dished up the minority Parliament. After all, as campaign director, he did his bit in 2010 helping Tony Abbott to win more seats than Julia Gillard.\nRespected as he is, though, Loughnane's departure is not all bad.\nIt also presents an opportunity for reform by ensuring that when his replacement is installed, a proper and observable separation of responsibilities is re-established uncoupling the party's organisational leadership and that of its Parliamentary team.\nThat is because a perception of a conflict of interest was allowed to develop when the two most influential positions outside the governmental leadership - of Liberal Party federal director and of chief of staff to the Prime Minister - were occupied simultaneously by a married couple, Loughnane and Peta Credlin.\nIt meant that if party members had concerns with the way the federal government was operating, and particularly if those concerns went to the political and administrative performance of the Prime Minister, then any complainants might think twice about raising them.\nHistorically, in such situations, the top party official would approach the prime minister as a genuinely independent adviser to convey what might be a difficult message. It may conceivably involve frank assessments of the PM's own performance or that of his chief of staff. It may also require the protection of sources. And that, in turn, would rely on high levels of trust.\nYet for the past two years, any such grievances from party members have been problematic, amounting in practice to complaining to Loughnane about an office run by his wife. Few are likely to step forward in such circumstances.\nThe best thing Malcolm Turnbull can do now is stay right out of the process of selecting Loughnane's replacement. While Credlin and Loughnane will soon be gone, the party's next federal director should once again ensure a proper functional separation not only exists but is seen to exist.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/brian-loughnane-exit-signals-the-end-for-liberal-party-power-trio-20151008-gk406s.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/brian-loughnane-quits-as-liberal-party-federal-director-denies-he-was-pushed-20151008-gk405s.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-nutt-tipped-to-replace-brian-loughnane-as-liberal-party-federal-director-20151007-gk36i0.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:18:46.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
