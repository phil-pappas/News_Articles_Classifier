If I thought we could've put together the campaign ... that our supporters deserve and our contributors deserved, ... I would have done it,\" he said in an interview aired Sunday on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\"\nIn the wide-ranging interview, in which Biden took questions for a time joined by his wife, Jill, the vice president also said he would not have gotten into the race just to stop Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\"I've said from the beginning, 'Look, I like Hillary. Hillary and I get along together,\" he said. \"The only reason to run is because ... I still think I could do a better job than anybody else could do.\"\nHe used the interview to play down suggestions his announcement not to run, made at the White House Wednesday with President Barack Obama standing at his side, included a jab at Clinton.\nAt the White House event, Biden lamented partisan bickering in Washington politics and said, \"I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies.\" Clinton had made a statement to that effect during the Democratic presidential debate earlier this month.\n\"That wasn't directed at Hillary,\" Biden told \"60 Minutes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:53:18.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
