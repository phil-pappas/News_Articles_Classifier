Ben Soud was captured in Pakistan, tortured and held two years in Afghanistan, the lawsuit says, until he was sent to Libya, where he was imprisoned by dictator Moammar Gadhafi’s government until 2011.\nThe third alleged victim represented in the lawsuit, Gul Rahman, whose estate is suing for damages on his behalf, died of suspected hypothermia in 2002 after being shackled sitting without pants on a cold floor, the Senate report says. The lawsuit says the report shows that one of the psychologists “oversaw and encouraged” Rahman’s treatment.\n[ READ: Torture Leaves Long-Term Psychological Scars ]\nThe psychologists named in the lawsuit , James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, initially worked as independent contractors for the CIA after 9/11 to help break down detainees, earning $1.5 million and $1.1 million respectively, according to the Senate report, which identified the men using the pseudonyms \"Grayson Swigert\" and \"Hammond Dunbar.”\nIn 2005, the duo formed a company and supplied the CIA with many interrogators, according to the Senate report. The company – known to be Mitchell, Jessen & Associates – was paid more than $75 million for its interrogation work into 2010. The CIA also agreed to provide $5 million from which the company could pull for legal costs, the report says.\nThe new lawsuit, filed in Washington state, seeks damages under the Alien Tort Statute, which allows lawsuits for human rights abuses. A lawsuit brought under the act that wound up in the same federal appeals court system – the 9th Circuit – resulted in judgments worth about $2 billion against the estate of former Philippines ruler Ferdinand Marcos in the 1990s.\nWatt isn't asking for a particular dollar amount in damages, but says if the case is resolved in his clients' favor it \"would be a significant sum\" based on the seriousness of \"egregious human rights violations such as use of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, nonconsensual medical experimentation and the war crimes equivalents.\"\n[ JOHN McCAIN: A First-Person Account of Prison in North Vietnam ]\nSee Photos\nEditorial Cartoons on Torture and the CIA’s Enhanced Interrogation Techniques Indeed, the conduct alleged in the lawsuit is eye-opening.\nSalim alleges when he was abducted, the CIA cut off his clothes and “once he was naked, they forcibly inserted an object into his anus, causing him excruciating pain.” He alleges he was photographed and dressed n a diaper before being spirited to another location, where he was subjected to “prolonged periods of sleep deprivation, repeated dousing in extremely cold water in a manner that approximated waterboarding, beatings, attention grabs, forceful slaps to the face and body, cramped confinement in two boxes – one coffin-sized and the other significantly smaller – and prolonged nudity.”", "external_links": ["https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/salim-v-mitchell-complaint", "http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=7c85429a-ec38-4bb5-968f-289799bf6d0e&SK=D500C4EBC500E1D256BA519211895909", "http://www.democracynow.org/2010/9/9/federal_court_dismisses_lawsuit_against_boeing", "http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/world/asia/02philippines.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/world/europe/03masri.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:49:27.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
