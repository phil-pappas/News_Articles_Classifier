Promoted stories \nMomentum will organise events, rallies and policy consultations and attempt to forge links with campaigners outside Labour. \nLeft-wing Labour activists will launch a local branch of Momentum in Edinburgh at a venue in the Grassmarket this week. \nOne figure involved in group said Momentum supported the “aims and values” of Corbyn and added that they would reach out to non party members. \nVince Mills, the chair of the Campaign for Socialism in Scotland, told the Sunday Herald that Wednesday’s local launch would lead to a national organisation being unveiled in the next few weeks. \nHe said he hoped Corbyn or shadow chancellor John McDonnell would appear at the national Scottish launch. \nHowever, senior party sources are worried that Momentum and the wider Labour left will seek to influence the party’s List ranking selections for the next Holyrood election. \nWith Labour predicted to get wiped out in constituency seats, the party is expected to return around 25 MSPs on the eight regional Lists. \nThe insiders believe the party’s left-wing is planning to put forward a pro-Corbyn candidate on each List. \nTom Harris, a former Labour MP in Glasgow who helped expel Militant members in the late 1980s, said: \n“The question is: why do we need an organisation like Momentum? We already have the Labour party. I just don’t know what they think their role is. \n“Momentum say they don’t want infiltration by the Socialist Workers Party, but what about the Greens and Tommy Sheridan’s party? Labour activists have to be very careful when it comes to the motivations of any of these organisations. The reason we managed to get rid of Militant is the National Executive committee recognised it was a separate party.” Share article \nScottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: \"This group, whilst seeking to promote Jeremy Corbyn's career, will only further undermine the Labour Party in Scotland. \n\"With Labour out of the picture, the only serious pro-union party to vote for in next year's Holyrood elections is the Scottish Conservatives.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:05:51.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
