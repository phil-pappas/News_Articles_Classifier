The first of six trials is set to begin Nov. 30.\nFive of the six officers have asked to have their statements thrown out, contending they were improperly obtained. One didn't give a statement.\nBaltimore city state's attorney's spokeswoman Rochelle Ritchie says Williams also will hear disputes over what information prosecutors must share with defendants.\nGray was a 25-year-old black man who died April 19, a week after suffering a spinal injury in police custody. Three of the officers are black.\nGray's death led to rioting, looting and arson.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:06:56.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
