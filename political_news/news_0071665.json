(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 6, 2015 | 10:17 a.m. EDT + More By KEN SWEET, AP Business Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” Stocks were mixed in early trading Tuesday, taking a pause after five straight days of gains. DuPont shares soared on news that its CEO would step down.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 63 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,845 as of 10:08 a.m. Eastern. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added a point to 1,988 and the Nasdaq composite fell six points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,776.\nDUPONT: The chemical giant DuPont rose $5.51, or 11 percent, to $56.79, the biggest gainer in the Dow and the S&P 500. DuPont's CEO Ellen Kullman said she would retire next week, a sudden departure for the embattled CEO. DuPont's profits have lagged in recent years and the company has been a target of activist investors like Nelsen Peltz.\nCENTRAL BANKERS: Markets are increasingly confident the Federal Reserve will hold off for longer on raising interest rates following last week's jobs report which showed the U.S. economy was creating fewer jobs. On Thursday, investors will get the minutes from the Fed's meeting in September, which should provide clues on whether policymakers still feel confident about raising interest rates.\nENERGY: U.S. benchmark crude rose $1.06 to $47.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gained 72 cents to close at $46.26 a barrel in New York on Monday.\nBONDS, CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices didn't move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.06 percent. The dollar slipped to 120.38 yen. The euro rose to $1.1233.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
