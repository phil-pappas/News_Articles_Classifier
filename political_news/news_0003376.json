Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen has warned small and medium businesses advocating the effects test to brace for \"a conga line\" of lawyers and bills if it goes through Parliament.\nThe Coalition is considering introducing the effects test, a controversial recommendation of the Harper review, which would change section 46 of the Competition Act so it only has to be shown that the effect, not the purpose, of a decision would be to eliminate competition.\nAddressing a high-level grocers meet in Canberra on Wednesday, Mr Bowen said it was a \"dangerous\" move that would result in a \"lawyers picnic\" for small business.\nEffects test \"If an effects test were to be introduced, and you were unable to convince the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take your case, be prepared to be facing a conga line of silks and consultants, with a potential legal bill that could be multiples of a small firms' turnover,\" he said.\n\"There is a risk of significant adverse cost orders should an applicant lose when trying to take action under an 'effects test'.\"\nHe acknowledged a number of the grocers in the room held a different view on the effects test, and believe it will help regulate the power of large supermarkets.\nA broad group, including t he Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Master Grocers Australia, the Australian Hotels Association, the Australian Retailers Association and the National Farmers Federation, are pushing for the test.\n Master Grocers Australia CEO Jos de Bruin slammed Mr Bowen's comments, suggesting he was being fed by the big business lobby.\n\"There is absolutely no substance to what he was sayingâ€¦ all that was, was a scare campaign,\" he said.\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell has also backed the effects test, saying it was a reasonable compromise that would not stymie competition nor hike prices to rise.\nThe current test only requires proof of an anti-competitive purpose or intent, which advocates argue has led to practically no successful prosecutions under the law.\nMr Bowen also said Labor was against extending the base of the GST to food, as it could feed Australia's diabetes epidemic.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/senate-no-road-block-to-effects-test-20151014-gk92tr.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:42:24.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
