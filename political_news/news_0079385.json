That does not stack up.”\nAfter all, Mrs T’s property firm boasted the rise in people struggling to keep a roof after the Crash was a “great opportunity” for bargain hunters.\n“Is preying on desperate people ever an ethical way to run a business?” asked Ms Dugdale.\n“No, I do not think that it is,” Ms Sturgeon grimaced, clinging to a new poll which showed the SNP on an all-time high and Labour “dying on its feet”.\nMs Dugdale gave a lofty tut. “I came to the chamber to ask questions about businesses that make their money from exploiting vulnerable people, and the First Minister’s response was to refer to a poll and tell us that everyone loves her. That is really quite incredible.”\nThough not quite as incredible as her next gem - that Mrs T had been due to speak on “exploring new markets” at this month’s SNP conference.\n“The FM personally endorsed Michelle Thomson as a candidate saying: ‘Michelle knows what she’s doing.’ Now we all know what Michelle was doing. Is it not time.. to admit it would be wrong for Michelle Thomson to return as an SNP MP?”\nThe FM sighed before administering a verbal kneecapping to her former colleague.\nShare article “Michelle Thomson is not a member of the SNP. She does not hold the SNP whip. She is not a spokesperson for the SNP. She will not be attending the SNP conference. That is what happens when serious allegations are raised that concern the SNP.” Ouch.\nMuch more of this and the final stop in Mrs T’s property trail will be under the FM’s patio.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:02:30.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
