(Photo: NBC) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn the Democratic race for president, the field is still very small. There are basically two main candidates: Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \nMany progressives in the party want to make sure voters know there is a clear difference between Clinton and Sanders. They argue Clinton hasn't always taken the lead on issues that liberal Democrats hold dear like gay marriage. \nThat point was brought up recently when Chuck Todd interviewed Clinton on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n\"Where you are on these? Bernie Sanders was there when it came to marriage 20 years ago,\" said Todd. \"Do you think one of the reasons he's doing well right now is some progressives think, 'Well, you know what? He was there when it wasn't popular.'\" \nClinton was quick to admit that her opinions have \"evolved\" over the years. \nAs for Sanders, PunditFact found that Todd's statement is pretty accurate. His support for gay rights dates back to the 1970's when he was running for Vermont governor. And he opposed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) when he was in Congress. \n\"Even though same sex marriage itself wasn't on the table, he still opposed limiting marriage to between a man and a woman in that way,\" said PunditFact's Katie Sanders. \"He voted against DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act and he was supportive of an amendment that would have left it to the states to define marriage. That amendment failed. We thought his votes supported Todd's point.\" \nBy opposing a restrictive definition of marriage, PunditFact says it seems logical Sanders supported a broader one. They rate Todd's claim TRUE .
