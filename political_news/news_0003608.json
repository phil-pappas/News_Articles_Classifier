There’s no easy answer, and it’s no small task, but it’s a fantastic question. So, let’s talk answers. My top three:\n1) A candidate with widespread appeal is essential. If you’re the kind of candidate who makes the base ecstatic but the centrists cringe every time you open your mouth, you’re not getting anywhere in blue-state terrain. Charisma, a delivery that invites discussion rather than division, optimism about the country’s future, a sense of humor, and a willingness to hear differing opinions and invite the individuals with those opinions to the discussion table are key. Preaching to the choir has its place in politics for sure, but the ability to change hearts and minds has far greater value. Think about Ronald Reagan winning over Democrats with his wit, charm, and ability to convey constitutional principles. Candidates should study that man’s approach to politics. If you’re not connecting with people, they’re not listening.\n2) Be solution-based. Stop talking about what the other side is doing wrong and start talking about what you’ll do right. Be specific; specifics inspire confidence. Talk school choice, jobs, tax reform, keeping this country safe, and targeted economic and educational proposals that have the potential to lift people out of poverty. Don’t stick a ten-paged plan in fine print on a website and expect people to pay attention to what you’ve written.\n3) Outreach, outreach, outreach. Go into struggling communities with policy representatives who can hold town halls, conduct question and answer sessions, and meet with community leaders to discuss why your policies have the ability to improve the quality of life of those struggling most. Hire a messaging team. Get on TV and be able to succinctly and precisely detail what you would do to improve the lives of those seeking leadership. Go into locations least likely to be receptive to your Party label, where preconceived notions about your Party are abundant, and break down those stereotypes about who you are and what your policies aim to do. If you go somewhere and only manage to convince a handful of people to consider what you’ve said, consider how many people those few individuals will then speak to and what the potential ripple effect could be. You have to start somewhere and big changes won’t happen overnight, but isn’t it worth the time and energy to reach people?\nThe Republican Party often appears incredibly lazy about its approach to politics. It’s as if they expect voters to simply be drawn to the Party because the candidates themselves believe they have the right ideas. If you have the right ideas, but don’t convey them to the public with enthusiasm and presence, why would people be inspired to listen? If you have the right ideas, but don’t share those ideas with the very communities you’re trying to help, how do you expect to broaden your support base? If you have the right ideas, but don’t lay them out in simple, succinct, specific terms that inspire confidence in voters, why would people believe that you’re the right person for the job?\nWinning over blue states and Independents takes time, energy, and commitment. But what’s your alternative if you don’t? If you’re not willing to devote yourself to the business of changing hearts and minds, the very hearts and minds you’ll need to cast those votes for you, then you simply don’t want the job that badly. Get off the stage and make room for someone who does.\n2016ers, we’re watching. Let’s see who’s playing to win.\nCross-published at http://amac.us/how-about-those-blue-states/", "external_links": ["http://amac.us/how-about-those-blue-states/"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:41:31.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
