Sang Tan AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story \nThe South American soccer confederation says the integrity of the FIFA presidential election has been jeopardized after world soccer's governing body suspended contender Michel Platini. \nA provisional 90-day ban was imposed on the UEFA president on Thursday after a payment he received from FIFA became embroiled in a Swiss criminal investigation. \nAlthough Platini's ban expires before the presidential election — scheduled for Feb. 26 — he's unlikely to now pass FIFA integrity checks after the Oct. 26 deadline for the submission of candidacies. \nCONMEBOL has joined Platini's UEFA in backing the former France captain, who had been considered the election front-runner. \nCONMEBOL says \"Platini has not been found guilty of any charge, therefore the provisional ban jeopardizes the integrity of the electoral process to the FIFA presidency.\" Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:32:56.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
