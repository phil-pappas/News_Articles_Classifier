President Obama hustled to call a press conference, in one of the fastest responses I’ve ever seen from him, to turn this into political spectacle before we had much, if any, information about what happened.\n“And what’s become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,” said the President. The President went on to idealize Australia and England, both countries that virtually ban firearm ownership entirely, so I don’t think Obama really wants any kind of actual reform, I think he wants to ban guns.\n“We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it,” said Obama.\nExactly what does he mean by that? We’ll get back to that in a minute. Ms. Sheld notes all the gun laws already on the books, especially in places with draconian laws, such as Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, etc. Places where gun-play regularly occurs. Strange, eh? What new laws, ones that mimic Chicago, for instance, would stop that? Chicago just had a big weekend of shootings. Baltimore has seen record numbers murdered by guns. Let’s shift to Charles C.W. Cook, who “debated” leftist Mark Halprin . Head to the link for the back and forth, watch the video, and remember how it ends\n“I don’t think that’s enough. I completely agree with the president,” Halperin said. “People need to find solutions to this and not talk about what won’t work and that it’s so complicated. We can’t be the only country that’s like this.”\nCooke quickly replied, “Alright, well then with respect, what’s your plan?”\nHalperin said there are “short-term solutions” like state and federal regulations, but “coming up with ideas” is also important.\n“But which ideas, Mark?” Cooke pressed.\n“We can talk about specific policy in a second, but just let me finish this second point,” Halperin replied, later criticizing his fellow reporter for his “tone” on the issue.\nIn other words, liberals really do not want to talk about their plans. They surely know that all the draconian laws do not work. Obama alluded to what they really want\nIdeally, someone on that [Democratic] debate stage would emulate President Obama and say America needs something like Australia’s policy of nationwide gun confiscation . I think the Republican nominee would love for the 2016 election to be a referendum on whether private citizens should be permitted to own guns, or whether Americans support a nationwide house-to-house, room-to-room search of every residence in all fifty states.\nThe major problem with most gun laws proposed/implemented is that they target law abiding citizens, not the criminals who use guns. So, what say, Democrats? Up for pushing to repeal the 2nd Amendment, instituting gun confiscation? Back to Liz Sheld\nWe have many laws on the books that are related to gun crimes that are violated in the process of actually committing the crime. Murder? Illegal. Stealing guns to use in a crime, like the Sandy Hook shooter did? Illegal. Do we need more laws on the books that will be ignored by people who, by definition, do not respect the law?\nBut let’s hear some details about this “common sense” legislation we need that would prevent insane maniacs and criminals from slaughtering people, assuming of course we aren’t really talking about a gun ban.\nYes, let’s hear it.\nSomeone saying gun play is worse in Red states than Blue states in 3….2…..1….", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/obama-oregon-shooting-umpqua-community-college-gun-control.html?_r=0", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/01/oregon-gunman-singled-out-christians-during-rampage/", "http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2015/10/02/is-it-time-for-common-sense-gun-legislation/", "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/424993/will-cnn-demand-gun-control-specifics-democrats-jim-geraghty", "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/380033/obama-praises-australias-gun-confiscation-charles-c-w-cooke", "http://time.com/4058961/transcript-read-the-full-text-of-obamas-statement-on-the-shooting-in-oregon/", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/3407f9a1/Mozilla/5.0", "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/10/02/reporter-mark-halperin-goes-after-nros-charles-c-w-cooke-on-gun-control-i-completely-agree-with-the-president/"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:40:06.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
