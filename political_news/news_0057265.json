The Rebuilding Together Houston programs use both crews of volunteers and professional contractors to repair homes for those who are unable to make or afford such repairs. From scraping and painting, caulking, replacing siding, windows, and doors, and constructing wheelchair ramps, volunteers will be sharing their talents to allow our neighbors to safely age-in-place with dignity and comfort.\n\"Rebuilding Together is a perfect fit for our team; over our 143 year history and almost 35 years in Houston , giving back to the local community has always been a top priority for Gilbane,\" says Dan Gilbane , Business Unit Leader for Gilbane Southwest, \"Building is a core competency for us, it's in our organizational DNA, and the opportunity to use those skills to help the Carter family really became a combination of community service, teambuilding and fun. We had a great weekend working with the Carter family and are excited to finish their project and continue to help Rebuilding Together.\"\nGilbane is sponsoring the Carter family and they are thrilled to have the experienced team from Gilbane, who joined with a team from Exxon Mobil Corporation, to do their repairs. The first stage of the effort was completed October 17-18 , with the project wrapping up this coming weekend, October 24-25 . The Gilbane Building Company has repaired homes with Rebuilding Together Houston in the past, but this time has sponsored the Carter's house to support Rebuilding Together Houston's Super Impact 17 campaign. This 17-month fundraising campaign is critically important to help the organization double its impact in the Houston area: from 365 houses a year to 700! Super Impact 17 will culminate in February 2017 in conjunction with Super Bowl LI. The 20-30 Designated Super Impact Homes sponsorships will not only help Houston homeowners in need today, but will also provide the financial resources for the organization to expand its outreach in the future.\nTo learn more about Rebuilding Together Houston, visit them on the web at rebuildinghouston.org.\nAbout Gilbane, Inc.\nGilbane provides a full slate of construction and facilities-related services – from pre-construction planning and integrated consulting capabilities to comprehensive construction management, close-out and facility management services – for clients across various markets.
