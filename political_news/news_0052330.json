It will either be one of Kevin McCarthy's first tasks as speaker, or one of John Boehner's last.\nIn a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the federal government is taking in less revenue than it had anticipated. Lew said the federal government therefore must increase its borrowing authority in five weeks or face the prospect of a catastrophic default.\nFor House Republicans, a vote to increase the debt limit is one of the toughest they ever have to cast. Boehner has had to rely on a core group of his members plus House Democrats to get the measure through the chamber in the past few years. The battle over the debt limit was so bitter in 2011 that U.S. government's credit rating was downgraded, an unprecedented move.\nThis year promises to be no different, and Boehner's resignation, coupled with the expected ascension of McCarthy to the speaker's chair, is going to make it no easier. The floor vote for McCarthy to become speaker is not expected until late October, shortly before the default deadline. That may make it more palatable for McCarthy for Boehner to oversee the vote.\nPelosi seeks support for speaker By Lauren French\n\"Over the past ten days, we have received quarterly corporate and individual tax receipts and additional information about the activities of certain large trust funds, including military retirement trust funds,\" Lew wrote in his letter to Boehner. \"The tax receipts were lower than we previously projected, and the trust fund investments were higher than projected- resulting in a net decrease of resources available to the United States government.\"\nLew added, \"Based on this new information, we now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures on or about Thursday, November 5. At that point, we would be left to fund the government with only the cash we have on hand, which we currently forecast to be below $30 billion. This amount would be far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion. Moreover, given certain payments that are due in early to mid-November, we anticipate that our remaining cash would be depleted quickly.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:42:10.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
