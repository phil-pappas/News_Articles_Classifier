(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) October 14 at 5:18 PM Regarding the Oct. 12 news article “ Benghazi panel chair disputes claims ”:\nIt may not matter whether Bradley Podliska, former investigator for the House Select Committee on Benghazi, was telling the truth. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) lost credibility and his chance to become speaker by saying what everyone already knew: The Benghazi investigation was a witch hunt designed to derail former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. Ms. Clinton, who should have known to toe the line carefully when it came to dealing with confidential or top-secret information, again placed her personal interests above the nation’s security by using a personal e-mail server for State Department and personal correspondence.\nOnly the FBI investigation will determine whether Ms. Clinton violated laws, but even if she did not, her credibility and lack of judgment raise questions as to her ability to lead the nation.\nThe Benghazi committee might as well cancel all operations, pack up and go home, as its credibility has also been shredded.\nHenry A.
