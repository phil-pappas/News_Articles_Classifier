Cuomo: federal inaction on guns a ‘disgrace’ By - Associated Press - Friday, October 2, 2015 \nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says Washington’s inaction on gun control is a “disgrace” and that Congressional Democrats should threaten to shut down the federal government unless legislation is advanced. \nThe Democratic governor’s comments on NY1 Friday came after Thursday’s fatal community college shooting in Oregon. \nCuomo says gun violence should be the top issue in the presidential race and that voters should hold their politicians accountable for their stance on the issue. \nHe says he would “love” to see members of Congress who support tougher gun laws threaten to hold up work on other issues until gun control is addressed. \nCuomo pushed a gun control measure through the New York Legislature in the wake of the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:54:50.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
