The Minister’s suggested model linking school funding to student achievement will only worsen the situation. \n\"New Zealand First made the commitment in its 2014 Manifesto to work with the sector to develop funding and resourcing models to best meet the needs of all children,\" says Mrs Martin. \n\"And when New Zealand First talks about ‘all children’ we mean all children, including those that need academic support or academic extension to reach their personal best. \n\"With so many voices in Northland expressing serious concern about proposed funding changes, it’s time the Minister listened before ploughing into yet another misguided policy,\" says Mrs Martin. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
