There was the $1,015 meal at Johnny's Half Shell, a swanky Washington, D.C. seafood restaurant. The $533 stay at Hotel Monaco, one of the nicest hotels in Baltimore. And a $1400 steak dinner at Sparks Steakhouse in New York City.\nThe campaign spent $2,089 at New York's iconic Waldorf Hotel and frequented Westins over Best Westerns.\nThe luxury spending is notable because while Carson raised $20 million in the third quarter he also burned through $14 million of it.\nCarson, sitting near the top of the GOP field in the polls, has $11 million in cash on hand. His quarterly haul has eclipsed all other Republican contenders.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:57:02.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
