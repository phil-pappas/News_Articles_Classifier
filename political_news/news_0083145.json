No, not Café Milano — it’s the Wesley Heights home of lobbyist Jack Quinn and socialite-turned-start-up-entrepreneur Susanna Quinn . The Quinns are about to list their sprawling white mansion for $3.5 million — a price that includes six bedrooms, a pool, exercise room, putting green and a ton of Washington history. Jack Quinn served as White House counsel for Bill Clinton before founding lobbying and communications outfit Quinn Gillespie & Associates. Susanna Quinn is a regular on the events circuit who last year launched an app called Veluxe, for on-demand beauty services.\nIn the 10 years the couple has lived in the house, they’ve hosted dozens of parties and played hosts to senators, governors, congressmen, ambassadors and media heavyweights — the 2010 birthday party held in honor of former Meet the Press executive producer Betsy Fischer was written up by the New York Times ’ Mark Leibovich and, so the story goes, led to his This Town book deal. (In the article , Leibovich dubbed the fete a “classic Suck Up City affair.”)\nWhile the sale of “Jack and Susanna’s,” as D.C. insiders call their place, marks the end of an era, it by no means signals the death of Quinn-tertaining. The couple, along with their 3-year-old son, Storm Quinn , and Susanna’s teenage daughter from a previous marriage, will soon move to their new home in the luxury enclave of Phillips Park, a private community just off of Foxhall Road where the custom houses hover in the $3 million to $7 million range and neighbors include David Gregory and Beth Wilkinson and Bret and Amy Baier .\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113875/tammy-haddad-washingtons-access-peddler-excerpt-town"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:31:26.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
