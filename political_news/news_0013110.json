Such a small community, all very friendly - it will have hit them hard. It's probably the friendliest, most laid back, welcoming place I've ever been. Think Devon surfer village, mixed with tiny Scottish fishing village and you're about there.

Given the speed of these boats I'm assuming it hit hidden rocks at high speed, it certainly is shown next to rocks in the images (though could have drifted there). Real shame, these guys are usually massively devoted to the job and very professional.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:14:07.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
