By talking about emails.\nDiscussing Hillary Clinton's 11-hour-marathon testimony in front of the House Benghazi committee Thursday, the former president told the crowd rallying for his wife, “we had the friends of our lifetime emailing me furiously saying they thought she was doing great,” he told the crowd that had been waiting an hour and a half for Katy Perry’s concert for Clinton. “To everyone of them, I wrote back, ‘I think I’ll vote for her.’”\nThe 42nd president, in a blue blazer and jeans, has always minimized his use of emails -- and all technology. In March, he said through a spokesman that he has only sent two email messages in his life, back when he was in the White House.\nClinton was in mid-campaign form, enjoying the spotlight during his first foray onto the campaign trail.\n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,\" he said. \"If they watched Saturday Night Live, they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\nBill Clinton stepping up fundraising for Hillary By Anna Palmer\nReferring to the recent Democratic debate, he said, \"I was proud to be a Democrat because I watched five hours of the Republicans debate. [On our side] every disagreement they had was over an issue. that’s politics at its best. Nobody insulted anyone else. no one was out there to get people to stop thinking.\"\nAbout 15 minutes into his speech, some of the crowd cheered when he said he was almost finished. While Clinton was on stage, a plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge she still faces in the face of the best stretch of her campaign.\nA Clinton aide said the former president misspoke, and that he meant people were texting him, not emailing him.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:07:45.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
