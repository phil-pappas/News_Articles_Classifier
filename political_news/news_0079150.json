We’ve got you covered. \nThere’s a mix bag of issues/races polled in the latest Quinnipiac poll so here’s a look at a few of them... \nFirst up, Senate 2016. In April, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland was up 9 points on Sen. Rob Portman. Now Strickland, a Democrat, is leading Portman, a Republican by 3 points. Because of the margin or error, Quinnipiac deems it too close to call. \nAs for Cincinnati Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, who will face Strickland in a Democratic primary, 86 of people say they don’t know enough about him to form an opinion. Portman does lead Sittenfeld 49-27 percent. \n*** \nMarijuana legalization : While Ohio approve of legalization for recreational use (53-44 percent) and medicinal use (90-9 percent), 65 percent said they “definitely not” use marijuana. \nThe poll did not ask specifically about Issue 3, the constitutional amendment on the Nov. 3 ballot. Just whether marijuana should be legal. \n*** \nKasich approval : And finally Ohioans gave Gov. John Kasich his highest approval rating yet at 62 percent. \n*** \nMore on Kasich poll numbers : After Wednesday’s Quinnipiac poll showed Kasich trailing billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson in Ohio, Northeast Ohio Media Group’s Henry Gomez reports, “The coming days and weeks will tell us more about the health of the Kasich campaign. But beyond money and infrastructure, the biggest tell of the state of Team Kasich comes from its collective state of mind. No one is sounding alarm bells or panicking or pushing for a radical strategy overhaul. The kind of infighting that infected Walker's campaign in its final days is not present.” \nAnd while third quarter campaign finance totals aren’t due to the Federal Election Commission for another week, Gomez reports, “His advisers are comfortable with the haul to date and are confident there will be enough cash to make it to the starting lines in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary.” \n*** \nOuch : “He’s not particularly charismatic,” Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, in Dartmouth, N.H., told ABC News about Kasich. “I don’t think his name recognition is very high, and it’s just very hard for voters to distinguish between so many different candidates.” \n*** \nWhat Kasich said : According to ABC News, Kasich told a crowd in Richmond, Va. earlier this week that if they are looking for a loudmouth, don’t look to him. “I’m not playing to the cheap seats,\" he told an audience early this week according to ABC News. \"If that’s what it takes, I’m not going to be president. I’m not doing it.\" \n*** \nCharter school reform vote :  “This bill is going to be a game-changer for the charter school sector of Ohio,” said Sen. Peggy Lehner, R-Kettering. “I think this is going to give us the opportunity to have charter schools that we are proud of.” \nLehner’s words came minutes after the House passed sweeping charter school reform and minutes before the Senate did the same, Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. \n“This bill puts Ohio’s charter school community on the road to national respectability,” Auditor Dave Yost said. \n*** \nPrison overcrowding : “Ohio lawmakers received a joint call Tuesday to curb their tough-on-crime sentiment until a potentially sweeping overhaul of the state’s criminal code is complete,” Dispatch reporter Randy Ludlow writes. “Legislators are undermining efforts to reform sentencing laws and decrease prison and jail populations by continuing to introduce bills creating new crimes and enhancing prison sentences, critics said.” \n*** \nMeanwhile at the Statehouse : “A few hours after Tuesday’s ACLU-hosted news conference, the Ohio House unanimously passed a bill that could send a few more people to prison,”& amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; lt; /span> Ludlow reports. \n“We can walk and chew gum at the same time,” said Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina. “ We'll pass the things we believe are appropriate … and ask the Recodification Committee to take that into consideration.” \n*** \nIn Columbus politics : Dispatch reporter Lucas Sullivan writes, “Columbus City Council President Andrew J. Ginther said he plans to give charities the contributions that his campaign accepted from lobbyist John Raphael, who has agreed to plead guilty to extortion.” \nGinther debated Franklin County Sheriff Zach Scott Wednesday night. \n*** \nAbout that debate : While Ginther and Scott kept it civil, a man in a hard hat joined them on stage. \n“Emmanuel ‘Golden’ Valentine showed up — unexpected but allowed to join in — with ‘election; and ‘Nov. 3’ written on his jeans,” Sullivan writes. \nHis platform? Keeping “ bed-bug-infested” mattresses out of alleys. \n*** \nHappening today : Ohio Republican and House Speaker John Boehner will sit down with reporters from The Dispatch as he prepares to end his congressional career at the end of the month. \n*** \nOn this day : From the Dispatch library, on this day in 2008, “A federal judge rules that Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner is breaking federal law by not giving county elections boards the chance to determine whether new voter registrations are fraudulent.” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
