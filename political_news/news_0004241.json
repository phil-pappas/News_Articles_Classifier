The negative stigma carried by any sex worker is the least of the victim’s worries when it comes to reporting violent clients.\nFear of further violent attacks or incidents is one of the main reasons why sex workers may not want to speak up. Feeling violated and alone, or perhaps unsure of what to do, many incidents continue to go unchecked and unreported.\nIndependent workers may lack the proper safety checks and procedures, and further may feel as though justice would never be served in the first place. We here at reportbadjohns.com disagree with this tactic and firmly believe in these simple reasons why every sex worker should report violent clients.\n3. Rights\nJust because a person happens to be a sex worker doesn’t mean that they don’t have rights. Adults have common and basic rights that extend beyond any profession. People exchange sex for any number of different reasons, and there’s no reason why a sex worker should lack these basic rights.\nStand up for your rights and report the violent incident to our extensive database to safeguard not only yourself but other sex workers as well.\n2. Safety\nViolent johns aren’t just that way with sex workers, there’s an underlying predatory element of violence that’s easy to see. Many times these deviants will browse and check on their victims before looking up their services.\nListings on reportbadjohns.com will help increase the professionalism of any sex worker but lets the bad guys know that they won’t get away with it. This not only helps stop future offenders but increases the level of safety in the community.\nIt also helps to breakdown the negative stereotype of violence against sex workers, as well as stop the cycle of violent acts against women. Being able to safely report any violent crime without any fear of backlash is a big part of the equation, and reportbadjohns.com is here to help.\n1. Prevention\nThe more people know the higher the chances of the people responsible being locked up and justice finally being served. Preventing a future incident might be the true reason to report any violent act against sex workers.\nResearch has frequently connected violent johns with convicted rapists and murderers, and all it may take is just one report to prevent any future victims. Every effort to strip these criminals of their freedom is worthwhile and one that should be explored no matter how the violent act happened.\nIn the 21st century and consensual sex between grown adults should stop being criminalized and sex workers should not be discriminated against. Reporting any violent john is just one of the pieces of the puzzle until sex workers can one day enjoy a better working standard and environment of mutual respect.\nMedia Contact:\nJacob Smith\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
