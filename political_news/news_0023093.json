It said Reginald Carr's sentence may have been unfairly tainted because Jonathan Carr blamed Reginald for being a bad influence during their childhoods. \nWhile the attorneys on both sides focused on the legal technicalities, several of the justices couldn't help but dwell on the sordid facts of the Carr case during two hours of oral argument. \nJustice Samuel Alito said it involves \"some of the most horrendous murders that I have ever seen in my 10 years here. And we see practically every death penalty case that comes up anywhere in the country.\" \nAt one point, Justice Antonin Scalia recounted at length the brutal details. Authorities said the brothers broke into a Wichita, Kansas, home in December 2000, where they forced the three men and two women inside to have sex with each other while they watched, then repeatedly raped the women. The brothers then forced the victims to withdraw money from ATMs before taking them to a soccer field, forcing them to kneel, and shooting each one in the head. \nFour of the victims died, but one woman survived a gunshot wound to the head because a plastic clip in her hair deflected the bullet. She ran naked through the snow for help and later testified against the brothers at trial. \n\"You truly think that this jury, but for the fact that your client was the corruptor, would not have imposed the death penalty,\" Scalia asked Frederick Liu, attorney for Reginald Carr. \nLiu argued that having both brothers in the same hearing could have led the jury to blame Reginald Carr for Jonathan's conduct. \nKansas Solicitor General Stephen McAllister argued that requiring the state to conduct separate sentencing hearings would lead to inconsistent results and unfairly allow defendants to preview the state's evidence. \nJustice Stephen Breyer warned that requiring separate sentencing hearings in such cases could \"throw a monkey wrench\" into hundreds of other cases where gang members and other co-defendants are tried and sentenced at joint proceedings. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor suggested some of the jurors may have been confused about how to consider mitigating factors that might favor leniency. The jury instructions said aggravating factors had to be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but made no specification for mitigating factors. \nKansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt argued that the instructions also included \"an open-ended invitation\" to consider any facts that might spare a death sentence, including pleas for mercy. \nEven if some of there was some \"unfortunate wording,\" Justice Elena Kagan wondered, \"why doesn't all this other stuff indicate that no juror was likely to be confused.\" \nA ruling in the cases is expected by the end of June. \n___ \nFollow Sam Hananel on Twitter at http://twitter.com/SamHananelAP Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:35:14.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
