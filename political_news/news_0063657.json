Martin O’Malley raised $1.3 million in the third quarter of the year and finished September with about $806,000 on hand — putting him well back of Democratic presidential rivals former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernard Sanders in the money race. \nMr. O’Malley’s campaign spent about $1.8 million in the reporting period covering July, August, and September, according to his third quarter filing with the Federal Election Commission, due Thursday. \nMrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, raised almost $30 million in the quarter, spent almost $26 million and finished with about $33 million cash on hand. \nMr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, raised $26.2 million, spent about $11.3 million, and reported almost $27.1 million in the bank. \nThe rest of the announced Democratic candidates didn’t come close to Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders, either. \nHarvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig reported raising about $1 million, spending about $442,000 and finishing with about $574,000 on hand. \nThat was better than either of the two remaining candidates who were on the stage for the first Democratic presidential debate earlier in the week. Mr. Lessig, who is campaigning on the issue of campaign finance reform, was not part of the debate. \nFormer Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia reported raising about $697,000, spending about $380,200 and finishing the period with slightly less than $317,000 on hand. \nFormer Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee raised just $15,457.86 and spent slightly less than $60,000. That left him with about $284,500 on hand, though his campaign also reported about $364,000 in outstanding loans he gave to himself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:12:15.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
