The Greater Christchurch Regeneration Bill, which will receive its first reading in Parliament today, will provide the tools to ensure progress is maintained as we move from recovery to regeneration. \n\"The Transition Recovery Plan confirms the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) will take on the task of monitoring a number of progress measures in greater Christchurch to ensure Government is providing the right levels of support, in the right areas. \n\"In addition, a Christchurch leadership forum involving the relevant Ministers and the Christchurch Mayor and city councillors will meet at least once a year to consider issues important to the city. \n\"The Transition Recovery Plan also refers to the Government’s June decisions to hand over various functions led by CERA to agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, Land Information New Zealand and DPMC.\" \nThe plan can be viewed at www.cera.govt.nz/transition, and hard copy versions are available at CERA’s offices and libraries and council service centres in Christchurch city, and the Selwyn and Waimakariri districts. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:52:46.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
