Joan McAlpine for fighting plans for shale gas extraction in Dumfriesshire; and Michael Russell for his efforts to secure a community buyout for Castle Toward, a listed mansion and grounds in Argyll.\nThe judges faced some of their hardest decisions over the Public Campaign or Campaigner of the Year award this year.\nThe British Deaf Association and the Scottish Council on Deafness have been shortlisted for a campaign stretching back 15 years which finally resulted in legislation promoting the use of British Sign Language.\nAlso nominated is motor neurone disease campaigner Gordon Aikman, who secured a promise of new legislation to ensure people with degenerative conditions have access to computer voice technology allowing them to speak.\nFinally, the Scottish Allotments and Gardens Society have been shortlisted for their successful campaign to retain standard plots of 250 square metres.\nThree council leaders, Andrew Burns, Mark Macmillan and David Parker, are in the running to be named Scottish Local Politician of the Year.\nSponsors of The Herald Scottish Politician of the Year Awards congratulated all those who have been shortlisted.\nKeith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, said: \"Scottish Power Renewables would like to congratulate those who made it to the final shortlist. \"The judges have selected a group who have made a significant contribution and particularly those in the E-Politician of the Year category, which we are proud to support.\"\nStephen Park Brown, MD of NVT Group, said: \"We are very proud to be associated with The Herald Scottish Politician of the Year Awards and, considering the standing of this year’s nominees and their contribution to Scottish politics, we believe this year’s awards will be the most important yet.\n\"May we pass on our congratulations to everyone shortlisted and we look forward to finding out the winners on November 19th.
