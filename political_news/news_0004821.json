That meant them making efficiencies elsewhere in order to keep to their annual budgets - that was money that should have been going into health services. \n\"The Government has underfunded health in four out of the last six budgets, because it was relying on HBL to do the job it was supposed to do. Instead it’s become a burden on our district health boards and an albatross around the neck of the health system. \n\"This was the legacy project of former Health Minister Tony Ryall. It was supposed to be the gold standard in delivering cost reductions. It has turned out to be an obscene waste of taxpayer money. \n\"I am pleased the Auditor-general undertook this investigation. Hopefully it will mean more precious health dollars will not be wasted on vanity projects and empire building by future Health Ministers,\" Annette King says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
