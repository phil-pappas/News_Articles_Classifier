Promoted stories \nSUDS was set up to be managed and maintained by Hampshire County Council , however the government changed legislation on SUDS, which caused Hampshire County Council to pull the plug and Winchester City Council will not manage SUDS either. \nA city council report said the costs to residents may not ‘significant’ as residents can claim a no surface water discount from Southern Water but cited the problem as ‘not ideal’ and added that it could form disputes in years to come. \nCouncillor Barry Lipscomb criticised the present situation at the Barton Farm Forum. \nCllr Lipscomb, said: “I am very unhappy with the concept of this development having uncertainty on what they will be charged. \n“I hope we can solve this before we see houses up for sale, we need to take a more robust attitude and get this sorted out, it can’t be put on the residents.” \nCouncil officers also refused to answer questions on government policy change, which was outlined by David Cameron, who promised to sweep away planning rules that require property developers to build affordable homes for rent in a bid to increase the building of homes for first-time buyers. Share article \nCorporate director at Winchester City Council Steve Tilbury, said: “There is no proposal to change the level of affordable housing at Barton Farm, but if government has a policy change then it changes and it can have an effect on it, we simply do not know.” \nIt is hoped that the first homes of the Barton Farm scheme will be occupied by March 2018.
