That move has angered some legislative leaders, who say the company is trying to make an end run around the General Assembly.\nCooper’s counterpart, Senate Health and Human Services Chairwoman Renee Unterman, R-Buford, has already blasted the move.\nThe DCH is holding a public hearing on the issue Tuesday, and the board is supposed to take final action at its November meeting.\nThe board in September tentatively approved the rule change to allow the company to shed its in-state patient cap.\nCTCA says the cap unfairly prevents Georgia patients from getting help at its facility. Other hospitals say CTCA cherry-picks patients with the highest-paying insurance coverage while leaving other hospitals to shoulder the burden of care for Medicaid cancer patients and other indigent patients.\nGeorgia typically requires hospitals to go through a stringent “Certificate of Need” process that is intended to control costs and prevent an oversupply of health care facilities. But in 2008, the General Assembly allowed CTCA to open a facility in Newnan as a so-called “destination hospital.” As such, lawmakers limited it to 50 beds and required that at least 65 percent of its patients come from out of state.\nThe new rule would give the hospital a pathway to become a general hospital that isn’t required to have an emergency room. With the new designation, it would no longer have to get most of its patients from out of state. It would also be able to apply to expand beyond 50 beds.\n“The rule change being considered by the board of Community Health addresses an admittedly difficult topic that speaks to the heart of ensuring adequate and accessible health care in Georgia,” Cooper said. “This is an issue that has been, and will continue to be, the topic of much debate in the General Assembly.”\nCTCA’s move reignited a decade-long battle between the company and other Georgia hospitals that claim the company has gotten special treatment.\nGov. Nathan Deal collected $12,500 from CTCA executives in September 2014 after attending a ribbon-cutting at their Southeastern Regional Medical Center. Since its push to enter Georgia began, the company and its employees have contributed almost $400,000 to state party political action committees and the campaigns of lawmakers and other state leaders.\nBut the company is up against some political heavyweights as well. The Georgia Hospital Association and Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals have contributed about $2 million to state lawmakers, candidates, state leaders and party political action committees over the past decade, according to disclosure reports reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Deal and his political action committee have collected more than $50,000 from the two groups. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle’s campaigns have gotten almost $87,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:47:13.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
