As a result, the efforts of Malla Reddy Medical College in getting permission from Delhi high court to fill all the seats will get adversely affected due to this order.\nThe total seats available in this college are 150. Of this, 75 seats have to be filled through convener quota, which are called A category seats. The remaining 75 seats are classified as B category and C (NRI) category seats. With the help of the Delhi high court order, the college has already filled 75 seats under A and B categories. However, now the Hyderabad high court bench, comprising Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice A Shankar Narayana, directed the authorities to conduct fresh counselling for A and B categories. This means, admissions given already to more than 50 students under B category will be in jeopardy.\nThe bench gave this order while hearing petitions filed by several students who were aggrieved with the action of the college in not filling the A category convener quota seats. The college has been maintaining that the medical council has wrongly disqualified them from making admissions. The college approached the Delhi HC and obtained permission to fill the seats on September 30, the last day for making admissions. After that the college cannot grant admissions as there is a ban imposed by the Supreme Court. Arguing for the students, senior counsel A Sudarsan Reddy convinced the court that in exceptional circumstances, colleges can be allowed to cross this deadline in the interests of students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:46:49.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
