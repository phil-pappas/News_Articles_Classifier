Rangi Wills and Angela Hauk-Willis will also continue to serve until 31 March 2016. \nMr Dunne has been leading a public consultation on changes to New Zealandâ€™s fire services and will seek a Cabinet decision later this year on how fire services would be managed, delivered and funded. \n\"I am pleased these four Commission members have agreed to be reappointed to provide continuity while Cabinet signals its preferred direction,\" said Mr Dunne. \n\"Once the way forward is confirmed, we can begin planning what skills and expertise the Commission will need for what could be a period of quite significant change.\" \nThe Fire Service Commission is a Crown entity that controls the New Zealand Fire Service and also acts as the National Rural Fire Authority. Mr Creech and Mr McFarlane were appointed in 2009, and since 2012 have served as Chair and Deputy Chair respectively.
