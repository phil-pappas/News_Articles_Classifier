All other candidates in the GOP field were in single digits with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina pulling in six percent of the vote. \nTrump garnered support from a wide range of the electorate, leading with voters 65 and older and those 45-64 along with voters under 29. He trailed Carson among voters 30 to 44 years old by just one percent and was just three percent behind Senator Ted Cruz among fundamentalist voters. \nAccording to the Texas Lyceum poll , if Trump left the race before the Texas primary in March 2016, more than a third of his voters would gravitate to Senator Cruz while 24 percent would move over to Carson. The remaining voters supporting Trump would be split up among the other candidates. \nOn the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the field with 36 percent of the vote followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at 24 percent, Vice-President Joe Biden at 15 percent (he hasn't declared a candidacy yet), and former Virginia Senator Jim Webb at two percent. \nThe poll found Clinton leads among African-American and Hispanic voters, but trails Sanders among white voters by five percent. Clinton also has a 23 point lead over Sanders among female voters, but loses male voters by one percent to Sanders, 29 to 28 percent. \nIn hypothetical general election races in Texas, Clinton trails Bush 27 to 35 percent, but 39 percent are undecided. Cruz leads Clinton by seven percent with 29 percent undecided. When it comes to Trump, Clinton is just two percent behind the Republican frontrunner in Texas 37 to 39 percent with a quarter of the electorate undecided, according to the poll. \nAs for President Barack Obama, 52 percent of Texans said he is doing either a very good or somewhat good job as president compared to 44 percent who said he is either doing a somewhat poor or very poor job. Obama has positive job ratings among Democrats, Independents, African-Americans, Hispanics, voters 18-29, voters 30-44, but is in negative numbers when it comes to Republicans, white voters, and voters over the age of 45.  //kvue.tv/1KOW7oD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:39:01.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
