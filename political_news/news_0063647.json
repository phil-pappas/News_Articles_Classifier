Those uninsured patients could get coverage if Gov. Bobby Jindal had agreed to accept Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, but Jindal refused to do it , citing concerns about long-term costs and federal entanglements.\nBecause it's been a non-starter with Jindal for so long, legislators have not grappled with the implications of expanding Medicaid or explored how to implement the program. So state Sen. Jack Donahue, R-Mandeville, has called a Senate Finance meeting for Monday (Oct. 19) that he described as \"a conversation about the cost of Medicaid in the state of Louisiana.\"\nDonahue decided to call the hearing after he and state Sen. Fred Mills met with Department of Health and Hospitals officials to discuss the soaring cost of the state's Medicaid program. Mills said he and Donahue left with \"a lot more questions than answers.\"\nDonahue agreed, saying, \"we're going to have to try to get those costs under control, and you have to understand what you're doing before you control it.\"\nAlthough Donahue downplayed the notion that the meeting would focus on Medicaid expansion, the issue has been a persistent question during this year's race for governor. All four major candidates have expressed a willingness to accept Medicaid expansion, and Democrat John Bel Edwards has framed the issue as both a budgetary priority and a moral obligation to help the working poor.\nBut questions remain on how the three Republicans would implement the plan since they would all seek changes that would require the federal government's approval. State Rep. Walt Leger, D-New Orleans, said that legislators in the coming months are going to have to study closely the models that are already in place in other states, all of which require time to pore over and understand.\n\"I think that certainly some legislators are going to have to do significant work to understand the options, and even more significant work building coalition and consensus with the next administration,\" Leger said. \"It's not nearly as easy as people think, and we have a tremendous amount of work. I'm continuing to try to wrap my arms around it.\"\nAdding to that problem is there hasn't been much reliable analysis done to estimate the cost savings the state could achieve because a report DHH produced in 2013 didn't include analysis of savings other states have enjoyed. Paul Salles, the president of the Louisiana Hospital Association, said getting fresh data for legislators and the next governor will be key in deciding upon a new direction for the state.\n\"I don't think there's been a real thorough analysis of how coverage expansion would not only benefit the citizens but really crunch the numbers and get into the details about where the savings exists,\" Salles said. \"I think because it's been off the table, I don't think anybody at DHH has spearheaded that. Their efforts to do analysis in the early going were skewed toward costing the state a bunch of money.\"\nBut that's not how it has played out in other states, said Steve Spires, a policy analyst at the Louisiana Budget Project. Most states have realized big savings, but many have gone about it differently.\n\"What's important for gubernatorial candidates and the Legislature to look at is what an important piece of fixing the budget that Medicaid expansion is,\" Spires said. \"It's not a hypothetical argument. The proof is in the pudding when you look at the shortfall we're facing. We have a big problem and not having Medicaid expansion is part of that problem.\"\nSenate President John Alario, R-Westwego, said legislators are well aware of the problem. But what's daunting is understanding how big a problem it is -- especially with the turnover of legislators coming into Baton Rouge after the election.\n\"It's very complex, and the sad thing about it, Sen. (David) Heitmeier (of New Orleans) decided not to run again.,\" Alario said. \"We would call on him, and he would sit down and read through thousands of pages of new regulation and help us understand it.\"\nLeger, who is House speaker pro tem, said meetings on Medicaid in the House have not been discussed yet. But he expects to have a conversation with House Speaker Chuck Kleckley after watching how Senate Finance plays out Monday.\nFor the Senate, Alario said he's not sure how the meetings will play out. But he said it's possible that members of the Senate may be digging into an issue that will yield some surprises.\n\"It may amplify the fact that it's a bigger problem than we thought,\" Alario said.\n. . . . .\nKevin Litten is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
