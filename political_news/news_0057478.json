Mitrani, an internist from South Florida who's been Bush's physician since 2007, wrote in a letter posted to Bush's campaign website Thursday .\nBush met with Mitrani last month for the evaluation. Candidates often release medical records to prove they are literally fit for the Oval Office.\nRELATED: First on CNN: Jeb Bush campaign raises $13.4 million in third quarter\nThe letter reveals private details about Bush, who has undergone one of the most written-about physical transformations of any politician during the past year. He's shed more than 40 pounds since starting on the Paleo diet shortly after Thanksgiving.\nRead More Mitrani wrote that Bush's Body Mass Index is 25.8, which is categorized as just barely overweight, according to BMI charts. Anything at 24.9 or lower is considered normal or healthy weight.\nThanks to his new eating habits, Mitrani wrote that Bush's blood pressure and blood glucose have normalized after being mildly elevated in the past.\nBecause of his family history, it was recommended that he take a stress test, which found that he has the capacity to \"complete high intensity physical activity.\"\nHe does, however, have mild thickening of the carotid wall with normal blood flow, which is why he's been taking Atorvastatin or Lipitor since 2013. That same year, his brother, former President George W. Bush, had to receive a stent to open up a blocked artery.\nJeb Bush's prior medical history \"includes vitamin D insufficiency, gastritis, colon polyps, sinusitis, and low back pain. Surgical history includes an appendectomy, a tonsillectomy, and arthroscopic knee surgery,\" according to the letter.\nWhile his prostate, skin and eye examinations have been \"unremarkable,\" Mitrani wrote, he will continue to have periodic colonoscopies due to the presence of previous colon polyps.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://jeb2016.com/medical-records/", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:45:01.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
