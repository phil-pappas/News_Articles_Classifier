It will also remove some of the current barriers to justice by improving understanding of domestic abuse and sexual harm, something we know is lacking in the current system.\n\"In particular, creating a new offence of sharing intimate images without consent, so-called revenge porn, helps to modernise the justice system to tackle the ways people are using new technologies to perpetrate abuse.\"\nLord Advocate Frank Muholland said: \"I welcome the publication of this Bill, particularly the measures to deal with the sharing of intimate images without consent. This crime is a form of insidious abuse designed to inflict humiliation and suffering on its victims who are predominately women.\n\"It results in significant distress to victims and in extreme cases has resulted in people taking their own lives.\n\"I called for a new law to cover this crime because we need to send a strong message to victims not to be embarrassed to come forward and report this offence. I believe it is currently under reported and I hope the new Bill will help reassure those who are affected that law enforcement will treat victims with sensitivity and ensure that those who commit this cowardly crime will face the full force of the law.\"\nThe measures have been welcomed by campaign groups.\nScottish Women's Aid chief executive Dr Marsha Scott said: \"We know that the threat or the distribution of so-called revenge porn can be used to humiliate and control the victim. It is a form and tactic of domestic abuse and must be understood in the wider context of gendered abuse.\nShare article \"We hope that a new offence will give greater clarity to police and prosecutors and make it easier for perpetrators to be held to account for their abusive actions.\"\nASSIST and Domestic Abuse Services head of community safety Glasgow Mhairi McGowan said: \"A specific offence to tackle the issue of the sharing of intimate images will bring much needed clarity to the law and help reassure victims that they can achieve access to justice.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:37:35.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
