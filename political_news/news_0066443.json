It is a party that lacks national unity, cohesion and direction and therefore has no national purpose; we are not looking for experimentation. \n“As for President Mahama and Nana Addo there is a gap of difference in their personality, their judgment and compassion, Nana Addo is just the opposite of president Mahama in all those styles\", he said. \nMr. Iddrisu was addressing the tertiary and educational institutional, network of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at the Nyakpala campus of the University for Development Studies (UDS) during a swearing in ceremony. \nThe Tamale South legislator who is also the Employment and Labor Relations minister also said the NDC is the only political party in the 4th Republic with unparalleled record of access to higher education in the history of the country. \nThis he says has been made evident through with the establishment of the UDS for the people of the Northern, Upper East, and West Regions of the country, the University for Allied Health in the Volta Region, among others. \nThe NDC according to him, is the political party with the most open, viable and democratic credentials to uphold the tenets of equality of the law and equality of opportunities for all its members. \nAlthough the Employment and Labor Relations Minister admitted to challenges in the management of the national economy, he said that has not discouraged President Mahama and the NDC government from embarking on developmental projects that will change the lives of Ghanaians. \nHe added that critics who think the current economic challenges have come to stay will soon be disappointed. \nHe made references to some projects that government has borrowed monies from the international market to initiate for infrastructure transformation, the $100 million works on upgrade of the Tamale airport to an international airport; $38 million Tamale teaching hospital phase one; $172 million Kejetia Market; $1billion Atuabu gas project, roads infrastructure among other tall lists of projects in the country that he said are visible for Ghanaian to see. \nThe newly elected members of TEIN were later sworn in by the Tamale south MP with the challenge to recover the Tolon seat back to the NDC from the NPP.
