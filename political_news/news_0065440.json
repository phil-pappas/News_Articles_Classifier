Mississippi's attorney general approved civil rights advocate Sharon Brown's request to start a petition to remove the Confederate flag Thursday. Brown issued the following statement in a press release from the Mississippi attorney general’s office: “Today we received our official ballot title and summary from the state and are excited that we are one important step closer to giving the citizens of Mississippi the opportunity to have their voice heard on this important issue. I appreciate the Secretary of State and the Attorney General for working expeditiously to get our initiative ready for circulation. It is exciting to know that we are one step closer to addressing this issue once and for all. We will be holding a press conference on October 9th to announce our next steps.
