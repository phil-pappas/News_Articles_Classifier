Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson grabbed 16% support, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina got 8% each and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz garnered 6% support.\nMeanwhile, Jeb Bush -- at one time the front-runner in national polls himself -- garnered 4% support.\nThe poll, conducted between Sept. 22 and Sept. 27, asked possible voters an open-ended question of who they would support for the Republican nomination. Unlike some other surveys, pollsters did not provide a list of names.\nThere was strong name recognition for Trump, but 25% of respondents said they did not know who they would vote for at this point -- just four months away from the first primary.\nTrump has been riding high in the polls for months now, but Carson and Fiorina have climbing their way up, too. Trump told CNBC's John Harwood Thursday that if he suddenly begins plummeting in the polls he will drop out of the race.\nRELATED: Donald Trump: 'If I tank,' I'll drop out\n\"Well, I'm not a masochist,\" Trump said Thursday. \"Right now I'm leading every poll, and in most cases big. That's good. If that changed, if I was like some of these people at 1% and 2%, there's no reason to continue forward. If I fell behind badly, I would certainly get out.\"\nThe survey comes from 496 Republican potential primary voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:18:16.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
