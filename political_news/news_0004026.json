Their crisis of confidence is becoming self-fulfilling, undermining Chile’s ability to weather stormy conditions in the global economy on the back of sound economic management. \n“If it looks like the rules of the game are going to change, you wait until they do — that’s natural. And if the reforms themselves are bad too — like the labour and tax reforms — that only amplifies the pessimism,” says Axel Christensen, chief investment strategist for Latin America at BlackRock. \nLabour reforms being discussed in Congress that would boost the power of trade unions have caused deep disquiet among businesses. Companies have also been fiercely critical of complicated tax reforms that were passed by Congress last year, increasing corporation tax from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The government has agreed to amend and simplify the tax reforms. \nThe pessimism has compounded a drop in investment in the mining sector caused by falling copper prices, leading to an overall decline in investment from 25.5 per cent of GDP in 2012 to 21.5 per cent this year, according to central bank figures. \nAlthough the fall has been checked by greater investment in the energy sector, which is hoped will bring Chile’s punishingly high energy costs down by as much as 30 per cent over the next two years, economic growth is suffering. The great fear is that Chile will fail to recover its dynamism, with growth falling to 1.9 per cent last year after averaging 5.3 per cent over the past three decades. \nOne problem is that there is limited capacity for fiscal stimulus as a result of the fall in copper prices. Meanwhile monetary policy is restricted by inflation that has reached 5 per cent — well outside the central bank’s 2-4 per cent target range — fuelled by a weaker exchange rate. \nEsteban Jadresic, chief economist at Moneda Asset Management, argues that although the peso’s depreciation has in theory made Chile more competitive, there has been a failure so far to reallocate resources away from mining to other export sectors such as forestry, fruit, salmon, software and services. \nWith the central bank expecting exports of goods and services to remain flat for the second year running, Mr Jadresic argues that pending labour market reforms that will increase rigidities are only making the problem worse. “Our principal source of growth is locked,” he says. \nThe government dismisses these fears and points to Chile’s performance in weathering the end of the commodities boom. \nMr Valdés says Chile has passed two important “tests” in adapting to the more challenging global environment. \nFirst, Chile is streaks ahead of the rest of the region in eliminating its current account deficit, which it has brought down to 0.7 per cent, from 3.7 per cent in 2013 — partly thanks to the very pessimism that pervades the private sector, where investment has collapsed owing to the uncertainty generated by Ms Bachelet’s reform programme. \nSecond, despite a 33 per cent depreciation in Chile’s currency, climbing to 700 pesos per dollar last month from 470 pesos in 2013, companies’ finances have barely been affected, unlike with previous devaluations. This has allowed the world’s top copper producer to make a relatively painless adjustment to its terms of trade caused by copper prices collapsing to around $5,200 per tonne, from more than $10,000 per tonne in 2011. \nOn top of this, a large and diversified financial sector with high domestic savings — Chile’s privately run pension system is one of the biggest in the world — provides a handy safety net given high levels of corporate debt and the government’s need to finance a 3 per cent fiscal deficit. If it looks like the rules of the game are going to change, you wait until they do. And if the reforms themselves are bad too, that only amplifies the pessimism \n- Axel Christensen, chief investment strategist at BlackRock \n“Our financial system is much more advanced than other countries in the region, which makes it easier to cope with the changes in the global economy,” says Mr Valdés. \nIndeed, Chile’s relatively low levels of public debt, at about 15 per cent of GDP, stand it in good stead at a time when once abundant tax revenues from copper exports have all but vanished, with growing numbers of mines struggling to break even at current prices. \nEconomists say that growth could pick up by at least a percentage point if business confidence recovers. But few see that happening soon. \nDiego Hernández, chief executive of Antofagasta Minerals, Chile’s largest private mining company, shrugs off the external situation as “nothing new” — unlike the problems at home. \n“We’re used to working with commodity price cycles. It’s part of the culture of the industry, so we know how to react. The domestic situation is much more complicated. It hasn’t been as bad as this for more than 30 years,” he says.
