Kevin McCarthy's decision to drop out of the House Speaker race, a network spokesperson told CNN. \nBoehner's office had announced Wednesday that... \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race to succeed Speaker John Boehner on Thursday, a shocking move that throws the House into chaos. \nThe move came without warning as House Republicans were in a closed-door meeting to select thei... \nHouse Republicans will cast secret ballots on Thursday to elect their party's nominee to succeed House Speaker John Boehner, who is resigning at the end of the month. \nReps. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-F... More \nThe Political Prediction Market experienced the sharpest-ever decrease in odds, according to the company that runs it, Pivit. Before McCarthy announced he was dropping out, his chances for landing the speakership were at 96 percent. \nHis two competitors for the job -- Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Daniel Webster -- had much lower chances than him before his announcement. Chaffetz's odds were at 1 percent, and Webster's odds were the same, despite earning an endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus. \nThe same day after his announcement, McCarthy's odds dropped to 0 percent. Chaffetz's chances at one point rose to 20 percent and Webster's chances rose to 21 percent. \nThe announcement has set off speculation of who could still enter the running. Rep. Paul Ryan's name has been tossed around, but he has said he will not seek the position. \nYet Ryan is leading the prediction market's chances to win the nomination at 23 percent. \nRep. Jeb Hensarling, who is also not in the official running for the speakership, has odds at 21 percent for the nomination. \nCNN's Political Prediction Market is a live online prediction game administered by a company called Pivit that factors polls and other factors, including input from online players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:14:47.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
