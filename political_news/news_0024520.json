Nehru spoke separately to members of the House and Senate. The day before Nehru met with President Harry S. Truman at the White House. He was accompanied by his daughter, Indira, who was to go on herself to become India’s prime minister. Nehru’s session with Truman proved to be a flop; the president declined to offer U.S. economic aid to a nation that recently emerged from British colonial rule and had proclaimed itself neutral in the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union.\nBecause the House chamber was being renovated, Nehru spoke -- for 15 minutes -- to House members in the Ways and Means Committee room in what is now known as the Longworth House Office Building. “I have come here,” he said, “… on a voyage of discovery of the mind and heart of America and to place before you our own mind and heart. Thus we may promote that understanding and cooperation which, I feel sure, both our countries earnestly desire.”\nThen Nehru headed to the Senate, which was temporarily meeting in the Old Supreme Court Chamber, where he repeated, word-for-word, what he had just said. Those twin remarks were followed by a lunch hosted jointly by the House Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees.\nAll in all, Nehru visited the United States four times, returning in 1956, in 1960 and in 1961.\nIn 1956, Nehru spent a day and a half at President Dwight Eisenhower’s Gettysburg farm, where the two leaders built a rapport during discussions that covered some 14 hours. Subsequently, U.S. economic aid to India rose to $822 million a year. In 1959 Eisenhower paid a successful visit to India.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:13:57.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
