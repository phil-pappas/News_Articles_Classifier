We’ve got you covered. \nOhio Gov. John Kasich will continue his presidential campaign on a bus tour of New Hampshire and Vermont this week with a hop over to Michigan today before heading back east for the No Labels event. That will include candidates from both parties. Billionaire Donald Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are on the schedule. \n*** \nPolicy proposals : The governor is set to unveil his first policy proposals on the tour on Thursday. \nThe event description reads “Join Ohio Gov. John Kasich as he presents his ideas for tearing down Washington’s big-government barriers to job creation, balancing the budget, cutting taxes and taking our power and money back to where we live in our states and communities.” \n*** \nLost momentum? “A spate of fresh polls shows (Kasich) is fading not only in New Hampshire but also in his own state of Ohio. He was relatively invisible in the last Republican presidential debate and seems unable to break past the dominant presence of New York billionaire Donald Trump, retired Baltimore neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina,” Dispatch Washington reporter Jessica Wehrman and bureau chief Jack Torry write. “Yet more than three months before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, independent analysts and those close to Kasich say that, unlike Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kasich has every reason to remain in this turbulent Republican presidential race.” \n*** \nAlso on Thursday : Campaign finance reports are due to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday. It will be the first look we get at how Kasich’s official campaign fundraising is going. \n*** \nHeadline from the weekend : John Kasich on Social Security cuts: 'Get over it' \n“Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Friday that a New Hampshire audience member would \"get over\" cuts to Social Security payments as a result of his reform plan -- and the left is already pouncing on the comment,” according to CNN. “The Republican presidential candidate was asked about entitlement reform during NH1's \"Fiscal Fridays\" series in Concord, New Hampshire, on Friday, and he said it was something that would have to get done.” \n*** \nICYMI : Kasich’s super PAC “New Day for America” has a new ad in New Hampshire in which Kasich proclaims “Nobody has shaken up the system more than I have.” \n*** \nHappening this week : The Democratic presidential candidates will have their first debate Tuesday in Las Vegas. You can watch it on CNN starting at 8:30 p.m. \nAccording to CNN, “On either side of (Hillary) Clinton, the highest-polling candidate, are Bernie Sanders (to Clinton's right) and Martin O'Malley (to her left). Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, the fourth- and fifth-placing candidates, bookend the stage.” \nAnd if Vice President Joe Biden jumps in the race, he’ll be added to line-up. \n*** \nIssue 1 : “Issue 1 isn’t the sexiest proposal on the ballot in November, but it could have a profound effect on how the state is governed in the future,” Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. “The proposed constitutional amendment seeks to overhaul Ohio’s hyperpartisan system for drawing legislative district maps — a system that has helped one party hold firm control of the Statehouse for most of the past two decades.” \n*** \nFrom Washington D.C. “The House Freedom Caucus is open to considering Wisconsin's Paul Ryan to be the next Speaker of the House of Representatives if he's willing to make changes sought by the group, its chairman, Champaign County GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, told Fox News' Chris Wallace on Sunday,” writes Northeast Ohio Media Group’s Sabrina Eaton. “But Jordan cautioned that his group isn't \"there yet\" for Ryan and likes that another candidate for the job - Florida Republican Daniel Webster - made changes when he served as speaker of Florida's legislature to  alter the institution's ‘top-down, centralized’ power model and empower its members, Jordan said on ‘Fox News Sunday.’” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
