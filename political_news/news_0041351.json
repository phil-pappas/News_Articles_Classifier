Scott Walker and his top advisers used private email accounts to send hundreds of messages early in the Republican's term in 2011. \nWKOW reported Thursday that in response to an open records request Walker's office turned over nearly 1,000 pages of emails sent by top aides in 2011. \nWalker's spokeswoman Laurel Patrick says the emails are an \"extremely small number\" given the volume sent and received, and they were retained and released in accordance with the law. \nDozens of the emails WKOW received were never sent to an official state account until they were forwarded to the government email of Walker's legal counsel four years after the emails were originally written and two months after the station's open records request.
