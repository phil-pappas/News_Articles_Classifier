Promoted stories \nHe said: \"We know shale production is safe and we take time to explain why to everyone we meet. However it’s not just Ineos who thinks this. The Scottish Government’s own expert panel has already concluded that shale production is safe if best practice is followed. The view is also supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering, The Royal Society and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. \n\"Unfortunately, misleading programmes like [American documentary] Gasland have fuelled people’s misconception of fracking. Pictures of US residents apparently setting light to their water taps have created a real hysteria but it’s important to acknowledge that this film has been discredited with a Forbes magazine article saying, 'the scene though attention grabbing is widely inaccurate and irresponsible'.\" \nMr Pickering argued there was no \"simplistic choice\" between green energy and gas, saying renewables could not guarantee a reliable supply and that gas also served as an essential raw material for products needed by society. \nHe added: \"As a Scot and someone who cares deeply about this country, I don’t want us to lose out on this once-in-a-generation opportunity. Aberdeen is seen as the capital of Europe’s oil business and Scotland now has another chance to lead an industry that will create jobs, boost the economy and showcase our fantastic engineers.\" \nDr Iain Black, a founding member of SMAUG, said that Mr Pickering's intervention had failed to address key concerns of independent scientists, environmental charities, local businesses and residents regarding safety and economic dangers. \nHe said the Forbes article he cited was written by a consultant to the oil and gas industry who denied links between carbon dioxide and global warming and dismissed solar and wind energy as \"silly\". Share article \nHe added: \"Given the growing evidence of problems, Ineos need to provide us with the evidence showing fracking does not have serious health impacts including on cancer and birth defects rates and that there has not been serious worker safety issues at fracking sites in, for example, the USA. \n\"Indeed, on Ineos’s corporate website they admit to problems with fracking in the US. Ineos must provide us with the evidence showing that it does not cause earthquakes, damage to water courses, lead to rogue methane emissions, damage local and national tourism or create noise pollution. They must provide their evidence because independent evidence exists to show fracking causing all these safety concerns.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:57:16.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
