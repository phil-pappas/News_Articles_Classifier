The convict was able to evade arrest for hours because of the arsenal of weaponry he found in an average suburban house.\n I think of those two incidents (which are both told to the best of my admittedly faulty recollection) when I hear pundits and politicians saying, after yet another shooting, that we need more guns at whatever institution the shooting occurred — an elementary school, a church, a college. I think of how easily a silly accident could have been a horrible tragedy if that teacher had decided to arm herself with something more lethal than pepper spray. I think of how much less of a tragedy that escape could have been if firearms weren't ubiquitous. I think of my own disturbing realization that a kid who took a math class next to mine could walk in and waste us all after a quick trip to the basement of his own home.\n On Friday, there were two more shootings at U.S. colleges. Both of them seem to be the kinds of shootings that don't usually make headlines: personal grudges or arguments gone wrong, incidents that elsewhere in the world may end in bruised egos or black eyes, but here regularly leave people dead. They only came on the national radar because they happened on the heels of a mass shooting at an Oregon community college.\nIn response to such tragedies, pundits, gun proponents, and some politicians are pushing more guns in schools. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson thinks it would be a good idea to arm kindergarten teachers . Conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote on his blog Redstate, \"Perhaps if the President wants to spend some money on gun control, he should start giving grants to colleges, elementary, and secondary schools to have trained officers on campus with guns to respond to shooter [ sic ].\" After the murder of school kids at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, NRA president Wayne LaPierre called on Congress \"to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation.\"\nA country in which concealed weapons are allowed in classrooms and dorms at institutions of higher learning is already here . In Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah, Texas, and Wisconsin, you can legally bring a concealed weapon onto a public campus. This year, politicians in 15 state legislatures introduced bills that would make it easier for college students to bring weapons to school. Starting in August 2016 in Texas , students will be able bring concealed guns into college classrooms — including at the University of Texas at Austin, which is working on how to implement the law on campus and where in 1976 an engineering student killed his wife and mother, then climbed to the top of campus clock tower and started firing, killing more than a dozen people in an event widely recognized as the opening shot to a half-century of mass killings and school shootings. At least one professor has already said he will leave the Austin campus and teach at the University of Sydney instead.\nThe justification for guns on campuses — or in elementary schools or churches or wherever else gun-related mayhem has recently struck — is usually some variation on the famous line by the NRA's LaPierre: \"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" If only the real world were as simple as an old-timey Western film, or a game of cops and robbers. In reality, good guys with guns accidentally kill people a lot of the time. The guns that belong to \"good guys\" accidentally or purposely kill people. The good guys lose their cool or get into a fight or get drunk or become overwhelmed by depression, and someone dies, or the good guy himself does. The reality of gun violence isn't usually good guys versus bad guys. It's a chaotic world in which people fight and disagree and forget and stumble and err, a world populated by fallible human beings and made infinitely bloodier by easy access to deadly weapons.\nThat is how most people are killed or injured by guns: not in mass shootings (although the randomness and scale of those events rightly strikes many of us as particularly terrifying), but because of stupid, quotidian crap. An argument. Festering resentment. A fight. An accident. A suicide. Since 1968, 1.5 million Americans have been felled by gun violence. Most of them have not been in mass shootings.\nWe know that young men are disproportionately likely to commit acts of violence, and that the human brain doesn't fully mature until we're 25 or so. According to FBI crime statistics, men are 90 percent of murderers and 77 percent of victims. Two-thirds of homicides involve a gun — usually a handgun, the weapon college students would likely be toting. About 40 percent of homicides were the result of an argument (and maybe more — the cause remains unknown for 35 percent of homicides).\nWe also know that colleges are full of women and men between under the age of 25, along with alcohol, drugs, first-time independence, elaborate social rules, and the resulting bad decisions. One study from 2002 found that 1,400 college students die every year from alcohol-related causes; there are another 600,000 assaults and 70,000 sexual assaults. Fraternities are nationally notorious for the deaths and injuries that occur at their houses, so much so that they rely on intricate networks of alumni and attorneys to protect their institutions. By virtue of putting a lot of young people together in an enclosed space, and giving them access to lots of alcohol in addition to normal hormones and their underdeveloped brains, there are a whole lot of fights and fallings-out and seething hatreds and jealousies and peer pressures and idiotic choices. Sometimes, the idiotic choices are fun. Sometimes they're deadly or at least painful.\nThat's the mix into which so many talking heads suggest we should flood with guns. What could go wrong?\nGuns on campuses will mean that many more of these already run-of-the-mill violent altercations will turn deadly. Mass shootings are less common, but even in a scenario where one kid walks in and starts spraying bullets, it's hard to see how the situation will be drastically improved by several other kids standing up and starting to spray bullets. Of course, in everyone's John Wayne fantasy, you pull out your gun and take the shooter down with one perfect shot, but that's not how gun violence works in real life — in real life, it's hectic and chaotic and unpredictable, especially when there are a bunch of other people in the room.\nSchools are also places where students, teachers, and staff have a right to feel safe and to learn in a gun-free environment. Allowing other students to covertly pack heat on campus compromises that right. If you're a professor, you didn't sign up to work in fear that a bad grade could mean an altercation with an armed, disgruntled student who is legally allowed to carry his weapon on campus.\nWe are already a nation saturated with guns and, as a result, saturated with gun violence. More guns in more places, including in our classrooms, isn't the answer — it's the problem.\nFollow Jill on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.refinery29.com/2015/10/95255/ben-carson-gun-laws", "https://www.dailytexanonline.com/2015/10/07/citing-concerns-with-campus-carry-professor-emeritus-to-withdraw", "https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expandhomicidemain", "http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2015/10/daniel-hamermesh-to-leave-ut-over-campus-carry/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/frank-bruni-guns-campuses-and-madness.html?_r=0", "http://fortune.com/2015/10/03/oregon-shooting-guns-campus/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/remarks-from-the-nra-press-conference-on-sandy-hook-school-shooting-delivered-on-dec-21-2012-transcript/2012/12/21/bd1841fe-4b88-11e2-a6a6-aabac85e8036_story.html", "http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/brain.html", "https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=203748", "http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/oct/08/crossfire-fact-checking-claims-about-guns/", "https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic", "http://www.redstate.com/2015/10/02/yes-mr-president-we-do-need-more-guns-in-schools/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/the-dark-power-of-fraternities/357580/", "https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expanded-homicide-data"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:34:20.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
