Evidently in response to the murder of a Muslim villager at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh which outraged the community of writers and creative people across the country, many of whom returned prestigious awards given by state-funded institutions, the President had urged fidelity to the values of diversity, plurality and tolerance. These he described as “the core values of our civilisation”.\nOnce again on Monday, speaking at a cultural event in Birbhum in West Bengal, President Pranab Mukherjee returned to the same broad theme as he wondered aloud if the idea of tolerance and the acceptance of dissent had declined. And on Tuesday, speaking to a news channel at his home in Kirnahar, the President yet again appealed to people to practise tolerance. When asked, he said the reason for his comments was that during his West Asia tour he had been asked about the “chemistry” of India and that this had got him thinking.\nWhen the President gives voice to a serious problem, the government must wake up.\nRight after Mr Mukherjee articulated his worries the first time around, Prime Minister Narendra Modi endorsed them wholeheartedly at an election rally in Bihar. He went to the extent of referring to the Rashtrapati’s remarks as an “inspiration”, and a source of “guidance”. The head of state is India’s highest constitutional authority, but the President is not just a rubber stamp. The office of the Rashtrapati is an integral part of Parliament. While the President enjoys no executive powers in our constitutional scheme, s/he enjoys enormous moral and political weight, especially someone like Mr Mukherjee who brings with him more than five decades of distinguished public office.\nThis is why the PM had rushed to give the impression that he had paid attention to the President’s words. Alas, Mr Modi has been unable to intervene to correct the distortions on the ground, and this has invited a second reference to the same problem. Seen in the broadest sense, this amounts to a censure of the government and there should be no surprise if Parliament takes up the matter.\nPerhaps the PM may be called upon to seek the guidance of Parliament on the advisability of the steps to be taken in the circumstances since the PM’s authority is being taken lightly by the Taliban-like elements who find solace from many in the ruling party. The situation is indeed unprecedented. In case the PM’s authority is not having the desired effect within his own party, he has an internal political job on his hands.\n commentary OPED Pranab Mukherjee PM Narendra Modi Also Read Mystic Mantra: Value what you have Clothes, bespoke Give banks a break A kickstart to monetary easing", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/commentary-op-ed/article/3rd-presidential-call-matter-serious", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/pranab-1_0_0_0_0_1.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/pranab-1_0_0_0_0_1.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:48:01.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
