It has been suggested his office has been looking at using an obscure process called an “Order in Council” to enable him to skip the ceremony.\nTory MP Sir Alan Duncan, himself a privy councillor, noted: \"The Queen has always put herself above politics but Jeremy Corbyn seems to want to put his politics above the Queen.”\nOne person who did attend the Privy Council meeting was the SNP’s Angus Robertson, who becomes a privy counsellor by dint of his being on the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee, which involves handling classified information.\nShare article Meantime, it was confirmed Mr Corbyn would, along with other senior politicians, attend a State Banquet at Buckingham Palace later this month in honour of Chinese President Xi Jinping.\nIt is a white tie and tails event and guests are traditionally received by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, shaking their hands and exchanging a few pleasantries.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:38:44.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
