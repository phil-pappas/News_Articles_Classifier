Same with the vast majority of Jews. Which got me to googling around. Last I had looked, a decaded of so ago, intermarriage was app 60% among non-orthodox. And about 80% among my friends. In the long term, this means many fewer Jews, just alot of partial ancestry ones. And the whole nature of the \"country club doctor\" being the mainstream fixture/stereotype, may gradually morph to alotta people with some part Jewish ancestry, along with a stronger component of high-fertility 'men-in-black'/orthodox. Pew survey of U.S. Jews: Soaring Intermarriage, Assimilation rates By Uriel Heilman Pew survey of U.S. Jews: soaring intermarriage, assimilation rates | Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) — There are a lot more Jews in America than you may have thought — an estimated 6.8 million, according to a new study. But a growing proportion of them are unlikely to raise their children Jewish or connect with Jewish institutions. The proportion of Jews who say they have no religion and are Jewish only on the basis of ancestry, ethnicity or culture is growing rapidly, and 2/3 of them are not raising their children Jewish at all . Overall, the intermarriage rate is at 58%, up from 43% in 1990 and 17% in 1970. Among non-Orthodox Jews, the intermarriage rate is 71%. The data on Jewish engagement come from the Pew Research Center Survey of U.S. Jews... Among the more notable findings of the Pew survey: * Overall, 22% of U.S. Jews describe themselves as having no religion, and the survey finds they are much less connected to Jewish organizations and much less likely to be raising their children Jewish. Broken down by age, 32% of Jews born after 1980 — the so-called millennial generation — identify as Jews of no religion, compared to 19% of baby boomers and just 7% of Jews born before 1927. * Emotional attachment to Israel has held steady over the last decade, with 69% of respondents saying they feel attached or very attached to Israel. 43% of respondents said they had been to Israel. * Far more respondents said having a good sense of humor was essential to their Jewish identity than observing Jewish law — 42% compared to 19 %. * Approximately 1/4 of Jews said religion is very important in their lives, compared to 56% among Americans generally. * Less than 1/3 of American Jews say they belong to a synagogue. 23% of U.S. Jews say they attend synagogue at least once or twice a month, compared with 62% of U.S. Christians. The Pew study is the first comprehensive national survey of American Jews in more than a decade.
