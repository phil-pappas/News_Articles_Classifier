In addition, the Talisim and other holy valuables were thrown to the floor. \nThe perpetrators then left the scene without stealing anything, the official said. \nPresident of the synagogue Rebecca Honig-Friedman released an email to the congregation members saying, “when Rabbi Aviad Bodner entered the Shul, he discovered that we had been vandalized. \n“Thank God, no one was hurt and the damage could have been much worse, the Torahs and ark were not touched,” she said. \nMs. Honig-Friedman urged the congregation and community to support each other in the wake of the incident. \n“I look forward to seeing you all in Shul and spending a peaceful Shabbat together,” Ms. Honig-Friedman said. \nThe Shul, built in 1913, is one of the last surviving tenement-style synagogues and is located at 180 Stanton St. \nPolice were called to the scene on Wednesday and took finger prints and reviewed some surveillance video that caught the suspects. \nSince nothing was taken and they just left the synagogue with damage its being investigated as a possible hate crime, but it may be a jobe done by some local men who were looking to steal cash and when they didnt find any they turned over the synagogue, the official added. \nNo Other Incidents were reported at any other synagogues in the lower east side, and this investigation remains active, cops said \nAnyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).
