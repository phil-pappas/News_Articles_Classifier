Earlier this week, a fifth congressional committee was set up targeting Planned Parenthood — despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing .\nThe stated goal of these politicians is to defund Planned Parenthood — blocking patients who rely on public health programs from coming to Planned Parenthood health centers for contraception, cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infection, and other preventive care. They've been trying to do this for years . The recent frenzy of activity was triggered by a thoroughly debunked smear campaign targeting Planned Parenthood's small role in facilitating fetal tissue donation for lifesaving research.\n But this isn't about the 1 percent of Planned Parenthood health centers that facilitate fetal tissue donation (a legal donation that is done only when a woman wishes to). It's not even about how Planned Parenthood uses the federal funding we receive (the vast majority of which is reimbursement for medical services we provide Medicaid patients). The sensationalized smear campaign is a convenient excuse for politicians opposed to safe and legal abortion to make another attempt at eroding access for women.\nMore From Cosmopolitan Last week, during a five-hour hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) asked me if I consider abortion to be health care.\nOf course abortion services are health care.\nShe countered that abortion care is not considered health care. ( The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disagrees .)\nRep. Black's opinion — stated as fact — tells us a lot about what this effort is really about.\nThe true purpose of this long campaign to defund Planned Parenthood is to shut down a provider of safe and legal abortion. Doing so by targeting preventive health services at Planned Parenthood shows a stunning lack of empathy and disregard for the needs of our patients — most of whom are low-income and live in medically underserved areas.\nTo reiterate: Abortion is a legal medical procedure in this country, and Congress has no right to target the organizations that provide it or the women who seek them.\nThree in 10 women in the U.S. have had an abortion — women of all backgrounds, faiths, races, and economic statuses. And they have them for countless reasons, all of which are valid, and all of which are their own business and no one else's.\nEvery woman should be able to freely make decisions about her health and her future in consultation with her family, her faith, and her doctors — and without being shamed by politicians.\nBut in states all across this country, women are not free to make this constitutionally protected decision.\nIn my home state of Texas, some women now have to wait up to 20 days to get an appointment as the number of abortion providers dwindles under new regulations.\nIn South Dakota, Missouri, North Carolina, and Utah, women are required to wait 72 hours between counseling and the procedure.\nIn Louisiana, Texas, and Wisconsin, women are forced to either look at an ultrasound or have their doctor describe the ultrasound out loud.\nNone of these rituals are medically necessary. They are meant to shame women who are trying to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. In effect, laws like this make it more difficult to do so, especially for women who lack support systems or economic resources.\nWomen's ability to realize their goals requires them to have control of their fertility. If we want women to have fulfilling careers and economic stability, we have to give them full access to the full range of reproductive health care, including abortion.\nAbove and beyond any practical, economic reasons to respect the right of women to control their own reproductive system, abortion rights are a matter of autonomy and equality.\nCondoms break. Birth control pills are not infallible. Intrauterine devices and implants, even, have failure rates, miniscule as they may be. When these things happen, women have to make a whole host of decisions. No member of Congress should interfere.\nWomen deserve healthy, fulfilling, positive sex (no matter how many times misogynists say it, \"keep your legs closed\" will never be a valid argument). And they deserve access to reproductive health care and information to make the best choices about sex. Planned Parenthood provides high-quality, compassionate, nonjudgmental reproductive health care to 2.7 million people across the country each year.\nBy coming after Planned Parenthood, leaders in Congress and in states across the country signal that they don't accept the proposition that women deserve to make their own decisions about their sexuality and their health care.\nIn the 99 years since Planned Parenthood was founded, we have been moving in the direction of more freedom and more autonomy for women. We won't go back.\nCecile Richards is the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. ​\nFollow Cecile on Twitter.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CecileRichards", "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/05/report-abortion-restrictions-led-longer-wait-times/", "http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf", "http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_MWPA.pdf", "http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/03/429026760/the-attack-on-planned-parenthood-funding-is-the-latest-of-many", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jason-chaffetz-planned-parenthood-funding_5616ed01e4b0dbb8000de134", "http://www.acog.org/-/media/Departments/Government-Relations-and-Outreach/FactsAreImportantABisHC.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20151007T1235024516"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:29:24.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
