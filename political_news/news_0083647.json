At the time, our credit rating under President Kufuor was B3 or B . We went to the market then without a World Bank Insurance cover because our macroeconomic fundamentals were strong, our rating was very good and our debt was sustainable. Even though the global credit crunch was rife in 2007 and average LIBOR was 5.251%, we only paid a little premium. \n'Fast forward to 2015, Ghanaâ€™s Sovereign Guarantee is of no value, our rating has deteriorated to junk status, our debt is unsustainable, LIBOR is 0.5266%, and yet in the face of a PBG, we had to pay a premium so high that the yield on the issue was 10.75%. \n'This is the highest yield on an Eurobond issue ever paid by an African country. It is embarrassing, to say the least. How can a developing country like Poland get a yield of 0.94% on the same day that Ghana issued? Angola, last week postponed plans for a $1.5 billion bond to await better market conditions. Even Zambia with all of its problems got a yield of 9.37%. \n'Ghana was desperate. We so much needed the money that we were prepared to pay any yield to sell the bond. Why did we reduce the size of the offering by $500 million? It is because of our worsening credit fundamentals. At this rate, we have to cough up $107.5 million a year for the next 15 years in interest payments on this bond alone. \n'That means that over the next 15 years, interest payments on this bond alone could have provided the country with ten [10] N1 highways with all the needed flyovers,' the MP for Suame said. \nSource: Starrfmonline.com Politics Follow Us The only way to be absolutely safe is never to try anything for the first time By: Ketor Edem", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:24.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
