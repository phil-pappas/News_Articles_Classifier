Which, technically speaking, is one of the most important part of a graph - because it helps the lines go the right direction. \nIt seemed like a lot of people were actually okay with Jason and his graph. I mean, really, what is the point of the y-axis? There's so many constraining stylistic rules about how one ought to fashion a graph - let us not rule out a great piece of evidence on a technicality. \nBut I couldn't stop asking myself: - Just who is Jason Chaffetz, and was he ever privy to elementary school education? - How does someone with no apparent grasp of basic arithmetic, come to preside over a congressional hearing? \nSince then, other people have asked Jason about his graph, and he's told us: - In data visualization, it doesn't actually matter how the data is visualized, just that there is at least some data - You can't make me say I'm sorry, because I'm not sorry \nYes, Jason and his graph had me in all kinds of bother. But by the weekend, I had almost managed to push the whole thing out of my head, with Prosecco. \nBut then on Sunday, I woke up to the news that Jason was running for the role of House speaker. Admittedly for me - an Australian still learning the many wonders of Congress - I didn't know a lot about the role of speaker. But I knew that if it required him to speak - this surely couldn't be a good thing. \nThis news then sent me into a spiral of thinking too much about Jason all over again. Much later, I was alarmed to find myself weeks-deep into his Instagram feed (@JasonInTheHouse), without any recollection of how long I'd been there, or how I got there. \nI hope I stop thinking about Jason soon. I just don't know if he'll let me. \nFollow Bec Susan Gill on Twitter: www.twitter.com/BecSusanGill More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:43:50.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
