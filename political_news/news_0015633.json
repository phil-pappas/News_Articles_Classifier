Shaheen, daughter of U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., last month said she would consider running if Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan decided not to run for re-election. Hassan announced last week she is challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte in what likely will be one of the most watched Senate races in the country. “I’m inspired by the number of people I’ve heard from and I’m really humbled by the support I’ve received,” Stefany Shaheen said. “I will continue the conversations in the next few days and weeks and make a decision.” Jeanne Shaheen served in the U.S. Senate since 2009. She is the only woman in U.S. history to be elected a governor and a U.S. senator. Asked if she has thought about the possibility she and her mother could both serve as governor of the same state, Stefany Shaheen said, “I don’t think about the historical context; what matters most to me is the New Hampshire voters.” What she’ll focus on when she makes her decision, Shaheen said, is “who can address those challenges (facing the state) in the next two years.” Shaheen, who was born in Portsmouth, has been promoting her book, “Elle & Coach: Diabetes, the Fight for My Daughter's Life, and the Dog Who Changed Everything,” in a book tour that has included appearances in California and New York. If she joins the race, Shaheen could face another offspring of a governor in Republican Executive Councilor Chris Sununu of Newfields, who has announced he's running for governor in 2016. Sununu is the son of John H. Sununu, who was governor of New Hampshire from 1983 to 1989. Jeanne Shaheen lost a U.S. Senate race to Chris's brother John E. Sununu in 2002 and then defeated him in a rematch in 2008.
