America Recycles Day , a Keep America Beautiful initiative, is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to promoting and celebrating recycling in the U.S.\nThis year's theme – \"Bathrooms, Wraps & Gadgets\" – shines a light on some of the everyday but not \"top of mind\" consumer products, which can and should be given another life through recycling. These include personal care items commonly found in the bathroom, like haircare and mouthwash bottles; plastic bags, such as those used at retail stores, and plastic wrap used in packaging paper towels, toilet paper or dry cleaning; and consumer electronics and gadgets, such as mobile phones, tablets, game consoles, televisions and more.\n\"I Will Recycle\" Sweepstakes\nDuring America Recycles Day 2015, individuals are encouraged to take the \" I Will Recycle \" Pledge. Between Oct. 15 and Nov. 20 , the America Recycles Day \"I Will Recycle\" Sweepstakes will provide four people the chance to win an Apple Certified Refurbished iPad mini 3. Individuals are encouraged to demonstrate their recycling spirit and automatically be entered in the sweepstakes by posting a photo on Twitter at @KABTweet or @RecyclesDay or @KeepAmericaBeautiful on Instagram holding a recyclable product that they pledge to recycle with the hashtags #IWillRecycle and #Sweepstakes. Individuals must enable public viewing of Twitter and Instagram photos. Keep America Beautiful may share tagged social media posts with its fans and four individuals will be selected at random to win an Apple Certified Refurbished iPad mini 3. For more details on how to enter, read the Official Rules .\n\"America Recycles Day provides key moments in time to educate and encourage individuals to better understand how, why and where they can recycle to divert relevant products from the waste stream and give their garbage another life,\" said Brenda Pulley , senior vice president, recycling, Keep America Beautiful. \"For 2015, we want to encourage people to think beyond bottles and cans to other products that may not be as top of mind but are also recyclable. We look forward to having more people take the 'I Will Recycle' pledge this year and to seeing and sharing their photographs for America Recycles Day.\"\nOnline registration is open at AmericaRecyclesDay.org for local organizers to schedule events in their communities and gain access to valuable resources to plan, promote and host an America Recycles Day event.
