The information would not be made available to the general public but could be accessed by animal breeders, shelters and pet stores.\nThe bill is scheduled for a hearing before a legislative panel Wednesday.\nSupporters of the measure say it would help keep animals away from people with a history of abuse.\nTennessee this year became the first state to pass a similar law. Bills are pending in several other states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:51:34.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
