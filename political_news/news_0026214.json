According to KIDK-TV , the student distributed messages online that he would bring guns to school because girls in his school wouldn't send him nude photos.\nThe student allegedly threatened to bring two guns and hunting knives to school, and had a detailed plan of how he would attack his classmates. \"No one will give any [nudes] to me,\" he allegedly wrote in an exchange with a concerned classmate. \"Everyone hates me [â€¦] I hope everyone has a will written.\"\n The threat was posted on social media, and an anonymous tip led the school to go on \"code blue\" lockdown , and only students or personnel with ID could enter, and only through the front door. They also controlled who could walk in the hallways between classes.\nThe Idaho State Journal reports that the teenager has been charged with two counts of telephone harassment and one count of threatening violence on school grounds, and he is currently in a juvenile detention center. Classes will resume as usual Friday, and counselors will be available for students who need to talk.", "external_links": ["http://www.localnews8.com/news/update-suspect-that-caused-the-lockdown-in-custody/35702484", "https://www.facebook.com/AshleyMonfortNBC12/videos/1009028125784004/?type=1", "http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/embed/iframe?aspect_ratio=3x2&auto_next=0&auto_start=0&page_count=5&pf_id=8270&pl_id=16611&rel=3&show_title=0&tags=news,%20mostpopular&va_id=6007659&volume=8&windows=1", "http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/one-in-custody-after-highland-high-school-gun-threat/article_7e0f3028-59a6-5061-bdac-cbbf36b7cf80.html%20", "http://www.kpvi.com/mostpopular/story/Highland-on-Controlled-Access-After-Possible/bxkMJsq5YUSWYtcveHjMjw.cspx"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:56:43.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
