There are cafés and trendy eateries on streets still graced by Art Deco architecture and home to chic boutiques. Joggers pound the pavements around what was once a horse track. Dog lovers enjoy its two parks. \nSo when a killer struck this month, claiming 18 lives in less than a week, residents were aghast. All the more so because the victims of the rat poison found in flower beds were pooches. The Condesa, after all, is the place to buy gluten-free, vegetarian dog food and canine cup cakes, where dogs have grooming parlours and shops put out water bowls for thirsty pets. More Copernican shale revolution \nThe perpetrator, or perpetrators, remain at large. One theory is that the dogs fell victim to an attempt to control a rat infestation in a restaurant, rather than dying at the hand of a crazed psychopath incensed at dog owners’ patchy poop-scooping. \nWhatever the cause, the canine crime wave should perhaps come as no surprise in a country struggling to keep violence on a short leash. \nThe human murder rate in Mexico has been on an upward path this year, spiking higher in May compared with April, and again in July and then August, to reach 12,319 victims in the first eight months of 2015, official data show. That is already above the 11,770 tally for January to August 2014. \nFurthermore, a third of Mexican households report having suffered some sort of crime in 2014, a figure virtually unchanged on 2013, according to the latest official survey of security perceptions and crime, called ENVIPE. \nThe murder rate, in particular, rather challenges President Enrique Peña Nieto’ s blanket assertion, in his annual state of the nation speech in September, that: “Today, it is a fact that violence in Mexico is reducing.” \nThe claim is not completely untrue: the numbers of other so-called “high impact” crimes — kidnapping and extortion — have fallen dramatically. The eight months to August saw 38 per cent fewer kidnappings compared with the same period in 2014, and 18.5 per cent fewer extortions, according to official data. \nNonetheless, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, said after a recent visit that “for a country that is not engaged in a conflict, the estimated [human rights crime] figures are simply staggering”. He cited 151,233 people killed between December 2006 and August 2015, and at least 26,000 missing. \nMr Peña Nieto took power three years ago, promising to make things better. Yet for many Mexicans, life is getting more dangerous. The crime rate per 100,000 residents fell in three states in 2014, but rose in 12 and was unchanged in 17 — indeed, three-quarters of residents claimed crime made their state a dangerous place to live, according to ENVIPE. But 93 per cent of crimes are unreported: a third of respondents said it was a waste of time to do so, and 17 per cent said they did not trust the authorities. Drug cartel related violence is certainly behind a crime spike in some areas, but there is torture and violence by state security forces, the UN says. The disappearance of 43 students a year ago, presumably handed by corrupt local police to a drug gang, is a “test case of the authorities’ willingness to tackle violent crime and corruption”, said the UN high commissioner. \nBut the government, under pressure to deliver on crime, corruption and the reform agenda that it defines itself by, is increasingly touchy about criticism. “It’s not like we’re Russia,” shot back one minister recently, irked at the suggestion that the government is failing to tackle Mexico’s rule of law problems and frustrated that official achievements are not being appreciated. \nYet this week officials again failed to read the public mood when they posted a shrewish advert on the government’s YouTube channel that extols the virtues of the reforms. Its tagline “ya chole con tus quejas” roughly translates as “stop complaining”. After an outcry, it was hastily pulled. \nThe heady days of the start of Mr Peña Nieto’s presidency, when he was hailed as a radical transformer, are long gone, largely because his government has repeatedly tripped itself up. Now he must work like a dog to deliver results and win over sceptical Mexicans. \njude.webber@ft.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:09:57.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
