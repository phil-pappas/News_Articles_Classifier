He finally had a wonderful summing up why people should vote for him. If you live in the First District of Virginia – or are nearby – please help Mark. Here’s his website and here’s his FB page. I am helping Mark already through this blog!", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVdJTD_M4k8", "http://www.varight.com//https://www.facebook.com/MatneyForSenate/", "http://www.matneyforsenate.com/"], "published": "2015-10-24T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:29:48.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
