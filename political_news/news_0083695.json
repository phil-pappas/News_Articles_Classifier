Background \nIn releasing their annual report earlier this year, the Ombudsman’s office said, “The Annual Report includes a special report regarding a complaint where the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Department of Immigration failed to follow certain Ombudsman’s recommendations.” \nThe report [ PDF ] said that in December 2013 a Bermudian professional lodged a complaint with their office against the Department and the Minister of Home Affairs, and detailed what happened following the complaint. You can read the full extract from the the Ombudsman’s report here . \nFollowing the Ombudsman’s Report , Minister of Home Affairs Michael Fahy said he found the report “disturbing,” and the two Departments did “absolutely nothing wrong and for the Ombudsman to portray anything other than that is utterly false and misleading.” \nA letter [ PDF ] from the UK-based Ombudsman Association said they “viewed with some concern the dismissive language that has been used towards the Ombudsman for Bermuda by some members of the Government,” while a letter from the Vienna-based International Ombudsman Institute said they it is “with great concern that the IOI has learned about the difficulties faced by one of its members, the Ombudsman for Bermuda, due to the damaging remarks made by the Minister of Home Affairs…” \nIn response to the letters, the Ministry said they “believe in the freedom of the Ombudsman to conduct her investigations” and they “will continue to support the work of the Ombudsman but in this particular case she has overreached…” \n““The Minister stands by this view, notwithstanding the apparent pressure being made by outside organizations of which the Ombudsman is a member,” the Ministry added. \nPremier Michael Dunkley also responded, saying‎ that “Government has the utmost respect for Bermuda’s Office of the Ombudsman” and has already written to both the international Ombudsmans groups to “formally express Government’s support for the role of the Ombudsman.” Walton Brown’s Comments \nMr Brown said, “The simple fact is the attack by Minister Fahy on the office of the Ombudsman is unacceptable in a democratic society. We stand with the Ombudsman Association and the International Ombudsman Institute in support of the Bermuda Office of the Ombudsman. \n“Our concern is not that Minister Fahy disagreed with the findings but rather the contemptuous dismissal of the work of the Ombudsman as “a farce. We are further concerned that Premier Dunkley has endorsed this sentiment by stating the Minister has his full support. \n“As an office enshrined in the Bermuda Constitution, the Ombudsman has a fundamentally important role in helping to maintain good governance and holding public authorities to account. \n“Minister Fahy’s emotional dismissal not only lacks political maturity; it also sends the unfortunate message that the OBA government does not respect the role of the Ombudsman. \n“To comment earlier this week on the details of the specific case that raised the Minister’s ire misses the point entirely. As a lawyer, Minister Fahy will certainly know that there will be rulings made by Supreme Court judges he will not agree with, even vehemently. But he would never publicly dismiss the Supreme Court as “a farce.” Why do it in this case? \n“The appropriate next step for Minister Fahy is not retrenchment into an indefensible and intransigent position, but rather an unqualified apology for the tenor and tone of his comments. \n“The appropriate step for Premier Dunkley is not a pat on the back for Minister Fahy; rather, he needs to demonstrate such conduct is not acceptable for any Minister in his Cabinet,” concluded Mr Brown. \nUpdate 4.31pm: In response, the Ministry of Home Affairs said, “The Minister has no further comment to make. He has made his position clear.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:51:25.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
