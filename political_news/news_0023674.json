You go to New Hampshire and there are no minorities there and nobody lives there and there are no minorities,\" Reid said. \"You go to Iowa and there are a few people there but again that does not demonstrate what America is all about for different reasons.\"\nReid was speaking to reporters and political strategists at the Washington Post 2016 \"Debate Pregame\" in Las Vegas.\n\"I'm satisfied that what we've done has been good for the country,\" Reid added. \"And I don't mean to denigrate New Hampshire or Iowa but they shouldn't be the ones choosing who's going to be president.\"\n  Iraqis preparing to retake Ramadi, for real this time Col. Steve Warren said Iraqi ground forces are encircling almost the entire city.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 1:02 PM The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary lead off the 2016 presidential race, and are very influential in the voting process. Most candidates spend considerable time campaigning in the early states and presidential contenders frequently drop out after disappointing showings.\nReid played a key role in 2006 and 2007 to enhance the role played by the Nevada caucus as it became the fourth nominating contest in the race. Nevada is a swing state with a significant Latino vote.\n\"We are a state that has represented what America's all about,\" Reid said. \"And I think that bringing in South Carolina, bringing in Nevada makes a better process for choosing a president.\"\nThe first Democratic debate of the primary season will be held on Tuesday night in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel.\nWhile Reid refrained from endorsing a Democratic presidential candidate, he spoke highly of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for their work in the Senate, and also briefly mentioned Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. The Senate Democratic leader said he would endorse a candidate before the Iowa caucuses.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner U.S. military: Russia's 'reckless' strikes actually helping ISIS Russian airstrikes in Syria have opened the door for the Islamic State to expand its foothold.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 12:41 PM Top Story Planned Parenthood to stop accepting cash for fetal tissue \nPlanned Parenthood will no longer accept payments  \nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/13/15 10:32 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:06:51.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
