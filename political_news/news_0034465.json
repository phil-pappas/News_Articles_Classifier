Leroy Burnell/Staff × Water rescues, dangerous roads and flood-victim relief kept area first responders running at full tilt during the peak of the rains. The Charleston Fire Department had staffers working up to 36 hours straight responding to a deluge of calls, said Mark Davis, chief of special operations. People trapped in their homes or vehicles because of floodwaters needed help, he said. “The majority of people that were removed did not even call 911,” he said. Instead, they saw the Fire Department in the neighborhood and asked for help, he said. Overall, there were 496 calls to the Fire Department Oct. 2-5, which is a 118-percent increase. Some 85 people were rescued from their homes along with 22 dogs, a cat and a bird, Davis said. “The dogs tend to get right in the boat,” he said. Charleston police received 393 calls Oct. 3-4, a 66 percent increase over the weekend before. The calls included people stuck in flooded cars and homes, and requests for sandbags. There were more officers assigned to duty and they worked longer, 12-hour shifts, said police spokesman Charles Francis. St. Johns Fire District Chief Colleen Walz said her department received triple the usual number of calls Oct. 3 and double the average number Oct. 4. Rescue calls included people whose cars had stalled in floodwaters on Kiawah, Seabrook and Johns islands, she said. “Flooding is the deadliest of all natural disasters. People just underestimate the power of Mother Nature,” she said. The department will assess maintenance needed for its big trucks after their service in the floodwaters. Brakes, drums and alternators can be affected. “It’s not going to be cheap,” she said. Most of the rescues Oct. 2-5 were in West Ashley in the Shadowmoss and Avondale areas. Calls also came in from Spruill Avenue in North Charleston down into the Neck area, as well as on James and Johns islands, Davis said. “The majority of them were people whose homes were surrounded by flooding and they were uncertain when the water would go down,” Davis said. Things were different at the St. Andrews Fire Department where Chief Mark Schrade said there were fewer calls than expected because people took the advice of officials and stayed home. The department responded to calls from people who tried to drive through high water. Some staffers had to stay overnight because others were not able to get to work in the floodwaters, he said. North Charleston Fire Department had 345 emergency calls during the rain-soaked weekend, which is about double the typical number. The requests for assistance included 12 water rescues. The state Department of Transportation mobilized hundreds of workers around the state in response to the flooding. “We’ve been on 12-hour shifts. Everybody is going to have a lot of overtime,” said DOT spokesman James Law. A DOT employee died in Columbia while responding to problems created by the flooding when his truck was swept away. The DOT worked around the clock to issue frequent updates for the hundreds of roads that were closed because of flooding. What the storm will cost the state for road repairs has not yet been determined. The public outpouring of donations for relief supplies prompted Gov. Nikki Haley on Friday to say there was no more need to give. Red Cross spokesman Patricia Kemp said a massive relief operation was activated in South Carolina. The operation still is in the response phase in much of the Columbia-area. But in the Lowcountry, the group is making the transition to the recovery phase, she said. The group opened 30 temporary shelters throughout the state during the flooding, Kemp said. Last night, 10 of them remained open. No shelters remain open in the Lowcountry, she said. Kemp didn’t yet have numbers available on how many people used those shelters, but, she said, more than 300 people were sheltered Monday night. She also said there were 800 Red Cross workers on the ground in the state, most of them volunteers. The Lowcountry S.C. Chapter of the American Red Cross serves the counties of Charleston, Beaufort, Berkeley, Colleton, Dorchester, Georgetown, Hampton, Jasper and Williamsburg. The Red Cross has served 92,000 meals and snacks around the state since the flooding began, and it has distributed 52,000 relief items such as bottled water, soap, toilet paper and bleach to people affected by flooding, Kemp said. The group also had 14 mental health volunteers, 40 health service volunteers and five wellness volunteers helping in South Carolina. United Way 2-1-1 received more than 900 calls from area residents regarding flooding issues from Oct. 3-8. “Generally it takes five to seven days for folks to come forward and reach out for help to address their needs after a disaster,” said Christine Boudolf of the Trident United Way. A woman airlifted from her home in Huger came to East Cooper Community Outreach for help. Later, the agency received another call for help from a woman evacuated from her home in McClellanville. ECCO spokeswoman Alana Morrall anticipated the organization would be seeing more people needing assistance as flood damage is assessed. “We’ve been internally strategizing as to how we can best provide support for people. That’s something that we are struggling with. We will try to be as prepared as we can,” she said. ECCO, which was founded after the devastation of Hurricane Hugo in 1989, provides food, clothing and financial assistance for other living expenses such as rent, utilities and health services. As part its expanded emergency relief efforts, the organization also is helping with home repair and property replacement. Toby Smith, executive director of Midland Park Community Ministries and a candidate in the Charleston mayor’s race, said her group regularly offers people help with food, utility bills and other needs. But more people have begun to come in for those services in recent days, she said. “People are hanging on to their cash so they can have money for flood-related things,” she said.
