It took him another hour to emerge from the selfie-scrum.\nBush’s SEC Selfie Tour went much the same way last Saturday in Knoxville, where a crowd of mostly students clad in Tennessee’s orange-and-white gathered in a patch of greenspace outside Neyland Stadium to hear the Republican’s pitch.\nWade Payne Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Gov.
