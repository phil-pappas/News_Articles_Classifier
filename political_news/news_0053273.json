At this juncture, I can only say that I’m ready to face my accusers anywhere. That justice be my defender,” said the governor. \n“I will subject myself to due process in the relevant institutions at the appropriate time and I’m sure I will be vindicated. In the meantime I continue to discharge my duties to the people of Murang’a as progressively as the people of my county have come to expect of me,” he added. \nMr Wa Iria spoke as the Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya termed the impeachment null and void. \nSpeaking in Naivasha on Friday during the CoG’s retreat at the Enashipai Hotel, Mr Munya said the County Assembly acted in total breach of the Constitution by not according the governor a hearing. \nHe accused some county assemblies of continuously holding the functioning of the devolved units hostage through blatant violation of the procedures laid down in the Constitution. \n“The threshold for removal upon which these grounds can be said to have been based are well articulated by the Court of Appeal,” said Mr Munya. \nHe said the CoG believed that the allegations levelled against Mr Wa Iria were as a result of the usual challenges facing counties, particularly the delayed disbursement of funds. \nMr Munya added that some of the accusations were neither substantial nor weighty. \n“The governor was also not accorded an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations levelled at him. It is against the rule of natural justice,” said the Meru Governor. \nOn Friday, Mr Wa Iria lost a bid to stop the County Assembly Speaker from forwarding to the Senate the decision to impeach him. \nThe governor had moved to the High Court in Nairobi to stop Speaker Nduati Kariuki, claiming he was not given a chance to defend himself. \nJustice Joseph Onguto declined to issue the order, saying the governor will not suffer any prejudice, but certified the application urgent and ordered that it be heard tomorrow. \nMr Wa Iria had sued the Murang’a County Assembly, the Senate and their Speakers. \nMr Wa Iria is one of central Kenya governors facing political battles as competitors scheme ahead of the next General Election. \nNyeri MCAs on Thursday formed a committee to probe claims of corruption against Governor Nderitu Gachagua in what they say is the first step towards impeachment. \nIn Embu, Governor Martin Wambora’s tenure hangs by the power of a court ruling after he survived the first and second impeachment attempts when High Court and the Court of Appeal nullified the same thereafter. \nThe two impeachment bids were pegged on the same ground — alleged irregular procurement of services to give Embu stadium a facelift and the supply of maize seed to farmers. \nIn August, Laikipia County Governor Joshua Irungu survived an impeachment motion after the mover sought to defer it. \nAt the heart of the impeachment attempts is a move by both the executive and the county assemblies to control billions of shillings meant for development with the belief that the MCAs especially need to spearhead projects that they will use to campaign in 2017. \nAlso fuelling the impeachment drives in the region is the bid by politicians to be in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s preferred party, Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP), ahead of the General Election. \nWhile MCAs accuse the governors of misappropriating county funds, governors are on the other hand saying MCAs are usurping executive roles instead of sticking to their legislative work. \nIn Nyeri, Governor Gachagua is putting on a brave face, and on Tuesday during Mashujaa Day celebrations in Nyeri town scoffed at those plotting to impeach him. \nOnly 15 MCAs attended the event, a majority of them nominated. \nThe MCAs are claiming that the governor has no development record to show for the three years he has been in office. \nMr Gachagua attacked the assembly speaker and accused him of inciting the MCAs, telling him to come clean about whether he harbours ambitions of being governor or senator. \n“The speaker is supposed to be neutral when conducting the affairs of the House but not behaving like a politician,” said Mr Gachagua. He said they want to see neutrality in the county assembly. \nWhile affirming that he will be defending his seat come 2017, the governor said he was ready to face his opponents. \nSo far, those said to be interested in the governor’s seat are prominent businessman Kinyanjui Githinji, National Oil Corporation chairman Daniel Wamahiu and a former Director of Vision 2030 Wahome Gakuru. \n“When that time comes, we shall face them, but now I want to tell them that they are just wasting their money campaigning for the seats which are not vacant,” said Mr Gachagua. \nThe Nyeri governor said both the governor and MCAs were elected by the Nyeri County residents and come 2017 they will go back to the electorate to seek a fresh mandate, and they will be judged according to their performance. \nOn several occasions, the ward reps have accused the executive of failing to control county debts stating that the executive arm of the county does not implement the set departmental ceilings. \nIn Kiambu County, bad blood between Governor William Kabogo and other elected leaders including MPs and the senator has at one time led to threats of impeachment but which have always come to naught. \nThe entry of Mr Ferdinand Waititu, who left Nairobi politics to run for Kabete parliamentary seat, has also complicated matters for the governor who, however, says the politician is wasting his time in his desire for the top county seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:10:57.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
