Jeremy Corbyn promised to debate this and any retreat from that will add to the extraordinary dissent and disarray which has engulfed Labour.\n“It is also time for Kezia Dugdale to decide where she stands - will she join with the SNP, her party's UK leader, her deputy in Scotland, Labour's only Scottish MP and two senior Labour MSPs who are all against spending £100 billion on weapons of mass destruction?”\nLabour is deeply divided on whether to renew Trident.\nShadow defence secretary Maria Eagle, deputy leader Tom Watson, and shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn want to keep it, while Corbyn, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray want unilateral disarmament.\nThe trade unions are also split, with the GMB, which has thousands of members in the defence industry, saying it would be madness to get rid of the Faslane-based weapons.\nMPs voted in 2007 to extend the life of the nuclear weapon system, and the “main gate” decision on whether to commission three or four new submarines is due next year.\nAround 1000 people are expected at this week’s conference, which will be Kezia Dugdale’s first in charge since she replaced Jim Murphy as Scottish Labour leader in August.\nDugdale yesterday said she wanted Labour to be “fit for the future”, a tacit admission that its recent past has been a disaster.\nInsisting she was confident about the looming Holyrood election, she said: “I want people to look at Scottish Labour under my leadership and see a re-energised, refreshed party that has positive things to say about the future.\n“That means a new generation of candidates; giving members a say in what happens in our party; and ensuring gender equality in the list of new candidates we put to the public.”\nBut she also appeared to distance herself from Corbyn’s nostalgic appeal to the Left.\n“Two of Labour’s proudest achievements - the NHS and the social security system - were created in the 1940s. I want to talk about how prepare Scotland for the 2040s. The arguments and solutions of the past, interesting though they may be, have to be behind us.”\nShare article The Scottish Tories yesterday cited a recent YouGov poll to claim almost 80,000 voters who backed Labour at the general election had switched to the Tories for Holyrood 2016.\nLeader Ruth Davidson credited “centre ground” policies and a stout defence of the union.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-25T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:59:20.837+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
