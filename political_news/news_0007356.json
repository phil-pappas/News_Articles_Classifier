Bill was right, that new face lift really paid off.\nLook mom! No more turkey neck!\nIn fact, Hilz doesn’t look a day older than she did 7 years ago.\nEven The Donald thought she performed well. It’s almost like she got the questions ahead of time, or something.\nMoral of the story: never, ever , bet against the Clinton machine. With the Clinton machine running efficiently in the background things that might normally matter no longer do. Corruption doesn’t matter, emails don’t matter, dead ambassadors don’t matter, classified information doesn’t matter, mucked up foreign relations don’t matter. In the Clinton Kamp of the Saints the only thing that matters are your female parts, free college and MORE SUGAR! For everyone.\nNo word yet on who will be picking up the tab for all that free stuff. Butt if you’re one of the remaining shlubs still working, assume it’s you.\nBecause Hilz is sick and tired of talking about her emails, and she wants to get on with doing the work of the American people.\nYeah, yeah, yeah; we’re all sick and tired of it. So what?\nVolley to you Joe – you in or what?\nAnd in other political news: I see that Ben Carson didn’t register as a Republican until a year ago. That is, as they say, not a flaw, it’s a feature.", "external_links": ["http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A-Z9MRAugZE/Vh5ddyfOb1I/AAAAAAABYxM/mA6N9A70dIk/s1600-h/hillary%252520and%252520bernie%25255B3%25255D.jpg", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MZjxKWfaBf4/Vh5djYl4NAI/AAAAAAABYx8/e7qCUaLCBEI/s1600-h/joey%252520Law%252520enforcement%252520officers%252520%25255B11%25255D.jpg", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jODUD4tR8Iw/Vh5de0vsi-I/AAAAAAABYxU/_67j_5ecctE/hillary%252520and%252520bernie_thumb%25255B1%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800", "http://www.michellesmirror.com/2011/09/obamas-jobs-plan-shoes-for-industrywtf.html#.Vh5dKf-FPDc", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IO9aKgnH26M/Vh5dhfZS6zI/AAAAAAABYxs/3V9PaQAp1Cs/s1600-h/hillary12%25255B3%25255D.png", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RUG_IY9T3k8/Vh5dfvK_SOI/AAAAAAABYxc/5QPmOUe7P5g/s1600-h/Screenshot%252520Studio%252520capture%252520%252523064%25255B3%25255D.png", "http://www.theamericanmirror.com/exclusive-records-show-ben-carson-became-republican-less-than-one-year-ago/", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mHyr_su2_Xs/Vh5dgr6kR9I/AAAAAAABYxk/fgcfyln2VXQ/Screenshot%252520Studio%252520capture%252520%252523064_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-praises-hillary-clintons-debate-performance/story?id=34464701", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rPv7NRC_JVc/Vh5diQMaMyI/AAAAAAABYx0/aIjNc_wVOks/hillary12_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800", "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JItpOr02l1M/Vh5dkA8739I/AAAAAAABYyE/HMqvrmrFzYM/joey%252520Law%252520enforcement%252520officers%252520%25255B10%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:19:24.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
