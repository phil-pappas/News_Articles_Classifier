TN prison scheduling, discipline criticized in audit \nLast week Schofield thanked consultants for the review, but has downplayed issues in the prison system and hasn't yet agreed to adopt any of the suggested changes. \nThere needs to be additional review of the prison system regardless of whether Schofield enacts the recommendations, said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, D-Nashville. Stewart, an outspoken critic of the department and the ACA's review, said the suggested changes would help some, and he's not trying to say the department won't make them. \nIf they're not enacted though, Stewart said it's further proof the department is determined to deny calls for change from officers, inmates and their families. \n\"It would be particularly remarkable, because what it would tell me is that the department as currently managed is not interested in or capable of making meaningful change in the face of overwhelming evidence that it is needed,\" Stewart said Monday. \n\"What we would assume is that the department does not intend to address any of the concerns that have been raised, I suppose until there is some catastrophic event or a federal lawsuit that forces it to do so.\" Conflict of interest questions arise in TN prison audit \nThe hearing is the fourth on problems in Tennessee prisons and the second in as many weeks focused on a review of several prisons by the ACA. The national accrediting body for correctional institutions visited five of Tennessee's 13 prisons over the course of several days in September. \nThe three ACA consultants who conducted the brief review said they thought the prisons were \"safe,\" but they suggested changes to the way correctional officers are scheduled to work and to the way violent incidents are defined. \n\"Ultimately, these changes are anticipated to positively affect outcomes relative to facility stability and safety as well as addressing staffing concerns relative to pay, overtime and scheduling issues,\" the ACA review states. \nThe ACA recommended changing the current, controversial 28-day time-keeping schedule to a 14-day schedule, with 12 hour shifts instead of eight-hour shifts. In theory, this would address officer concerns about delayed payments in overtime, while also helping the state by eliminating one of the three current employee shifts. Officers would have more regular days off, and it would be less likely they'd be forced to work overtime. That would allow the state to get rid of double shifts as well. Critics: Puncture wound case illustrates prison reporting issues \nThe state needs to change how it defines \"assault on staff\" and \"staff/inmate provocation,\" the consultants also recommended. After denying any policy changes, the state recently acknowledged a change in how it enforced policy regarding attacks on officers. An officer hit in the face with urine would be an assault, but an officer hit in the chest with feces would be a \"staff/inmate provocation.\" \nDepartment data shows the number of \"staff/inmate provocations\" nearly tripled while the number of reported assaults were cut in half from 2008 to 2015. \nThe current definitions can be confusing, the ACA consultants said. They recommending deleting both definitions and replacing them with six different definitions that specifically address assaults with or without a weapon, fighting, disorderly conduct and \"defiance.\" \n\"This change, the ACA team believes, would clarify a policy that is confusing to some employees. It would also exemplify to staff that inmate negative behavior has results for corrective action,\" the report states. \nThe hearing is scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m. in room 29 at legislative plaza. The legislature will also stream the hearing online. \nReach Dave Boucher at 615-259-8892 and on Twitter @Dave_Boucher1 . 4 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Lsomv5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:03:20.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
