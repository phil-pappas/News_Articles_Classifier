They even sent me to Lancaster House to clean as I was the best cleaner.\" \"This is a gross injustice\" Citizens UK \nThe 14 cleaners embroiled in the row signed a letter on July 21 congratulating Philip Hammond on his new role and seeking a meeting to discuss the Living Wage. \nSix weeks later, they received a letter from Interserve initiating a disciplinary process, accusing them of “bringing the contract into disrepute” for writing to the Minister. \nMs Rojas said she was made redundant because the company claimed she was unable to use cleaning machines - even though she had never been asked to do so. \n\"I did nothing wrong,\" she said. \"I had no understanding of what happened. I'm from Ecuador and I feel so sad because I didn't think we would be treated like this. I feel like we had more workers rights at home.\" \nKaty Rojas Photo: Eddie Mulholland/The Telegraph \nIt is understood the redundancies were initially launched as the Foreign Office is moving from Old Admiralty Building to smaller premises at King Charles Street. \nCitizens UK, which has led the campaign for the higher voluntary living wage, will deliver a letter to Mr Hammond demanding that the disciplinary action is dropped. \nThe letter says: \"This is a gross injustice, especially in the context of the Government’s summer budget and professed support for those on the lowest rates of pay. \n\"In writing to you as the Minister, the cleaners were simply exercising their democratic right. We hope you are as shocked as we are at the action taken by your contractor, Interserve, and that you share our view that this needs to be rectified as soon as possible.\" \nReverend Rosemia Brown, of Citizens UK and St James Church, Hackney, said: “Time and again we are told to take up the issue of low pay with the cleaning contractor, but we know that they work to the requirements set by the FCO. That’s why we are appealing directly to the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond and asking him to review his department’s contract and help the cleaners who have been disciplined simply for writing a polite letter. \"Surely he can’t agree that writing a letter is cause for disciplinary action? That’s simply not right.” \nPaul Jennings, partner at law firm Bates Wells and Braithwaite, who represents a group of the employees, said: “This is a genuinely troubling case. A number of employees raised legitimate concerns with the Secretary of State about levels of pay and the difficulties they face meeting the cost of living. \n\"The letter to the minister was professional and courteous. It conveyed a very compelling and personal account of the pressures faced by people working as cleaners within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\" \n​Interserve said in a statement: “Interserve is committed to paying its employees a fair wage and our personnel will benefit from the new National Living Wage when it comes in effect next year. \n“Following the FCO’s decision to close Old Admiralty Building we are reducing the number of cleaning staff on the account and have been in a process of consultation with employees and unions over the proposed changes. This is now drawing to a close and a number of people will be affected by redundancy. \n“This process has been undertaken in full cooperation with unions and employee representatives and has no bearing on any other employee issues.”​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:30:24.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
