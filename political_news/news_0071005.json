(42771116) 87 comments \nSIR Danny Alexander returns to Westminster today for his first public appearance since the General Election to give evidence on the devolution of public finances to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. \nThe former Chief Secretary to the Treasury who lost his Inverness seat in the SNP landslide will be quizzed by peers on a range of issues including: whether or not it is appropriate for the UK Parliament to be considering the Scotland Bill before a new fiscal framework is agreed with Holyrood; should Westminster have a bigger role in scrutinising the financing of devolved governments; is it time to reform or abandon the Barnett Formula and should limits be placed on the additional borrowing powers devolved to Scotland. \nThe committee will also take evidence from Keith Cochrane, Chief Executive of the Weir Group, Professor John Kay from the London School of Economics and Professor Noel Lloyd, who served on the Silk Commission on Welsh devolution.
