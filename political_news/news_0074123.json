Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, believes Congress should play a strong role in the investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s email server \n\"I am very upset with what I heard today,\" said Graham, a foreign policy hawk who has been one of the Obama administration's fiercest critics on Benghazi. \"I don't dislike Secretary Clinton but I think what she said to those family members was wrong...she sat on the sidelines and let Susan Rice tell a story that was a lie to help the President and that's gonna matter for whether or not she is prepared to be our next commander in chief.\" \n\"You have to be held accountable,\" he said concluding his thoughts on news of the day at the end of his town hall in Derry. \nBut watching the Senator on the campaign trail, the high-stakes interrogation playing out on Capitol Hill could not have felt more distant. Though he struggles to gain traction in the polls and with the media, Graham nonetheless appears to be having more fun than anyone on the campaign trail -- telling jokes, back-slapping and wolfing down \"LindseyChick-Filets,\" a custom made special at Milford's Red Arrow Diner, as he attacks Obamacare and the administration's foreign policy, or lack thereof. The most enthusiastic retail politician in the 2016 field, it turns out, is the guy at two percent in the Republican polls. \"LindseyChick-Filet!\" special at Milford's Red Arrow Diner Jacqueline Alemany / CBS News \n\"Help me if you can. I'm a start-up business,\" the cash-poor Graham told the owner of a new antique store in Milford, one of four stops on Thursday. \"I love New Hampshire, it's just like South Carolina except y'all have an accent,\" he added with a gruff chuckle. \nThe son of small business owners himself -- his parents ran a pool hall in the tiny town of Central, South Carolina -- Graham's genial personality and his inclination toward bipartisanship on some issues is often lost in the morbid simplicity of his de facto campaign message: \"Kill terrorists and get out of debt.\" \nIn person, Graham isn't afraid to veer off the script that other politicians stick to. \nHe'd rather make you laugh than make you cry, wisecrack about drinking, his sorry poll numbers, and Vladimir Putin's shirtless horseback riding. He routinely invites reporters out to dinner and drinks. And he's unafraid to talk about being a 60-year old bachelor. \nHis casual demeanor can come across to some as a lack of seriousness - one reason he may be stuck in the lower tier of presidential candidates . But spending a day with Graham during his quixotic White House adventure is one of the more entertaining and enlightening ways of experiencing the 2016 presidential race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:44:02.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
