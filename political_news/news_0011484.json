The actor will be seen donning the Ram avatar in a special show Life OK Dussehra â€“ Jeet Sachchai Kee that will be aired on Dusshera. Says Gurmeet, \" Ramayan was my first show and it was a big hit. Twenty five years after Arun Govil's Ram, people accepted me in that role. After that I played varied characters in serials like Geet Hui Sabse Parayi and Punar Vivah and even they turned out to be huge successes. Till then people had thought if you played a mythological character you will be typecast, but I broke that stereotype. Now I playing Ram again, but after six years.\"\nThe actor shares that he was offered several roles as Ram, but he turned them down. \"I wanted to keep that exclusive because the character is close to my heart. In a way it's Ram's aashirvad that I attained success. However, when I heard the concept of Jeet Sachchai Kee, I was impressed. They want to convey a message through it and it will be shot in the Broadway style in the dance form, which is a first for me,\" says Gurmeet, who proved himself to be a good dancer when he won Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:19:26.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
