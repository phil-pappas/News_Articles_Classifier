It depends.For instance, women have a lower risk for accidents according to insurance data. However, they drive about 2/3rds the distance on their male counterparts and at all ages apart from under 18 and over 65, they have a higher accident rate than men.So should we ban women?But women drive mainly in towns, where accident rates are higher (the correlation between the area where there are more women and the higher accident rates is not something I'd willing to go into). So do men who drive mainly in towns have a similar accident rate? The only research I've heard of is in Germany, so maybe not directly transferable, which suggested that women have a 5x higher accident rate. But then women mainly drive their kids to school, and only the very best drivers would be able to avoid accidents doing that every day.Males and females over the age of 65 have the same accident rates nearly. Or old men drive like old women. But their accident rate per mile driven is the same as that of a 25 year old male. So if we ban old people for their higher accident rates, we must also ban males under the age of 25.And maybe women as well as their accident rate stays more or less the same from 21 onwards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:22:00.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
