John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, attends a Senate Higher Education Subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.

Although administrators eventually pulled the post, the subcommittee kept the meeting, and repeatedly pressed UT's leaders to justify their spending on a broad range of diversity programs. UT president: Pronoun controversy 'like nothing I've seen' \nWhile the questions touched on a wide array of issues, they frequently returned to money. Although the subcommittee is made up of three state senators, three other lawmakers joined them during the 90-minute discussion to ask their own questions about racial diversity, gender identity and the First Amendment on campus. Five members of the panel were white male Republicans and the sixth was a black male Democrat. \nThe UT system — which includes campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Martin and Memphis — pumps $5.5 million annually into diversity programming. That makes up less than .25 percent of the system's total budget of $2.1 billion. \n“I’m not passing judgment on anybody’s lifestyle,\" Sen. Todd Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga, told the administrators. “But I have a responsibility to look at the numbers” to determine if UT is spending money wisely. \n“To me it appears that you’re not.” \nUT System President Joe DiPietro (Photo: File / AP) \nAfter the hearing, UT system President Joe DiPietro stood by the investment, saying it \"improves the competency of our students and provides us a more inclusive environment on our campuses.\" \nJimmy Cheek, the chancellor of UT Knoxville, said much of the funding goes toward efforts to improve the racial and ethnic diversity of the school's student body. It's something he said employers want. \n“The business community is asking us to diversify our student population,\" Cheek told the panel. \"That’s where most of these resources go.\" \nStill, some of the legislators were not pleased with the way that money is doled out. During a particularly heated exchange, Rep. John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, pressed DiPietro and Cheek on how they measured diversity. \n“How much is enough? At some point we can declare victory” and move the millions spent on diversity elsewhere, Ragan said. “Your diversity goals should have numbers assigned to them so that you know when you’ve got to the goal line.\" \nDiPietro and Cheek said measuring diversity is more complicated, and included race, culture, gender identity and sexual orientation. \n\"You need global competency. It takes resources to do that,\" DiPietro said after the hearing. \"We think we produce a better product at Knoxville because of that.\" \nIn the post that triggered the hearing, UT Knoxville Pride Center Director Donna Braquet said students and professors should ask one another what pronouns they use. Braquet wrote that students who do not identify as men or women might prefer gender-neutral pronouns. UT's pronoun post part of a larger college trend \nUT released several statements saying the gender-neutral post was meant only as a resource. In an email in September, DiPietro said the university system had tweaked its policies to ensure future Web postings and communication from UT would encourage inclusive practices \"in a more educational tone than in a prescriptive tone.\" \nThe subcommittee will meet again on Thursday to discuss other topics, including campus safety. The senators will prepare a report for the larger Education Committee. \nAfter Wednesday's hearing. Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Joey Hensley, R-Hohenwald, said he did not expect to suggest any new legislation surrounding the diversity issue. \nReach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and on Twitter @tamburintweets. 95 CONNECT 24 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 26 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1RILAhm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:39:48.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
