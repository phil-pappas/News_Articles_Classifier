(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nVice President Joe Biden would run an optimistic and unscripted \"campaign from the heart\" based on restoring middle-class opportunity, one of his top political advisers said Thursday, laying out for the first time the argument Biden would make if he runs for president. \nFormer Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, one of Biden's closest political advisers, said Biden would soon make a decision about whether to enter the race. In an email obtained by The Associated Press, Kaufman said Biden will need his supporters' help immediately if he runs for president. \n\"If he runs, he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead,\" Kaufman said. \nKaufman's letter to so-called \"Biden alumni\" appeared designed to reassure the vice president's supporters that he's still actively considering a campaign and believes he could be competitive, despite Hillary Rodham Clinton 's commanding performance in the first Democratic debate on Tuesday. Top Democratic leaders have questioned whether it's too late for Biden to mount a viable campaign — a concern Kaufman alluded to as he asked Biden loyalists interested in working for a potential campaign to \"stay in touch.\" \n\"If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you — yesterday!\" Kaufman wrote. \nBiden's top consideration is the welfare and support of his family, Kaufman said. The vice president has said previously he's unsure he has the emotional fortitude to run following the death of his son, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, from brain cancer in May. \n\"He is determined to take, and to give his family, as much time as possible to work this through,\" Kaufman said. \nKaufman served as Biden's chief of staff in the Senate and replaced him when Biden became vice president. He's one of three top advisers who have spent the last two months cloistered with Biden as he decides about 2016; Biden chief of staff Steve Ricchetti and political adviser Mike Donilon round out the trio. The group met with Biden to discuss the 2016 race on Wednesday evening at Biden's official residence, said a person familiar with the meeting, who wasn't authorized to speak to reporters and requested anonymity. \nThose discussions have all taken place in private, and Biden's office has declined to comment on the status of his deliberations or when he'll make a decision. Yet Clinton's strong showing in the debate, coupled with the major obstacles posed by entering the race this late, have led many Democrats to conclude he's missed his window to be a viable candidate. \nKaufman's letter, distributed to Democratic operatives who worked for Biden in the Senate, in the White House or on his previous presidential campaigns, sent a clear signal that Biden still feels he can be competitive and could well announce a campaign in the coming days. It also served to reinforce the notion that Clinton isn't the only Democrat who could run in part on a promise to lock in policies that Obama has advanced during his two terms. \n\"He believes we must win this election,\" Kaufman said. \"Everything he and the president have worked for — and care about — is at stake.\" \nAs Biden has mulled his decision in recent months, Kaufman and other top Biden staffers have put together a campaign-in-waiting that could be activated quickly if he decides to take the plunge. Kaufman said he wasn't sure whether Biden would run, but that if he did, he would run an \"optimistic campaign.\" \n\"A campaign from the heart. A campaign consistent with his values, our values, and the values of the American people,\" Kaufman said. \"And I think it's fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won't be a scripted affair — after all, it's Joe.\" \n___ \nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:32:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
