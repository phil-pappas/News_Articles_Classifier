And only 6 percent of New Hampshire Republicans picked Bush as their second-choice candidate. Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Rubio and Ted Cruz were all more popular backup choices.\n  Border agent: Illegals 'know that they will be released' \"What we have right now is essentially a catch-and-release policy.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/21/15 1:30 PM Furthermore, Bush is tied with, or led by, Trump in four out of five categories that measured candidates' authenticity, readiness to be president, ability to handle Russian President Vladimir Putin and care for everyday Americans. Thirty-one percent of respondents named Trump the most able to handle Putin while 13 percent named Bush, and Trump beat Bush 18 percent-6 percent as the candidate \"who cares most about people like me.\"\nHowever, voters were more likely to identify Bush over Trump as the most conservative GOP hopeful. Thirteen percent of respondents said Bush leans furthest to the right and 10 percent said Trump. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Tea Party favorite, dominated that category with 26 percent.\nTwo of Bush's most controversial positions, his advocacy for a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants and support for common core, were also more likely to negatively impact voters' perception of him as opposed to going unnoticed. Fifty-three percent of voters said Bush's stance on illegal immigration makes them less supportive of him (42 percent said it has no impact) and 49 percent said they're less likely to support him because of his backing of Common Core.\nMeanwhile, 87 percent of voters said Rubio's age (44) didn't bother them despite the fact he is young compared to the rest of the presidential field. And 68 percent of respondents said Carson's opposition to a Muslim being president had no impact on their support. Nearly 75 percent of voters said Bush's status as the brother and son of former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush does not affect whether or not they support him.\nThe poll of 400 likely voters in New Hampshire's Republican primary was conducted between Oct. 15-18 and contains a margin of error plus or minus 4.9 percent.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Treasury, IRS lay out tax rules for same-sex couples following court ruling With the rules, a marriage of two people of the same sex will also be recognized for federal tax purposes.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/21/15 5:22 PM Top Story GOP lawmakers: Has EPA fired anyone for toxic mine spill?
