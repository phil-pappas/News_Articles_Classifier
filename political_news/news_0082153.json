Contractors will then be able to apply online for a visa for the person being recruited – without having to advertise, go to WINZ or any the other requirements currently causing so much difficulty. \n“As RCNZ will hold the AIP, there are a number of responsibilities placed on us and it will be important that all those contractors who wish to use this scheme comply with all these conditions and requirements,” Mr Levet explains. \n“For starters, there will need to be a written contract between RCNZ and each member company participating in the scheme – to ensure each knows their responsibilities and that RCNZ and other member companies are protected. If these conditions are not complied with, the AIP can be rescinded.” \nThese conditions include that the AIP is only available members of RCNZ and that the contractor or company must also hold Registered Contractor accreditation with national body. \n“This is a safeguard to ensure that the appropriate statutory and regulatory compliances are being met,” Mr Levet explains. “Those applying to the scheme will also have to fully comply with RCNZ’s Code of Ethics and our Code for Employing Overseas Staff.” \nMr Levet adds that – due to the amount of the work involved in setting up the new scheme and the imminent start of the new season – RCNZ aims to have it up and running by 1 June 2016. \nIt is not known exactly how many temporary, overseas workers are needed by rural contractors around each year, but it is thought to be around 900. \n“Every year, in many parts of the country, it’s often impossible for rural contractors to find skilled New Zealanders to carry out this seasonal work,” Mr Levet explains. “That’s why it is necessary for us to look overseas to find experienced people to fill this need.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:12:53.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
