Makeup artist Cyndle Komarovski has a few tricks for getting cat eye that isn't wobbly, crooked, or uneven, and her technique is so good that she even demonstrated the moves on herself. Her first tip is to start with the eye that you consider to be more \"difficult.\" It'll be easier to replicate on your \"good\" eye, she tells me. See below for her favorite liquid eyeliner and other easy tips.\nDot it on.\nStep One: Komarovski likes Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner , which she praises for being a shade that is \"truly black.\" After deciding which eye is your \"bad\" eye, draw a dot on the outside corner indicating how high you want your cat-eye slant to extend. If you aren't sure, trace the curve of your bottom lash line and extend up and out.\nLine it.\nStep Two: Use that dot as a marker and draw a straight line connecting the dot to your lash line. To make it easier to draw in a straight line, gently pull the skin next to your eye taut.\nAdd a second line.\nStep Three: Draw another line below the original and start to connect it to the lower lash line.\nLook for the triangle.\nStep Four: Fill in the triangle of space between your top lash line and your lower line to create the cat-eye flick.\nClean it up.\nStep Five: The secret to super-sharp cat-eye edges is not a steady hand — it's not being afraid to clean things up. Take a Q-tip and dip it into makeup remover, like the Koh Gen Do Cleansing Spa Water , and pull it along the bottom of the line to make a super-clean edge. Komarovski favors an angled Q-tip, like these Slanted Precision Q-Tips , to get an extra-sharp edge.\nClean it up some more.\nStep Six: You can also use the Q-tip along the top to clean up that line.\nCat eye perfection.\nStep Seven: Cat-eye perfection.", "external_links": ["http://www.sephora.com/stay-all-day-waterproof-liquid-eye-liner-P253818", "http://www.sephora.com/cleansing-spa-water-P294007", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005XIM6J2"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:23:23.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
