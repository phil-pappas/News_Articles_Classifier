Of these, 16 were new faces.\nDuring the hustings, party chief Low Thia Khiang praised the East Coast GRC team and the candidate for single-seat Fengshan, saying they were part of the core of the party's next-generation leadership.\nThe other two East Coast GRC candidates - IT consultant Gerald Giam, 37, and sociology professor Daniel Goh, 42 - as well as the party's Fengshan candidate, shipping law firm partner Dennis Tan, 45, are already in the CEC. Mr Tan is also an NCMP, as one of the best performers among those who lost at the elections. He got 42.5 per cent of the vote in Fengshan.\nAt Tuesday's meeting, several CEC members were also appointed to head various sub-committees.\nDr Goh will be the WP's new media chair, taking over from Mr Giam, and Mr Fairoz, its webmaster.\nMr Foo was appointed deputy organising secretary, helping former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian, 37, and Aljunied GRC MP Pritam Singh, 39, both of whom are organising secretaries.\nThe CEC is mid-way through its two-year term after being elected at the Organising Members' Conference in July last year.\nThe last time the CEC co-opted members was in 2013, when it brought in Dr Goh, Mr Tan and Mr Toh Hong Boon, 35, a project coordinator in a global agrochemicals firm. Mr Toh was not elected at last year's party conference.\nAfter the 2011 polls, the WP CEC co-opted Aljunied MPs Chen Show Mao, 54, and Mr Singh, as well as Mr Yee Jenn Jong, 50, who was an NCMP.\nMr Singh recently became chairman of the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:15:47.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
