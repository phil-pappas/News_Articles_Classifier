New Zealand has far too few labour inspectors, with each inspector having to oversee double the number of workers their Australian counterparts have to. \n\"The Governmentâ€™s repeated attacks on unions mean that fewer and fewer people have someone to turn to when their rights at work are breached by their employer. \n\"Labour Day provides the perfect opportunity to focus on the increasing insecurity of work and the difficulty people have securing what ought to be their basic rights. \n\"The Government has allowed a situation to develop where more and more people are reliant on the temporary work offered by labour hire companies. The Minster must make sure this is not just a recipe for greater exploitation,\" Iain Lee-Galloway says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:13:15.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
