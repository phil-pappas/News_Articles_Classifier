Their Medicaid obligations grew by nearly 7 percent, compared with 3.4 percent in states that expanded the program.\nThat's because states across the board saw more people sign up for Medicaid because of increased outreach efforts. In states with Medicaid expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the costs for many of the new enrollees, but states without expansion received only their regular federal match.\n\"States that opted to expand Medicaid saw significant gains in coverage, reductions in the uninsured and access to additional federal funds,\" said Diane Rowland, Kaiser's executive vice president.\nThat trend so far appears to undermine arguments by Republican governors who resisted expanding Medicaid on the grounds that it would saddle their state with unsustainable new costs and crowd out room for spending on other priorities.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have faced criticism in their presidential races from more conservative candidates for choosing to accept Medicaid expansion in their states.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Fed official acknowledges confusion over interest rates 'We probably haven't been doing that well' in communicating, New York Fed president says\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/15/15 12:59 PM Fiscal arguments against Medicaid expansion could hold more water once the federal government stops paying the full cost of the new Medicaid enrollees. The federal match drops to 95 percent in 2017, and then to 90 percent four years later, where it remains indefinitely.\nBut some states with expanded Medicaid have recently issued reports showing that it would be a fiscal loss to their state should they rescind it.\nEarlier this month, an independent consultant in Arkansas reported that ending Medicaid expansion would have a \"substantial cost\" for the state. Even after the federal match starts shrinking in 2017, Arkansas would stand to lose $438 million if it reverted to the traditional Medicaid program, the Stephen Group found.\nA report by Deloitte earlier this year found that Kentucky experienced a net positive impact on its budget by deciding to expand Medicaid.\nStates will have to start chipping in more over the next few years. But when savings from a bigger insured population are realized, they may find it was cheaper to expand Medicaid than not to, some experts say.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner McCarthy warns against Obama's drawdown in Afghanistan \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised President Obama's decision to keep troops in Afghanistan Thursday, but warned against an \"arbitrary drawdown\" in 2016.\nMcCarthy, R-Calif., issued a statement following Obama's Thursday announcement that he was delaying plans to pull all American troops out of Afghanistan by the end of his term.\nInstead, Obama said he would keep nearly 9,800 troops in the region until October 2016 and then cut back to 5,500 troops in early 2017.\nMcCarthy warned against the planned reduction, citing Taliban gains in Afghanistan.\n\"The president should not continue his arbitrary troop drawdown from 9,800 troops to 5,500 in 2016 until conditions on the ground and U.S. national security\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/15/15 12:59 PM \"States will have to put up a share, but I think the net budget savings will continue,\" said Judy Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"I think they now see getting rid of [Medicaid] is going to be a hardship.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:59.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
