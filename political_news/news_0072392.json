Cheryl Grossman, a four-term Republican from Grove City, announced last week that she intends to run for the 16th District held by Sen. Jim Hughes, R-Columbus, who is term-limited.\nBut as she was announcing her run, the Senate GOP Caucus, headed by Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina, was getting out the word on Capitol Square that it is backing two-term Rep. Stephanie Kunze, R-Hilliard, for the seat.\nAlthough the caucus has not made a formal endorsement, sources said the message went out from Faber and others, including Christina Lisotto, the Senate GOP’s chief fundraiser.\nSources speculated that the early caucus backing, which comes well before the county Republican Party has officially weighed in, is designed to keep Grossman from building up a larger fundraising advantage. Grossman had about $150,000 in her campaign account at the end of June, while Kunze had about $38,000.\n“I’ve let it be known that we may endorse Stephanie Kunze,” Faber said. “I thought it was important that I let Cheryl Grossman know that we would make a decision sometime in the near future.”\nThe district covers much of western Franklin County, including Worthington and Grove City. Republican Mitt Romney beat President Barack Obama in the district by nearly 2 percentage points in 2012.\nGrossman said she was not told why the Senate GOP Caucus is backing Kunze, whom she called a “ very nice person.”\n“Based on prior elections, I didn’t think that would happen,” Grossman said of the stance of the caucus.\nGrossman highlighted some of her endorsements from local officials.\n“I’m telling you there are a tremendous number of businesspeople and community leaders that are extremely supportive,” she said.\nFaber said the caucus is looking for the candidate who would best represent the district and has the best chance to win what could be a strongly contested general-election race. No Democratic candidate has joined the race yet.\n>> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

Mike Duffey, R-Worthington, said he considered running for the Senate but instead will run for re-election.\nSenate Republicans have a few other open-seat primary fights on their hands next year.\nIn the 24th Senate District in suburban Cleveland, Rep. Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, recently became the third candidate in a GOP primary that also includes Rep. Nan Baker, R-Westlake, and former state Rep. Matt Dolan, son of Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan.\nSen. Tom Patton, R-Strongsville, who is term-limited from the 24th District, is expected to run for Dovilla’s House seat and has endorsed him in the Senate race.\nA pair of former House members, John Adams and Matt Huffman, will square off in the 12th District in western Ohio to replace Faber, who is term-limited at the end of 2016.\njsiegel@dispatch.com \n@phrontpage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:05:11.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
