The votes clear the way for a vote in the full Senate. It's unclear how much support the bill has in that chamber, however. \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison researchers and private scientists oppose the measure. They argue it could end ground-breaking medical research that relies on fetal tissue cells. Republicans have amended the bill to outlaw research on fetal tissue cell lines obtained from abortions after Jan. 1 of this year, but the researchers say they need new lines. \nThe state's largest business group, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, also opposes the measure. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
