She will return to her normal workload shortly, Escano said. \nAs news of her hospitalization spread throughout the neighborhood, so many people visited the councilwoman that a visitor’s list was made for her at Harlem Hospital. \n“The village of Harlem has supported the CM throughout this time and she is very much thankful for their support and love,” Escano said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:54:43.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
