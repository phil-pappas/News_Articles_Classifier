The Maryland General Assembly last session repealed a law mandating the state's nine largest counties and Baltimore City to collect a fee dedicated specifically to funding stormwater management improvements, and just this week, the Baltimore County Council introduced legislation that would phase out the fee for county residents and businesses over a two-year period. \nSo far, Kittleman has not taken any steps towards getting rid of the fee. Both his transition team and the county's Spending Affordability Committee advised him not to repeal it until he had identified an alternate source for stormwater management projects, which are necessary to meet mandatory federal runoff goals. \nThursday, he said he thinks he's identified an alternate funding source. \n\"I'm cautiously optimistic we'll be able to announce something and roll back the rain tax\" later this year, he said. \nKittleman said he was also working on legislation to modify growth tiers in the county, which limit the density allowed on a parcel based on its location.
