And alliance leaders have scrambled to find ways to react to the Kremlin's more aggressive posture and reassure members of its relevance to their security.\nBut in recent weeks, a number of current and former officials, along with several Russia experts, have warned that Putin's gambit to split the transatlantic compact and redefine international security relationships to Russia's advantage appear to be working.\n\"Before us is emerging one of the premiere strategic challenges of the post-Cold War period,\" said retired Marine Gen. James Jones, a former NATO supreme allied commander in Europe who also served as White House national security adviser from 2009-2010.\n  Pittenger: 'We're a lion with no teeth' \"Tracking this money is just an enormous challenge and this will just compound everything.\"\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/19/15 1:00 AM \"I think it's possibly the beginning of the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I think it's that serious. We just can't sit back and let this happen.\"\nRussia has been building an \"arc of steel,\" a network of bases on the country's outer flanks from the Baltic to the Black Sea aimed at hemming NATO countries in, Adm. Mark Ferguson, chief of NATO's Allied Joint Forces Command Naples and U.S. Navy commander for Europe and Africa, said in an Oct. 6 speech.\nRussian ships and aircraft also have dramatically increased their testing of NATO defenses, even along U.S. borders.\nOne of the alliance's key challenges in meeting the new Russian threat is convincing member states to ramp up defense spending after two decades of a post-Cold War holiday from the Eastern threat that had initially brought its members together.\nIn an Oct. 12 speech to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Norway, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned members that \"once there was a time to collect the peace dividend. But now is the time to invest in our defense.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pass the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act now Bill to reduce suffering of people with untreated serious mental illness has not been brought up for a vote.\nBy Representative Tim Murphy • 10/19/15 12:01 AM \"Deterrence is often seen as some kind of old-fashioned, Cold War concept,\" he added. \"But being strong enough to stop others from attacking you is not old-fashioned. Being strong enough so that your people can go about their business without the fear of war is not old-fashioned. We have strong forces not because we want to fight a war, but because we want to prevent war.\"\nAnother major threat to the alliance's stability is a massive state-run and state-sponsored global media campaign to push the Kremlin's point of view, to which NATO officials have not yet managed an effective response.\nThis information and psychological warfare campaign has even reached into NATO countries. A June poll by the Pew Research Center found that majorities in France, Germany and Italy opposed the idea of using military force to defend another NATO country against Russia. The results pose a grave threat to the principle of collective self-defense that forms the cornerstone of the alliance, and were not seen as reassuring to Eastern European members under Russia's shadow.\n\"We need to employ a much more effective strategy,\" said Heather Conley, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"This is the great challenge of our time and we don't have an effective answer.\"\nThis article appears in the Oct. 19 edition of the Washington Examiner magazine. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner The Sanders-Clinton college cost-shifting plan Democrats like to frame their proposals as one for \"free college tuition,\" but there is no such thing.\nBy Washington Examiner • 10/19/15 12:01 AM Top Story Is the GOP really still a party?
