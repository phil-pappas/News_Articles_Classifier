It has never been more important to vote for people who are committed to changing the way this town has been managed. \nWest Milford has recently been given a report card of sorts in New Jersey Monthly magazine’s poll of the best places to live in the state. This poll ranked West Milford as the 17th worst place to live in New Jersey. The fact remains that we are ranked lower than Paterson, Camden, and Elizabeth. Our ranking is the absolute worst in Passaic County. \nSome council members are dismissing the poll’s ranking of West Milford, saying that our town’s natural beauty should override the criteria used in the poll. Another councilwoman made a baseless and inaccurate claim that our low ranking was due to last year’s fatal bear attack. \nBut something like this cannot be sugarcoated. To long-term residents, the decline is obvious and consistent over the past eight years. Never before have we seen so many foreclosed homes in West Milford, many of which are just rotting away. Our sky-high taxes have driven our property values into the ground, forcing many of our senior citizens to sell their devalued properties for mere survival. We pay a staggering price per student for education in this township and yet no one in either the Board of Education or the teachers’ union are held accountable for the well-below-average performance of our students.\nOur own township and state are to blame for as many of our woes as residents here. It is a fact that West Milford has been less than helpful in cultivating new or old business. Opening or expanding business in town is beyond frustrating and expensive. The township as well as the state has taken many properties off of the tax rolls, leaving us residents to pick up the slack, such as Westbrook Park, Apple Acres, Jungle Habitat, the Johner Building, and the Finn property.\nThe most important thing is that we vote for candidates who at least recognize the problems we face and will put forth an effort to correct the mistakes of the past that have created today’s burdens. I have heard Lou Signorino, Mike Hensley, and Tim Wagner talk about a multitude of these topics and I sincerely believe they will do their best to get the ball rolling in the right direction for West Milford’s residents.\nDave Griffiths, \nHewitt/West Milford", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:26:12.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
