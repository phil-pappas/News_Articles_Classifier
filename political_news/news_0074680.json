At 876 feet tall, the bridge is one of the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and perfect for the sport. For just six hours one day a year, the state allows BASE jumping as part of an annual festival celebrating the bridge.\nEnjoying what is a crime every other day, jumpers free fall from the bridge before parachuting into the gorge, where National Park Service rangers and safety crews provide support--instead of citations--below.\n\"When we do it here one day a year we can monitor it,\" said Dave Bieri, a National Park Service ranger. \"We can make it as safe as we possibly can.\"\nRead More Experience the event and meet the BASE jumpers at the video above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:11:19.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
