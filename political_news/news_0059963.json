(Just kidding about that last part.) \nAugustus Sol Invictus has been a controversial figure in Florida politics, who admitted sacrificing and drinking the blood of a goat as part of a religious ceremony. Shortly beforehand the Chairman of the state Libertarian party resigned. The local committee here in Seminole county disbanded, and two former Libertarians that were running for office changed parties. \n“If I were Catholic, Grayson would not dare criticize me for eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Christ every Sunday.” concludes Invictus.
