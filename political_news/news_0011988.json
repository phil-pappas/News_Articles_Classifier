According to separate cases filed against Gulen affiliated schools, the group has allegedly engaged in systemic abuse of the American visa system, Amsterdam says.\nGlobally, the Gulen network operates thousands of schools. Amsterdam emphasized the need for transparency for the network's operations around the world, including its agreement with the African Union to open 1,000 new schools in the region. \"We cannot entrust an entire generation of children to a group that claims to uphold the 'truth of light,' yet is itself covered in darkness,\" said Amsterdam.\nAmsterdam & Partners LLP, with offices in London and Washington DC , is an international law firm specializing in political advocacy and cross-border disputes. The firm was awarded the Global Pro Bono Dispute of the Year Award by American Lawyer Magazine in 2013.
