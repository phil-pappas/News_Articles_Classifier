When there is a problem it is the youth [that suffers]. \n\"We are pleading for a new and credible voters register,\" Ahmed said, adding they needed to complement the efforts of their leaders who are already demanding for a new register. \nThe Electoral Commission will be meeting representatives of the parties on October 29 to among other things, announce whether or not a new register will be compiled. \nAhmed said they will not accept anything less than a new register. \n\"We want to send our message before the 29... Our next action is that we will do a very serious demonstration in Ghana,\" if the EC decides to use the existing register for the 2016 elections. \nA number of political parties including the Convention People's Party, and Progressive People's Party are all demanding for a new register. \nEven though the governing NDC believes the current register has some challenges, it believes it should be cleaned rather than having a new one compiled. \nThe EC is expected to pronounce on the matter on the 29.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:27:03.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
