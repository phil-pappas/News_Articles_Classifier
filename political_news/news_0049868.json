That's one less person than the party's last meeting because Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker suspended his campaign. \nBillionaire businessman Donald Trump will be front and center at Wednesday's 8 p.m. EDT event alongside fellow outsider Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon. \nOther participants include Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul . \nCNBC will host an \"undercard\" debate at 6 p.m. for those who didn't place in the top 10 in recent national polls.
