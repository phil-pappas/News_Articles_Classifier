CR Magazine's judges considered a number of key metrics including the scope of the CEO's impact on his organization and community, the extent to which the CEO drove this initiative, and the individual reputation or professional risk taken by the CEO.\nUnder Cho's leadership, LG Electronics has further increased its commitment to bringing to market innovative ENERGY STAR® certified products that deliver significant energy savings and lessen the impact on the world around us, while driving consumer awareness about climate change and significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its U.S. operations.\n\"We at CR applaud LG's commitment to introducing innovative products that are developed with the environment in mind,\" said Elliot H. Clark , CEO of SharedXpertise Media LLC, publisher of CR Magazine and co-founder (with the Corporate Responsibility Association) of the COMMIT!Forum , recognized worldwide as the leading event for corporate responsibility practitioners.\n\"Mr. Cho has taken a leading role in advancing a corporate culture in which sustainability is treated as a core business principle. His efforts have been critical in reducing the company's environmental impact while enhancing the quality of life for consumers,\" Clark said.\nIn his relatively short time as CEO of LG Electronics USA (since January 2014 ), Cho has made a major impact on the company and the industry. His vision drove LG's efforts to introduce scores of innovative, energy-efficient products into the U.S. market – including the launch of the first commercially available heat pump dryer in the U.S. – and securing LG's recognition as 2015 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year.\nUnder Cho's leadership, the company has implemented a number of key initiatives in support of LG's industry-leading goal of reducing GHG emissions in its U.S. operations by 50 percent by 2020. Among his other noteworthy achievements, LG has launched a new design for its New Jersey -based North American headquarters – with strong support of conservation groups for the $300 million LEED Platinum green building project.\nEqually significant is the CEO's role in advancing a corporate culture in which sustainability is treated as a core business principle. In short, LG's environmental management and product sustainability strategy focuses on energy, resources and human factors:\nImproving how LG products use energy – by enhancing energy efficiency through reduced power and stand-by power consumption, and reduced CO2 emissions throughout the product lifecycle.\nImproving how LG uses natural resources – by reducing product weight and volume, using more recycled materials, and designing products for easier recycling.\nImproving the human experience – by phasing out hazardous substances and improving the home environment.\n\"This recognition, while humbling to me personally, really reflects LG's progress toward excellence in environmental sustainability,\" Cho said. \"I am honored to accept on behalf of the talented team of men and women at LG USA who share my view that we all have a shared responsibility to protect our planet.\"\nClark said, \"In an era where the greatest pressure is a quarterly drive to deliver financial results, it is impressive to have leading CEOs like Mr. Cho striving toward corporate responsibility. Leaders like these prove that long-term success is comprised of many measures; great social and environmental practices deliver long term profitability and performance in many areas.\"\nCho was honored at CR Magazine's Oct. 22 Responsible CEO of the Year Awards Dinner held at The Roosevelt Hotel in New York City during the 2015 COMMIT!Forum.\nAbout Corporate Responsibility Magazine\nCR Magazine , the leading voice of the corporate responsibility profession, is published by SharedXpertise Media LLC, which also publishes the 100 Best Corporate Citizen's List, which has been ranked one of America's three most-important business rankings, according to PR Week.
