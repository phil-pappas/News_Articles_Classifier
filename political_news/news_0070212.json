After all, the goals of the standards are lofty and noble. Consider what the Common Core website says to explain the purpose of the initiative: State school chiefs and governors recognized the value of consistent, real-world learning goals and launched this effort to ensure all students, regardless of where they live, are graduating high school prepared for college, career, and life. \nIn the 6 years since the program launched, controversy has surrounded it. The latest conflict focuses on a writing lesson plan that Common Core is releasing which critics say puts forth a social and political agenda. The study guide, entitled, \"The Battle Over Gun Control,\" is written by KQED, an affiliate of National Public Radio based in northern California. \nConsider the introduction of the writing lesson plan: \"Moderate gun control\" measures introduced following the Sandy Hook school massacre were deep-sixed by the \"powerful political influence\" of the NRA. Second Amendment advocates say the wording, in supplemental material designed to help teachers plan instruction, frames the debate in a one-sided fashion aimed at influencing young minds. “The issue took center stage in December, when a lone gunman entered an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children and six adults in one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history,” reads an intro from the guide. “Yet, months down the line, the issue remains highly controversial: An attempt to enact moderate new gun control measures this spring was voted down in the Senate, due in part to the powerful political influence of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association.” \nThis lesson plan is just one example of one of the biggest problems with Common Core. Instead of focusing on teaching fundamental principles of reading, math, science, grammar, and writing, creators of the standards are making the most of every opportunity to push their own political, moral, and social agendas. Gun control is not the only issue being promoted. Others include normalizing the homosexual lifestyle, promoting extramarital sexual relationships, and a laundry list of other positions. \nAs more and more of the Common Core standards are launched in school systems across the country, we will see our children pull further and further away from the standards taught to them by their parents. \nThe end goal of the Common Core standards is supposed to be \"graduating high school prepared for college, career, and life.\" We all must ask the same question that Alice Linahan of the alternative media group, Voices Empower, when we decide if we want our children to be taught using these standards: “Does a child get a job because they can read well, write well and have competent math skills, or do they get a job for supporting gay marriage and gun control?” - Alice Linahan, Voices Empower", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:56:07.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
