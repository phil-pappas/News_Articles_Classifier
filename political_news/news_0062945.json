Some of the companies, including Nike, have pledged to power their operations entirely with renewable energy or to reduce their carbon emissions to zero. “The bottom line is this: These commitments show that international action on climate are not only good for our climate but good for the bottom line,” said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president. Todd Brady, global environmental director at Intel, acknowledged Monday morning that his company’s pledge is a combination of prior and new commitments. The administration’s leadership on the issue “has caused us to step back and see if we can do more,” Mr. Brady said. The administration is also using significant new regulations, including the newly released Clean Power Plan, to drive down carbon emissions in the United States over the next 15 years. Republicans have denounced such regulations as job killers that will result in significant costs to both businesses and consumers. By showing that many major businesses are making large reductions in carbon emissions voluntarily while still being profitable, the Obama administration hopes to prove that its new rules will lead to greater economic growth, not less. The administration expects to persuade even more businesses to sign its climate pledge before climate talks in Paris begin in six weeks. Such pledges, Mr. Deese said, “will really help drive the conversation and drive progress going into Paris.” \nFollow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
