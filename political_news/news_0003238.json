When Mills forwarded Nancy Pelosi's announcement calling on Weiner to resign, Clinton responded \"I just sent to you. [REDACTED].\"\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 09/30/15 7:01 PM The only commentary provided by Clinton's aides came in the final email on the topic, sending along a Politico story. The email subject line included the note \"See Doug Reference.\" That referred to longtime Clinton operative Doug Band. The Politico piece included this passage:\nAbedin, reportedly watched his first news conference — in which he acknowledged sending sexually charged text messages and photographs to six women over three years — with her best friend, Doug Band. \nBand, the longtime top aide to President Bill Clinton, and his wife served as counselors to Abedin as the scandal unfolded, despite what was described as revulsion with her husband for what he'd done. Abedin returned from a trip to Africa with her boss, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. It's not yet clear what effect she had on his decision to step down. \nThe Clintons, who consider Abedin a \"second daughter,\" made clear their disgust with Weiner. But they also articulated clear support for his wife, while not engaging the congressman on what he should do (a report that the former president urged Weiner to leave office, sources said, was untrue). \n\"They are livid,\" said one source affiliated with Hillary Clinton. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Israelis 'always sound cocky' Clinto replied to an email thread by saying Israelis \"always sound cocky — in the air and on the ground.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 09/30/15 6:49 PM Timothy P.
