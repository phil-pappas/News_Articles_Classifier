It didn't disclose a time period for the investment, but said it will start making advanced memory chips that can store data without using up power, called 3D NAND chips, in second-half 2016.\nThe move follows a flurry of deals in the global semiconductor industry, highlighting growing importance of the memory chips used to store data in increasingly popular mobile devices. Researcher TrendForce predicts China will consume $6.67 billion worth of NAND chips this year, or 29 percent of global NAND industry revenue.\nBuilding a chip industry of its own has been deemed of strategic importance by China in its drive to modernise its economy. Intel's new investment follows a deal last year to buy 20 percent stake of two mobile chipmakers owned by state-backed Tsinghua Holdings Co Ltd.\nFor its part Tsinghua recently announced a plan to buy a 15 percent stake in US data storage company Western Digital Corp for $3.8 billion.\nIn separate deals, Western Digital is also in advanced talks to acquire US memory chipmaker SanDisk Corp, while Tsinghua is also trying to acquire Micron, though this deal is facing regulatory scrutiny.\nIntel's latest move raises concerns that new memory supply from the chipmaker could undercut margins for leading industry players like South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and SK Hynix Inx, and Japan's Toshiba Corp.\nAnalysts have said that healthy profits for the industry in recent quarters come partly due to careful capacity management among the dominant players.\nShares of SK Hynix fell 5.7 percent on Wednesday on concerns about the firm's outlook. The South Korean firm is due to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\"SK Hynix needs to boost competitiveness for its NAND business but these issues are creating problems for the company,\" said Hana Financial Investment analyst Rokho Kim.\n business companies Intel Also Read India's sugar output to be 24.8 MT: USDA Amul to invest Rs 4,000-4,500 crore in two years on expansion Job market finally hots up GMR signs an agreement to develop Filipino airport", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Intel%20CPU_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Intel%20CPU_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/business-companies/article/intel-says-may-invest-55-billion-china-memory-chip-plant", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:27:18.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
