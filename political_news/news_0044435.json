A respected local Democrat running to replace him. An enthusiastic governor, also a Democrat, backing her campaign.\nIn a different year, or a different part of New York, those ingredients might have added up to a bonanza for Democrats. The party has aimed to take control of the State Senate in the 2016 elections, with a presidential campaign pulling voters to the polls and Republican incumbents on the defensive over a wave of ethics investigations targeting the Legislature.\nBut the special election in the economically distressed Southern Tier region along the Pennsylvania border has instead become an early barometer of voters’ disgust with state government — and perhaps a reality check for Democrats who hope to compete in rural parts of New York in 2016.\nTo compete after the resignation of Senator Thomas W. Libous, who was convicted in July of lying to federal investigators, both parties drafted candidates who have positioned themselves as political reformers. Barbara Fiala, 71, a former Broome County executive who served in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s cabinet, seemed to give Democrats their best chance to compete in the conservative-leaning district.\nPhoto Barbara Fiala, 71, a Democrat who served in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s cabinet, is running in a special election in the Southern Tier region of New York. Credit Andrew Thayer/Press & Sun-Bulletin But with the Nov. 3 vote approaching, even Ms. Fiala acknowledged that her bid has been largely overpowered by a Republican advertising campaign that has cast her opponent, a comparatively obscure law enforcement official named Fred Akshar, as a chainsaw-wielding political outsider eager to do battle in Albany.\nThe only public survey of the race, a Time Warner/ Siena College poll released in late September, showed Mr. Akshar leading by 28 percentage points.\nMs. Fiala has tried to highlight her achievements in Broome County, branding herself in campaign materials as “the real choice for change in Albany.”\nBut she lamented that in the current environment, voters seemed to recoil from her experience in government. Republicans have assailed her for her tenure leading the State Department of Motor Vehicles under Mr. Cuomo, whose popularity has fallen steadily upstate.\nAdvertisement\n “They don’t trust government; they don’t trust their politicians; they don’t trust Albany,” Ms. Fiala said of the voters, adding, “I have a good track record as county executive, and we’ve tried to bring that out in our message.”\nThe same poll exposed undiscriminating distaste for New York’s political leaders: About three in five voters said they had an unfavorable view of both Mr. Cuomo and the Republican-held State Senate. Fifty-six percent had a negative view of Mr. Libous.\nRobert Blizzard, a pollster who advises Senate Republicans and the Akshar campaign, said Republicans had succeeded in making the race “a contrast between an Albany insider and a fresh face.”\nMr. Cuomo’s diminished standing in the district, he said, has also helped the Republican cause in the contest to serve the remainder of Mr. Libous’s unexpired term.\n“Clearly, anything with ‘Albany’ attached to it is toxic,” Mr. Blizzard said.\nAdvertisement\n Ms. Fiala has tried mightily to puncture Mr. Akshar’s aura of novelty; last week, she held a news conference to release a State Police report from 2009 that she said implicated Mr. Akshar, 36, in having “covered up a domestic violence incident” involving a nephew of his longtime girlfriend.\nIn the report, Mr. Akshar, a Broome County undersheriff, is portrayed as having helped retrieve the nephew from the scene of a car crash — which the nephew’s girlfriend accused him of deliberately causing while under the influence of alcohol — before the authorities could investigate.\nThe episode, Ms. Fiala said, revealed Mr. Akshar’s flawed character. “I do know corruption when I see it,” she said.\nMr. Akshar denied that he did anything improper in the matter and said at a brief news conference that a review cleared him of wrongdoing. But his aides declined to make him available for an interview.\nThe Republican has run a tightly controlled campaign operation, rarely speaking to the news media and leaning on television advertising and paid political mail to communicate his message. The Akshar campaign denied a reporter’s request to observe the taping of a television debate last week.\nPhoto Fred Akshar, 36, a Republican, has been portrayed in his advertising campaigns as a political outsider eager to do battle in Albany. Credit Andrew Thayer/Press & Sun-Bulletin State Senate Republicans have given muscular financial support to Mr. Akshar’s campaign: At the start of the month, they reported sending him nearly $200,000 in contributions from their political committee and from the individual campaign accounts of several lawmakers.\nMr. Akshar has channeled that money mainly into television commercials, spending nearly a quarter-million dollars on ads, according to his campaign finance report — nearly three times Ms. Fiala’s television spending.\nBijoy Datta, the chairman of the Broome County Republican Party who speaks frequently for Mr. Akshar, said Republicans had blunted any backlash over Mr. Libous’s downfall by recruiting a youthful candidate with a background in the sheriff’s office.\n“There’s no question that there’s a clear differentiation, when you have a guy who has such a stellar record like Fred, who comes from law enforcement,” said Mr. Datta, a former political aide to Mr. Libous.\nIf that political model appears to be working for Republicans in the 52nd District, in a special election campaign fought over inexpensive airwaves, the party is likely to face a far taller order replicating that approach in 2016.\nIndeed, in 2016, Democrats are eager to apply nearly the same messaging — outsiders challenging insiders, candidates channeling revulsion with Albany — in races with entrenched Republican senators on the ballot, defending more diverse and suburban districts across the state.\nSince Mr. Libous’s resignation, Republicans hold 31 seats in the 63-seat Senate chamber — short of a majority, but their numbers have been padded by six senators who were elected as Democrats but caucus with Republicans.\nIn addition to the seat held by Mr. Libous, one other Senate district is on the ballot this fall: a seat based in Brooklyn that was previously held by John L. Sampson, a Democrat convicted in July in a corruption trial.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n Democrats are expected to easily retain that seat.\nSenator Michael N. Gianaris, who leads the Democratic campaign committee, said the party was looking forward to putting Republicans on the defensive over what voters widely perceive as a broken Legislature.\n“Next year is going to be a very favorable environment for Democrats running against Republican incumbents, who have been part of the problem in Albany for so long,” said Mr. Gianaris, from Queens. “And a presidential election is widely known to increase Democratic turnout, so that should also work in our favor.”\nMs. Fiala, too, said she could imagine a more inviting political environment in 2016, when the Libous seat comes up for re-election. Should she lose this time, Ms. Fiala said, she could consider a second try.\nA longtime Broome County politician who started her career in the Civil Service, Ms. Fiala entered the special election early in the summer, after Mr. Libous’s resignation.\nShe had spoken in the past to Senate Democrats about potentially seeking the seat, but the campaign accelerated quickly after Mr. Cuomo declared in a radio interview that Ms. Fiala was the best possible Democrat to run there.\nMs. Fiala, who said she had not requested a campaign visit from Mr. Cuomo, called the governor’s endorsement a testament to her abilities.\n“I was part of his cabinet,” she said. “He knows my work ethic. He knows what I can do. He knows I know government.”\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
