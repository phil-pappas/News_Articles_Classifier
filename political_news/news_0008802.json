Facebook Tori Jo Carlson hardly looks like the kind of person to terrorize a neighborhood.\nBut that's precisely what members of the Thornton Police Department believe the 22-year-old did.\nCarlson, whose Facebook page lists her place of employment as the Tilted Kilt (and includes several photos that appear to have been taken at the venue), was arrested earlier this week on suspicion of kidnapping, burglary and more after allegedly threatening a number of residents at gunpoint and briefly taking control of a child, age four.\nThe Facebook gallery for Carlson features a number of provocative pics, including this one....\nTori Jo Carlson.

CBS4 Rather than attempting to bust in, Carlson is said to have entered a second home and pointed a gun at the man inside. He, too, was able to simply extricate himself from the situation, taking refuge in another room and locking the door — and she left on her own.\nMoments later, Carlson allegedly entered a third home, this time occupied by a woman named Melanie Clements, who was watching a friend's four-year-old.\n“She pointed a gun at my chest, cussing and screaming that she was going to kill me,” Clements told the station. “She kept cussing and yelling, ‘You know what I want, you know what I want.'\"\nActually, Clements didn't have the slightest clue what Carlson wanted — but after an extended conversation, she managed to convince the intruder to put down her gun.\nFinally, Carlson received a phone call, and as she answered it, she briefly left the home with the child. However, Clements was able to grab the four-year-old, take him back into the house and lock the door. Thornton police arrested Calrson a short time later.\nAt last report, Carlson, who lacks a previous criminal record, was in custody on a $50,000 bond.
