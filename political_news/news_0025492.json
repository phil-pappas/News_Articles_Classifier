We don’t even appear to be making great gains on trade which is vital for us. \n\"Leaks suggest the secrecy around the negotiations is hiding some aspects that will damage our sovereignty, open up Pharmac drug buying decisions to the drug makers and leave the government open to compensation claims from big foreign corporations. \n\"We must question why Ms Clark is stepping outside her own boundaries about not commenting on New Zealand domestic policy. \n\"She is also ignoring UN’s special rapporteurs who said they were concerned about the TPPA on many grounds including healthcare and democracy. They wanted the impact on human rights assessed before signing.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:36:01.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
