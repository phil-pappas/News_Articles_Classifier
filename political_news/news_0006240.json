(AP) - Three legislative seats up for grabs next month in New York state are vacant because their previous occupant was brought down by corruption. \nYet the candidates who hope to replace them say corruption rarely surfaces in conversations with voters, many of whom aren’t even aware of who their representatives in Albany are, or that they get a chance to vote Nov. 3. \n“People are fuming over the cost of taxes, utilities,” said Jeffrey Ferretti, a Republican who faces Democratic Assemblywoman Roxanne Persaud in a Brooklyn Senate race to replace former Democratic Minority Leader John Sampson, who was convicted of lying to FBI agents. “A lot of people tell me they don’t even know who Sampson is.” \nSpecial elections in off-years are typically low-turnout affairs. Two Senate and three Assembly races will be decided. On Staten Island, voters will choose a new district attorney. \nIn the state’s Southern Tier along the Pennsylvania line, Republican Fred Akshar and Democrat Barbara Fiala are vying for the seat held for more than a quarter-century by Thomas Libous. Libous was the Senate’s No. 2 Republican when he was convicted this summer of lying to federal agents investigating his son’s high-paying job at a politically connected law firm. \nAkshar, Broome County undersheriff, and Fiala, a former Broome County executive and state motor vehicles commissioner, said corruption does come up in conversations with voters, but that the primary issue in the campaign is the area’s struggling economy. \n“Sen. Libous did a lot of good for the people in the 52nd District,” Akshar said. “But at the end of the day the justice system has spoken and we need to move forward.” \nThe district is heavily Republican and Fiala concedes it’s an uphill battle. \n“It’s jobs, jobs, jobs,” she said when asked what is on the mind of the voters she talks to. Corruption comes up too, often in the context of a general distaste for state politics in general. “People are disillusioned about Albany and you can see why.” \nVoters in a Queens Assembly district will pick a new representative after longtime Democratic Assemblyman William Scarborough was sentenced to 13 months in jail last month for raiding his campaign fund for personal use and submitting at least $40,000 in false expense vouchers for days he didn’t actually travel to Albany. \n“The legislators here have been in office for an extended period of time and haven’t been able to deliver for the community,” said Republican candidate Scherie Murray, whose background is in media production and journalism. “It’s imperative to change the status quo.” \nWith the GOP holding a razor-thin majority in the state Senate, an upset in either race could have wider implications. The GOP holds 31 seats in the 63-member Senate - though they maintain control thanks to the support of six breakaway Democrats. \nAlicia Hyndman, a state Department of Education employee and member of her local Community Education Council, said Scarborough doesn’t come up that often in conversations with voters. \n“It’s an off year,” she said of the special election. “Some people think I’m running for Congress. Some people don’t know that Assemblyman Scarborough isn’t in the seat anymore.” \nAlbany’s corruption problem has shaken the public’s faith in state government - and is likely to blame for low voter interest, according to Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director of the League of Women Voters of New York State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:10:00.619+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
