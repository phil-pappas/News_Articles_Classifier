It’s going to be lawmaking, with an authentic frontier ambiance. \n“I expect that, because the open carry people did it the last time,” says Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, the committee chairman and co-sponsor of Senate bill 442. \nIn Michigan, a woman can’t carry a small purse into UM’s Big House but she can wear a handgun on her hip in the state Capitol. \nThis situation is being reviewed today, but not in the way you might think. \nToday’s hearing ought to be controversial because the bill would enable any licensed gun owner to carry concealed guns into what are now “pistol free zones” – schools, day care centers, hospitals, sports arenas, even college dormitories. Similar legislation passed in Georgia last year, where the bill was cheerfully marketed as “Guns Everywhere.” \nOnly a few weeks after nine students were mowed down at an Oregon community college, Michigan legislators are hoping to pass a law that will allow guns in schools and day care centers. “It’s basically splitting the gun groups,” says state Sen. Steven Bieda, the only Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee. \nBut what’s upsetting the gun-on-their-belt crowd isn’t loosening the restrictions on where you can carry guns. It’s a provision in the bill that would prevent open carry in those same zones. A legal loophole now permits open carry. \nJones, a solid gun-rights advocate, is backing the bill, which is causing a ruckus in the gun-rights community. \nThis is a battle between those who want guns everywhere and those who want concealed guns almost everywhere. Both sides are well-organized and prepared to take names and vote accordingly. \nThose who are disturbed by the prospect of guns carried into more places aren’t well-funded or particularly well-organized. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, likely Michigan’s largest advocate for gun regulation, has no paid staff members in Michigan. Its volunteer chapter leader, Kristen Moore, who teaches math at UM, says a big part of the group’s mission is “volunteer engagement,” and said she hopes the senators will see real “boots on the ground opposition” from Moms Demand Action, which wants to see universal background checks. \nJones is bringing in John Lott, a national hero to gun advocates, to testify on behalf of the bill. Moms Demand Action will have a local mom speak. \nBut Bieda, who wants to see gun laws tightened, says the opposition to guns isn’t apparent. “After a shooting, I get calls,” he says. “But in the last few days I have heard from a lot of gun advocates who have mixed feelings.” \nWhen we spoke Monday, he hadn’t heard from Moms Demand Action, and his thoughts echoed those of President Obama, frustrated, after the Sept. 30 Oregon shootings and the increasing routine of mass shootings. \nIt would be nice, he said, to hear from those opposed to the very arguable Lott dictum of “more guns, less crime.” “It’s amazing that people haven’t risen up to say, ‘We have to do something about this,’” says Bieda. \nWe do. 5 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1RDIbAd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:51:43.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
