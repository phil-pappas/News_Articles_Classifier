At 43, he is the second-youngest politician to be elected the nation's leader and will be presiding over the most diverse parliament in several years.\n But Trudeau is notable for another reason, as well: He is an outspoken advocate for women's rights , including aboriginal women. This is a stark contrast from Harper, whose administration has hampered women's rights by slashing funding for federal organizations that promote gender equality, and who was notably absent from a national debate on women's issues in September. He said in 2014 that the disproportionately high murders and disappearances of aboriginal girls and women \"isn't really high on our radar, to be honest.\" ​\nMore From Cosmopolitan Trudeau, on the other hand, vocally supports women's rights and has even labeled himself a feminist. \"My mom raised me to be a feminist,\" he said at the September debate that Harper declined to attend. \"My father raised me, he was a different generation but he raised me to respect and defend everyone's rights, and I deeply grounded my own identity in that, and I am proud to say that I am a feminist.\"\nI am a feminist. I’m proud to be a feminist. #upfordebate\n— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) September 21, 2015\nTrudeau has also prioritized aboriginal (First Nation) girls and women, ​who make up just 4.3 percent of the population but 16 percent of homicide victims in Canada. \"We will build a renewed relationship with indigenous peoples on a nation to nation basis,\" he said days ago . \"That will include, for example, a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. It will include $2.6 billion over four years for First Nations education.\" ​\nTrudeau's government may fight harder for reproductive rights as well. ​In May, Trudeau announced that all members of parliament in the Liberal Party would be expected to support a woman's right to choose . ​ Harper, too, has made it clear that he does not want to reopen the abortion debate, but Maclean's notes that Harper's administration has shied away from using \"foreign aid funds ...to provide access to abortion.\" Maclean's reported, \"T he Harper government has been careful to ensure its maternal health initiative and even its funding of Planned Parenthood avoided abortion. The Liberals, on the other hand, 'believe that the full range of reproductive health services must be included in government aid for maternal health.'\"\n​\"I am perfectly comfortable with Canadians knowing that the Liberal Party is unequivocal in its defense of women's rights,\" Trudeau said. \"We are the party of the Charter. We are the party that stands up for people's rights. We will continue to do so.\" ​\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/canada-aboriginal-women-murder-homicide-police", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/20/justin-trudeau-canada-new-prime-minister-liberals", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/the-closing-of-the-canadian-mind.html", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/stephen-harper-s-comments-on-missing-murdered-aboriginal-women-show-lack-of-respect-1.2879154", "https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/646103864454713344", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/upfordebate?src=hash", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-100-days-1.3276219", "http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/study-says-canadas-three-major-parties-are-fielding-more-visible-minority-candidates", "http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-defends-abortion-position-after-graphic-flyers-target-liberal-leader-1.2371906", "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/a-matter-of-life-and-death/", "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/why-stephen-harper-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-womens-issues/", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.macleans.ca/politics/on-abortion-is-there-any-difference-between-harper-and-trudeau/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/planned-parenthood-s-canadian-funding-renewed-1.981977"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:56:27.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
