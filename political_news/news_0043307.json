Has he carried through on that promise?\nYes, according to payroll data requested by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune. From June 17 to Sept. 1, Lewis:\nCut the central office staff from 168 employees to 161 Grew staffing at the six network schools from 396 to 435 Increased the total number of employees from 645 to 677 The smaller of the city's two public school systems monitors 18 charters and directly runs six schools: Mary Bethune Elementary, Benjamin Franklin Elementary, Mahalia Jackson Elementary, Eleanor McMain Secondary and McDonogh No. 35 Academy and College Preparatory. The state oversees New Orleans' other 50-plus charters, mostly through the Recovery School District.\nThe staff changes will affect spending. Salaries at network schools increased by $1.5 million to $18.1 million, while central office salaries fell by about $340,000 to $8.9 million. These figures include part-time employees and those paid by federal grants, not local and state taxes.\nLewis started the superintendent's job in March , ending a 2½-period of interim leadership in the school system. He redesigned the central office into an outfit focused on supporting schools instead of running them.\nThe network schools needed more staff due to enrollment increases, executive director of administration Blake Stanfill said Monday (Oct. 19). In addition, a number of central office employees, then and now, spend most of their time at schools; more than 40 people work on services for gifted and disabled students, for instance.\nThe salary changes are even larger than the new data suggest because they don't factor in two high-ranking employees who left the school system after Lewis started work. Longtime chief academic officer Rosalynne Dennis retired in May with a $145,000 salary. And Michelle Orillon, the departing executive director of information technology, was still being paid part-time in September as she trained her successor, said chief administrative officer Michelle Blouin-Williams.\nHenderson Lewis' changes to Orleans schools staffing and salaries June staff June salary Sept. staff Sept. salary Change, staff Change, salary Total 645 $27,740,387.88 677 $29,072,733.22 32 $1,332,345.34 Central office 168 $9,242,186.29 161 $8,900,420.10 -7 -$341,766.19 Six network schools 396 $16,619,474.91 435 $18,129,073.01 39 $1,509,598.10 Source: Orleans Parish School Board Lewis spoke in June about cutting positions over the summer, but he wouldn't say which employees might come or go. In the end, about 20 central office staffers left. They include Dennis; deputy superintendent Kathleen Padian; disadvantaged business program director Armer Bright, since convicted for his role in a kickback scheme; financial analyst Cynthia Grace; and Margaret Abadie of the student information team.\nThe highest-ranking additions included Blouin-Williams; Stanfill; Margaret Griffon, in the new position of executive director for network schools; and Thomas Lambert, a director on the performance and accountability team. Lewis also has a new secretary, Sharon Hunter , who replaced Sharon Butler this fall, Stanfill said.\nAs Lewis said in September, some staffers changed jobs. For instance, the top two officials in the now-disbanded curriculum division now work on the network schools and federal programs teams, with the same salary.\nMary Garton, brought on by Lewis in March to help with the transition, was officially hired as chief portfolio officer and bumped up $46,000 to more than $130,000. Two key deputies in the charter school office, Sean Perkins and Colleston Morgan, were promoted and received pay raises to bring their salaries up to about $95,000.\nVeteran employee Armand Devezin remains on staff but with a lower salary. As interim chief of staff during the 2½ year interregnum, he made $135,000. He now is paid almost $104,000 as executive director of human resources, making him still one of the highest-paid employees in the system.\nHunter, Blouin-Williams and Garton all came straight from Jefferson public schools , which has gone through its own changes since a new School Board and superintendent came in.\nThe central office has one major vacancy remaining: an executive director of facilities, Blouin-Williams said. Lewis has predicted more changes in the future .\nOrleans Parish School Board's 15 highest-paid officers, Sept. 2015 First Name Last Name Job Annual Salary Henderson Lewis Superintendent/chief executive $180,000 Michelle Blouin-Williams Chief administrative officer $145,707 Stanley Smith Chief financial officer $145,707 Mary Garton Chief portfolio officer $131,971 Edward Morris Chief counsel $126,000 Wayne Delarge Executive director, finance $109,751 Armand Devezin Executive director, human resources $103,586 Gail Audrict Executive director, network schools $101,873 Gregory Becnel Director, finance $95,194 Nicolette London Executive director, federal programs $95,021 Margaret Griffon Executive director, network schools $95,021 Blake Stanfill Executive director, administration $94,337 Leslie Rey Executive director, finance $94,337 Colleston Morgan Executive director, performance and accountability $94,337 Sean Perkins Executive director, portfolio management $94,337 Source: Orleans Parish School Board\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said that Bright had been sentenced and that Abadie worked in information technology.", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hApDWNQizsb84gutuX3O7DX7jQfFeBZCtJfY2CLwnII/pubhtml?widget=true&headers=false"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:05:28.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
