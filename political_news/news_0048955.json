Today, Tata is expected to announce up to 1200 job cuts; 800 are due to go in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, with another 400 at plants in Dalzell in Motherwell and Clydebridge in Cambuslang.\nYesterday, Caparo went into administration. Unite, the trade union, said 1700 jobs were threatened at the firm, owned by Labour Peer Lord Paul, which has plants across the UK, but mainly in the West Midlands.\nTony Burke, assistant general secretary at Unite, said: \"Government ministers need to ask themselves. How many more steel firms need to go to the wall before they step in and support the UK's steel industry?\nPromoted stories \"Failure to act urgently could lead to a 'domino effect' taking hold across the industry, leading to the loss of yet more skilled jobs as firms buckle under a combination of steel 'dumping' and high energy costs.”\nDowning Street made clear the Prime Minister would raise the dumping of cheap Chinese steel onto the European market, blamed for the crisis in the UK industry, at his talks with President Xi, denying that the Conservative Government was “kowtowing\" to Beijing for the sake of commercial deals and stressing “nothing is off the table in our discussions with the Chinese”.\nIn the Commons, Mr Cameron told Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that the Government would do “everything we can to help our steel industry” and stressed: \"Will we raise it with the Chinese? Of course, we'll raise all these issues. That is what our relationship with China is all about.\n\"It is at such a high level that there is no subject off the table and all of these issues, including the steel industry, of course will be discussed.\"\nTom Blenkinsop, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, attacked the PM over the Government's record on helping the steel industry.\n\"Is the reason the Prime Minister didn't raise the steel crisis because he is embarrassed that his own carbon floor tax makes us less competitive than our EU allies, that he personally has failed to act on Chinese dumping unlike our EU and US allies, and that he personally rejected calls to request European global adjustment funds for over 5000 directly affected steelworkers?\"\nMr Cameron replied: \"I don't see any point in trying to play politics over this issue. The British Government is doing everything that we can and every issue that we can take up, we will.\"\nHe then urged MPs to \"work with us and we will do everything we can to help these industries\".\nThe expected closure of the last steelworks in Scotland, at Cambuslang and Motherwell, will bring to an end almost 150 years of the industry in the country.\nAt its peak, steelmaking employed more than 10,000 people in plants and surrounding businesses in central Scotland with the famous Ravenscraig site once the biggest producer of hot-strip steel in Europe.\nThe industry was the centre of many Lanarkshire communities and Motherwell Football Club still use the nickname \"the Steelmen\" in tribute to the workers who supported them.\nShare article The steel industry worked closely with shipbuilding - Scotland's other famous heavy industry - supplying the metals for construction but as a downturn on the Clydeside yards took hold, the steelworks soon followed.\nAround 400 jobs remain in the two threatened Tata plants.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:57:20.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
