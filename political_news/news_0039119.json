(AP) - Advocates of open government are criticizing the city of Sioux Falls for keeping secret the details of a $1 million settlement with Denny Sanford Premier Center contractors regarding bulging metal siding. \nCity officials announced the settlement Sept. 18, just two weeks after saying they were going to sue. \nThe city attorney’s office rejected a request by the Argus Leader (http://argusne.ws/1Nra7G7 ) to see the agreement, saying terms of the deal prohibit its public disclosure. \nArgus Leader Media attorney Jon Arneson says agreeing to keep details from the public isn’t in the best interest of taxpayers. \nIssues with the bulging panels began even before the $117 million events center opened a year ago. The city says the problem is one of aesthetics - an investigation concluded the metal siding is structurally sound. \n___ \nInformation from: Argus Leader, http://www.argusleader.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:17:11.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
