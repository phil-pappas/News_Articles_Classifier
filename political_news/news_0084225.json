Everybody loved everybody.\n‘‘A tribute to Jay [Cutler],’’ coach John Fox said of his quarterback, who played with a bad hamstring.\n‘‘I think he did a great job of orchestrating the offense,’’ tackle Kyle Long said of teammate Matt Slauson, who filled in for injured center Will Montgomery. He added that Slauson ‘‘is a really bright guy.’’\nCutler said Long ‘‘battled all game long.’’\nTight end Martellus Bennett ‘‘has been a big part of making sure this ship stays on course,’’ Fox said.\n‘‘The defense gave us chance after chance after chance,’’ Slauson said, conserving energy by praising 11 men at once.\nBut as the metaphors and bouquets flew wildly, one man — Cutler — kept getting more than his share.\nPlaying in only his second full game of the season after straining a hamstring in Week 2 against the Cardinals, Cutler completed 28 of 43 passes for 281 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. His 89.4 passer rating was good but not great. That’s what a pick will do to you.\nStill, he led the Bears back from his own mini-disasters, which included a fourth-quarter interception that helped the Raiders take a 20-19 lead, and engineered a two-minute comeback that culminated in a game-winning 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould.\nMaybe that’s like a baseball pitcher letting the other team take the lead so he can come back and get the victory, but it counts.\nAnd other than a lost snap from center and a few bad throws, Cutler did nicely, considering he is without his best receiver from last season (Brandon Marshall) and maybe his two best from this season (Alshon Jeffery and rookie Kevin White).\nIt sure was better than another Jimmy Clausen game, which I’m not sure anyone deserves to see again.\nCutler clearly was limited in his mobility, but he did dodge enough pressure in the pocket to keep from getting sacked more than the three times he did.\n‘‘If I had to break contain or move a little bit more, it might have been dicey,’’ Cutler said. ‘‘But in that five-yard little box, I felt fine.’’\nHaving seen Clausen for a game and a half makes us appreciate how much talent Cutler has. His arm strength, his knowledge and his visual skills are elite.\nBut when he threw that interception at what seemed to be precisely the wrong time, that’s when fans at Soldier Field slapped their heads in frustration. We’ve seen that act before.\nBut there was redemption for many in this game, including Gould, who missed an extra point, then made 54- and 49-yard field goals in the fourth quarter; and receiver Marquess Wilson, who dropped a pass with a minute to go, then caught a tough one for a first down two plays later.\nCutler’s seven-yard completion to Bennett on fourth-and-five with 90 seconds left was about as big as it gets. Bennett’s stats (11 catches, 83 yards, one touchdown) speak for themselves.\nBut, naturally, Bennett needs no one putting words in his mouth because words gush from that orifice like water from a hose.\nAs to whether Cutler gets enough credit, Bennett said: ‘‘I give him enough credit. . . . Like I said, they threw stones at Jesus, and Jesus was an excellent guy who did a lot of awesome stuff.’’\nTotally.\nSo Jay’s back?\n‘‘There’s some things that Jay can do that other quarterbacks can’t do,’’ Bennett said. ‘‘It’s a little bit of everything. Like Flacco from ‘The Replacements.’ Falco, not Flacco. No offense to [Ravens quarterback Joe] Flacco. He’s good, too. I’m talking about Falco.’’\nWhat the hell?\nOh, of course, the Keanu Reeves character in ‘‘The Replacements.’’\nBut the true lovefest was between Cutler and the new coaching regime.\n‘‘This is the best coaching staff I’ve been around,’’ said Cutler, who has been around a few.\n‘‘My hat’s off to his toughness,’’ Fox gushed.\nOurs are, too.\nAnd this being Chicago, if Cutler plays poorly next week against the Chiefs, we’ll put them on again.\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander.\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:08:19.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
