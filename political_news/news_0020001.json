Along with personally identifiable information, this document includes personal information about his health, criminal history, questions about whether he's used drugs and associations with foreign governments.\nOther documents, such as a letter from the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, a congressional bill from 2008 that would limit interrogation techniques, and a intelligence policy paper were also published but offered little insight into the inner workings of the intelligence community.\nThe hackers, who claim to have illegally accessed Brennan's personal server last week, are believed to have supplied WikiLeaks with this information and are threatening to release more documents.\nRead More \"The hacking of the Brennan family account is a crime and the Brennan family is the victim,\" the CIA said in a statement. \"The private electronic holdings of the Brennan family were plundered with malicious intent and are now being distributed across the web. This attack is something that could happen to anyone and should be condemned, not promoted. There is no indication that any the documents released thus far are classified. In fact, they appear to be documents that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess.\"\nWikiLeaks tweeted late Wednesday afternoon that it planned to release more emails from Brennan.\n\"Tomorrow we continue our @CIA chief John Brennan email series, including on US strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. #AfPak #CIA,\" the group said.\nTomorrow we continue our @CIA chief John Brennan email series, including on US strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. #AfPak #CIA\nâ€” WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 21, 2015 Follow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CIA", "https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/656945668418859012", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/CIA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AfPak?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:41:47.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
