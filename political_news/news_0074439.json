Thirteen of Clubs (CC by SA-2.0) Who knew organic kale could be so controversial?\nNext Tuesday, the Seward Co-op plans to open its \"Friendship\" store in south Minneapolis. But not everyone is thrilled about high-end produce coming to 38th Street and 3rd Avenue.\nAn online petition with more than 1,000 signatures bills the healthy-hippie grocer as a sign of gentrification and wants the co-op to negotiate a “community benefits agreement.” Launched by Marcus Harcus under the banner of the Central Area Neighborhood Development Organization (CANDO) and the Bryant Neighborhood Organization, the petition states that the co-op would be unaffordable to many residents and its staff would not reflect the neighborhood's diversity.\nA Tuesday press conference was nixed hours ahead of time as the sides had yet to iron out certain details of a planned statement.\nStill, Doyle says the co-op was already working toward similar goals internally. The Seward fairly recently upped its low-income discount and made a push to diversify its ranks at its Franklin Avenue location and new Co-op Creamery restaurant, where prices include built-in tips designed to help staff earn livable wages. Currently, more than 60 percent of Friendship store employees are people of color.\n“Our mission is to sustain a healthy community,” he says. “We work towards building agreement more than anything else.”\nWhile co-ops have gone from bohemian enterprise to foodie cachet, the longtime co-op worker says was surprised the Seward was pinned with the gentrification tag. Any time the co-op has moved or expanded, Doyle says there’s been some tension. Just not usually this much.\n“We didn’t understand and realize the degree of concerns around” broader changes in the neighborhood, he says.\nContact: Michael Rietmulder Follow: @mrietmulder ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/mrietmulder", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:28:55.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
