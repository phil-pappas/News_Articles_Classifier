We are already working with the Koreans on a number of joint research projects, such as human digital interaction for immersive 4D home entertainment and Antarctic research. \nThis type of international collaboration and investment broadens the capacity of our science system and ensures New Zealand remains at the forefront of new developments,\" Mr Joyce says. \nThe visit to Korea follows the Prime Minister’s visit to Seoul in March, and a visit to Auckland by the Korean Foreign Minister in September. \nMr Joyce will then travel to Shanghai and Beijing, on his third visit to China this year, to focus on deepening bilateral education linkages and to advance joint science and innovation initiatives. \nIn Beijing, where New Zealand is the Country of Honour at the China Education Expo fair, Mr Joyce will lead the 24 strong education delegation. He will meet with senior Chinese leaders and participate in bilateral education activities, including the 4th New Zealand - China Higher Education Forum, the New Zealand - China Technical Vocational Education and Training Forum, and will address the Plenary Session of China Annual Conference for International Education (CEAIE). \n\"Advancing bilateral education linkages and helping to raise New Zealand’s profile as an international education destination will be a key focus. International education contributed $2.85 billion to the New Zealand economy last year, supporting 30,230 jobs across the country, and there’s significant potential for further growth.\" \n\"China is a key strategic science and innovation partner for New Zealand, and makes an enormous investment in science capital. There are real benefits to our scientists from collaborations such as Shanghai’s Drug Discovery Centre, which has partnerships with several New Zealand universities\". \nMr Joyce will return to New Zealand on Sunday 25th October. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:52:48.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
