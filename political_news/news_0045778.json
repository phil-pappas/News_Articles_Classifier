Botswana and Namibia also suffered severe drought earlier this year, but the food risks there are not considered as serious, according to the agencies.\nThe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said they plan to step up operations in southern Africa, citing data that show there will be about 27.4 million people facing food insecurity in the region in the next six months.\nThe agencies define food insecurity as struggling to \"buy or produce enough nutritious food to lead a healthy life.\"\nThe El Nino weather phenomenon could lead to another poor season of rainfall, exacerbating the nutrition problem, the United Nations said.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
