REUTERS/Yuri Gripas More + \nWASHINGTON -- Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin is now a step closer to trading the job he has and loves for one he had never sought -- that of speaker of the House. \nAs members of the Freedom Caucus emerged from their meeting Wednesday evening, they said that Ryan now clearly has at least the 218 votes from the Republican conference he needs to become speaker. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan has agreed to run for speaker of the House -- if he has backing from all factions. Nancy Cordes reports on Ryan's condit... \nRep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, the leader of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters after the meeting that \"a supermajority of the Freedom Caucus has agreed to support Paul Ryan.\" \nHe went on to say, \"There was not an agreement on [Ryan's] preconditions , and we are going to continue to work to change what is happening in the House. There is already a process going of reform and we are going to support that process of reform.\" \nLabrador stopped short of saying the caucus would endorse Ryan for speaker. \nRyan's conditions included unifying House Republicans, updating conference rules, and a work-family balance that would mean spending less time traveling than prior speakers so that he would have more time to spend with his family. Paul Ryan said Tuesday night he wasn't positive about running, but that he would be 'willing to serve' as speaker if certain conditions are met. ... \nThe Freedom Caucus released statement of support for Ryan that also said, \"We all know that Washington needs to change the way it does business, and we look forward to working with Paul and all our colleagues to enact process reforms that empower individual representatives and restore respect to our institution.\" \nOn Tuesday night, Ryan said he would give the major GOP caucuses until Friday to endorse him. \nHouse Republicans are now scheduled to vote by secret ballot for speaker next Wednesday and hold a floor vote next Thursday. \nRyan released his own statement, saying, \"I'm grateful for the support of a supermajority of the House Freedom Caucus. I look forward to hearing from the other two caucuses by the end of the week, but I believe this is a positive step toward a unified Republican team.\" Â© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.
