PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Republicans are renewing their call for an ethics investigation into a Democrat with ties to an embattled nonprofit. \nSenate Republicans have repeatedly pushed for a hearing into whether Sen. Jeff Hayden benefited financially from misspending at Community Action Minneapolis. The group provided heating assistance but was shut down last year. Hayden later stepped down from his board role. \nAn ethics complaint against the Minneapolis Democrat stalled last year. But a court-appointed receiver discovered $3,400 in “improper” travel expenses filed by Hayden and his wife, who served as his designee. \nRepublican Senate Minority Leader David Hann says it’s time to finish an investigation. Hann announced a renewed ethics complaint Monday. \nHayden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His attorney says the couple’s expenses were justified. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:52:05.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
