Twice the slice \nSunday, Oct. 18, starting at 9:30 am \nREAP Food Group’s popular Pie Palooza fundraiser is back at the Goodman Center, 149 Waubesa St., with four timed seatings from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm. Pies both sweet and savory come from restaurants and bakeries all over the area. You get two slices of pie (your pick), salad and a beverage. We have our eye on that French Canadian Pork Pie from Gates & Brovi. Advance tickets $18 through reapfoodgroup.org, $20 at the door. \nAtwood rules \nOct. 20 & 27, Nov. 3 & 10, 6 pm \nMadison Eats’ “Atwood Brew and Chew Tour” showcases the best of this historic, walkable, food-and-drink-rich neighborhood. Tickets through madisoneats.net ($48). \nTasting and teaching in Brew Town \nOct. 23-24 \nMilwaukee is known informally both as the City of Festivals and Beer City, so combining these two obviously creates the Wisconsin Craft Beer Festival , a two-day beer tasting event at the Harley-Davidson Museum. More info and tickets for three tasting sessions and seminars at wisconsincraftbeerfestival.com.
