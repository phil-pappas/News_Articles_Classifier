Clinton picked up 38 percent of the vote, while Sanders took in 34 percent, including those leaning in one direction but not completely decided on a candidate. It's a 7-point gain for the former secretary of state from last month, when she drew 31 percent with leaners, and Sanders led with 35 percent. Biden dropped to 9 percent, a decrease of 5 points from the September survey.\nRegardless of whom they say they are supporting in their state, 60 percent of voters said that Clinton is most likely to win the Democratic nomination, while 13 percent said Sanders and just 9 percent Biden.\nChelsea Clinton: Hillary's testimony will be 'remarkable' By Nick Gass\nIn two national polls released Tuesday , Biden came in a distant third, with diminished results from each last respective survey.\nThe senator from neighboring Vermont is seen slightly more favorably than Clinton by Democratic primary voters, with 70 percent viewing him favorably and 17 percent unfavorably. Clinton, meanwhile, enjoyed an 8-point uptick in favorability to 64 percent and a 3-point decrease in those with an unfavorable opinion at 27 percent.\nBut Biden, who has still not made his intentions known about another bid for the White House, fell from a net positive of 45 points (66 percent to 19 percent) to just 27 points in this month's poll (55 percent to 28 percent).\nVoters gave Sanders much higher marks on trustworthiness and honesty than Clinton, with 80 percent agreeing that he is, compared to just 53 percent for Clinton, largely unchanged from the previous month's survey.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 via landlines and cellphones, surveying 401 likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.wbur.org/"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:15:39.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
