He says the purpose of the committee is to find out the truth, and that it has nothing to do with politics.\nMcCarthy spoke in an interview on Fox News Channel. He aims to quell controversy after boasting earlier this week that the Benghazi committee was responsible for Hillary Rodham Clinton's dropping poll numbers.\nDemocrats pounced on McCarthy's initial comments, saying they proved that the committee is on a witch hunt against the Democrats' leading presidential candidate.\nEven some Republicans criticized McCarthy, who is campaigning to become speaker of the House following the resignation of John Boehner (BAY'-nuhr).\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
