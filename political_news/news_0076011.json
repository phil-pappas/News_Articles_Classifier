The attacker was shot on site, resulting in his death,” a statement from the military read. \nA military spokeswoman later clarified to AFP that the assailant was killed by soldiers. \nEmergency medical services spokesman Magen David Adom said they had evacuated a 19-year-old Israeli with a stab wound in his neck to Shaare Zedek hospital in Jerusalem, which said he was in a “serious and unstable condition.” \nPalestinians named the dead attacker as Raed Jarradat, in his 20s, from the village Sair, north of Hebron and close to the Beit Einun junction where the attack took place. \nOn Sunday, a man from Sair was wounded by gunfire shortly after an Israeli was stoned and stabbed nearby. The Israeli, who was moderately wounded in the attack, had managed to fire his pistol at his assailant.

One Israeli Jew and one Eritrean have also been killed after being mistaken for attackers. \nMonday’s attack takes the number of Palestinians killed in attempted attacks and clashes to 54. \nAn Israeli Arab attacker has also been killed.
