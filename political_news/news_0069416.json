Photo by: AP (File) FRIENDS LIKE THESE: Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of both President Bill and Hillary Clinton, looms large in the Benghazi hearing as a regular email correspondent with the former secretary of state. prev next comments Tweet Congressional Republicans, despite an eight-plus-hour grilling of Hillary Clinton on the Benghazi attack, failed to uncover their much sought-after smoking gun or land a game-changing knockout blow.\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi, led by South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy, tried to make the case that Clinton, as secretary of state, lost interest in Libya after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi, ignored requests from Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens to bolster security around Libyan outposts and misled the American people in the days after the attack.\nIt was tense and confrontational at times. But if Republicans were hoping to derail the Clinton campaign, it never happened. The marathon hearing eventually sent the former first lady into a coughing fit and she temporarily lost her voice. But that was the only damage done to the Democratic presidential front-runner.\nAs day turned into night, Democrats argued that the sheer length of the inquisition proved their point — that the investigation had been a partisan witch hunt all along.\n“Do we want to badger you over and over again until you get tired, until we do get that gotcha moment?” shouted Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) some 10 hours after testimony began. “We’re better than using taxpayer dollars to try to destroy a campaign. That’s not what America is all about.”\nClinton sought repeatedly to take the high road, citing the heroic actions of diplomats overseas and accusing committee members of exploiting the tragedy.\n“I can only hope that the statesmanship overcomes the partisanship,” Clinton said. “At some point we have to do this. It is deeply unfortunate that something as serious as what happened in Benghazi could ever be used for partisan political purposes.”\nBut Clinton hardly emerged unscathed.\nHer poll numbers have continued to plummet on questions of honesty and trustworthiness springing from revelations about her private emails. U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) picked up on that theme when he assailed her for publicly casting the attack as a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Islamic YouTube video, while privately telling international leaders, and even daughter Chelsea Clinton, that it was, in fact, an organized strike by militants.\n“We know the attack on Libya had nothing to do with the film — it was a planned attack, not a protest,” said Jordan, reading from a transcript of a phone call Clinton held with the Egyptian prime minister.\nJordan went on to suggest the initial explanation was a politically convenient excuse dreamed up 56 days before President Obama faced re-election.\nRep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) highlighted Clinton’s unusual arrangement with confidante Sidney Blumenthal — despite being barred by the Obama White House — reinforcing the narrative that the Clintons play by a different set of rules than everyone else.\nYet Republicans failed to trigger a Clinton self-implosion or even provoke anything resembling her infamous “What difference at this point does it make?” moment at a 2013 congressional hearing.\nDemocrats on the panel, meanwhile, railed against the 17 months and $4.7 million of taxpayer money spent on what they called a “fishing expedition.”\nBenghazi doesn’t move the needle for most voters the way jobs and the economy do. The people who feel strongly about Benghazi have already made up their minds, and nothing the former secretary of state or the congressional Republicans said changed them.\nAnd that was a win for Hillary Clinton.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Analysis%3A+Hearing+not+likely+to+hurt+Hillary+Clinton+in+prez+race"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:29:22.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
