If possible, create a home inventory of belongings. Include as much information as possible about items, such as brand name, the price you paid, date of purchase, make and model, and serial numbers. Take photos of each item and include any receipts. Remember to go through all your drawers and closets, and include items in your garage,\" Commissioner Miller said. \"The more detail you can provide, the easier it will be for your insurance company to evaluate your loss. If you don't have time to create a home inventory, then quickly videotape and/or photograph each room.\"\nCommissioner Miller advised homeowners to document losses before beginning to clean up. Take photos or video and make a list of the damages or damaged items, and if possible, save these items for your insurance company representative to review. In preparation for the storm, the commissioner issued a consumer alert on handling storm damage claims.\nHomeowners are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to avoid further damage to their home or belongings, including making temporary repairs, such as covering a hole in the roof, or hiring a qualified professional to do this work. Insurance companies typically reimburse the cost of these repairs as part of a claim.\n\"While making sure your family is safe and cleaning up what you can are always top priorities, you need to file your insurance claim as soon as you can, as most companies have a time requirement for doing so,\" Commissioner Miller said. \"Contact your insurer as soon as possible after a storm damages your home.\"\nYour insurance company will send a claims adjuster to your home to assess the damage at no cost to you. The adjuster will then provide documentation of the loss to your insurance company to determine your claim's settlement.\nCommissioner Miller also advised caution when choosing a contractor to make repairs to your home. Check licensing and references, always insist on a written estimate before authorizing any repairs, and don't sign any contracts before an adjuster has surveyed the damage.\nCommissioner Miller also reminded consumers that standard homeowners' insurance policies do not cover flood damage.\nIf you have questions about a homeowners' insurance claim, go to www.insurance.pa.gov , and click on \"Consumers\", or call 1-877-881-6388.\nFor tips on preparing for and staying safe during a storm, visit www.ReadyPA.org .\nMEDIA CONTACT: Ron Ruman , Insurance Department, 717-787-3289\n releases/pennsylvania-insurance-department-provides-homeowners-information-for-filing-storm-damage-claims-300153415.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.insurance.pa.gov/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC18589&Transmission_Id=201510021158PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC18589&DateId=20151002", "http://www.readypa.org/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-insurance-department-provides-homeowners-information-for-filing-storm-damage-claims-300153415.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:18:21.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
