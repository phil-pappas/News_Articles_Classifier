In (the case of Liberty Place), they don't,\" the article says.\nThe Liberty Place monument, which now sits at the foot of Iberville Street in the French Quarter, commemorates a bloody 1874 coup against the Reconstruction government of Louisiana by a band of ex-Confederates.\nAs is The Economist's tradition, the opinion piece is unsigned.\nThe piece lays out three main arguments for keeping divisive statues in place, none of which The Economist finds persuasive. The arguments, which have been raised by many New Orleans residents who want to keep the statues , include: the need to preserve history, the existence of more pressing concerns and the difficulty in distinguishing between the relative sins of historic figures.\nIt is important to preserve history, the magazine writes, but official endorsement of such statues suggests the figures they commemorate \"should be not just remembered but publicly revered.\"\nThe point echoes a similar theme Mayor Mitch Landrieu has used in his advocacy of the removal of the Liberty Place obelisk and statues of Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard and Jefferson Davis, all famous Confederates.\nThe Historic Development Commission's staff has also raised concerns that allowing the statues to stay in place represent a tacit endorsement of a Lost Cause narrative of the Confederacy and Reconstruction that most serious historians say isn't supported by the facts.\n\"By propagating a sentimental version of the war that glosses over the South's belligerence and attachment to slavery, too often these monuments misrepresent the history they purport to embody,\" the magazine writes.\nOn the second point, The Economist agrees that there are \"bigger things to worry about\" than such monuments, but says that \"the persistence of inequality and discrimination is intimately connected with how America sees its past,\" so the monuments' effect on the community extends beyond the symbolic.\nThe Economist reckons the last rationale for keeping the monuments, that removal could lead to a slippery-slope cleansing of the public space, is the most persuasive. Still, the magazine says, a line can be drawn to distinguish which monuments are worth preserving.\n\"It is possible to distinguish between someone whose principal contribution to history was ultimately baleful and someone, such as (George) Washington, whose failings were subordinate to their claim to greatness. Wherever the line is drawn, Confederates and segregationists who once divided their country and now alienate many of its citizens, fall on the wrong side.\"\nThe Economist's strong endorsement of monument removal is noteworthy, given the publication's reputation for adopting positions, often voiced with an air of cool rationality that can seem insensitive.\nFor example, the magazine recently panned a book called \"The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism,\" saying author Edward Baptist failed to produce a balanced view of slavery. \"Almost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains. This is not history; it is advocacy,\" the review pronounced.\nAfter a swift and widespread backlash, The Economist retracted the review and apologized.", "external_links": ["http://www.economist.com/news/books/21615864-how-slaves-built-american-capitalism-blood-cotton", "http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21669958-where-statues-confederate-leaders-do-and-dont-belong-museum-pieces"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:48:49.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
