Carla Nelson in Rochester's District 26. \nElliot Culp, who worked as a DFL field organizer for southeastern Minnesota in 2014, says he's running against Nelson because he wants to help shepherd Rochester's $6 billion Destination Medical Center public/private development over the next 20 years, according to the Rochester Post Bulletin . \nCulp is now executive director of Lake City's Economic Development Authority . \nHe's newly registered with the state Campaign Finance Board as a candidate. The paper says he's a Rochester Mayo High School grad with a bachelor's degree in religion at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. \nNelson, the incumbent, served in the state House in 2003-2004, and was elected to the state Senate in 2011 and reelected in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:17:35.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
