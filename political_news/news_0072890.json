They drove to a place in Kamathipura, where they took her inside a building, which looked like an office. They raped her and escaped, leaving her there,” said Kamathipura Inspector B. Ramesh.\nAs per the victim's statement, they abandoned her after 1 am. Later, she called her husband, who took her to the police station to lodge a complaint.\n“They came to the police station in the early hours and gave a complaint. We booked a case for rape and kidnap, and have started investigation,” said the inspector.\nPolice officials, however, said that there were contradictions in her statement as a few points she had said earlier appeared different from what she said when she elaborated the incident in the petition. “We are verifying CCTV footages around the Central Mall, where she was allegedly kidnapped. A few other evidences have also to be verified,” said Ramesh.\nThe victim was sent for medical examination as part of the investigation. Cops said that there was no injury on her body.\nStates: Telangana nation Current affairs South Rama Talkies Also Read Chennai women share close bond with refrigerator BBMP power struggle: Siddaramaiah tries to build consensus Mumbai: Rs 1.41 crore stolen in Bollywood-inspired plan Telangana, Andhra Pradesh to continue with old protocol", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/woman-alleges-kidnap-rape-hyderabad", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/woman-alleges-kidnap-rape-hyderabad", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/violence1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/violence1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:35:44.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
