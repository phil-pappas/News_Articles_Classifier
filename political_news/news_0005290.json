Asked if kids were being given 100s of pounds a week, Camila Batmanghelidjh says \"no\" then \"some did\" then \"not under 18s\" then \"very rare\" \n— John Bingham (@John_Bingham) October 15, 2015 \nShe was ridiculed for her response to questions about where Government funding granted to Batmanghelidjh's charity had ended up. Kate Hoey asks where employees' taxes went that weren't collected. Batmanghelidjh: \"they were conceptualised\". Hoey rolls her eyes... \n— Anoosh Chakelian (@Anoosh_C) October 15, 2015 \nThis prompted a barrage of awful jokes. I wish you'd all conceptualise your terrible tweets. \n— Ed Jefferson (@edjeff) October 15, 2015 \nAnd when she tried to claim some answers shouldn't be given in public, people having none of it. Camila Batmanghelidjh: \"I'm happy to answer these questions in private\" \nShe appears to think she should have the same privileges as MI6 \n— Ned Donovan (@Ned_Donovan) October 15, 2015 \nAfter her extensive series of gaffes, Batmanghelidjh, left few impressed. Camila Batmanghelidjh has the air of a dinner party guest who has said something insensitive and has spent the evening trying to recover. \n— David Wyllie (@journodave) October 15, 2015 \nYentob, appeared alongside her, but received just as scathing reaction to his performance. \nHe came under intense fire for his role in overseeing the closure of Kids Company, while acting as its chair of trustees. \nHe sought to justify travelling to a BBC studio with Batmanghelidjh for an interview she did weeks ago on its closure and denied this gesture was an attempt to influence the BBC's coverage. \nBut his explanation did not go down well. Yentob justifies being in BBC studio while Batmanghelidjh was interviewed as \"I was just there to hear what she said\". IT WAS ON THE RADIO \n— Michael Deacon (@MichaelPDeacon) October 15, 2015 \nThings got worse when Yentob attempted to scorn his questioners. \nThe move completely backfired. Chair: [noting #KidsCompany deficits] I'm involved with charities.. Yentob: Has yr charity lasted 20yrs? Chair: It's bn going 400 years.. \nAnd left lots of people wondering if he might be in the wrong job. This is the best television Alan Yentob has done for years... #kidscompany \n— James Tyrrell (@JRTyrrell) October 15, 2015 \nThe three-hour grilling was insightful and entertaining - not least because the awkward experience served as a masterclass to MPs, bosses and experts, who often appear in front of similar committees. Are you due to appear before a Select Committee soon? Highly recommend watching Batmanghelidjh & Yentob's appearence; then do the opposite! \n— Christopher James (@ChrisJames_90) October 15, 2015 \nBatmanghelidjh announced she would step down as chief executive of her charity back in August, when concerns were first raised about serious financial mismanagement with thousands of pounds of taxpayers money it received. During the hearing, Batmanghelidjh said the charity had 36,000 clients and, since its closure, only 1,069 of them had been handed to local councils.
