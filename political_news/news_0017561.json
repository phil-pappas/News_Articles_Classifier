Already all the requests placed before me by the various communities within the constituency are being worked on. I have assured them that should I fail to deliver on my promises to them when they vote for me as the Parliamentary candidate, they should vote massively against me during the Parliamentary elections in 2016. That is simple,” he states. \nKobby Acheampong who visits the constituency every weekend has been meeting NDC supporters in the constituency to canvass for votes. \nHe told Joy News’ Richard Kwadwo Nyarko after a visit to the Nkanfoa and Pedu – both communities in the constituency – that he would not wait to become the Member of Parliament for the area before he supports the development of the area. \nThe Presidential staffer is again cautioning the NDC supporters to be wary of inexperienced candidates. According to him, such inexperienced candidates will make the party’s fight to increase the seats that were won in the Central Region in the 2012 elections difficult. \n“The party’s chances look very bright with people who have enormous experiences in government and not people who just completed their schooling and have not even worked before. The 2012 elections are not for feeble legs but for people who have been tried and tested like Kobby Acheampong. We don’t need to experiment lest we lose our seats,” the former Deputy Interior Minister said. \nKobby Acheampong bemoaned how politicians who ride on the back of the people to power neglect the very people who voted for them. \n“I have seen that the people have a lot of issues. Issues that bother on their livelihoods. I am mapping out strategies to resolve such issues. It wouldn’t be bad for a community to own two taxis that work for them. It is achievable and I will do it for my people,” he said.
