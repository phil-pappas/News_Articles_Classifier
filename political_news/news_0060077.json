This cycle, the Democratic National Committee has six debates the schedule. In 2008, the last time there was a competitive Democratic primary,the party had already held nine debates by this time. \"We still have a lot of work to do in order to move ourselves from the continuum of know, recognize, like, support,\" O'Malley said. \nO'Malley's visit to Dartmouth College, three days after the debate, drew more than a hundred people, well beyond what the campaign says it expected. \nTom Lanzetta of Lebanon was one of those in the audience. He said O'Malley's debate performance was the only reason he came. \n“It seems like he has achieved a lot, in results in both as a mayor and governor, so we are impressed with how much he got done on guns and that kind of stuff,” Lanzetta said. Prior to the debate, Lanzetta said, he was supporting Bernie Sanders, but now he said he feels he has more options in the democratic field. \nPaul Hogan, athletic director at NHTI in Concord, where O’Malley also spoke Friday, said he was impressed by O’Malley’s record, as well as his delivery on stage. \n“He speaks well, he is genuine, he’s well read. He has some good ideas. And he doesn’t just speak off the cuff,” Hogan said. Martin O'Malley spoke to a packed crowd at Dartmouth College on Friday Oct. 16, 2015.

We won introducing him; we showed there’s a credible alternative to getting things done,” said O’Malley’s deputy New Hampshire director Matt Sheaff. \nHe said since last week they have received a jump in calls, volunteers and even financial contributions. \nFormer state Sen. Pete Burling of Cornish, an O’Malley supporter, said he expects this exposure will reflect positively in the polls. \n“Do I expect over the week or so to see a bump up from ones and twos to eights and tens? I do expect to see that,” Burling said. Martin O'Malley drew dozens of people to a town hall event at NHTI on Friday afternoon -- just three days after the first debate.

Bob Noelte, of Concord, who came out to hear O'Malley speak at NHTI, said the candidate sounded too much like a politician for his liking. \n“There wasn’t a feeling, an emotion, a naturalness that I would have hoped. I thought it was more of a scripted type of delivery,” Noelte said. \nThe next Democratic debate is scheduled for November 14 in Iowa, followed by one in New Hampshire on December 19.
