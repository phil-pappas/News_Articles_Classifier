They do, in the form of income taxes on their Social Security benefits and higher Medicare premiums. Depending on income, they may pay as much as $335.70 for Part B , more than triple the base amount.\nThat premium apparently could rise to about $504 unless things change. I do not complain that the “better off” pay more. But I am weary of hearing they should with no recognition that they already do.\nMichael Cogswell , Vienna", "external_links": ["https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/costs-at-a-glance/costs-at-glance.html#collapse-4809"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:28:47.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
