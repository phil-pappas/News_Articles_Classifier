What a coincidence! Could it be that these numbers were extrapolated from one number for the D.C. metro area?\nIn the table’s food category, all 12 jurisdictions had exactly the same cost. Did The Post mean to say that food costs the same in New York City as it does in Houston, Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta?\nIn the transportation column, eight of the 12 jurisdictions had an average cost of $6,991. The Maryland suburbs, Virginia suburbs and Miami also had the same cost ($7,301). Only the District showed a higher number ($7,439).\nIf I were a cynical person, I could say that these numbers have been played with to prove a thesis that this is the most expensive area to live in the country. Charts like this one are pretty useless in determining relative costs.\nJohn Bartoli , College Park\n●\nIn the Washington Post Magazine’s Oct. 4 Crunched feature, the Economic Policy Institute reckoned that a family of four living in the District needs an annual income of $106,493 to cover necessities [“ Where the rent (and everything else) is too darn high ”]. According to Census.gov, the median income for a four-person family living in the District in 2012-2013 was $63,435, and there are many families with much less. Are half of the families of four starving because their income is more than $40,000 short of what’s needed for necessities? The Post should not print such statistics without some discussion of the questions they raise.\nKeith E.
