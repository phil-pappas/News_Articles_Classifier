De Blasio will take part in the Annual Conference of Mayors, at which he’ll be a keynote speaker to address the topic of “Anti-Semitism in the West: How Cities Must Lead.” \nIn a statement given to JP, Gross mentioned de Blasio’s long history of standing up against anti-Semitic acts. \n“I’m honored to join Mayor de Blasio in his fight against anti-Semitism and in support of tolerance,” Gross told JP. “New York City can provide other cities with a model for protecting all communities against hate. I look forward to the mayor’s visit and his remarks in Jerusalem.” \nThe conference, which offers an opportunity for dozens of mayors around the world to discuss current issues and challenges, is being hosted by the American Jewish Congress, American Council for World Jewry and World Forum of Russian-Speaking Jewry. \nThe cost of the trip could have been covered by the city due to both security and anti-Semitism are continued sources of concern in New York City, but instead was paid for by Gross. The NYPD will foot the bill as it pertains to security costs associated with the trip. \nGross, who has over 30 years of experience as a business entrepreneur, has established companies in the United States, Europe and Israel. \nPrint Friendly 10/09/2015 5:22 PM by Ryan Haas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:01:37.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
