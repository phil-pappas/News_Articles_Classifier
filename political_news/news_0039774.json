This is largely a reaction to the 9/11 attacks. Meanwhile, attacks from right-wing radicals have largely been overlooked by officials. This is despite the fact that attacks from rightwing radicals have led to more deaths than homegrown jihadists since 9/11, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). In fact, since the twin towers were hit, self-proclaimed jihadists have killed 26 people in the U.S. whereas rightwing radicals have killed 48, so says statistics provided by the New America Foundation. rightwing-jihadists (2) Weve seen lone actor attacks about every 33 days, mostly white supremacist or anti-government extremists, Heidi Beirich of SPLC told NBC News. Homegrown violent extremists can be motivated by any viewpoint on the full spectrum of hate  anti-government views, racism, bigotry, anarchy and other despicable beliefs. When it comes to hate and intolerance, no single ideology governs. The most notable attack by a white supremacist this year was in Charleston, South Carolina in June.

He had regularly posed with flags that represented his white supremacist views. . . .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:41:39.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
