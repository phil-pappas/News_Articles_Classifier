Wasn't for me , would rather spend my evenings over in Bahrain and enjoy a proper beer. Yep. I knew someone whose cat knocked a bottle of Bacardi(? I think) over and smashed it. The way they told it they were wringing the cat out well before thinking about taking it to the vet.As above, most people just brewed and consumed on the compound. Telegraph site won't let me read the article but I guess the guy is a bit unlucky and you don't hear of many Saudis getting caught with alcohol.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:54:23.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
