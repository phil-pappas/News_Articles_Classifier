Richards at the department's District 8 headquarters in Harrisburg to explain how the Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) system will help improve the department's real-time information on vehicle movement, plow-route coverage and usage of materials such as salt and anti-skid.\n\"We expect that this technology will not only help us review truck movement and material usage after a storm, but it should also help us while storms are occurring,\" Richards said. \"Interstates and expressways are our top priority during winter weather, and this system will help us identify and respond to real-time conditions even better than we do today.\"\nThe AVL system pilot is part of Governor Wolf's GO-TIME initiative that leverages inter-agency coordination and collaboration to maximize efficiency, modernize state government operations, and provide the highest quality services. The pilot, as one of seven GO-TIME projects identified by PennDOT in 2016-2017, is expected to realize a cost savings of $1.4 million over the next four to six years based on a combination of reduced salt usage and better use of department equipment, Richards said.\nIn total, 516 PennDOT plow trucks and 212 contracted rental trucks servicing interstates and expressways across the state will have AVL installed. Statewide, PennDOT has 2,200 total department-force trucks and also rents approximately 270 trucks and their operators to maintain the more than 40,000 miles of roadway for which PennDOT is responsible.\nPennDOT plans to make the system's real-time location data available to the public later this year through its traveler information website, www.511PA.com .\nFor more information on winter operations and how the public can prepare for the season, visit www.PennDOT.gov/winter .\nFollow PennDOT on Twitter at www.twitter.com/PennDOTNews or \"like\" the department on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/PennsylvaniaDepartmentofTransportation?fref=ts .\nMEDIA CONTACT :\nJeff Sheridan , Governor's Office, 717-783-1116\nRich Kirkpatrick or Erin Waters-Trasatt , PennDOT, 717-783-8800\n releases/gov-wolf-announces-expanded-penndot-technology-pilot-to-track-over-700-plow-trucks-300164883.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.penndot.gov/winter", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gov-wolf-announces-expanded-penndot-technology-pilot-to-track-over-700-plow-trucks-300164883.html", "https://www.facebook.com/PennsylvaniaDepartmentofTransportation?fref=ts", "http://www.511pa.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC36204&Transmission_Id=201510221420PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC36204&DateId=20151022", "http://www.twitter.com/PennDOTNews"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:54:24.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
