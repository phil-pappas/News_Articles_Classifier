And for spring 2016, he once again sat out his London Fashion Week show time, instead opting to show his collection in video format. The film, directed by Nick Knight, stars a sea of top models, including Mica Arganaraz and Aymeline Valade, who disco down the runway in true Studio 54 go-go style, while wearing shiny chrome jackets and zebra capes.\nMost notably, Lady Gaga also walks the \"runway\" in an assortment of dance-floor-ready outfits, and recorded a cover of Chic's \"I Want Your Love\" as the soundtrack. Clearly, the designer's love for the '70s remains undiminished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:01:01.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
