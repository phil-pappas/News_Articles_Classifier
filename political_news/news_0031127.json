We will also have stories of real-people who have quit smoking thanks to e-cigarettes. \n“More and more New Zealanders are quitting smoking by using e-cigarettes, which has to be a good thing. But as a result of the mix of laws (Medicines Act and Smoke-free Environments Act), people looking at e-cigarettes as a way to stop smoking are forced to buy nicotine-containing e-cigarettes from overseas suppliers. \n“As a result of this situation, a key part of our advocacy will be on encouraging New Zealand regulators to introduce a separate regulatory framework including age restrictions and product standards for e-cigarettes and e-liquid products,” said Mr Satchell. \nThe New Zealand Vaping Alliance is comprised of a group of New Zealand’s leading e-cigarette retailers and keen vaping enthusiasts concerned at the absence of a collective voice on e-cigarette use and vaping community issues. \nThe New Zealand Vaping Alliance website www.nzvapingalliance.co.nz will become a depository of information on the e-cigarette / juice market for media, interested stakeholders (including public health groups) and policy makers. We will also be seeking a more proactive media presence on issues impacting the e-cigarette market and the vaping community. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:37.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
