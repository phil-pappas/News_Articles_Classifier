(AP) â€” The nine people killed after a gunman opened fire on an Oregon community college campus Thursday took different paths to the small rural college, ranging from teens starting college for the first time to adults who were seeking a second career. One was an assistant professor of English at the college.\nThe worst mass shooting in Oregon history also injured several others at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The gunman died following a shootout with police. Some family members took to social media early after news of the shooting broke, expressing concern that they hadn't yet heard from relatives. Many used that same platform to express their heartbreak once their worst fears were confirmed.\nAuthorities released the identities of the victims Friday.\n____\nKim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59, loved the outdoors, her 18-year-old daughter and her two Great Pyrenees dogs, said Robert Stryk, the owner of Pyrenees Vineyards in Myrtle Creek, where Dietz worked as a caretaker for many years.\nDietz was taking classes at the same college as her daughter, who was unhurt in the shooting, Stryk said.\n\"That's really the tragedy here, is that this is a woman who was just trying to better herself,\" he said.\nDietz's ex-husband, Eric, is the vineyard manager, and both were still close friends, Stryk said.\nEric Dietz, who had posted updates on his Facebook page while searching for news of his daughter and ex-wife, on Friday posted a picture of Kim and confirmation of her death \"with deep grief in my heart.\"\nStryk said that the two had met in Southern California, but that Kim Dietz was originally from England.\n\"She was a very energetic, very kind, kind soul,\" he said. \"Kim was an exceptional woman.\"\n___\nThe father of 19-year-old Lucero Alcaraz fought back tears and anger outside of his Roseburg home Friday.\n\"There is no sense in talking about it. It's in vain,\" Ezequiel Alcaraz said in Spanish. \"What's the point in showing our pain?\"\nLucero's sister, Maria Leticia Alcaraz, posted to Facebook that her sister was missing, then broke the news that she was dead.\n\"Never in a million years would I have imagined going through something like this. She was my best friend and my sister,\" she wrote. \"I can't begin to describe how I feel. I'm full of anger, pain, sadness, regret that I didn't get the chance to see her or prevent this from happening.\"\nMaria Leticia Alcaraz wrote of being proud of her sister for getting scholarships that would cover the entirety of her college costs, and for the fact that she was in college honors and wrote that she \"would have been a great pediatric nurse.\"\n\"You were going to do great things,\" she wrote.\n___\nJason Johnson had just started his first week at the college, his mother told NBC News Friday.\nTonja Johnson Engel said that her son had struggled with drug abuse, but decided to continue his education after completing a six-month rehab program with The Salvation Army in Portland.\n\"The other day, he looked at me and hugged me and said, 'Mom, how long have you been waiting for one of your kids to go to college?' And I said, 'Oh, about 20 years,'\" Engel told NBC News.\nShe said that her son kissed her before he left for class Thursday morning.\n\"Love ya,\" Engel told NBC her son told her (http://nbcnews.to/1VsXTDZ ). \"I'll see you this afternoon.\"\nIn a family statement read by police Friday, Jason's mother said that Jason was proud of himself for enrolling in school, and so was his mom. They felt that Jason had finally found his path. His family says that he will be loved and missed.\n___\nQuinn Glen Cooper of Roseburg, age 18.
