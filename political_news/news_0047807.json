Remember our Government says Putin not fighting ISIS but the good rebels we are supporting. Question here: are these fighters our Government is supporting really the “Good Guys.” I think not! \nIf the truth were known they are probably off-shoots of the Muslim Brotherhood – so far Obama has used our hard earned money to back the Muslim Brotherhood since 2009. Every time Obama removed a dictator it was for the purpose of putting the Muslim Brotherhood in power. When will the Republicans stand up and tell Americans the truth; we have a very dangerous person hold the office of Commander in Chief and it looks like Donald Trump is the only one brave enough to tell the truth about Obama. \nHere is what Putin said, “We are facing an epic struggle between those who espouse sacred values such as justice and decency versus those who wish to destroy all values.” \nVladimir Putin Battles Satan Worshipers and New World Order Agents Again \nhttp://theinternationalreporter.org/2015/08/09/vladimir-putin-battles-satan-worshipers-and-new-world-order-agents-again/ \nSo Americans we’re between a rock and hard place here, Obama wants to destroy our Nation and Putin wants to be a World power. Putin doesn’t hide behind closed doors, nor does he cower from Barack Obama; Putin knows that our Nation has regressed in the past 7 years. He realizes that our Military has been weakened and knows that we have an accumulated National Debt that is bordering on bankruptcy. \nPutin knows about Obama’s false ideology and monitors everything that our Commander in Chief and the Liberal base are doing. He doesn’t worry about the GOP, because they’ve turned into a bunch of fractured politicians who can’t function. \nOn the other hand Obama is following the Cloward/Piven theory and that is why he has opened our borders and why he is very tolerant of the “SANCTUARY CITIES.” The goal of Obama’s is to create one literally manufactured scheme after another to build up new Democrat voters. \nBe aware that Obama has moved the number of refugees allowed in our Country from 10,000 to 200,00; this is the perfect storm for Obama, he’s buying Democrat votes on our dime again. \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/07/11/do-not-doubt-the-power-of-the-cloward-piven-strategy/ \nWatch the video by Dennis Michel Lynch and Dick Morris on Obama’s power grab – it will send chills down your spine. https://youtu.be/mZ7R_LB_je8 \nDO NOT DOUBT THE POWER OF THE WARD-PIVEN – Obama opened our borders with one intent and that was to allow a migration of millions of people to enter our Country and of course they would automatically depend completelyon our Government. But the end goal of Obama’s is to throw our Nation into what is called the New World Order, which basically removes all citizen’s rights and freedoms making them dependent on one system only. Folks that is what Common Core is all about just as an example; Bush and Fioriana are both advocates of Common Core even America is suffering through a transformation created by Barack Obama that has devastated our Nation. In 7 years Obama has destroyed us financially, our National Debt As of January 8, 2015, the U.S. is $18.1 trillion in debt. He has weakened our Military, taken over our schools and increased dependency on the Government by the millions. Approximately 42 States have adopted the Common Core Standards. \nHere is some very important documented information on the illegal alien crisis in our Nation. \nDennis Michael Lynch has researched and studied this problem and many of the Liberal venues refuse to use his documentaries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:54:39.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
