Its sole purpose is to take its time and smear Hillary Clinton for as long as they can. Now, they've shifted focus onto her email server instead of the task they were originally formed to investigate. \nSince they are dragging their feet waiting for 2016 to arrive, instead of investigating, they are creating gun clubs and \"Wine Wednesdays: \nWith the slow progress, members have engaged in social activities like a wine club nicknamed “Wine Wednesdays,” drinking from glasses imprinted with the words “Glacial Pace,” a dig at Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the committee’s ranking member, Major Podliska said. Mr. Cummings used the term to question the speed of the committee’s work. \nAt one point, several Republican staff members formed a gun-buying club and discussed in the committee’s conference room the 9-millimeter Glock handguns they intended to buy and what type of monograms they would inscribe on them, Major Podliska said. \nAs ericlewis0 says at Daily Kos, it appears they are even celebrating their \"glacial pace\": \nThis is the smoking gun, folks. It has been obvious to Democrats for years now that the Benghazi Committee was intentionally dragging its feet in order to stretch the investigation all the way to the 2016 presidential elections. The idea being that it would thereby do maximum damage to Hillary Clinton's chances. But now there is proof that Gowdy and his pals were doing this, celebrating it, even. \nPretty soon Trey Gowdy and his \"laid back\" committee mates will be drinking Gin and juice. \nRollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind] Rollin down the street, smokin indo, sippin on gin and juice Laid back [with my mind on my money and my money on my mind]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:44:47.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
