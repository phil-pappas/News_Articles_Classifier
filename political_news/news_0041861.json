Owners have until Nov. 18 to sell the magazines, take them out of the city or surrender them to police. \nThe law mirrors those in San Francisco and Sunnyvale \nThe Los Angeles Daily News reports ( http://bit.ly/1NZBRER ) the lawsuit argues that the ordinance violates existing state regulations, which ban the manufacture and sale of the magazines but not their possession. \nJoining the sheriffs' lawsuit are a state-affiliated group of the National Rifle Association and the California Reserve Peace Officers Association. \nCity Attorney Mike Feuer says the law is constitutional. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:01:14.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
