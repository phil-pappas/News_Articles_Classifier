All countries must contribute to solving the global refugee crisis, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mogens Lykketoft, said on 21 September. Lykketoft stressed that the international community is obliged to help the women, men and children seeking refuge from conflict and violence.\n“The world has not seen a global humanitarian crisis of this magnitude since the Second World War and with winter approaching in the northern hemisphere, it is only going to get worse,” Lykketoft cautioned during his first formal press conference since taking office last week.\n“The tragic stories and heart-breaking images we are seeing in the media are only the tip of the iceberg – the manifestation of much bigger issues which only multilateral cooperation and global leadership can solve,” he added. “This is a global crisis. And it requires a global solution.”\nThe President of the UN General Assembly underlined that “the majority of people fleeing war and violence are refugees and have the right to seek asylum without any form of discrimination,” adding that the international community need to ensure that its response is “tangible, focused…towards lasting, sustainable solutions.”\n“We need to ensure that countries affected by the arrival of refugees, particularly Syria’s neighbouring countries, receive the support and assistance necessary to address the needs of these vulnerable populations,” he said.\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has invited Member States to a special meeting on 30 September in New York to discuss the crisis, also voiced his concern about the migration policy promoted by some EU countries.\nBan’s spokesperson said that the UN Secretary General “calls on all European States to ensure that they abide by their international obligations, including the right to seek asylum, and the prohibition of refoulement.”\n“All persons must be received with dignity and their human rights must be respected. The Secretary-General has followed with increasing concern the closing of some borders in Europe, as well as the lack of proper reception facilities as well as the increased use of detention and criminalization of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers,” the spokesperson said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:02:21.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
