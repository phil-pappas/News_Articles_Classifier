He was 71. \nIn 1968, Wooldridge graduated from Santa Ana College with a degree in history and politics. He then graduated from Chapman University, where he worked on the student newspaper. \nIt was during his time at Chapman that Wooldridge met his wife, Chancy, who was a friend of a university instructor. They married in 1977. \nWooldridge co-founded and wrote for the Orange City News for a few years before starting in politics. \n“He was passionate about all politics,” Chancy Wooldridge said. “He was a bit on the quiet side, but he liked to chat and had a great mind for understanding the political landscape. \n“What I’m most proud of is he ran a lot of campaigns for women, who were just starting to run for office back then.” \nWooldridge ran more than 20 elections for female candidates, was an aid to county Supervisors Ralph Clark and Don Roth, and served in several appointed positions, including president of the State Architectural Licensing Board. \nHe retired in 2005. He kept following politics, in addition to spending time with family and attending Angel games. \nIn late September, Wooldridge, who had already been sick for two years, was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer. He died 11 days later. \nAs a long Angels fan, her husband was happy when the team won it’s Oct. 3 game, 11-10, a day before he died. \nWooldridge is survived by his wife, Chancy Wooldridge of Elk Grove; a daughter, Lindsay Alexis Wooldridge, of Newport Beach; son Travis Cutler Wooldridge of Mission Viejo; and son David Louis Peterson of Oregon. He also leaves behind a sister, Darlene Fitchen, of Prescott, Ariz. and extended family members.
