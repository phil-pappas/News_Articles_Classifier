Previous Next Enlarge \nStuff happens. \nThat was how Jeb Bush on Friday shrugged off the slaughter of nine people at an Oregon community college by a gun-toting maniac. \nBush made the flippant “stuff happens” remark during a campaign stop in Greenville, S.C., where he argued against more gun control in the wake of the latest massacre, Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker magazine first reported. \nLater, when Lizza asked Bush if he meant to say what he said, the Republican presidential candidate said he stood by his words. \n“It wasn’t a mistake, I said exactly what I said,” Bush said on video footage obtained by The Daily Beast . “Things happen all the time. Things.” \nAsked about Bush’s crack, President Obama said “I don’t even think I have to react to that one.” \n“I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting, and they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening,’” Obama said at the White House. \nObama has taken heat from some Republicans for unleashing an emotional broadside against the gun lobby after Thursday’s massacre. \nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
