The question does not arise about the export of cow meat jumping by 14.5 per cent since the NDA government came to power as India has completely banned the export of said product, he said in a statement.\nAccusing Kumar of distorting export figures deliberately to foment communal tension in the run-up to the Assembly polls in Bihar, Modi said, the exporters have to certify on packets of meat as to which animal does it belong to.\nAsserting that the export of cow meat is totally banned in Inda and slaughter of all animals completely prohibited in Gujarat, the senior BJP leader charged both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar with vitiating communal atmosphere and deliberate attempt to polarise voters by making baseless statements about beef and beef exports respectively.\nObserving that cows below 14 years of age were being slaughtered in Bihar despite a ban on it for the past six decades, he dared the chief minister to make a promise a\ncomplete ban on cow slaughter if he has political will to do so.\nThe BJP leader said the NDA, on the other hand, was committed to ban cow slaughter in Bihar by making it a punishable offence with ten years imprisonments and Rs 10,000 fine on those indulging in such activities in the event of the BJP-led coalition coming to power at the hustings.\n beef export meat beef ban Sushil Kumar Modi Nitish Kumar nation Also Read Complexities made Isro confident Leopard on prowl, Chengalpet residents cautioned Human Resource & Development ministry unveils new site MP Mithun Reddy adopts Sadum under Sansad Yojna", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Sushil-Nitish.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/nation-current-affairs/article/no-beef-has-been-exported-india-last-15-months-says-bjp", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Sushil-Nitish.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:34:48.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
