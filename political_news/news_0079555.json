Take a horribly tragic event overseas that cost the lives of four Americans and turn it into a witch hunt against their toughest rival for the 2016 presidential election. It's been obvious to everyone on the planet, except of course the media, who slavishly print every rumor breathlessly as fact, even after at least seven hearings on the matter have proved nothing against the former Secretary of State. \nRep. Kevin McCarthy, who's in line to become the next Speaker of the House, let the cat out of the bag so to speak, by publicly admitting these charades have all been about hurting Hillary . \nCue up the Conservative tsunami to refute his claims. \nSpeaking to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room,\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said McCarthy should apologize , saying the California Republican made an \"absolutely inappropriate statement.\" \n\"I might have said it differently,\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN. \"Any ancillary political activity that comes out of it is, in fact, not the goal of the committee and is not what the committee is seeking to do.\" \nRep. Justin Amash of Michigan, \"I totally disagree with those comments.\" Asked if they could jeopardize his bid for speaker, the conservative Amash said: \"I think it should be a concern.\" \nRep. Chris Stewart, a supporter of McCarthy's who did not see the leader's remarks, said that the California Republican may need to be cognizant that his comments now are going to be heavily scrutinized. \nKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who supports Webster, said McCarthy's remark \"diminishes\" the work of Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the committee. But Westmoreland pushed back at the notion the committee's purpose was political. \"That is not true at the committee, and (McCarthy) knows that's not true at the committee. Chairman Gowdy has been clear this is not about politics.\" \nRep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, a candidate for majority leader, said the \"role of the Benghazi committee is to get to the truth.\" \nIllinois Republican Rep Adam Kinzinger, a supporter of McCarthy's, told CNN that McCarthy's comments were \"unfortunate\" said he needs to address them. ↓ Story continues below ↓ \nErick Erickson from Red State immediately attacked Rep. McCarthy as being unfit to be Seapker. You Want This Guy As Speaker? \nWhen will the media finally admit that Trey Gowdy and all the other hearings on this tragic event, unfortunately, were not about getting to some sort of truths other than to dig up any kind of remark or dirt that could be used to smear Hillary Clinton with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:00:26.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
