I wouldn’t be coming up here a lot if there was not a market for what I had to offer.” \nGraham describes his campaign as a traditional grassroots effort, one of town hall forums, house parties and shaking hands with nearly every voter he meets. It’s a lot of work, but Graham sure seems to be having fun doing it. Lindsey Graham and Arizona Sen. John McCain take some time to play roulette while out on the campaign trail in Manchester.

Dante Scala, a political science professor at UNH, said after serving in the Senate for more than a decade and winning re-election last year, Graham really doesn’t have anything to lose. \n“I think he is running the type of campaign a candidate would like to run – a fun campaign. A campaign not necessarily with high expectations; therefore, not a campaign with a lot of pressure,” Scala said.

I welcome that, he didn’t seem like a stump politician.\" \nIf there is one theme Graham is emphasizing during his campaign stops, it’s his focus on foreign policy – specifically in dealing with ISIL and curbing nuclear threats from Iran. \nAnd Graham often refers to his own military record on the stump: He served in the Air Force and Air National Guard for 12 years and was in the reserves for two decades before retiring in May. \n“I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan 35 times. I know the mess we are in and how to get out of this mess,” Graham said. “Those fighting this mess deserve someone with experience. I think the voters owe it to the military to pick somebody worthy of their sacrifice and who can protect their families.” Lindsey Graham says by attending house parties, town halls and shaking hands with nearly every voter he meets, he hopes to turn the polls around.

Of the 15 candidates in the GOP field, Graham is the only one with military experience. “I think it is important to know how the military works from the inside, I think that is important, especially with what’s going on in the world,” Larsen said at a house party in Keene last week. \nWith this focus on foreign affairs, Graham often leaves domestic topics like college affordability and healthcare in the background. Fundraising challenges have also meant Graham has spent zero dollars on advertising so far. \nBut Graham is hopeful that like his friend and sometime campaign partner Sen. John McCain, who twice won the New Hampshire primary, the long hours will pay off. \n“What I hope to have is, between now and the end of the year, the cumulative effect of meeting people, family talking to family, neighbor talking to neighbor,” he said. “Word of mouth is still a powerful force in New Hampshire but it takes a while to jump start it. You have to literally come here a lot.” \nAnd that is what Graham plans to do until the February primary – one living room at a time.
