The Sensex surged 564.60 points or 2.15 per cent to end the day at 26,785.55 while the Nifty climbed 168.40 points or 2.12 per cent to end the day at 8,119.30.\n“Now most of the global investors feel that a rate hike would happen only by March 2016 instead of December 2015. Moreover, the global growth outlook is also not promising,” said Uday Narayan Dubey, vice- president, institutional desk at R.K. Global. On the domestic front, he pointed out that the sentiments had improved after the RBI surprised the street with a 50 bps cut in interest rates.\n business Market Sensex Nifty global investors Also Read HP and Foxconn announces joint venture agreement Top companies lose Rs 74,193 crore from market valuation Oil markets extend gains after biggest daily climb in six years Piramal to buy 20 pc stakes in Shriram Capital for Rs 2,014 cr", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151006/business-market/article/markets-rise-2-cent-global-cues", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Sensex%20Nov%2025_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Sensex%20Nov%2025_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:11:21.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
