John McGuinness TD said the committee was “cautioned” and formally advised on how to conduct its hearing. He said: “This is an effort to frustrate the committee.” Mr McGuinness, Sinn Féin TD Mary Lou McDonald and Independent TD Shane Ross criticised the Minister for releasing documents late last night of his Department’s dealings with the Nama. PAC live stream Noonan discussed ‘Project Eagle’ deal with Robinson, McGuinness Mr McGuinness said it was “deeply frustrating” that the information was released at 8.30pm ahead of a public hearing with the agency. Mr McGuinness said the release of the information worked against the principles of good accountability. He said members did not have the opportunity to read the documentation. Mr Ross said he believed this was a deliberate move by Mr Noonan. Fine Gael TD John Perry and John Deasy said the accusation that the Minister was trying to frustrate the committee was wrong. Mr Perry said the working of the hearing had become political. The committee also requested to hear from Minister for Finance Michael Noonan. Deputy first minister Martin McGuinness has now requested to appear before the committee. Chairman of the Northern Ireland Finance Committee Daithi McKay addressed the committee this morning. He said his committee had been frustrated by some “key witnesses”. Mr McKay said the reluctance of Nama to appear before them is regrettable and insisted co-operation with the agency is necessary. He added: “It has been more forthcoming than some witnesses, who continue to cite the criminal investigation as a reason for not providing written or oral evidence to the committee. I believe that is becoming more tenable than the day.” Ms McDonald also called on former first minister Peter Robinson and former minister for finance Sammy Wilson to appear too. Mr McGuinness earlier said the purchase of Nama’s Northern Ireland loan portfolio has become a “huge public interest story”. “A lot of allegations have been made, a lot of new information has come into the public domain, since our last meeting. It’s a huge public interest story now,” Mr McGuinness told The Irish Times . “Nama need to clarify all the issues raised, give the information. I’d like to see them co-operating with the investigation in the North. They will be asked about that today.” Mr McGuinness said PAC had twice invited Independent TD Mick Wallace to attend and give evidence. The Wexford deputy has been to the forefront in raising concerns about the sale of the loan book of 800 properties in Northern Ireland, and the payment of €45 million in “fixers” fees to a number of individuals. “We’ve asked him to come on two occasions, but he’s said he’ll wait to see how this goes,” Mr McGuinness said. “We now need to examine more closely the Project Eagle portfolio given the evidence by Deputy Mick Wallace that developers have agreed to settle with Cerberus by paying 50 per cent of the unpaid balance, which, if true, would see Cerberus making significant profits on the portfolio,” he said. He said a number of other sales, including Project Arrow, and the evidence to the Banking Inquiry by developer Johnny Rohan , who was highly critical of decisions made by Nama in forcing the liquidation of Treasury Holdings , would also be discussed. Mr McGuinness said the Committee was trying to assess whether or not Nama was delivering value for money. The committee will hear from Nama chief executive Brendan McDonagh and chairman Frank Daly. Donal Rooney, Chief Financial Officer, Michael Moriarty , Head of Asset Recovery and Aideen O’Reilly Head of Legal will also appear. From the Department of Finance , Declan Reid, a specialist in the Shareholding Management Unit, will give evidence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:25:25.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
