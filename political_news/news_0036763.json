(AP) - Firefighters waded through knee-high floodwaters to rescue a woman stranded in her minivan Tuesday as muddy runoff gushed to the tops of her tires following storms that pelted the Phoenix area and other parts of the Southwest.\nCindy Musselman of Phoenix said there was just a little water on the road when she tried to cross a desert wash outside the city. But the water rose quickly as she entered a low area, and her vehicle got stuck.\nFirefighters drove a pickup truck into the wash, strapped a flotation vest to Musselman and then walked her through the flowing water. They got to the truck and drove to safety, while ambulances, firetrucks and other emergency vehicles waited on dry land on either side of the torrent.\n\"It went whoosh,\" she said of the rapidly rising water. \"It caught me.\"\nThe storms that produced heavy rain and hail in northern Arizona and further south in Phoenix's suburbs came from a low-pressure system out of the west, said meteorologist Ken Waters with the National Weather Service in Phoenix. Weather forecasters said it is not directly related to a phenomenon known as El Nino that creates a persistent warming of the Pacific and threatens an unusually wet winter in California and Arizona.\nIt's too early to know if El Nino caused intense storms in California over the last few days that unleashed flooding and mudslides that inundated roads, homes and vehicles. Massive debris flows trapped more than 100 vehicles on one highway last week, and hardened mud has kept State Route 58 closed about 80 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.\nOfficials also suspended the search Tuesday for a 67-year-old man swept away during the California flooding because deep, wet mud in the area made the search too dangerous.\nThe National Weather Service issued watches and warnings for strong winds, heavy rain and hail for large areas of Arizona and New Mexico.\nThe area where Musselman was rescued Tuesday morning in Phoenix's far northern outskirts later was pelted with marble-sized hail. There were no immediate reports of damage or injury.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:10:23.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
