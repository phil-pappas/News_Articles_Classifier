The elections scheduled for Nov. 8 are the first since a nominally civilian government was installed in 2011. If the elections are credible, most observers believe the NLD will win the most seats in parliament and could even control a majority by forming a coalition with smaller parties. The general election is to be followed by a presidential election early next year when the army and the elected members of parliament will nominate a total of three candidates, and then all lawmakers will vote for the president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:53:20.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
