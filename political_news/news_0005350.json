He said police had found bomb-making materials at their homes.\nAdeeb's lawyer on Saturday called the allegations against his client untrue.\nDuring a hearing in which Adeeb and his lawyers participated by teleconference, the court approved his detention for 15 days of questioning while police conduct raids on the homes and businesses of his family and associates.\nGayoom has been dodging controversy since he won the presidency in 2013 after hotly disputed elections against a predecessor who was forced to resign three years earlier amid public protests. Former President Mohamed Nasheed is now serving 13 years behind bars on a conviction delivered in a rushed trial widely criticized as unfair.\nThe 33-year-old Adeeb, who was hugely popular with young Maldivians, was credited with delivering the important youth vote to Gayoom. Some 40 percent of the mostly Muslim country's 350,000 people are aged from 15 to 34.\nIn July, Adeeb was moved from the Tourism Ministry to become vice president, after lawmakers loyal to Gayoom impeached his predecessor and lowered the minimum presidential age from 35 to 30.\nThe promotion put Adeeb next in line for the presidency, should Gayoom be unable to govern. Adeeb was also given influence and powers beyond those of his elder colleagues, including heading the country's economic council and mapping out plans for a special economic zone. Meanwhile, he kept control over tourism — a major industry for an island nation known worldwide for its palm-fringed beaches, clear waters and luxury resorts.\nAfter the explosion tore through the president's boat last month, rumors soon began circulating that Adeeb was behind the blast — allegations he emphatically denied.\nInvestigators ruled out mechanical failure as a cause of the blast, and the government said an explosive device had been placed under the seat the president usually occupied.\nAuthorities carried out raids on the homes and businesses of Adeeb's associates, but have refused to give any details about what may allegedly have been found. Gayoom also sacked his defense minister and the police commissioner after the blast.\nAdeeb was taken into custody Saturday at the airport immediately upon returning from an official visit to China. Police spokesman Ismail Ali said Adeeb was wanted \"on suspicion of involvement in the boat blast.\"\nThree other people were arrested Saturday, raising the number of those detained in the case to seven. Earlier, three soldiers were arrested, including a former member of Adeeb's security detail and a member of the army's bomb squad.\n___\nFrancis reported from Colombo, Sri Lanka.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:30:09.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
