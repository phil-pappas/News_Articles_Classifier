Israeli ZAKA emergency response members carry the body of a Palestinian at the scene of a shooting attack in Jerusalem on Tuesday.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 13, 2015 | 10:18 a.m. EDT + More Violence in Israel reached new levels Tuesday when Palestinian attackers used a firearm and a vehicle in separate but nearly simultaneous attacks in Jerusalem that left three dead. Three stabbings also took place elsewhere in the country.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a security cabinet meeting at which the police will present a plan to curb the violence. Netanyahu has been criticized for failing to stop attacks that have killed eight Israelis in the last month, with a new poll showing 70 percent of Israelis dissatisfied with his handling of the situation. In response to the violence, the Israeli government is considering relaxing gun restrictions for private citizens.\nRELATED\nIsraeli and Palestinian 'Brothers' Push for Dialogue to Solve Conflict The developments come as two Israelis died when two suspected terrorists stormed a bus in Jerusalem, one opening fire and another stabbing passengers. One of those attackers is dead and the other is in critical condition. Around the same time, another attacker rammed his vehicle into a crowded bus stop. An Israeli man died and at least five others were reported injured.\nTwo separate but nonfatal stabbings occurred in Ra'anana, a city north of Tel Aviv. A third stabbing attack in Kiryat Ata appeared to be perpetrated by a Jewish Israeli who misidentified his victim, also a Jewish Israeli, as an Israeli Arab due to his appearance, reports say.\nAt least 27 Palestinians have also died, with 11 of those identified by Israeli authorities as attackers in the stabbings, shootings and stoning. The remaining Palestinian deaths took place in clashes between protesters and Israeli troops, some on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas and has been the site of violent riots.\nSecurity restrictions already put in place appear to be doing nothing to quell the lone wolf attacks that are nearly impossible to predict and subsequently difficult to prevent. Last week, Israel instituted an age restriction on Muslim men allowed into the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a site considered to be holy by both Jews and Muslims. The site is currently administered by the Jordanians and only Muslims are allowed to pray there. Much of the violence has been stemmed by rumors that Israel seeks to change this status quo agreement at the holy complex, which currently bars Jews from worshipping there. Netanyahu has denied this charge.\n[ READ: Haifa Is an Island of Sanity as Violence Increases in Israel ]\nThe Israeli government has called for further restriction of Arab movement in Jerusalem, with Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog demanded Arab neighborhoods be locked down. Education Minister Naftali Bennett made similar comments.\nAccess to the city of Ra'anana, site of two of Tuesdayâ€™s attacks, has been restricted by roadblocks. There have also been calls to restrict movement in and around the West Bank.\nTAGS: Israel Palestine Netanyahu, Benjamin Judaism Islam", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=3%20Dead%20in%20Terror%20Attacks%20in%20Israel", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=3%20Dead%20in%20Terror%20Attacks%20in%20Israel&summary=Israeli%20officials%20are%20considering%20security%20measures%20that%20include%20loosening%20gun%20restrictions%20for%20private%20citizens.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=3%20Dead%20in%20Terror%20Attacks%20in%20Israel", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5m8m%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:31:59.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
