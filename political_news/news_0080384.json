The Vatican has declined to say who had invited Davis. \n\"The private meeting request was unsolicited and facilitated by Vatican officials,\" says the statement from Liberty Counsel. \nThe meeting created controversy following the pope's visit. \nDavis rose to prominence for refusing to issue all marriage licenses rather than be compelled to issue licenses to same-sex couples. \nVigano has strongly taken up the religious liberty charge championed by U.S. bishops.
