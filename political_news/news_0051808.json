In the run-up to the debate, Biden's lack of a decision about entering the race spurred speculation he'd fly to Las Vegas last-minute to debate. Debate host CNN is keeping a podium ready for him just in case.\nIf Biden tunes in early, he may catch an ad airing nationally urging him to run. Draft Biden says it's spending $250,000 to air the jobs-focused ad ahead of the debate and on Wednesday. The super PAC pulled its first ad about the death of Biden's wife and daughter at his request.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:38:12.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
