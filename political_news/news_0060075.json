Donald Carcieri , current Governor Raimondo and a number of past and present lawmakers entangled in the state's court fight to recover its 38 Studios losses. In legal jargon, the three $150-an-hour lawyers are called \"conflict counsel.\" They include: Marc DeSisto , paid $33,844 to represent members of the the Rhode Island House of Representatives and the governor's office; Lauren Jones , paid $10,025 to represent the Senate; and Raymond Marcaccio , paid $16,137 to represent the treasurer's office. They were hired by Attorney General Peter Kilmartin in 2014 to avert a conflict between the AG's role in the ongoing criminal investigation of the state's failed $75-million investment in ex-Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video-game company, and the statutory duty of the attorney general's office to defend \"the state\" in legal matters. Their billings reflect a high level of previously unseen legal activity that began in March 2014, and grew increasingly complicated during then-Rep. Gordon D. Fox 's descent from House speaker to accused criminal to federal penitentiary inmate #09914-070, after state and federal investigators raided his home and State House office. DeSisto's legal bills, in particular, reflect the difficulty of responding to a subpoena for records after the state police, FBI and IRS left the speaker's office on March 21, 2014, with boxes marked: \"evidence.\" The subpoena served on Fox a day earlier by 38 Studios' defendant Wells Fargo Securities sought \"any and all documents, notes, calendar or diary entries relating to any conversations or meetings related to 38 Studios.\" It also invoked the name of 38 Studios deal-maker Michael Corso , seeking from Fox: \"Any and all documents, notes, calendar or diary entries relating to any communications, conversations or meetings with Michael Corso relating to ... 38 Studios, the Transaction or the Litigation.\" Unlike the Senate, which turned over hundreds of pages of material to the defendants' lawyers, including an email in which Senate President M. Teresa Paiva Weed displayed her momentary pique with Senate Government Oversight Chairman James Sheehan , the House apparently turned over nothing, except public meeting agendas and vote tallies. \"We were told that Fox was not able to produce anything for the subpoena,\" House spokesman Larry Berman said last week. \"We can’t say any documents are “missing” because we don’t know if they ever existed,\" but \"keep in mind that ... when the authorities raided his State House office, they removed a number of boxes. ...We have no idea what was in those boxes.\" Fox is currently in a prison in Pennsylvania on corruption charges, unrelated to 38 Studios. Page 2 of 4 - As for Sheehan, he had drawn Paiva Weed's ire in August 2013 by venting his frustration that the Senate was not holding more hearings to probe how 38 Studios happened. \"While I agree that there are politics involved in this issue, I am convinced that the best way to move forward is to take this issue head on,\" he wrote her. Her response, in a note to an aide: \"I am furious with this. No one ever said political. We said 'investigation ongoing.'\" Name-dropping The lawyers' bills are peppered with the names of top-ranked lawmakers and state officials, past and present, including Carcieri; former House Finance Committee Chairman Steven Costantino , who, in spring 2014, was the state's secretary of Health and Human Services; Rep. Joseph McNamara , the current state Democratic Party chairman; Paiva Weed; and, of course, Fox. Fox, Costantino and Carcieri were ultimately deposed by lawyers for the defendants in the state's lawsuit. Paiva Weed and McNamara were not. Part of DeSisto's job: to pen a May 2014 letter to House Oversight Chairwoman Karen MacBeth to explain why Costantino — who had a huge, but not yet fully revealed role in crafting legislation to allow the disastrous state-backed loan — would not voluntarily testify in the House's 38 Studios inquiry. In that letter, DeSisto correctly predicted that Costantino would be called to give a deposition in the civil case. \"I expect the questions and responses at his deposition to be exhaustive and responsive to any and all inquiries,\" DeSisto wrote. DeSisto also had to respond on Fox's behalf to the subpoenas for documents that had, at that point, been served on both Fox and Paiva Weed by defendants in the lawsuit — alleging fraud, negligence and legal malpractice — that the Chafee administration filed in November 2012 against the chief architects of the disastrous loan deal. Several lawyers' names pop up in his billings, including: Fox's criminal attorneys Albin Moser and and former House Speaker William J. Murphy ; House legal adviser Richard Raspallo ; and Christopher Valente , lawyer for Wells Fargo Securities. A sampling of DeSisto's notations on the legal bills he submitted to the state for payment: March 19, 2014: \"Telephone conference with Attorney Jones regarding subpoena for Ms. Paiva Weed and request for continuance ... Requesting same consideration for Speaker Fox. Draft emergency motion to modify or quash subpoena.\" March 20: \"Review Ms. Paiva Weed's subpoena compared to Mr. Fox's; review and revise catchall objection.\" March 21: \"Note to file regarding search warrant execution and impact on subpoena. \" March 22: \"Note to file regarding the client's resignation as Speaker of the House and impact on subpoena.\" March 24: \"Note to file regarding process of determining extent and scope of subpoena (whether it reaches beyond records of G. Fox).\" Page 3 of 4 - March 26: \"Telephone conference with Attorney W. Murphy regarding criminal issues impacting subpoena.\" March 29: Telephone conference with Gordon Fox regarding index of potentially applicable documents still in his possession.\" April 8: \"Begin research legislative privilege.\" April 14: \"Telephone conference with Attorney Richard Raspallo confirming no documents at the State House.\" April 15: \"Preparation of letter response to Atty. Valente regarding lack of responsive documents at State House ... Research regarding limits of legislative immunity.\" Aug. 5: \"Telephone conference with Rep. J. McNamara.\" Relatively interesting McNamara, D-Warwick, says he can't explain why his name would appear on DeSisto's bill. He does not recall talking to him. But he is aware that deep within the trove of 38 Studios documents is an email that his wife's nephew Derek Dupras — then an employee of 38 Studios — wrote at 11:51 a.m. on March 24, 2010, to the company's CFO, Jennifer MacLean . It said: \"Hi Jen, Here's a link to my uncle's Rep page. As you'll see, he's been in office for many years and has many contacts. ... Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.\" At 11:53 a.m., MacLean forwarded his email to Schilling and 38 Studios director Tom Zaccagnino with this note: \"FYI — Derek's uncle is a RI representative, and has told Derek he'd be happy to vote for a bond to help get us to move there.\" \"I have no idea where he would get that from,\" McNamara said recently of the son of his wife's brother. He said he usually only sees Derek once a year, on Thanksgiving or Christmas. Surmising what happened, McNamara said: \"He's a young man with a young family and I think he was trying to impress his boss.\" He noted that the contact information Derek provided was a link to his biography on the General Assembly website, not his private email or home number. \"We can't control what our relatives say,\" said McNamara, the chairman of the House Committee on Health, Education and Welfare then and now. Like most lawmakers, he says, he had no idea $75 million was earmarked for 38 Studios when he voted in 2010 for the now-infamous \"Job Creation Loan Guarantee\" bill that made the calamitous loan possible. Kilmartin complication? Complicating the picture: Kilmartin is one of the former lawmakers who voted in 2010 for the legislation that paved the way for the state-backed 38 Studios loan, though his spokeswoman Amy Kempe said again recently: \"The investigation is being conducted by career prosecutors, who are directly overseen by the chief of the Criminal Division. \"We are always mindful of the potential for a case-specific conflict within the office, but in this instance, the Attorney General does not believe one exists,\" she said. Page 4 of 4 - She also cited again this June 18, 2014, statement by State Police Col. Steven O'Donnell : \"I am aware that the Attorney General, as a former representative, voted on this legislation. I remain satisfied that he has no conflict in this case, based upon his role as a legislator, and I have full confidence in the professionalism of the career prosecutors he has assigned to this investigation.\" — kgregg@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:05:18.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
