Jesus came to earth, gave us the Gospels to teach us the best way to live our lives, and then suffered and died on a cross to pay for our sins so through Him we can enter Heaven. Political correctness is a false doctrine that says any behavior, no matter how perverted or sick, must be applauded. The Holy Bible, plainly stated in the Ten Commandments for one location, says; murder, lying , coveting the possessions of others, including their spouse, are all wrong, hence the beginning of “thou shalt not”. Several passages in Scripture denounce sodomy as wrong, calling it an abomination before God. The Bible also states that homosexuals will not enter the Gates of Heaven, and that isn’t my “hate” it is God’s word. God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah due to their homosexual sin yet this nation spits in the face of God and says homosexuality is an “alternate lifestyle” and must be accepted.\nMoslems call for death to homosexuals yet it is us Christians who are targeted by the homosexual lobby because we merely refuse to accept sodomy as normal and urge them to repent and turn to God for help. Why is it that moslem owned businesses are never approached to bake cakes or take pictures for homosexual events? Could it be that they know judges will side with the satanic cultists and allow them to kill the homosexuals to resolve the issue? I do not hate anyone in spite of what leftist liberal anti-God people say. Calling me a “hater” does not change any facts of the matter, nor does their name calling change my mind. I am allowed by the Constitution to have my Christian values and nothing can change that, not the “supreme court” or any other government entity.\nJesus is coming back for His people before things get really bad and I will be taken out of this world in the Rapture before the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are unleashed to bring unimaginable suffering and death on the earth. The anti-Christ will bring more suffering on the political correctness crowd than any of them can begin to imagine. I don’t understand why so many who claim to be Christians support the satanic goals of fuhrer obama. It is clear that they have no real knowledge of the Bible and have been deceived by satan into believing they can pick and choose what parts they have to follow and what parts they can either ignore or twist to fit the desires of satan, the father of lies.\nI recently wrote an article critical of pope francis because his socialist views conflict greatly with the Word of God and the uproar was enlightening. People said I would go to Hell for being critical of francis for his statements about guns, his words about illegal immigration, and his ignoring homosexuality and abortion. The Vatican refused to admit Francis met with Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who refused to issue marriage licenses to homosexuals, violating an unconstitutional and illegal “supreme court” edict. The meeting was only acknowledged after francis was back in the safety of his walled castle in Rome. I wonder what Jesus will say when francis explains his lukewarm response to sin while here. Those who have already sentenced me to hell will likely find God will not be as displeased with my positions as they are. I am not afraid to stand before God and answer for anything I have written. God inspires my writing and has given me this gift to use for His glory and furthering His Word in America. I believe God gives me the topics and words that I merely put into print as His loyal servant. People have mocked me before for giving God the credit and glory for these articles but I don’t mind the mockery, it shows who and what they are not who or what I am\nJesus Christ is my Lord and Savior, dying on the cross to save me, in payment for my sins and I will honor Him in every way I can. The first blog article I wrote was on July 4, 2010 and came as a result of my watching videos of our founding fathers and how this once great nation came to be. In high school I wasn’t able to even write a decent book report but after watching those documentaries and giving thanks to God for the guidance He gave the founders I found an ability I never had before. I end all of the articles the same way, acknowledging God as the real author for a reason. The credit should go to the creator of all things, and the bestower of previously non-existent abilities. I suffered a severe stroke on August 19, 2014 that left my left side paralyzed, my speech and sight gone temporarily, and my short term memory severely impaired. While I have not totally recovered God is restoring me by his power, mercy, and grace. I know God didn’t cause the stroke, it came from satan in an attempt to get me to blame God but through God’s grace and strength I turned TO Him instead of turning away from Him. Again that is a testament to the grace of God, not to me. I am on the road to recovery and there is more road behind me than ahead of me, once again thanks to His mercy and grace. Satan can destroy this human body but he cannot destroy my immortal soul because I belong to Jesus and no amount of hardship or suffering can change that, thanks again to the grace of God and the suffering of Jesus in payment for my sins.\nI submit this in the name of the Most Holy Trinity, in faith, with the responsibility given to me by Almighty God to honor His work and not let it die from neglect.\nBob Russell\nClaremore, Oklahoma\nOctober 10, 2015\nCDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jesus-125x125.jpg", "http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Jesus1-125x125.jpg", "http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Holy-bible-125x89.jpg", "http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Iran-hangs-Homosexuals-1-125x125.jpg", "http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Il-Duce-Obama-125x125.jpg", "http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Pope-Francis-125x125.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:39:33.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
