Stand up Chuck, let 'em see you. Oh, God love you. What am I talking about. I'll tell you what, you're making everybody else stand up, though, pal.\"\n  Obama references Trump, advises Kanye on presidential bid Obama cracked that the legislative body \"couldn't get any stranger.\"\n  3:04 PM A BFD \nMarch 23, 2010: During the signing ceremony for Obamacare, Biden followed his introduction of President Obama by embracing him and telling him \"This is a big f deal.\" Then White House press secretary Robert Gibbs quickly affirmed the vice president's barely off-mic comments via Twitter saying, \"And yes, Mr. Vice President, you're right...\"\nGod rest her ... living soul \nMarch 17, 2010: Just days before the Biden had his BFD moment, he asked God to bless the late mother of Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen.

Biden was making is that there has been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades,\" that's not exactly what C-SPAN's cameras caught.\n\"In Delaware, the largest growth of population is Indian-Americans, moving from India.
