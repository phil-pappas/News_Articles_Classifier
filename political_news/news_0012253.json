Harry Reid has not yet endorsed any of the Democrats running for president.\nAnd Nevada's Democratic senator wasn't ready to show his hand on Monday, one night before Democrats seeking the nomination debate in Las Vegas.\n\"Not tonight,\" Reid said when asked about an endorsement, speaking at the MGM at the 2016 Pregame, an event organized by The Washington Post and sponsored by MGM Resorts International.\nThe event, attended by about 280 people, offered analysis and insights into the upcoming debate, which will have five Democratic presidential contenders take the debate stage today at Wynn Las Vegas. The Democrats debating are front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady; U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia; and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and former U.S. senator from Rhode Island.\n\"I think the world of all of them,\" Reid said in an interview with Paul Kane, The Washington Post's congressional correspondent. \"And the last time we had caucuses here, I didn't endorse until after the caucuses so I'm going to look things over and do it when I feel is the appropriate time.\"\nIt's the first of six debates for the Democratic candidates: Debates are planned in five other states with early presidential caucuses and primaries â€” Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Wisconsin.\nReid said Clinton was a \"tremendous\" secretary of state. Asked about Sanders' description of himself as a \"Democrat socialist,\" Reid said Sanders has been a good colleague who advocated for the healthcare reform bill.\n\"Let's just stop the name-calling and try to talk about people and what a good job they do and what a bad job they do,\" Reid said.\nReid had a quick answer when the interviewer told him: \"You've had your share of saying some funny things about people.\"\n\"I'm trying to reform,\" Reid said, drawing laughter from the audience.\nWith February caucuses, Nevada is an early voting state that plays a central role in determining which Republican and Democratic candidates will win their party's nomination.\nReid played a central role in getting Nevada's primaries moved up, making the state a key player in the 2008 primary and caucus cycle. He said Nevada improves the process, noting that the Silver State is diverse and doesn't have a lack of minorities compared to Iowa and New Hampshire, two other early voting states.\n\"We are a state that is representative of what America is all about,\" Reid said.\nAsked about the prospect of Vice President Joe Biden jumping into the race, Reid said it's a \"personal decision\" for Biden.\n\"I don't think Joe's made up his mind at this stage,\" Reid said.\nIt's one election Reid won't be running in. Reid is ending his decades-long career in the Senate and not running for re-election in 2016.\nAsked about his post-Senate plans, Reid said: \"I would like to be able to spend a little time in Washington and a lot of time back here, so we'll see how that works out.\"\nBeyond that, Reid didn't indicate any retirement plans.\nReid added: \"I don't know what I'm going to do. I know I'm going to miss my job.\"\nThe event also had two panel discussions. One had U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev.; Sig Rogich, a Republican strategist and Maria Elena Salinas, a network news anchor with Univision.\nThe other panel had Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist, Jon Ralston, a Nevada political pundit and television host of \"Ralston Live;\" and Hugh Hewitt, a national radio host.\nThe two-hour debate starts at 6 p.m. today, with programming on CNN starting at 5:30 p.m. The debate can be viewed online at cnn.com.\nContact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2904.
