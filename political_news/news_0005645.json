I think we need to continue this discussion as we set our priorities for the county.”\nA primary focus was when and how revenue projections are made by staff with county chief financial officer Mike Swift and trustee David Lenoir .\nCommissioners noted that this year, early projected revenue numbers were lower than the funds collected.\nThat situation could be remedied if the commission changed the date when the budget is due from March to April, Swift said.\nProperty taxes, the largest portion of the county’s revenues, are paid primarily in December, when mortgage companies send funds, and February, when taxes are late, Lenoir said.\nBut, with figures changing as late as June, in a fiscal year that ends June 30, Commissioner Heidi Shafer wanted to know when changes can be made to the budget before it is “set in stone.”\nMeanwhile, Commissioner Mark Billingsley pushed for the commission to establish its own five-year plan, making the budget process one that also followed county goals.\n“I feel totally reactive,” Billingsley said of how the commission is expected to respond to needs. “And I think we could be doing a better job if we had that three-to-five-year plan.”\nWhile the Luttrell administration has a plan in place, commissioners said they should be a part of it, too.\nCommissioners spent the early hours listening to Tony Saunders, chief restructuring officer and CFO for Wayne County, Mich., where he helped oversee Detroit’s financial recovery.\nHe spoke about addressing Shelby County Schools’ OPEB (other post-employment benefits) liabilities, which are now at $1.5 billion.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:26:13.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
