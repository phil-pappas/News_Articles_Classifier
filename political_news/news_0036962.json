Hubbell Draft Indictment.\"\nBut the National Archives refused to release those records, citing an exemption to protect Clinton's personal privacy.\nRead More \"Judicial Watch has confirmed the existence of draft indictments of Hillary Clinton for her lies and obstruction in the Whitewater bank fraud investigation,\" Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch's president, said in a statement.\n\"The Obama administration is refusing to release these records out of concern for Hillary Clinton's privacy,\" Fitton added. \"Hillary Clinton's privacy cannot be allowed to trump the public's interest in knowing more about whether she obstructed justice and lied to a federal grand jury.\"\nClinton's presidential campaign did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:31:38.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
