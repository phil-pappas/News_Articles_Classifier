(AP) â€” Regional Mexican music singer and television star Larry Hernandez will be extradited to South Carolina where he has been accused of kidnapping and assault during a business dispute, a judge ruled Wednesday.\nHernandez, 38, consented to extradition during a court hearing in San Bernardino, California, and will remain jailed without bail until authorities transport him to South Carolina. The singer and star of the Spanish-language reality series \"Larrymania\" appeared in court with his hands and legs shackled.\nPolice in Newberry, South Carolina, say Hernandez is wanted on kidnapping and assault charges filed after a businessman accused the singer of punching him and pushing him into a wall during a dispute over payment for a concert last month.\nHernandez was upset that he was only being paid $14,000 for a concert and demanded $30,000 before attacking the man, according to a police report. The man told police that Hernandez and two other people wrapped him in plastic wrap and beat him in a parking lot before unwrapping him and leading him into a hotel room where they continued to hit him.\nHernandez was arrested on a fugitive warrant Friday at Ontario International Airport, where he was waiting to board a flight to Colorado.\nHis attorneys, Anthony R. Lopez and Manuel H. Miller, declined comment after the hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:48:16.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
