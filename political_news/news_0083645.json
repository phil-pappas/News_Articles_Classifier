How? Here is the link for the short minders, information to come; If you don't like the link, find another. I'm not bias to it, it's just the talk and there are hundreds of links saying it. BERNIE SANDERS DOMINATED THE DEBATE <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Then asked workers for $30..to compete with SUPER PACKS In no way shape or form did Clinton win the debate. I'm all for a woman President if she is \"the one\", but not because they are a woman and she DID pull that card many times. I doubt she would have without the presence of Bernie. Everyone on that stage at one point wanted to shelter under Bernie Sanders and his wise points. Even Hillary Clinton on multiple occasions. Hillary even argued for Banks against Bernie, which he openly laughed because they donate so much to her. I'm curious why he didn't expose this deeper, but that is the anti-bully 2015, the smart will learn on their own. Every voice on that stage was timid except for 2. Bernie Talked Politics. Hillary looked like the typical Political Car Salesman. Re: Bernie Won All the Focus Groups & Online Polls, Media Is Saying Hillary Won? How? Dat MSM spin.
