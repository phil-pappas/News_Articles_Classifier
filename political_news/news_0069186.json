So, as Paul Homewood points out “Take away the subsidies and see what happens.” We aren’t talking tax breaks, we’re talking direct government monetary input\nSubsidy: a sum of money granted by the government or a public body to assist an industry or business so that the price of a commodity or service may remain low or competitive.\nAir America, liberals version of talk radio, couldn’t survive without direct and massive input of rich liberals money. They couldn’t survive otherwise. Their advertising revenue was minuscule. The same applies to a goodly chunk of these “green energy” companies, which cannot survive without government, ie, taxpayer, money.", "external_links": ["http://www.thepiratescove.us//feed/https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/two-renewable-energy-companies-go-bust/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-group-and-climate-energy-two-clean-energy-firms-go-bust-because-of-tory-u-turn-a6686321.html", "http://www.thepiratescove.us//feed/https://climateenergy.co.uk/", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/429b2812/ping.blo.gs/2.0.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:43:56.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
