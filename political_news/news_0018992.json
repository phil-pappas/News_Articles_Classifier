A contentious referendum is scheduled for Nov. 7 in Rehoboth Beach, Del. (Washington Blade file photo by Michael Key) Full and part-time residents and owners of Rehoboth Beach property will have the opportunity to weigh in on the issue of home sizes in this summer resort town popular with the LGBT community. On Nov. 7, a referendum will be held on zoning changes recommended by the town’s Board of Commissioners. A longtime battle has pitted neighbors against each other, and according to property owner Rich Barnett, “People are saying the whole zoning issue and referendum has been nastier and more vicious than in recent memory.” Barnett, who is gay, says that the two competing groups fanning the flames on this issue are led by gays and lesbians. Neighbors began raising issues about the impact of larger homes on their area about two years ago and the Commission began the formal process to consider zoning ordinance changes in September 2014. After about 18 hearings, the Commission voted 6-1 in July to amend the existing code to prevent the proliferation of what some people consider mini-hotels — homes in some cases with six or more bedrooms. According to a press release by the newly formed Rehoboth Neighbors United, “these homes, entirely out of scale to their neighborhoods, many with swimming pools, have increased noise and congestion and decreased the green space that makes our city so beautiful and unique.” The proposed ordinance changes, according to Commissioner Stan Mills, “would increase required yard space, and change the footprint for houses.” Opponents of the ordinance feel that such an ordinance violates their property rights and thus filed a petition to require the city to hold a referendum. Although they initially fell short of the required number of signatures needed to bring about such an election, proponents were allowed additional time to gather signatures and within the allotted three days secured enough signatures to bring the issue to a vote. Susan Gay of Rehoboth Neighbors United said that the opposition is being fueled by the real estate industry, which “already pumped a lot of money communicating negative messages over the summer . . . in an attempt to keep the ordinance from being passed.” Gay added “their sole interest is to make it as easy as possible to build as much as possible in Rehoboth Beach.” Eugene Lawson, a well-known Rehoboth Beach attorney and property owner who led the petition drive said, “if somebody is spending a million and a half bucks for a lot, you would think they’d be able to build the house they want.” Lawson, who has owned property in Rehoboth with his partner of 43 years, also contends that, “I have also seen the city use its power to deny property rights.” He recalls that as an owner of the Strand Restaurant, which opened in 1988, he was targeted for having a gay establishment and was denied a liquor license. Gay contends, however, that those large homes essentially become rentals and “that while the owners of these mini-hotels may reap immediate economic benefit from rentals to large groups of visitors, the value of their neighbors’ property is being decreased due to these negative effects.” Mills pointed out that another problem the city wants to address is that although there is a 3 percent gross rental fee for units that are rented, the city has not adequately monitored the rentals. The ordinance would require the listing of contact persons for the properties that are rented in hopes of improving the monitoring process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:19:18.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
