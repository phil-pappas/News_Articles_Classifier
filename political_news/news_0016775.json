We need measures to slow pollution of our water by intensive dairy farming. \n\"However that is not the end of what is a gloomy prognosis for our indigenous animals and fish, with the finding that eight of our 30 native marine mammals are threatened with extinction. \n\"The report also says 90 per cent of our seabirds are at the risk of being wiped out. \n\"It's time for the Government to stop talking and start acting when it comes to the environment,\" says Megan Woods. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:26:39.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
