Big Apple at Citi Field gets Band-Aid after being hit by d'Arnaud homer The giant apple in center field of Citi Field is seen with a bandage on it after a home run in the first game of National League baseball championship series between the New York Mets and the Chicago Cubs Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in New York. (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\nAssociated Press Oct. 18, 2015 | 8:30 p.m. EDT + More NEW YORK (AP) â€” The bruised big apple at Citi Field got a Band-Aid.\nA day after being hit by Travis d'Arnaud's long home run, the 4,800-pound faux fruit behind the center-field fence had two large, white strips in the shape of an \"X'' on top of it before Game 2 of the NL Championship Series.\nThe playful bandage was on there during batting practice Sunday night, then pulled off before the New York Mets hosted the Chicago Cubs.\nD'Arnaud hit the apple with a 431-foot homer as the Mets won the opener 4-2.\nThe 16-foot-tall by 18-foot diameter red apple, which rises after home runs, is much larger than the old Shea Stadium version, which was 9 feet high and weighed 582 pounds.\nThe old apple is now stationed near the home plate entrance of the new ballpark.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
