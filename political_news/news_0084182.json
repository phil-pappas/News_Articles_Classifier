It was the biggest setback since orders dropped 3.7 percent in December.\nDemand in a key category that serves as a proxy for business investment slipped 0.8 percent in August, following solid gains of 1.9 percent in July and 1.5 percent in June.\nManufacturing has been under stress this year as a strong dollar has hurt export sales. The big fall in energy prices has also resulted in cutbacks in investment by energy companies.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
