If that deadline weren't met, the law would automatically be changed to put in place the sequester relief plan offered in President Obama's budget plan.\n  Sanders and Cummings 'sickened' over drug CEO Turing Pharmaceuticals' Martin Shkreli hasn't lowered the price of a drug that he jacked up 5,000 percent.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:44 PM That budget plan called for about $74 billion more in discretionary spending in fiscal year 2016, which started on Oct. 1. That's about a 7 percent increase in spending.\nIt seems unlikely the GOP would agree to support the Democratic bill that ensures more spending either way. But Republicans are expected to enter into negotiations this fall with Democrats that could result in higher spending.\nDemocrats have opposed Republican efforts to boost defense spending around the sequester caps, while leaving in place those caps for social spending that Democrats want to see increased. That opposition has prompted Democrats to oppose all spending legislation that fails to boost non-defense spending above the caps.\nGetting Democrats to end their opposition is expected to involve some spending hikes, although it's not known exactly what the GOP will have to propose to get a deal.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Lawmaker wants birth control device off the market The Food and Drug Administration has received 5,000 safety reports about Bayer's Essure device.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:32 PM Top Story Rock bottom?
