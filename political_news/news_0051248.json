Life cycle analyses show that plastics are often the most environmentally-friendly material to use for applications, and as shown in the examples from these ... companies, the manufacturing of those plastics can also be done in an environmentally responsible manner.\"\nInterstate Plastics' recognition for environmental excellence came following a company-wide recycling effort that began in 2014 and includes recycling scraps, runoff and remnant material. Interstate Plastics Safety and Quality Manager Rich McDevitt , who has spearheaded Interstate Plastics' green initiatives, emphasized that \"it is important that we recycle and reuse all materials, not just plastics ... Although sometimes challenging to implement in large settings, recycling is very rewarding.\"\nIn addition to the IAPD Environmental Excellence Award, Interstate Plastics has joined the IAPD GreenScene™ program.
