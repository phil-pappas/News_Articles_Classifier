Walking the streets of Toronto with my wife is a truly liberating feeling! We feel safe, free, & at home! #Love,\" he said Monday on Twitter. \nHis arrival ends his nearly two-year ordeal in a case that raised questions about Egypt's commitment to free speech. \nFahmy was arrested in 2013 with two Al-Jazeera English colleagues. He was sentenced to three years in prison in a retrial this year for airing what a court described as \"false news\" and coverage biased in favour of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. \nThe case was widely condemned. He and his Egyptian co-defendant, Baher Mohammed, received a presidential pardon last month. The other colleague, Australian Peter Greste, was previously released. \nFahmy left Cairo last week after learning his name had been removed from a no-fly list. He stopped first in London, where he was to meet with his high-profile lawyer Amal Clooney. \nFahmy is scheduled to attend a press conference hosted by Canadian Journalists for Free Expression at Ryerson University on Tuesday. \nHe has said he plans to take up a position as an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's school of journalism in Vancouver. He is also writing a book about his experiences. \nFahmy has also been invited to meet with NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau ahead of the federal election on Oct. 19 and has said he's eager to thank both politicians for their support during his ordeal. \nThe Conservative government said last week that it was pleased Fahmy was on his way home. \nFahmy moved to Canada with his family in 1991, living in Montreal and Vancouver for years before eventually moving abroad for work, which included covering stories for the New York Times and CNN before his job at Al Jazeera. \nWith files from The Associated Press \nAlso On HuffPost:   Marwa Fahmy (C), the wife of Canadian Al-Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy (unseen), reacts as she sits next to Amal Clooney (R), the human rights lawyer representing Fahmy, during the trial of her husband and Egyptian Baher Mohamed, both accused of supporting the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood in their coverage for the Qatari-owned broadcaster, on August 29, 2015, in the capital Cairo.
