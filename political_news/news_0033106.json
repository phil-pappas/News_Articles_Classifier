Oh my god, this sounds so familiar! Hmmm, curious this just came up around here not long ago. I wonder why that could be? From the article: .... And, like the Planned Parenthood hearings, the grilling of Clinton will be an opportunity for Republicans to engage is crass sexism while pretending that theyre somehow being high and mighty. The gendered politics of the Benghazi non-scandal tend to be discussed in abstract terms. The cultural frame that the Republican party has so successfully managed to build up since the days of Ronald Reagan is one in which Democrats are weakkneed appeasers and semi-pacifists, Paul Campos writes for Salon, while the GOP is the party of strong, war-like Daddy figures, who know how to deal with foreign threats with unsentimental ruthlessness. The unspoken subtext of this is that Democrats are womanly and Republicans are manly. .... Just as with the Planned Parenthood hearings, the official conservative narrative is that gender has nothing to do with the issue, but the reality is that gender has everything to do with it. Despite the claims to be concerned about fetal life and utterly unsubstantiated accusations of corruption, the war on Planned Parenthood is all about anxieties over womens changing roles and the way that reproductive health care access aids that. The Benghazi hearings will about trying to send the message that Hillary Clinton is weak and soft on terrorism. But this message cannot help but feed off sexist beliefs about women being weak and incapable of handling big, supposedly manly jobs like being the President. .... A similar talking point was trotted out during the Planned Parenthood hearings, when Rep. John Duncan asked Richards, Surely you dont expect us to be easier on you because youre a woman? But while Duncan wanted audiences to believe a man would get the same treatment, it was quite obvious to anyone watching who wasnt an anti-choice fanatic that this was not the case at all. Richards was getting a level of hostility from these easily threatened men that another man would not get. The fact that she held up under that ended up making her look stronger, particularly in comparison to these men who are so easily frightened at the idea of women making choices for themselves. Theres a lesson in this, though Republicans will likely not see it in time. They clearly hope to make Clinton look weak and timid and to play off all sorts of ugly sexist stereotypes to undermine her campaign. But they may, in fact, just be giving her a chance to show off how strong she can be when shes being bombarded by a bunch of condescending men who clearly have issues with powerful women. By the end of it, the narratives about who is weak and who is strong may end up completely inverted from the story they set out to tell. You can pretend it doesn't happen, or it isn't really there, but we can see the ugly elephant in the room.
