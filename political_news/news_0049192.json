File/Staff × Charleston’s legal community Thursday grilled mayoral candidates on law, justice and public safety in the Holy City.\nTo stay up-to-date on the race for Charleston’s next mayor, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android .\nSix candidates are running for the city’s top post: Ginny Deerin, William Dudley Gregorie, Toby Smith, Leon Stavrinakis, John Tecklenburg and Maurice Washington. Each one hopes to replace Riley, who has led the city for 40 years. They all participated in the Law and Justice forum, which was held at Founders Hall at Charles Towne Landing.\nSeveral dozen people attended the forum, which was sponsored by six organizations: the Charleston County Bar Association, South Carolina Chapter of the Federal Bar Association, Charleston School of Law, Charleston Area Justice Ministry, League of Women Voters Charleston Area and Thurgood Marshall Society.\nDeerin, founder of the youth program WINGS for Kids, several times talked about how serving youth better ultimately could reduce poverty. That, in turn, could reduce crime, she said.\n“We need youth programs, summer programs and jobs programs,” she said.\nState Rep. Leon Stavrinakis, who is a lawyer, said efforts should be made to reform laws that criminalize poverty. “Sometimes, if you can’t pay a fine, guess what, you’re not going home,” he said.\nHe doesn’t think people should end up in jail for petty crimes, he said. “We need to make sure we don’t take poverty and make it a jail sentence.”\nCity Councilman William Dudley Gregorie said the city needs to review the list of reasons for which police can stop, detain and search vehicles. On that list now are things such as someone appearing nervous or wearing a certain type of clothing. There are items on that list that could be construed as racial profiling, he said.\n“We need to look at things systemically,” he said. “Black lives matter.”\nSmith, executive director of Midland Park Community Ministries, who is black, said earlier this year, she was stopped because her third tail light was out. “Even though I had nothing to fear, I have fear in my heart,” she said.\nTecklenburg, a businessman, said if he’s elected, he would conduct audits of all city departments, including the police department.\nOne of the things he would try to do is reduce the attrition rate of the city’s police officers. It’s expensive to train officers, he said. “We need to look at compensation and benefits.”\nHe also said the police department needs a meaningful citizens’ review committee.\nWashington, a businessman, said there needs to be a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination by police officers. But, he said, first the city needs to find ways to break down barriers between police and citizens, give officers proper training and have mental health services available for them.\nThe election is Nov 3.\nReach Diane Knich at (843) 937-5491.", "external_links": ["http://www.palmettopolitics.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palmetto-politics/id897497885?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:51:38.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
