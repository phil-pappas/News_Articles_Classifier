(AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\nAssociated Press Oct. 22, 2015 | 12:14 a.m. EDT + More By ANDREW SELIGMAN, AP Sports Writer\nCHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Cubs were so hot down the stretch they had their long-suffering fans thinking this just might be their year.\nThe Mets swept that notion away.\nThe Cubs lost 8-3 on Wednesday as New York wrapped up a four-game sweep in an NL Championship Series that had Chicago's faithful eagerly hoping for more. Instead, the Cubs' World Series championship drought that dates to 1908 will last another year.\nThe Cubs had finished with the third-best record in the majors and stormed into this series with 12 wins in 13 games. Even though they were shut down by the Mets pitching staff and never led in the NCLS, the Cubs insist this is a start, not an end.\nThey believe they are poised for even bigger things in the years to come with young sluggers such as Anthony Rizzo and rookies Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber powering their lineup.\nBesides those big boppers, they can point to front-line starters in Cy Young candidate Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester, not to mention a fun-loving manager who happens to rank among the majors' best in Joe Maddon.\nAfter five straight losing seasons and a painful rebuild under president of baseball operations Theo Epstein, this was the payoff: 97 wins. Their first postseason appearance since 2008. Their first trip to the NLCS since 2003. And the Cubs' first playoff series-clinching victory at Wrigley Field, against the hated St. Louis Cardinals, no less.\nBut after eliminating St. Louis and Pittsburgh, in the wild card game — the only two teams that finished with better records this season — the Cubs managed just eight runs against the Mets' stingy staff led by Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom.\nArrieta and Lester lost the first two games of the NCLS, too, and the Cubs fared no better sending Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel out, either. Hammel last just one batter into the second inning Wednesday night and was booed as he left the mound.\nAfterward, Maddon was asked what his wish list for next season looks like. He noted that Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer will call those shots, but then made clear his priority.\n\"You're always going to look to augment your pitching, you always do,\" he said. \"For me, you look among the players ... it's more a pitching-oriented sort of thing for me, but you'll have to talk to the guys (Epstein, Hoyer) about that.\"\nDespite the quiet loss in the NLCS, it will be viewed as a good year for Epstein, Maddon and the Cubs.\nThey expected to be better — but this good? Maddon's arrival and Lester's $155 million deal signaled the Cubs were serious after young players started to arrive last year. But Bryant and Schwarber kicked things to another gear.\n\"I want them to understand and embrace all that they have done well this year,\" Maddon said. \"And also understand that we go to spring training next year, we can just jump on it, we know what we want to do and we can just do it.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
