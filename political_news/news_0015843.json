You could’ve started earlier, worked harder, stayed later — what were you thinking? It’s all your fault.\nLiving with a guilt-prone mind is exhausting, in short. And yet, weirdly, the bulk of the psychological research points to some serious social perks of always feeling guilty, writes Christian Jarrett in a post at the British Psychological Society’s Research Digest, in that the guilt-prone tend to have better relationship skills than people who do not often feel guilty. Now, Jarrett writes, some new research starts to hint at why this might be: Guilty types are pretty great at reading other people’s emotions, as it turns out.\nIn the study, published in Cognition and Emotion , a team of Australian researchers first measured the guilt-prone tendency of 363 people, by presenting them with a variety of scenarios and asking them how they’d feel as a result. “For example, one involved making a big mistake on a work project,” Jarrett writes. “From the range of answers available, participants who said they'd think ‘I should have recognised the problem and done a better job’ were considered to have shown evidence of guilt-proneness.”\nThey then asked all of the study volunteers to take a test psychologists often use to measure emotional intelligence: Participants are shown a series of photographs of facial expressions and are asked to judge whether the person looks afraid, happy, sad, and so on. The results showed that the more guilt-prone the participants were, the better they did on the emotion-reading test. And the link does make a certain amount of sense. Emotional intelligence is all about promoting group harmony; likewise, a tendency to feel guilt signals that you're concerned with taking responsibility for your actions, again, in order to keep up that group cohesion. In short: The feeling of feelings is a considerably complicated business.", "external_links": ["http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2015.1072497?journalCode=pcem20", "http://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/guilt-prone-people-are-highly-skilled.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:33.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
