Mark Kenny provides analysis.\nPT1M13S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Business, welfare, and union leaders plan to press new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison to commit to tangible reform in the near term to unshackle a sluggish economy and reposition Australia for the Asian century at a meeting, dubbed a mini-summit in Canberra on Thursday.\nIn a powerful statement of intent the peak bodies say years of political gridlock has made the reform task urgent, and they now want an emphasis on \"actual doable\" policies, rather than more talk.\nThe push comes amid fresh hopes that change might again be possible out of Canberra, after the key leaders from the August 28 National Reform Summit - jointly sponsored by Fairfax Media and News Corporation - were summoned by Mr Turnbull to the Cabinet Room to discuss ideas.\nKate Carnell Photo: Louise Kennerley\nHigh on their list is tax reform around which there is an emerging national consensus, including for a lower company tax rate, addressing bracket creep, and a tightening of generous high-end superannuation tax breaks that allow wealthier taxpayers to divert significant income into concessionally taxed super accounts. Other long-sought changes such as an increase to the GST and serious labour market reform, however, remain the subject of disagreement.\nAdvertisement While the Abbott government had simply ruled out any negative changes to superannuation indefinitely, the reform proponents say tax concessions designed to encourage saving for retirement are costing the budget billions in revenue forgone - with the overall costs, currently at around $33.5 billion, set to outstrip the total outlay on the age pension by 2018-19. The age pension cost the budget $44.2 billion in 2015-16. Treasury forecasts suggest both hemispheres of the retirement incomes pie will exceed $50 billion before the end of this decade.\nAt least of some of this could be clawed back by cutting the concessional rates for high income earners, described by the Greens leader Richard Di Natale on Wednesday as a \"tax haven for the wealthy\".\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull Photo: Rohan Thomson\nChief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kate Carnell said business groups were looking for \"actual, doable\" policies on issues such as workforce participation.\n\"If we can't get more women, young and older people into the workforce, we can't get productivity up,\" she said.\nAnd in echoes of Bob Hawke's new consensus of the early 1980s, the ACTU has declared it is \"ready to roll up its sleeves\" to \"work with the government, business and community groups to kick-start urgent action to grow the economy, create jobs and lift living standards\".\nACTU leader Dave Oliver. Photo: Anna Kucera\nBut unions say the reform task cannot be seen as simply cutting wages and other costs for employers and reducing taxes.\n\"We want to engage on the high road of reform - not the low road of reducing wages, stripping conditions or cost shifting on to working families,\" said ACTU secretary Dave Oliver.\n\"Cutting your way to growth doesn't work - the European experience of austerity measures has shown that this is a lazy and destructive answer which is not a path to long term, sustainable economic growth.\"\nGathering his economic ministers together on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull sent out the right signals, albeit in broad brushstrokes rather than specific detail, which all agree is the hard part of reform.\n\"We think it's been a very useful exercise and we look forward to a frank discussion with the principal players tomorrow,\" he said.\nBusiness leaders, some of whom had given up serious hope of forcing the reform pace under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, are once again angling for bold reform, including in industrial relations, which was a virtual no-go area for the Abbott government seeking to avoid any WorkChoices-style campaigns.\nMs Carnell said there were many changes beyond industrial relations that would benefit different sections of the economy and lift productive output.\n\"With women, we know it's about affordable childcare and effective tax. If they can't have money in their pocket, they can't go back to work,\" she said.\n\"For young people it's ensuring they have the skills businesses need and ensuring businesses have the support they need to employ young people.\"\nAnd she criticised the standard Work for the Dole approach, saying governments should be helping young unemployed people with training across a range of industries.\nShe said ACCI also wanted a competitive tax package that fixed income tax bracket creep and lowered corporate tax rates to 20 per cent over time.\n\"That would mean that the GST would need to be part of the mix. That means an appropriate compensation package needs to be worked up and put on the table,\" she said.\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions developed a blueprint of reforms it is chasing after the initial national reform summit in August.\nAmong measures it is seeking are calls for more investment in science, technology and innovation, including the reinstatement of funding that had been cut from the CSIRO.\nAlong with ACCI, it wants more affordable childcare and improved training opportunities to boost workforce participation, and it is also demanding increased investment in higher education and TAFE.\nIts brief recommends government introduce universal protections and entitlements for workers, as well as a requirement for companies to train Australian workers in the same areas that they currently employ people on 457 visas.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-01T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:10:44.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
