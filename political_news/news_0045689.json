Liberty Common's principal, former Colorado Congressman Bob Schaffer, then shared the post and called candidate Tomi Grundvig an \"excellent education leader\" who would provide \"sensible stewardship\" of Thompson. \nLiberty Common has 566 followers to its Facebook page. Schaffer, who lost a 2004 bid for U.S. Senate, has more than 3,900 \"friends\" on his personal page. \nAdministrative law judge Matthew E. Norwood called the violation \"minor,\" and ruled that \"no government money of any significant amount was spent to make the contribution.\" He also focused on the post to the school's specific page, not Schaffer's personal page. \nTo read more, go to http://noconow.co/1jF1VZa . \n(Copyright Â© 2015 Fort Collins Coloradoan, All Rights Reserved) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LUwK6K TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:50:19.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
