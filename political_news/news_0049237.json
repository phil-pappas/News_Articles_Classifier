Refugee Agency.\nBut compounding the problem for many countries who are offering asylum to refugees is the alarming number of migrants seeking better economic opportunities.\nIn the last year, civil war has forced 15 million people to flee Syria and Iraq; 1.1 million people have been displaced in Yemen; more than 500,000 have fled South Sudan; 190,000 in Burundi; and 300,000 in Libya, according to U.N.
