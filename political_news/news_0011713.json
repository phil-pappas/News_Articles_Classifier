Others blame the economy, even as unemployment is down to 4.7 percent. More than 1,700 pantries remain in Ohio, but the closures come as the state is ranked as one of the worst in the nation for food insecurity, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in September. And more than 1.66 million people — close to 1 in 6 of the state’s population — are on food stamps.\nOfficials at the Ohio Association of Foodbanks think the closures are the result of higher demand after many people were taken off food stamps following a reinforcement of a work requirement in 2013.\nUnder the requirement, able-bodied adults ages 18 to 50 who don’t have any dependents must spend at least 20 hours a week working, training for a job, attending class or volunteering in order to receive food assistance.\nThe requirement was waived for a few years during the recession and then reapplied to most of the state except in counties with high unemployment rates. The number of Ohio residents receiving food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has decreased by more than 115,000 since January 2014, when individuals began losing benefits for not meeting the requirement.\n“There is a clear relationship between food-pantry use and SNAP eligibility” said Brad Draper, corporate director of food-pantry services at a Columbus pantry operated by Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio. “If it becomes harder to qualify for SNAP, obviously that generates greater demand.” But officials at the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services say there’s no evidence work requirements cause large numbers of people to be taken off food stamps.\n“It’s important that we provide both immediate assistance to individuals who are struggling to purchase food and long-term assistance in the form of job training or education or volunteer work,” said Ben Johnson, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. “The requirements do not deny anyone food assistance. All they do is — in addition to food assistance — the individual also receives job training or something similar.”\nJob and Family Services calculated that about 140,000 individuals on food stamps would have to fulfill the work requirements when they took effect. Johnson said they tracked the program for the first eight months and many people did not lose benefits because of the reinstated requirements, but he could not provide an exact number.\n“While we are very grateful of the recent increase that we received in the state budget, there isn’t enough money in the system to offset nearly half a billion dollars in food-stamp cuts,” said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.\nThe network of pantries is challenged by the need from so many Ohioans and operating with mostly faith-based volunteers, she said.\nMarilyn Tomasi, vice president of marketing and communications at the Mid-Ohio Foodbank, blamed the higher demand on food pantries on the economy, saying, “As folks talk about the economy getting better, those high-paying jobs are not coming back, so folks continue to struggle even though they are working at least in a full-time job and oftentimes two, even three part-time jobs.”\nMike Pajiban, 64, said he’s gone to the Lutheran Social Services Pantry on the South Side for almost a decade and has seen the effects of growing demand.\n“I appreciate what they can give,” Pajiban, a 20-year Army Reserve veteran, said of the pantry. “ They’ve had to be cut back. You used to be able to go twice a month, now it’s only once a month, but I’m still thankful for what is provided. It may not be everything, but everything we get we use.”\nPajiban said he and his wife used to get about $175 a month in food assistance, but over the years his benefits were cut to about $97. As he gathered bread and other food staples last week to feed his family, including his wife, daughter and two grandchildren, Pajiban said life without a pantry nearby would “be a challenge.”\nDina Berliner is a fellow in the E.W.
