God bless him for his success in that regard. Let’s see how long that last,” Bush said during an interview with Regent chancellor Pat Robertson.\nWhile Bush’s super PAC remains heavily funded, his campaign fundraising has slowed in recent months. He reported collecting $13.4 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, less than Ben Carson, who led the field with about $20 million. Bush ended September with about $10 million in cash.\nThe former Florida governor indicated to the audience of 700 in a Regent theater that he’s far from done.\n“I’m all in with the primary states including Virginia. … Every dollar we can save in overhead is a dollar that goes on television, that goes on radio, goes on media, goes on voter outreach.”\nWith three months remaining before voters start choosing their nominees, Bush is cutting staff in his main office in Miami to bolster operations in key early primary and caucus states. The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 1 and are followed in quick succession by the New Hampshire primary a week later, then Nevada and South Carolina. Virginia’s primary is March 1.\nWhen Robertson noted that Bush had collected about $500,000 at a fundraiser recently in Detroit, the 62-year-old candidate said “This fundraising stuff is not as easy it looks.”\nWith a nod to Robertson’s viewer-sponsored Christian Broadcasting Network, Bush added, “I know you guys do great.”\nDuring his hourlong appearance, Bush also explained his stances on several issues including education and his desire to shift more government power from Washington to state capitals.\nThe federal government should have minimal involvement in education, Bush said, but should promote the use of school vouchers that allow students use tax funds to attend private schools if they so choose.\nA convert to the Roman Catholic faith, Bush said he favors a Catholic principle of subsidiarity, meaning that issues should be handled by the smallest, least centralized authority.\nStates should be in more control of education, transportation and energy, he said. “We have to fix those things by pushing power back to the states.”\nIf Virginia wants to allow drilling for gas and oil off it’s coast, it should have the freedom to do so, he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nBill Bartel, (757) 446-2398, bill.bartel@pilotonline.com \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
