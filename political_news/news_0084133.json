Ruth Bryan Owen, the first woman to serve on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the nation’s first female ambassador, was born on this day in 1885 in Jacksonville, Illinois. Owen was the daughter of William Jennings Bryan, President Woodrow Wilson’s secretary of state and three-time Democratic presidential nominee. In 1929, Owen became Florida’s — and the South’s — first female representative in Congress.\nIn 1903, she dropped out of the University of Nebraska to marry William Leavitt. The couple had two children before divorcing in 1909. She married Reginald Owen, a British army officer in 1910, and had two more children. During World War I, she was a nurse in the Egypt-Palestine campaign.\nOwen first ran for Congress in 1926 but lost the Democratic primary contest for Florida’s 4th District by fewer than 800 votes. After her second husband died after a sickness he incurred during World War I, she ran again and won.\nHer GOP opponent, however, challenged her victory on the grounds that she had lost her citizenship when she married a non-U.S. citizen. Owen took her case to the House Committee on Elections, where she successfully argued that no American male had ever lost citizenship through marriage and that she was being discriminated against as a woman.\nOnce in Congress, she launched an annual program — using some of her own money — to bring high school students from her district to Washington. After winning reelection in 1930, she was defeated for the Democratic nomination in 1932 by a candidate advocating the repeal of prohibition.\nAfter Owen left the House in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named her U.S. minister to Denmark and Iceland. She served there until 1936, when she married Borge Rohde, a Dane. Subsequently, she served as U.S. delegate to the San Francisco Conference, which established the United Nations after World War II.\nOwen died in 1954 in Copenhagen.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:37:23.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
