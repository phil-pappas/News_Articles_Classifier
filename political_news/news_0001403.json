Werkheiser’s name will appear twice on the Nov. 3 election ballot, once for a two-year term and once for a four-year term. Werkheiser, a Democrat, and Republican Judi Coover are the only two candidates for two two-year openings, meaning that only an improbable massive write-in campaign could prevent him from winning one of those openings. Werkheiser also is among four candidates seeking three openings for four-year terms. If Werkheiser finishes in the top three in that race with incumbents Jerry Lastowski, Tom Felver and Rich Wielebinski, Werkheiser would have to declare which seat he wants. If that happens, the seat he declines would be declared vacant. Then the four commissioners elected next month would appoint a fifth commissioner to office in January. What this means for Pocono Township voters this year is that they could vote once or twice for Werkheiser on Nov. 3. In nearly every other circumstance, a candidate would be barred by the Pennsylvania First Class Township Code from running for two seats. But this year is different because Pocono Township is transitioning from a second-class to a first-class township. The result is that all five positions are open simultaneously and some terms are staggered. Eventually, there will be regularly scheduled elections only for four-year terms, with elections held every other year. Voters approved a referendum in November 2013 to become a first-class township, replacing three elected supervisors with five elected commissioners. Werkheiser, who was an incumbent supervisor, actually won re-election that night to a new six-year term, but he couldn’t take office because the referendum passed, too. The Monroe County judiciary appointed five commissioners who took office in January 2014 — as required by the first-class code — pending next month’s election. Werkheiser, who was penalized by the system in 2013, is benefitting from the system now. Werkheiser — who checked in advance with elections officials on the legality of running twice — sees nothing wrong with seeking two seats. “I did some investigating and I was told I was allowed to do it,” Werkheiser said. “I don’t make the laws.” If he wins both seats, Werkheiser said he is leaning toward accepting a four-year position. So what do the other candidates think of Werkheiser’s double candidacy? “I think it’s interesting he was the only one clever enough to realize he could run for both,” said Coover, a Republican who also is virtually assured of winning a two-year position. “Any of (the other candidates) could have run for both. “It won’t happen again,” Coover added. “It will always be four-year positions, and you won’t be able to vote for the same person twice.” Lastowski said he was aware of the option of running for two seats but decided to seek only a four-year position. “I thought it wasn’t a fair option, so I chose not to do it,” Lastowski said. “I think that is unfair and unethical and I won’t do that.” Felver said the strategy of running twice could backfire on Werkheiser, that many voters might cast just one ballot for him. “I talked to Harold once this year on this, and I thought it was splitting his vote,” Felver said. “They can vote twice for him, but I’m not sure the public understands that.” Felver, a Republican, said he isn’t opposed to Werkheiser's decision, but thought it was best for him to seek just one office. “I didn’t want to hedge bets,” Felver said. “I want the public to decide who’s best to represent them.” Wielebinski said, “I don’t really have an opinion” on Werkheiser’s double candidacy. The Republican candidate said he knew the option existed but decided he would only seek one office. Werkheiser will likely face another unusual situation after taking office next year. He sued the old township supervisors board — while still a supervisor himself — after the other two supervisors removed him from an appointed job as township roadmaster. That case against the township is still in litigation. The roadmaster position doesn’t exist in first-class townships. Though second-class supervisors can and often do appoint themselves to township jobs, first-class commissioners are prohibited by the state code from being employed by the township they represent.
