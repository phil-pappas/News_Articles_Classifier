Media Galleries \nThe ad, paid for by the Republican National Committee, highlights Clinton's comment that she \"did not email classified material to anyone.\" Hundreds of her emails have been retroactively classified, though, as U.S. agencies have reviewed their contents before their release. \n\"Hillary Clinton is not telling us the truth ... again,\" the ad says in text displayed on screen. \nThe five-figure ad buy will put the 30-second spot on cable television and online -- where it will be specifically targeted toward supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's toughest primary opponent thus far. \n\"Hillary Clinton's growing scandals and the multiple investigations into the potential mishandling of classified info is a mess of her own creation. As Democrats debate in Vegas the RNC will continue to remind voters, including Democrats, why the vast majority of Americans find Clinton to be dishonest and untrustworthy,\" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:45:11.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
