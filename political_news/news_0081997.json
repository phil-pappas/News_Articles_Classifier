The map of the Anglia region looks true blue, the Tories won all but 6 constituencies across the East at the General Election. And the Prime Minister says he has the mandate to deliver the promises in his manifesto.\nBut there are still tricky issues to deal with. On the NHS David Cameron told me he is \"of course concerned\" about Addenbrookes being the latest hospital in our region to be put into special measures. He says there is more money going into the NHS but says there is more to do . And he says he expects more GPs to work together in federations to help tackle the issue of lack of GPs in some parts of our region.\nHe faces concerns from amongst his own MPs about the cuts to child tax credits coming down the line, Waveney MP Peter Aldous has said he has \"serious concerns about the impact on working families\". The Prime Minister wouldn't say if he agreed with the Suffolk MP but says that he believes there is a \"fair package\" being put forward for working families.\nOf course David Cameron has already said he will stand down as Conservative leader and PM before the next election. There is a long list of Conservative MPs who may replace him, including South West Norfolk MP Liz Truss , South Northamptonshire MP Andrea Leadsom and Witham MP Priti Patel. I asked David Cameron if he thought it was time for another female leader of the Party, the Prime MInister said he \" wouldn't wreck anyone's career\" by backing them.\nYou can watch Emma's interview with David Cameron by clicking below.\nPlay video Last updated Mon 5 Oct 2015 Politics Essex Hertfordshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:57:13.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
