(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via Associated Press) By Editorial Board October 21 at 7:25 PM AT A TIME when populists and other political outsiders are spooking political establishments in the United States and other Western countries, Canada’s election this week was something of an outlier. Though incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who had served nearly a decade, was bumped out of office, the winner was a thoroughly mainstream leader of Canada’s center left, Justin Trudeau, whose father, Pierre Trudeau, was Canada’s most renowned modern prime minister.\nJustin Trudeau will reverse a few of Mr. Harper’s policies, including his commitment of a half-dozen Canadian planes to the bombing campaign against the Islamic State and the purchase of new F-35 jets. But his policies will be, if anything, more in keeping with Canada’s political traditions than those of Mr. Harper, and he is likely to have better relations with the Obama administration.\nMr. Harper was relatively successful in steering Canada’s economy, and his support for human rights and democratic principles was notable at a time when the United States’ voice was more muted. However, he was tripped up by the collapse of oil and other resource prices, which caused an economic slowdown, and he offended many with his attempt to win votes with a crude attack on veiled Muslim women . The 43-year-old Mr. Trudeau offered a change of tone: “A positive, optimistic, hopeful vision of public life,” as he put it in his victory speech.\nHis come-from-behind campaign, which saw his Liberal Party surpass the more leftist New Democratic Party as well as Mr. Harper’s Conservatives, featured an economic platform that might have been borrowed from President Obama. Mr. Trudeau promised to raise taxes on the rich, increase the budget deficit and spend the funds on infrastructure. He also hopes to cobble together a plan to reduce carbon emissions in time for an international summit meeting in Paris this December. A more constructive Canadian stance on that issue might give Mr. Obama reason to finally support the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from western Canada to the Gulf Coast.\nMr. Trudeau has been noncommittal on the newly concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership, a vital free-trade treaty including the United States and other Pacific Rim countries, but unlike Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, he did not seek electoral advantage by coming out against it . The White House reported that in a phone conversation after the election, Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Obama agreed on the need to implement the treaty’s “high standards,” which we hope means Mr. Trudeau will support its ratification.\nIt remains to be seen if Mr. Trudeau, who was a snowboarder and teacher before entering politics just eight years ago, will prove to be a competent manager of government or a leader who can overcome Canada’s considerable divisions. He begins, however, with a reservoir of goodwill, the product of a campaign more focused on what he called “ sunny ways ” than anger. If it lasts, Canada will be better off.\nRead more about this topic:\nCharles Krauthammer: Stop kicking Canada around\nRichard G.
