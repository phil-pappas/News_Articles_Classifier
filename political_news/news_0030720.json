Here are the relevant Quote: s from the editorial, followed by my comments:\nT-P: \"He fought to hold the Army Corps of Engineers accountable for the levee failures and to get recovery resources for South Louisiana, including essential funding for coastal restoration.\"\nDavid Vitter has made a career out of fighting the Corps of Engineers on any and all issues, especially those that involve wetland permitting or other regulatory matters. For example, he opposed increasing the required mitigation area for destructive coastal development projects. During the Blanco administration he and his former staffer, now 6th District congressman Garret Graves (R-Baton Rouge), went ballistic when the corps denied a request by a North Shore landowner to clear cut vital coastal forests.\nT-P: \"He was a leader in forcing the corps to close the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet , which destroyed or damaged 600,000 acres of wetlands and worsened flooding during Katrina.\"\nClosing MR-GO was no longer controversial by the time Vitter opportunistically hopped on board the train to pull the plug on our infamous and deadly Hurricane Highway. Long before Katrina, I used to attend meetings with the corps to discuss the congressional de-authorization of MR-GO and I don't recall a peep from Vitter's staff.\nT-P: \"That (Vitter's) background will make him particularly suited to guide Louisiana's coastal restoration efforts as governor. His understanding of how Washington works and his connections there should help the state maximize federal resources for its $50 billion coastal master plan.\"\nMary Landrieu can take far more credit for federal funding for our coast than David Vitter, who has consistently bitten the hand of the Obama administration, rather than seeking to curry support for what is clearly a nonpartisan cause.\nT-P: \"There is arguably no more important issue for South Louisiana than shoring up the coast. Lives depend on it, and Sen. Vitter knows that. \"\nIf David Vitter knows that lives depend on success, then why is he, like Scott Angelle and Jay Dardenne, so vehemently opposed to the levee board lawsuit aimed to force industry to help pay for the coastal damage that it has created? And why are these three in total denial of the reality of our biggest threat â€” anthropogenic climate change?\nLen Bahr\nBaton Rouge", "external_links": ["http://www.davidvitter.com/plan_restoring_our_coast"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:36:46.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
