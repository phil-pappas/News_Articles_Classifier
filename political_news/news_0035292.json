Something that we all take for granted made its appearance on this date in 1933, when the first household detergent - named Dreft, and still in production - went on sale. The chemistry of making soap had changed little over hundreds of years, until shortages of fats for making soap during World War I sparked research. Detergents really took off following World War II, and by 1953, their sales had passed those of traditional soaps. Now, detergents have all but replaced soap-based products for laundry, dishwashing, and household cleaning, and most soaps for personal hygiene also contain some detergents. Some 637 U.S. manufacturers produce $23 billion worth of detergents and soaps each year.
