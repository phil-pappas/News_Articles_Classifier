The 72-year-old Vice President made the announcement Wednesday at the White House with his wife and President Obama by his side. He said the window of opportunity to launch a successful campaign had passed. Biden had privately struggled with the decision since the death of his son, Beau, from brain cancer in May. He told a New York Times columnist in August that his son pleaded with him to run because he believed the White House would be better off guided by his father's values. Biden first ran for president in 1988 but ended the race when accused of plagiarism, which he later acknowledged as “a mistake” from his youth. He ended a 2008 run with the first primary caucus in Iowa, and was later tapped to be Obama's running mate. Historian Joel Goldstein, a professor at St. Louis University, says Biden has continued the pattern of consequential vice presidents. “He's been an important and trusted adviser and troubleshooter, and has handled very significant assignments,” Goldstein said, a pattern that began with Richard Nixon and continued through Dick Cheney. Beau Biden's death was the second tragedy for the family. Biden's his first wife and daughter died in a Christmastime car crash in 1972 that injured sons Beau and Hunter. Biden took his Senate oath of office a few weeks later while at the boys' bedside in the hospital. Biden grew up in Scranton and often refers to the city the as his home. He lived there until age 10. Biden's decision clears the way for Hillary Clinton. The latest Suffolk University Poll shows Clinton leading the Democratic field with backing from 41 percent of primary voters; Sanders had 23 percent and Biden, 20.
