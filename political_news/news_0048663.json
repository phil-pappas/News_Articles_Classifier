Ben Carson says he would “intensify” the war on drugs squarepush3r Uncle Buck Fan Club this guy, who I kind of liked, just wrote himself out of my book http://rare.us/story/ben-carson-says-he-would-intensify-the-war-on-drugs/ The proposition that the war on drugs has been a complete failure continues to become more of a national consensus, as evidenced by polling in recent years, the proliferation of relaxed marijuana laws in multiple states and even both major parties promoting criminal justice reform. In 1996, conservative icon William F. Buckley led the anti-drug war charge when National Review published its cover story The War On Drugs Is Lost. That was nearly twenty years ago. On Wednesday, Glenn Beck had a rapid fire question-and-answer session with Republican presidential frontrunner (at least in Iowa) Ben Carson. At one point Beck asked, “Do you continue the war on drugs?” Carson’s reply? “Absolutely, I intensify it.” We can’t be exactly sure of what Dr. Carson means by “intensifying” the drug war. Before that comment, Beck asked “Legalized marijuana?” Carson said, “I disagree with that.” At the same moment an emerging majority of Americans are embracing legalization and leaders in both parties are calling for an end to drug related harsh sentencing, it’s hard to imagine a more counterproductive position to take, for Carson’s party and his own candidacy. Besides a majority supporting legalization today, the 90 million Americans that qualify as Millennials will be the largest voting bloc in the country in the not too distant future. Even 63 percent of Republican Millennials agree with marijuana legalization. Good luck with that, Dr. Carson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:23:57.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
