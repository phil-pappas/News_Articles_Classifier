Naturally, the powers that be at CNN view this as an inconvenient truth to be aired in public. Given the left-wing media’s recent hysteria over Ben Carson’s “anti-Muslim” comments, Carson has been invited to speak at many TV news shows as the usual suspects try to trip him up and frame him as a hateful bigot.\nTrue to form, Wolf Blitzer dutifully executed his duties as commanded. Watch him badger Ben Carson and demand that he swear fealty to The Narrative and recognize President Obama’s Christian bona fides.\nBlitzer even managed to drop the “birther” meme, as if it didn’t originate with Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential campaign in 2008.\nThis is CNN at its best, or worst, depending on your sense of humor.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nl4iY38QpeA", "http://google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?tpl=safari&#038;site=theblacksphere.net&#038;hl=en-us"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:33:36.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
