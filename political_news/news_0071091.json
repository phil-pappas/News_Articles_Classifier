Boehner if House Republicans are willing to rally behind his vision, capping after a lengthy wait to hear from the man who many had tapped as the only savior for the bitterly divided caucus. \nMr. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican, gave members until Friday to decide whether they agree with his vision for the party, one that includes trumpeting big ideas, making clear policy choices and a cooperative effort to change the way the House operates. \nHe demanded a healthy work-life balance so he could spend time with his family, and said members cannot move to oust the speaker whenever they see fit. \n“If the members agree with his requests and share his vision, and if he is a unity candidate—with the endorsement of all the conference’s major caucuses—then he will serve as speaker. He will be all in,” Mr. Ryan ’s spokesman, Brendan Buck, said in a breakdown of what happened behind closed doors in a House GOP conference meeting. \nMr. Ryan , a 45-year-old father of three school-aged children, had resisted calls to assume the post, saying he prefers his tax-whiz role as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Yet the Wisconsin Republican and 2012 vice presidential candidate huddled Tuesday with vocal conservatives who’ve asserted their influence over the race, the start of a frenzied Capitol Hill evening capped by an address to the full GOP conference. \nA spectrum of GOP members begged him to step into the role, casting him as the only person who could unite the party ahead of a full slate of autumn decisions on raising the nation’s debt limit, funding highway projects and keeping the government open past mid-December. \n“I’m not sure anybody can reach 218,” said Rep. Bill Huizenga, Michigan Republican, referring to the number of votes a candidate needs to become speaker. “If Paul can’t, I’m not sure who can.” \nEven Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid picked the former 2012 vice presidential candidate as the best man for the job, even if it probably wasn’t the type of endorsement that Mr. Ryan sought. \n“He appears to me to be one of the people over there that would be reasonable. I mean, look at some of the other people. I’m a Paul Ryan fan,” Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, said, prompting some to wonder if he was just trying to stir up the House GOP . \nMr. Boehner , Ohio Republican who faced repeated revolt from his right flank, planned to step down Oct. 30 but agreed to stay on until the caucus rallied around a successor. \nMr. Ryan met Tuesday with the House Freedom Caucus, an influential bloc of about three dozen conservatives who’d nudged Mr. Boehner out and then prodded Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California to withdraw his name from the speaker’s race. \nEarlier this month caucus had backed Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, forcing Mr. McCarthy to realize he might not be able to gather 218 votes from the chamber without making notable concessions to the small faction of conservatives. \nRep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas Republican, said the Freedom Caucus was still supporting Mr. Webster saying the party “can’t have just another Boehner 2.0.” \n“This is a job two heartbeats away from the presidency,” he added. “I think Republicans made a mistake in 2010 — I was part of the mistake — in which they crowned John Boehner as speaker before the election of November 2010.” \nOthers in the caucus cast the race as an open contest to see who will shake things up on Capitol Hill, saying they didn’t want to speculate about who’s in and who’s out of the race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:47:31.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
