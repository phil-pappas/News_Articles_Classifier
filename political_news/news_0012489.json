Let's take a stand against terror all together. Let's spoil the game that is played in our region,\" he said. The twin suicide bombings in the Turkish capital last Saturday claimed 102 lives and injured hundreds at a peace rally. After the attack, Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) co-chairman Selahattin Demirtaş held the government responsible for the blasts. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, Republican People's Party (CHP) leader urged Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu to dismiss interior and justice ministers, Selami Altınok and Kenan İpek, respectively, following the attack. Thirteen suspects are in custody as part of the investigation. \"We have begun to uncover the activities of ISIS which is always mentioned as the usual suspect and the network within this framework,\" Davutoğlu said on Thursday, adding that the probe was also looking into the identities of the suspected suicide bombers involved and the cooperation they allegedly received. The blasts have shaken Turkey as the country faces a general election re-run on Nov. 1, while counter-terrorism operations continue in the southeast and an ongoing civil war rages on along its southern border in Syria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:11:32.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
