The suits were filed after the rules were published in the Federal Register today.\nWhite House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz was asked by reporters Friday if he feels the legal action could create uncertainty for the president's goal of a successful climate deal in Paris as countries begin to assemble on Nov. 30. The deal would seek to lower carbon dioxide emissions that many scientists blame for increasing the Earth's temperature.\n\"[W]e are confident that this plan is on strong legal footing, and I'll explain why,\" Schultz said. \"The clean power plan is consistent with a text history and structure of the Clean Air Act, and it also gives the states the flexibility they need to implement it, and it reflects unprecedented public engagement, and finally is responsive to all of the feedback we received from stakeholders during [a] very long engagement process.\"\n  Obama says GOP field like Grumpy Cat He compared GOP climate change denials to a sick patient who refuses to listen to his doctors.\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/23/15 5:43 PM As Schultz was giving the daily press briefing, more lawsuits were being filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and a large contigent of oil refiners in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition, the Republican leadership joined with Democrats to introduce bipartisan resolutions of disapproval, which would repeal the climate change regulations.\nReporters continued to press Schultz at the briefing if the double-pronged attack on the power plan has the administration worried.\n\"Well, I am not surprised that our Republican critics have rushed to the courts to try to prevent something they were not able to do legislatively,\" said Schultz, referring to previous attempts by the GOP to squash the regulations in legislative riders and other bills. \"That's something they've shown an inclination to do on other issue areas, but we believe that this approach has been shaped by data, shaped by science and represents a balanced, pragmatic view of how to tackle this.\"\nHe added that the Clean Power Plan \"doubles down on flexibility and choice\" to accommodate utility firms and states' energy goals. The states argue that the plan is a federal \"power grab\" that looks to dictate how they develop their resources.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Press yawns, declares Hillary Clinton 'won' the Benghazi hearing Both left and right-leaning media appear to share the sentiment that Clinton \"won\" the Benghazi hearing.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/23/15 5:31 PM Top Story Justice won't charge IRS' Lois Lerner The   matter.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/23/15 3:04 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:01:47.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
