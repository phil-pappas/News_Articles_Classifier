(AP Photo/John Locher) \nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio raised $5.7 million during the third fundraising quarter, according to a Federal Election Commission filing released Thursday. \nThe Florida senator's campaign haul places him behind this quarter's heavyweight fundraisers Ben Carson and Jeb Bush, who raised $20 million and $13.4 million, respectively. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took in more than $12 million this quarter while former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina raised $6.8 million. \nThe campaign previously indicated Rubio had raised $6 million, though the FEC documents more specifically place that figure at $5.7 million. \nBut although Rubio did not raise as much money as other candidates, his war chest stands at nearly $11 million. The campaign boasted that it had stockpiled more money than the Bush campaign, which has $10.3 million on hand. The FEC filing indicated that Rubio's campaign spent $4.6 million during the third quarter. \n\"Thanks to smart budgeting and fiscal discipline, Marco Rubio for President started October with more money in the bank than Jeb Bush for President and most other campaigns,\" a statement to the press released by the campaign said. \nNotably, only $1.2 million -- or 21 percent of Rubio's total donations -- came from small-dollar donors who gave less than $200. That stands in stark contrast to Carson's massive fundraising total, 60 percent of which came from small donations. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:02:21.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
