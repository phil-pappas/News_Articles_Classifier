The bipartisan legislation, designed to require broadband capacity for any subsequent federally funded infrastructure project, is being referred to as the 'Dig Once' bill.\nThis bill would ensure that that any future highway and other infrastructure projects anticipate, plan for and include plastic broadband conduit pipes, given there is a \"demonstrated need\" for broadband in the subsequent fifteen years.\nThis requirement will not only provide for better highways, road, bridges and tunnels, but also for telecommunications capacity to carry more data in the future. By piggybacking on future federal infrastructure projects, this initiative will prevent wasteful re-digging and reduce construction-related impact on consumers.\n\"Bipartisan legislation like the bill presented by Eshoo and Walden correctly assumes that American innovators will continue to push the possibilities of an interconnected society. This bill arms Americans with expansive capabilities, both now and in decades from now,\" said Mike Montgomery , executive director of CALinnovates. \"Both sides of the aisle need to continue to advance forward-looking legislation that propels our country into the future.\"\n\"The new American economy requires fast, easy-to-access broadband technology built in to any and all infrastructure,\" said Kish Rajan, chief evangelist of CALinnovates. \"Legislation like the Eshoo-Walden bill drives economic innovation and job creation, especially in states like California .\"\nCALinnovates urges Congress to swiftly act on Rep. Eshoo and Rep. Walden's proposal to further our nation's capacity to innovate.\nCALinnovates brings together stakeholders in the technology and startup communities with government leaders to ensure a careful and considered approach in policies impacting the high-tech sector.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/145522\n releases/calinnovates-endorses-eshoo-walden-dig-once-broadband-legislation-300165268.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC36620&Transmission_Id=201510222113PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC36620&DateId=20151022", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140911/145522", "http://eshoo.house.gov/issues/economy/eshoo-walden-introduce-dig-once-broadband-deployment-bill/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/calinnovates-endorses-eshoo-walden-dig-once-broadband-legislation-300165268.html", "http://www.calinnovates.org/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140911/145522"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:12:29.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
