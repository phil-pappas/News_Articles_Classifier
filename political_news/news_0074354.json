Abrams, President Barack Obama has no intention of staying on the political sidelines during the 2016 campaign. Videos Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \nIn fact, White House officials are vowing the president will stay active both at private fundraisers and at campaign events to help Democratic candidates \"up and down the ticket in 2016.\" \n\"As head of the party, he'll be making sure candidates have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns and he'll be a forceful messenger for the values and priorities championed by Democrats,\" said top White House political strategist David Simas in a statement to CNN. \nWhite House officials caution the level of political activity won't vary too much from previous election cycles. \nDespite Obama's up and down poll numbers and Hillary Clinton's recent moves to distance herself from her one-time 2008 rival, the president remains very popular among Democrats. \nThe president has also signaled he will take increasingly risky political positions on hot-button issues like gun control.
