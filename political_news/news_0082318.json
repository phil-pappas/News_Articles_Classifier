So it's a very dangerous phenomenon,\" Sharif said.\nSharif said dealing with the extremist group was set to become an ever greater challenge than the Al-Qaeda network behind 9/11 attacks in the United States.\n\"I feel the future challenge is Daesh. It's a bigger name. Al-Qaeda was a name but Daesh is now a bigger name,\" Sharif said.\nThe General, popular for taking on militants from northwestern Pakistani tribal areas bordering Afghanistan to criminal gangs in Karachi, emphasised the reconciliation between Afghan Taliban and the Afghan government. He expressed his fear the Taliban could seek an alliance with Daesh unless they were brought back to the negotiating table.\n\"This reconciliation in Afghanistan is very important. If we do not do it in the proper manner and the Afghan Taliban splinter, they would go for a bigger name and that is Daesh,\" Sharif said.\nPakistan, which supported the Taliban during the 1990s, has blown hot and cold over the insurgency while contending it was working to bring about Afghan reconciliation.\nIslamabad organized the first set of direct peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government in July. But another round scheduled around later that month was stalled following the announcement of the death of Taliban founder Mullah Omar.\nGeneral Sharif launched operation \"Zarb-e-Azb\" in June 2014 in a bid to wipe out militant bases in the North Waziristan tribal area and so bring an end to the bloody decade-long Islamist insurgency that has cost Pakistan thousands of lives.\nThe army intensified its offensive after last year's Peshawar school attack which killed 151 since when there has been a lull in violence.\nThe last major attack in the city came in February when three heavily armed Taliban militants stormed a Shiite mosque, killing 21 people.\nOverall levels of violence have dropped dramatically this year, with 2015 on course for the fewest deaths among civilian and security forces since 2007 -- the year the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group was formed.\n ISIS London Pakistan Terrorism World Also Read ‘Even the mention of Liberty Chowk raises my hair’ 5 indicted for stoning pregnant woman to death in Pakistan India, Australia are blessed nations to have functioning democracies: PM Modi Islamic State defies air strikes by shelling Syrian Kurdish town", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Islamic%20State_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Islamic%20State_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151003/world-europe/article/pakistan-army-chief-say-would-not-allow-even-shadow-isis", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:11:06.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
