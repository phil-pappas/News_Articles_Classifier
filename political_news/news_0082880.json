The current standard of 75 parts per billion was set in 2008 during the administration of President George W. Bush.\nIn announcing the new standard, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the updated limit will “substantially increase” public health protections, particularly for at-risk groups such as children and people with asthma. Smog can exacerbate respiratory illnesses and has been linked to heart and lung disease and premature death.\nThe rule is based on the EPA’s review of 1,000 studies published since the agency’s last review of smog standards in 2008, as well as the types and severity of health effects of smog on sensitive groups, McCarthy said.\n“What I used to make that judgment is the science and the law,” she told reporters on a call. “I did not base it on a popularity contest.”\nCounties have until between 2020 and 2037 to meet the standards, depending on the severity of their pollution problem. States are responsible for devising plans to demonstrate how they will comply with the new limits.\nThe Rev. George Heartwell, the mayor of Grand Rapids, joined McCarthy for her announcement and said Americans have a “moral imperative” to be good stewards who ensure nature and its resources are “protected for generations.”\nGrand Rapids and all of Michigan is in compliance with the current standard, and “I’m confident that with the time allowed in this new rule, we’ll be able to meet the new standard,” Heartwell added.\nThe Southeast Michigan Council of Governments had urged the EPA not to revise the ozone standard in comments submitted to the agency earlier this year, noting the “significant” improvement in air quality in Metro Detroit during the past 15 years.\nAir quality “will continue to improve over the next decade due to stricter regulations on motor vehicles and industry that are just beginning to take effect,” the council wrote. “In fact, EPA’s own modeling predicts southeast Michigan would meet a 70 ppb standard by 2025, strictly by implementing regulations that are already in place or in the process of being finalized.”\nSEMCOG said air-quality monitors for ozone and other air pollutants in southeast Michigan didn’t need to issue any alerts this season because there were no days when they predicted elevated concentrations of smog.\nWhile the new standard is an improvement, several environmental groups said it falls short of adequately safeguarding public health. Regina Strong, director of the Michigan Beyond Coal campaign of the Sierra Club, called the EPA’s smog standard “weak” and said it’s “disheartening” the rule doesn’t go further to curb pollution.\nRep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized the new limits as harmful to the economy.\n“These new standards yank the rug out from under many communities who are still scrambling to implement the 2008 standards. Even some of our national parks will not be in compliance,” Upton said in a statement with Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Kentucky.\n“Countless communities cannot afford to be sidelined into ‘no growth’ zones. Jobs, manufacturing, and economic growth will greatly suffer.”\nRep. Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township, said the new ozone level standards are another “overreach” by the Obama administration.\n“Unable to achieve his political legacy through the deliberative legislative process, (Obama) has turned to governing through regulations and executive orders, and, now, Michigan will pay a steep price for what American manufacturers are calling the most expensive regulation in U.S. history,” Miller said in a statement.\nMiller highlighted an analysis by the National Association of Manufacturers estimates that complying with the new standards would cost U.S. industries $1.1 trillion.\nThe EPA estimates that meeting the new standard would prevent 160,000 missed school days, 230,000 asthma attacks and up to 660 premature deaths a year in 2025. The change would yield public-health benefits valued at $2.9 billion to $5.9 billion a year, starting in 2025, the agency forecasts.\n“These benefits outweigh the costs by as much as a ratio of 4 to 1,” McCarthy said. “This standard is achievable. ... The Clean Air Act gives states plenty of time and flexibility to meet the new standards.”\nmburke@detroitnews.com\n(202) 662-8736", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//detne.ws/1FJ8hRl&mini=true", "http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/ozonepollution/pdfs/ozonegb.pdf", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//detne.ws/1FJ8hRl&text=EPA%20tightens%20limit%20for%20smog-causing%20ozone%20emissions&via=detroitnews", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:24:10.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
