Gandhi, an ardent environmentalist, the Indian government said it would slash the rate of emissions relative to gross domestic product by 33-35 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels. Already, the country has reduced its carbon intensity by 12 percent since 2005, it said.\nEnvironment Minister Prakash Javadekar said India held its submission back so it could coordinate its filing with the Indian holiday celebrating Gandhi's birthday on Friday.\n\"Our every action will be cleaner than what it was earlier,\" Javadekar told reporters, insisting that Indian traditions and culture are already \"at one with nature.\"\nThe carbon intensity goal will allow India's emissions to grow as its economy expands, but at a lower rate than now.\n\"It is estimated that more than half of India of 2030 is yet to be built,\" the government said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made manufacturing and job creation a key promise of his administration, and has implored foreign companies and governments, with the slogan \"Make in India,\" to help.\nEnvironmental groups following the U.N. climate talks welcomed India's pledge.\n\"India now has positioned itself as a global leader in clean energy, and is poised to play an active and influential role in the international climate negotiations this December,\" said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a group based in New York.\nClimate analyst Samir Saran at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank, also described India's targets as ambitious and \"rooted in Indian reality,\" given the fact that at least 300 million citizens — a fourth of the population — still have no access to electricity at all, while hundreds of millions more make do with just a few hours a day.\nIndia also promised aggressive reforestation efforts, with enough new trees to absorb up to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2030, and laid out plans for adapting to changing weather and temperatures.\n\"This is a positive and novel Indian approach,\" Saran said, adding that India was effectively sharing responsibility for taking action to protect the climate while seeking global partnerships on implementing those plans.\nIndia plans a fivefold boost in renewable energy capacity in the next five years to 175 gigawatts, including solar power, wind, biomass and small hydropower dams.\nEven with a major boost in renewable energy, India is also planning to expand coal power — the biggest source of emissions — to satisfy its energy needs. Coal-fired power plants account for about 60 percent of India's installed power capacity.\nBy 2030, the government said its installed capacity from \"non-fossil fuel-based energy resources\" would grow to 40 percent. It was not immediately clear whether that would also include nuclear power.\nIndia said boosting its renewables to that level would require help with transfer of clean technology and financing — two of the crunch issues before the Paris deal, which is supposed to apply to all countries but also include provisions for rich countries to help poor countries fight climate change and adapt to its consequences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:30:41.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
