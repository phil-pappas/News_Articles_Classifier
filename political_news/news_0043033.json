This is why representatives of all parties have raised concerns about this issue.\" Promoted stories \nTory unease about the plans was on display at a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, where Mr Osborne was questioned about the measures. \nIn an effort to underline the importance of the plans as part of Mr Osborne's efforts to balance the books, the Treasury commissioned analysis on the level of public spending on tax credits that would have occurred without the Government's changes. \nThe figures show that before Mr Osborne's reforms since 2010, including the controversial cuts in July's Budget, spending on tax credits would have risen from £28.9bn in 2010-11 to £40bn a year in 2016-17. \nIt is now forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility to be just over £25bn in 2016-17 - around £15bn lower. \nGreg Hands, the Treasury Chief Secretary, said: \"Labour has opposed every single saving we've made in a welfare budget they let spiral completely out of control. \n\"When they left office, they had allowed means-tested payments to go so far up the income scale that nine out of ten families - including MPs - were eligible. \n\"Treasury analysis now shows that without the reforms we have embarked on, spending on tax credits would be rising to £40bn next year. Instead it's forecast to be £25bn. \n\"That £15bn that we've saved - while at the same time offering working people lower taxes and higher wages, thanks to our new personal allowance of £11,000 from April and the new National Living Wage - is the equivalent to £500 extra in income tax for every taxpayer.” \nHe added: \"Labour must now explain where the money is coming from. Their economic policy lurches further from chaos to incredibility.\" \nAlthough Tory MPs were elected on a manifesto commitment to cut the welfare bill, some have concerns about the way tax credits will hit those in work. \nFollowing the meeting of the 1922 Committee in the Palace of Westminster, Tory MP Steve Baker confirmed Mr Osborne had been asked about the issue. The High Wycombe MP said: \"Lots of us don't like the tax credit changes.\" \nHe said MPs were aware they were part of a package, which also included the new National Living Wage and the increase in the tax-free personal allowance. \n\"But colleagues are well aware that some families will miss out,\" he said. \n\"Lots of us are very concerned about it but the vast majority of colleagues accept that these changes are a consequence of all the other pledges we made in the manifesto.\" \nA number of Tories expect Mr Osborne to come up with plans to reduce the impact on low-paid workers. \nLondon mayor Boris Johnson said he believed the changes were under \"intensive review\" while former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell also suggested Mr Osborne may have to \"tweak\" the plans. \nStevenage MP Stephen McPartland - one of only two Tories to vote against the tax credit cuts - said he believed Mr Osborne was preparing to take action to soften the blow. \nMr McPartland told the BBC: \"I genuinely believe that we will be able to persuade him to tweak the policy. \n\"I believe he will because I believe he wants to look after those people and it will just have been a matter of maybe nobody understood the full impact.\" \nMr McPartland said that the prospect of a worker on £12,000 losing a 10th of his income \"doesn't sit right with me\", adding: \"There were and still are a number of Conservative MPs who are very unhappy about the changes.\" \nElswehere, Tory peer Lord Tebbit, the former Cabinet Minister, said he supported tax credit reform, but noted it \"depends how far and fast you want to go with this\". \nHe added: \"Clearly there should be transitioning. We are all agreed about that. Nobody is pulling the whole lot in one shot. The difficulty is to decide what is right, because there isn't surety about the numbers.\" \nMeantime, Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \"These changes, they are certainly hitting people further down the income distribution than the changes that were made under the last parliament. \n\"But the Chancellor made quite a big choice in the Budget. He has decided to hit people in work rather harder than people out of work. So, he has actually made the choice relatively speaking to protect some of the poorest people on tax credits.\" \nHe added: \"Wherever we end up in 2017, it's still going to be a much more generous system than we had back in 1997. The total level of spending back to about 2003 levels, not back to a world before tax credits.\" \nIn a separate development, Boris Johnson appeared to be backing away from his earlier reservations about the tax credit cuts as he emerged from a meeting of the political cabinet in Downing Street saying that reform was \"essential\". Share article \nThe London Mayor said: \"We have got to get people out of a system that is extremely cumbersome. I see people in London who are stuck in a system where they are systematically overpaid for one reason or another and then they have to pay back to the authorities. \n\"It's very, very distressing and we need to get out of these poverty traps. That's the reason why the reform is essential. We are in a situation where nine out of 10 families are locked into this thing. \"What we need to do is have the London Living Wage coming in and supporting those families,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:30:36.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
