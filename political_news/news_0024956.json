David Vitter , R-La., reiterated his dissatisfaction Wednesday with the Securities Investor Protection Corp. for failing to provide compensation for investors who bought fraudulent certificates of deposit from Texas businessman Allen Stanford.\nVitter told a Senate subcommittee Thursday that many brokers \"plaster the SIPC logo across their doors,\" offering assurances that they won't be victimized by a fraudulent investment.\n\"Investors believe that if their broker dealer fails, SIPC will be there to help them,\" Vitter told the subcommittee. \"I can tell you from experience watching the Stanford case, trying to help them however I can, that is just patently false.\"\nVitter said thousands of Louisiana investors, many from Baton Rouge, were left in the cold when the SIPC rejected a request from the Securities & Exchange Commission to compensate the victims.\nStanford, who ran the investment scheme that involved CDs from a foreign bank, was sentenced in 2012 to 110 years in prison for organizing what prosecutors said was an illegal Ponzi scheme.\nStephen Harbeck, president and CEO of the SIPC, defended the decision to deny compensation to Stanford investors in prepared testimony to the Senate Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment.\nHe called on the Senate to reject a bill offered by Vitter and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to compensate Stanford victims.\n\"The Restoring Main Street Investor Protection and Confidence Act, S. 67, would require SIPC to underwrite, guarantee, and pay the debt obligations, represented by Certificates of Deposit of the Stanford International Bank, a foreign bank in an offshore tax haven,\" Harbeck said. \"The Antiguan Bank CD purchasers knowingly sent their money away from a SIPC member to an Antiguan Bank where, in the words of the SEC, the claimants received 'high rates of return on CDs that greatly exceeded those offered by commercial banks in the United States.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:16:13.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
