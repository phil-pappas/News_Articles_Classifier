Trumps rise and sustained competitiveness in the race has been a trick that just about nobody -- perhaps not even the candidate himself -- thought that he could pull off initially, when those old rules still seemed to be in place. The same goes for Ben Carson, a man who campaigns sporadically and never met a tenuous Nazi analogy he didnt like, and is being rewarded handsomely in polls for his rhetorical shamelessness. And it says as much about modern presidential politics as it does either GOP outsiders political savvy. Put simply, the assumptions that govern campaigns are no longer operable. Trump and Carson are, in some respects, the symptom, not the cause. Everyone knew this election cycle could be a tough one for GOP insiders, but few realized initially just how tough. When Carly Fiorina is added to the mix -- another Republican White House contender who has never held public office -- the anti-politicians in the GOP field continue to poll at more than 50 percent among likely GOP primary voters. The biggest victims of this newcomer-enamored dynamic have been the very politicians that the GOP has long viewed as its best 2016 weapon: governors. . . . The GOP gave up its ability to be seen as adult, let alone leaders, by letting the teabaggers gain control with hiring Palin as VP for McCain. The outcome of the stupidity and down right flagrant ignorance, but vile and vulgar comments from her opened the door to the republican party admitting only the most stupid people on the planet in; only the children's table could come play politics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:15:09.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
