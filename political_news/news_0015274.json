Since then, China's currency has fallen 2.3 percent against the dollar. \nTreasury says it will be important going forward for China to allow its currency to again rise in value against the dollar when market forces dictate such a move. \nThe report, which Treasury is required by law to submit to Congress twice a year, did not charge any country with unfair currency manipulation. Such a designation could ultimately lead to trade sanctions.
