The video, \"Split Decisions,\" shows teens and tweens how to resolve conflict before it escalates to bullying online ( www.nsteens.org/Videos/SplitDecisions ). It's part of the free Internet safety site, www.NSTeens.org .\nAccording to the Cyberbullying Research Center, on average, 26 percent of students say they have been the victim of cyberbullying at some point in their lives, and 16 percent admitted they have cyberbullied others. Cyberbullying might start with an online rumor, a photo, or a forwarded message-and can escalate quickly, sometimes to aggressive and cruel harassment.\n\"Today children are constantly connected to their peers through social media and wireless devices, making them feel there is no escape when they are the victims of cyberbullying, and creating sometimes long-lasting or even tragic consequences,\" said Linda Krieg , NCMEC acting CEO. \"We want to stop cyberbullying before it starts, and with Sprint's support we created this video to help kids think about the consequences for themselves and others before they send that text, make that comment or post that picture.\"\nThe video tells the story of two teen girls who are having trouble getting along. Viewers follow them in two versions of their story with very different outcomes based on their decisions. One version of the story ends with them finding common ground and the other leads to digital drama.\nAt www.NSTeens.org , the video is paired with discussion guides and activity cards to make it easier for educators or parents to incorporate it into a lesson or conversation about digital citizenship. The site also has additional videos, web comics and games addressing other topics like online enticement, online security and digital ethics.\n\"The first stop to preventing cyberbullying is awareness and education\" said Debby Ballard , Director of Corporate Responsibility at Sprint. \"We feel it is our responsibility as a wireless provider to ensure the right tools are provided to address online harassment in this super-connected and digital world.\"\nNCMEC and Sprint launched www.NSTeens.org in 2007. It's part of NCMEC's popular Internet safety resource, NetSmartz Workshop ( www.NetSmartz.org ). It's funded as part of Sprint's Internet safety initiative, 4NetSafety ( www.4NetSafety.com ), through Sprint's charitable phone-recycling program, Sprint Project Connect. 4NetSafety is an important part of Sprint Good Works SM , an initiative that encompasses Sprint's community and philanthropic outreach across the country.\nAbout the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children\nThe National Center for Missing & Exploited Children is the leading 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working with law enforcement, families and the professionals who serve them on issues relating to missing and sexually exploited children.
