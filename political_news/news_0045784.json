Zac Goldsmith , the golden-haired, blue-eyed son and grandson of millionaires, has been announced as the Conservative candidate to take on Labour’s Sadiq Khan , the son of a bus driver who came to this country from Pakistan.\nThe coming contest will, of course, be a key test for Labour’s new leader Jeremy Corbyn and a good indicator of whether the Tories are succeeding in their project to command the centre ground of British politics, rebranding themselves as the workers’ party. But the clash of Goldsmith and Khan will also say something about Britain and the enduring grip exercised by what would once have been called the upper classes.\nRelated: Sadiq Khan elected as Labour's candidate for mayor of London\nThat one Old Etonian, Boris Johnson , has been succeeded by another as the Tories’ standard-bearer in the capital has barely raised a shrug. We’ve got used to this single school filling the top ranks of our national life, providing both the current prime minister and archbishop of Canterbury, to say nothing of our cultural top rank, Damian Lewis, Eddie Redmayne, Dominic West and the others.\nBut it wasn’t always this way. In 1990, Douglas Hurd could lament that his schooling had left him at a disadvantage against John Major, the boy from Brixton. “I thought I was running for the leadership of the Conservative party, not some demented Marxist sect,” Hurd fumed. By the time Cameron was voted in as party leader, the reverse snobbery of old had melted away.\nSome insist it’s no more than that. If Goldsmith has glided to the Conservative mayoral nomination with 70% of the vote (in which, it has to be said, only 9,277 people took part), they say, then that merely proves that an aristocratic background is no longer a barrier. It doesn’t mean it’s an advantage. In this view, the success of the Old Etonians reflects well on Britain: it shows we’re a true meritocracy, refusing to hold a person’s roots against them. This is David Cameron’s line when pushed on his own privileged upbringing: it’s not where you come from that matters, but where you’re going. In the same spirit, others stress that Goldsmith’s success, like Johnson’s before him, owes less to his blue-chip background than to his status as a political maverick. Here credit goes to London’s first mayor, Ken Livingstone , who won the post in the face of stiff resistance from Tony Blair – and thereby made “party rebel” part of the job description. On this logic, it’s Goldsmith’s green defiance on Heathrow expansion, his insistence that he serves his constituents rather than the party whips and his demand that voters have the right to “recall” errant MPs – rather than his schooling in Berkshire – that accounts for his appeal.\nIt seems we only have to see a member of the officer class and our muscle memory makes us salute\nBut this is all a bit convenient, making it somehow a curious but insignificant coincidence that so many people from such a narrow layer of high society wind up at the top. Take the “maverick” thing. It takes supreme confidence to break ranks with your party. Livingstone could do it in 2000 because he had a solid base as the man who had run London once before. But for the likes of Johnson and Goldsmith, the confidence springs from a different source. It surely owes something to membership of a class that breeds self-belief from birth.\nMoney plays a part too. We are living in the age of the political outsider, when voters are drawn to those capable of shrugging off the usual constraints of careerism. Sometimes, as in the case of Corbyn, that’s due to a lack of conventional political ambition: until May, Corbyn was happy to serve forever on the margins. But often that’s down to wealth. In the US, Donald Trump boasts that he’s so rich, he can’t be bought . Other rich men have offered, even tacitly, a less crude version of the same argument: that they don’t need high office, that they’d happily walk away. That gives candidates of Goldsmith’s class an edge over less gilded politicians, such as Khan.\nRelated: London mayoral race: Zac Goldsmith v Sadiq Khan\nThere’s been a subtler shift in our attitudes to the elite, too. Consider the life stories of those political figures often cited as examples of the greater social mobility of old: Harold Wilson, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher. All three came from modest families, were educated at grammar schools and made it to Oxford before reaching the political summit. At the time, such a trajectory was viewed in a completely different way to those of, say, Alec Douglas-Hume or Harold Macmillan, patrician politicians who had, as it happens, both been pupils at Eton.\nBut would we recognise that distinction today? Sunder Katwala of the British Future thinktank notes how quick Labour supporters were to dismiss Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall as insiders, no matter where they had started in life. The defeated candidates could speak of their comprehensive schooling or roots in ordinary towns and suburbs, but it cut no ice. “Those were upward mobility stories,” says Katwala, “but we treated them as Westminster elite stories.”\nSadiq Khan has travelled a much further distance than Zac Goldsmith to reach next May’s mayoral contest, yet he’ll have to persuade voters he’s not just another Westminster insider. It’s worth remembering the participant in a 2013 focus group who thought that Ed Miliband – graduate of a north London comp – was an Eton boy.\nIf the elite is seen as a much broader category, that helps the likes of Goldsmith. If no one is making the fine gradations that, in fact, separate a super-rich Etonian from a self-made lawyer, then that puts next year’s combatants on an equal footing. Though Goldsmith will still enjoy the advantages of his upbringing. Among them will be that age-old self-confidence, that comfort in one’s own skin that so clearly separates a Cameron from a Miliband.\nStill, the key advantage resides not in them, but in us. It seems the British psyche has never quite lost its ancestral deference to the upper classes. As Ivo Delingpole, a 16-year-old Eton pupil, wrote recently , “People want to hate us, but in the end they can’t resist us.” He cited the presenter Dermot O’Leary’s recent declaration that:“We trust an old Etonian in this country. We just do – even if we don’t know we’re doing it. It’s bred into us that they can run the country.”\nIt seems we only have to see a member of the officer class and our muscle memory makes us salute. We did it for Cameron, Londoners did it for Johnson and they might do it again for Goldsmith. Britain is more mixed and diverse than ever before, but the habits of breeding – theirs and ours – are hard to shake.", "external_links": ["http://life.spectator.co.uk/2015/09/etons-recipe-for-success/", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/donald-trumps-so-rich-i-cant-be-bought-120743", "https://twitter.com/rafaelbehr/status/392741735652016128", "http://www.britishfuture.org/"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:40:17.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
