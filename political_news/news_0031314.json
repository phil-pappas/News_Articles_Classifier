It must be approved on two more readings.\nThe ordinance allows the owners of a property that adjoins a vacant lot owned by the city or Shelby County to mow that government-owned property and eventually take ownership.\nThe minimum cost for eligible lots is $500 and the maximum is $10,000.\nProgram participants, individuals or nonprofit organizations, pay an administrative fee of $175 and will be credited at a rate of $25 a cut for three years, or a maximum of $1,350.\nIf the property's cost exceeds that amount the participant pays the difference.\nCode enforcement officers will monitor their progress and the participants will also be required to provide periodic pictures of their work.\nBoyd wants to have the program up and running by January.\n\"So in essence, we're hoping this will reduce the city and county's cost of maintaining these properties, it will actually take a nontaxable property and put it back on the city and county tax rolls and it will actually create and put pride back in some of these neighborhoods,\" Boyd told the public works and transportation committee.\nThe city and county together spend about $8 million annually to cut and maintain empty properties.\nThere are 3,500 vacant lots in the county land bank and 97 percent are inside the city, Kinard said. The city also owns about 200 lots, she said.\n\"A lot of times people are already cutting these lots and they just don't know who owns them,\" she said. \"I think it's just another tool to help.\"\nAn eligible property owned by the county would be gifted to the city for the program. The city will then deed the property to the participant when the maintenance agreement is fulfilled.\nCouncilman Bill Boyd wanted to know if people who did maintenance but dropped out of the program would be allowed to keep their credits if they wanted to re-enter the program.\n\"We believe that if you don't fulfill that agreement, then those credits terminate if you don't take it to completion,\" said Carter Gray , county attorney, a member of Boyd's mow-to-own committee.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:27:19.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
