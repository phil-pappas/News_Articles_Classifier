It is a manipulated result to suit the government’s message. \n\"Only greater independent scrutiny across the entire process will reveal the true picture. \n\"New Zealand First has a member’s bill in the ballot that requires the Better Public Service target results to be independently audited by the Office of the Auditor-General. \n\"Minister Bennett has previously welcomed greater scrutiny of her statistics. We challenge her then to put her full support behind our Better Public Service Target Results Independent Audit Bill, in order to show she truly stands by all her statements.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:14:56.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
