Mark DeSaulnier . \nDeSaulnier, D-Concord, held an event at the University of California, Berkeley to roll out H.R. 3675 , the Student Borrower Fairness Act, which would offset its costs by increasing corporate tax rates on companies that pay their CEOs or highest paid employees more than 100 times the median compensation of all employees. \n“It is patently unfair that the same big banks that toppled our economy borrow from the federal government at extremely low interest rates while student borrowers are struggling to pay back their loans,” DeSaulnier said in a news release. “Meanwhile, people of all ages are buried in student loan debt which holds them back from being able to buy a car, purchase a home, save for retirement, or start a family. This bill is a first step toward making sure our students can emerge from under their piles of crippling debt and enter tomorrow’s highly-trained workforce.” \nCongress acted on student loan rates in 2013, but the changes only applied to new borrowers. \nUC-Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks applauded the bill. “College students and their families depend on student loans to access higher education,” Dirks said in the congressman’s release. “At Berkeley, we are proud that 61 percent of our undergraduates graduate without debt and the average debt of students who do borrow is only $17,584, much lower than the national average. This legislation would benefit all borrowers because it will help them manage their debt and repayment.” \nJames Donahue , president of St. Mary’s College of California in Moraga, said his college “is built on the idea that education has the power to transform lives. The Student Borrower Fairness Act will provide opportunities for all students to pursue their dreams of a higher education, and ultimately highly successful lives. Student loan debt is a national issue and reducing it must be a national priority.” \nDeSaulnier’s office said outstanding student loans now total more than $1.3 trillion, surpassing total credit card debt. More than 37 million Americans have outstanding student loan debt, with an average outstanding balance of $29,400 for those who borrowed to get a bachelor’s degree. From 2004 to 2012, student loan debt rose an average of 14 percent per year. \n[You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.] Elwood \nOh, for God’s sake! \nHe was full of crap as a bartender, but this is totally out of control. \nAfter Congress passes Marky Mark’s bill it will be escorted to the White House for signature by a squadron of flying pigs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:15:30.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
