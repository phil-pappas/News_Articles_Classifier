The tone-deaf rapper who said he wouldn't vote for a woman for president is apologizing — again.\nT.I called his recent comments on DJ Whoo Kid's SiriusXM radio show \"insensitive and hurtful to women\" in a remorseful video on his Facebook page Thursday, two days after he initially apologized on Twitter.\n\"I never intended to be taken as though I felt women couldn't be leaders,\" the rapper said in his latest apology.\n\"I know that my daughters as well as your daughters can lead this nation as well as any other nation as long as they apply themselves and educate themselves and motivate themselves to do so,\" he continued.\nThe \"Top Back\" spitter said he was only joking around on the show, adding that his remarks were \"not a reflection of how I feel.\"\nT.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, made the controversial comments on Monday's show during a discussion about the forthcoming 2016 election and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\"Not to be sexist but, I can't vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" T.I. said. \"Just because, every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well. But, the president?\"\n\"I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally — they make very permanent, cemented decisions — and then later, it's kind of like it didn't happen, or they didn't mean for it to happen,\" he continued.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:32:43.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
