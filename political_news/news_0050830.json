But Jeb Bush’s super-PAC execs, fearful of violating the no-coordination rule, divorced themselves a week or two before the former Florida governor’s formal declaration.\nThe set-up of Kasich’s public events in New Hampshire and other states, as well as all literature and paraphernalia handed out, comes strictly from his official campaign. But Carly Fiorina’s super-PAC does not consider it coordination to set up the former Hewlett-Packard CEO’s campaign gatherings, as well as providing Fiorina handouts and even the placard for her lectern.\nThe Kasich campaign generally handles field operations such as collecting information about voters and potential supporters attending the governor’s rallies and town halls. But Bobby Jindal’s super-PAC usually takes the responsibility for those functions at the Louisiana governor’s appearances.\n“It just shows you how our campaign-finance system continues devolving as more gets deregulated, and candidates push against the rules and get no pushback from the FEC (Federal Election Commission),” said Richard Hasen, law and political-science professor at the University of California-Irvine and co-author of a casebook on election law.\nSpending by single-candidate super-PACs as of mid-September was 55 times as much as for the same point of the 2012 presidential cycle, the Center for Responsive Politics found.\nSuper-political-action committees — actually independent-expenditure committees — arose after a series of federal court rulings early this decade removed key restrictions on fundraising. Such groups have quickly become presidential candidates’ best friends because they can raise money in unlimited amounts from not only wealthy individuals but corporations and unions as well.\nOfficial presidential campaign committees are limited to individual contributions of $2,700, which can’t come directly from unions or corporations.\nBoth types of committees must report donations and spending to the FEC. But while later this month voters will see the smaller hauls collected by the official campaigns of Kasich and others through the end of the third quarter (Wednesday), the big money raked in by the super-PACs won’t be known until much later.\nWhat the official reports won’t show are the convolutions that many presidential candidates and the super-PACs go through to raise the most money possible — yet avoid illegal coordination.\nFor instance, it would be improper for a presidential candidate to overtly raise money for his or her super-PAC. However, the FEC has decreed that candidates can appear as a “special guest” at a super-PAC gathering and tout their candidacy — but can’t take part in explicitly soliciting any contributions, campaign officials and finance attorneys say.\nBoth Mitt Romney and Barack Obama performed this maneuver in 2012, and at least Bush and Kasich have done so this year.\nThe Oval Office aspirants also are allowed to meet with potential mega-donors and mention the name of the super-PAC supporting them without running afoul of coordination concerns. But if the candidate suggests giving a specific amount to the super-PAC, that is considered illegal.\nThe official campaigns and super-PACs can even use the same campaign fundraiser, as long as he or she is an “independent” consultant and not formally on the payroll of either group.\nAnother factor uniquely benefitting the Kasich team: Bruce Berke, a New Hampshire lobbyist who ran Kasich’s abortive 2000 presidential campaign in the Granite State, has been closely advising the 2016 effort in his home state but has no formal role with either the campaign or the super-PAC — meaning he is able to communicate with both.\nNumerous commentators contend that many 2016 hopefuls delayed their formal candidacy declarations so they would have more time to openly coordinate with their super-PACs — even though people such as Bush and Kasich presumably knew for weeks ahead of their official announcements that they were running for president.\n“No doubt the candidates (especially Bush and Kasich) have been pushing the envelope on what coordination means,” Hasen said.\n“I believe both campaigns would concede that if they did some of these activities after they were official candidates it would break the coordination rules. Yet they did them when it was quite clear they were at least ‘testing the waters’ of a candidacy and should have been subject to the anti-coordination rules.”\nRob Nichols, spokesman for Kasich’s official campaign, said, “As is always our practice, we’re careful to follow not just the letter of the law but the spirit of it also, and we work closely with our legal counsel to make sure we do. And, if anything is ever uncertain, we make sure to always err on the side of caution.”\nKasich’s team made no secret of the fact that it went over long-term strategy with leaders of the super-PACs before the two groups divided when Kasich announced.\nAfter the split, Hollywood ad man Fred Davis joined the independent groups, taking with him hours of video recordings of Kasich and other campaign material that is now being used in the $5 million-plus worth of ads the super-PACs are airing in New Hampshire.\nJohn Weaver, who worked with Davis in past presidential campaigns, remained with the official effort as chief strategist — but not before his company snared a $150,000 payment from the super-PAC.\nWith such familiarity, there is little reason to improperly coordinate, said Matt David, chief strategist of Kasich’s super-PAC New Day for America who teamed with Weaver and Davis in earlier campaigns.\n“We’ve worked together in the past. We know what we need to do to be successful, and it doesn’t require any coordination. That’s why we haven’t coordinated and won’t,” David said.\nUnlike the campaigns of Fiorina and Jindal, Kasich super-PAC staff members don’t even attend the governor’s campaign events, much less run them.\n“We can only rely on what our lawyers tell us to do, and for that reason we have not engaged in that practice,” David said. The group’s lawyer prepared a\nmemo that runs for several pages of do’s and don’ts, and both staff members and volunteers are schooled on the legalities, said New Day for America spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp.\n“We take all the laws and regulations very seriously,” she said.\nThe super-PAC focuses on media buys and voter contact, with several staff members already on the ground in early voting states. Based in Downtown Columbus, it also has made tens of thousands of phone calls, mostly to New Hampshire voters, urging support for Kasich. Volunteers with headsets and either electronic tablets or smartphones gather in the L-shaped office five days a week for the digitized operation.\nAs he talked to one New Hampshire voter last week, volunteer Tyler Duvelius, executive director of the Ohio Young Republicans, extolled the virtues of Kasich. “That’s why I’m here on a Thursday night when there’s football on and baseball,” he added before landing a commitment for the governor.\nDuvelius, who volunteered on Kasich’s 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial campaigns, said he likes calling New Hampshire residents because “it’s refreshing to hear from people who care about the issues.”\nThe Kasich presidential bid has traveled an especially convoluted legal path. He started the year visiting other states to push for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. Those trips were paid for by a new nonprofit whose contributions and expenses have yet to be publicized.\nThen the Ohio Republican Party started picking up the tab for Kasich’s out-of-state forays, justified as proper because he was “telling Ohio’s story” to people in other states.\nFinally. a political entity simply dubbed a 527 group — after the section of Internal Revenue Code that governs it — took over responsibility of paying for the governor’s travels as he began to more openly consider a presidential run. Soon after Kasich made his candidacy official, the 527 quickly evolved into the pair of super-PACs that exist today.\nDon’t expect the FEC gendarmes to come riding in anytime soon to investigate whether all those maneuvers pass legal muster.\nEarlier this year, the bipartisan six-member panel challenged the name of Fiorina’s super-PAC, Carly for America, because it could be confused with the official campaign.\nBut the regulators accepted a new name: the Conservative Authentic Responsive Leadership for You for America super-PAC — which, of course, now legally goes by its acronym of CARLY for America.\ndrowland@dispatch.com \n@darreldrowland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:26:39.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
