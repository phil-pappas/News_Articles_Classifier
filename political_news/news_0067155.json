When they were accepting the invitation and communicating their acceptance in the form of a formal letter to the IEA, was NDC not aware that there had been an agreement with the GPPP that it was only the EC that is mandated to organise debates on the issue?” \nMr Baako believes that the NDC must have thought extensively about the invitation before replying and accepting to send representatives. \n“There is an honesty and integrity deficit that is driving the statement they issued and in so doing they attack the IEA’s integrity by trying to put IEA in a partisan contest…and this is not the first time they have done that”, he said \nAccording to the veteran journalist, there is no way the IEA or anyone can replace or substitute the EC, adding, “it doesn’t happen, it cannot happen”. \nIn his view, the IEA’s debate will not be a substitute for the EC’s declared forum because it is widely known that the EC’s forum is more critical than any other forum organised concerning the voters register. \n“The idea that only EC is supposed to deal with election matters in the form that they are talking about is surprising and shocking.” \nThe NDC, in his view is only creating its own distortion and “they are using that distortion to fight a cause - in my opinion a worthless cause – because IEA hasn’t said its mandate stretches to the EC. That is a creation of someone’s imagination”. \n“But they have deliberately created, manufactured and fabricated it, put it out there so as to sustain the dubious argument that they are pushing across”, he said.
