Share article \nHowever the cuts were attacked by opposition councillors, with Liberal Democrat Keith House saying they will affect frontline services and some of the county's most vulnerable residents. \nMore details on where the cuts will fall are due before the council sets it's budget in February.

The criteria for receiving care from adult services has been raised and raised so less older people, the sick and disabled are eligible for support now and must struggle alone. Those that meet the criteria face long waits for assessments and care and this is set to get worse by cutting 50 million pounds off the adult services budget alone. Yet again, it is the most vulnerable that will suffer. Absolutely abysmal.
