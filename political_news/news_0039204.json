And as far as I know, I will always be black.\nYou go ahead and feel free to use the term African-American if that is your preferred nomenclature and it makes you feel comfortable. I personally prefer the term black. It’s the term that I grew up with. I see no reason to change it simply because those who subscribe to absolute political correctness see it as a polite alternative to lines of color drawn in some meeting of bureaucratic label makers.\nSo yes, I am black.\nWhat I am not is “yo nigga,\" \"yo muthafucker,\" or \"yo dawg.”\nYou will not catch me “sagging” my way through the hood with my home boys, referring to them as “ma nigga” to prove a point, insult or compliment them all with the same level of vulgar intensity. You will not catch me cruising the hood with rap music (I use the term \"music\" reluctantly) so loud that the only defining or memorable pieces of it are the obscenely frequent use of the word \"nigga,\" the vibrating license plate, and the fact that the oversized backward spinning “rims” probably cost more than the car is actually worth.\nI do not refer to women as \"bitches\" and \"hoes.\" Nor do I post videos on YouTube of my children’s first steps with commentary like “Check dat shit out. That little nigga walkin'.”\nI can appreciate many of the intricacies of the English language, such as not using “ax” instead of \"ask,\" or “dat” instead of “that.” Is it too much to ask for you to fully complete an entire single word or stop using ones that were originally used to deride and control us? If it is your choice to be offensive, there are plenty of other words that will do without the extremely negative connotations of being “less than.” As far as I know, we are the only race to consistently and willingly throw ourselves under the bus and claim self-awareness under some misguided attempt to lay claim to a culture we never really understood in the first place.\nCall me an asshole. I'm OK with that.\nThe way I see it is this. If you call me an asshole, the connotation of the word becomes irrelevant. The word \"asshole\" is universal, a one-size-fits-all insult applicable to any race, and generally used to point out a behavior or belief. But when you call me a nigger, you are diving into a particular time and place, one where the word is universally and undeniably used to denigrate my existence.\nYou are implying that I am “less than human,” an animal to be acquired, used, traded, sold, or even killed at your whim because we were once considered property stolen from a nation in Africa and shipped to America to be used as free labor. You can, if you like, argue the point that “it’s our word” or “we’re taking it back,” or “it’s OK if you are black.”\nUnless there is an unknown draft of the “I Have a Dream” speech, I don’t recall the term “my nigga” being used. You don’t get to use our greatest civil rights activists as an example of the mistreatment of blacks while working to subvert their very message. We need to stop raging against “the man” and work to improve our own lives and culture. We need to stop perpetuating the myths and blaming the world for problems we have helped create.\nThe Civil Rights movement was a prime example of things working the way they should. What you saw was thousands of people marching, holding hands, singing, and speaking to each other respectfully. When those against their movement got in the way, they simply stepped around them. They didn't threaten to \"buss a cap in they ass.\"\nWhat you also didn't see were people burning down the very neighborhoods they reside in, then complaining that they have nowhere to shop once the smoke has cleared. You did not see them carrying off televisions as they marched, leaving a wake of destruction and theft. The greatest civil rights activists achieved success by not being the thing people believed they were. They achieved their goals by being better than those who opposed them.\nLooting is not protesting. It’s theft. Destroying public property is not protesting. It’s vandalism. I understand why the people of Ferguson were angry. Not having been there, I chose not to believe all of the hearsay regarding the events leading up to the death of Michael Brown. I’m going to simply say that it’s tragic that another black life was lost through a police shooting.\nTrayvon Martin was killed by a man who simply thought he could get away with it. He was killed by a citizen who essentially stalked and harassed a kid on his way home.\nThe problem is that we let him get away with it. The system failed Trayvon Martin, his family and our community in general. We let a murderer walk away.\nWe all know that police have in fact gotten away with murder, but I have to believe that those officers that are simply out for the kill are few and far between. I believe that the best way to deal with these situations is simply not be in a challenging situation. Remember that the goal is to be alive, and that people can be ignorant and frightened by things they do not understand.\nI was reading the comment section of an article about Black Lives Matter's boycott of the State Fair and some ignorant (I assume white) woman commented that if black lives really mattered, “They should stop killing each other.”\nI managed to hold back my first and rather angry response, which was to say, “Yes, maybe they should go to movie theaters and high schools instead.” It was a knee-jerk reaction to bigotry and I didn’t say it, not because it would be impolite, but because ignorance is what it is, and understanding simply cannot be taught to someone who is universally unwilling to see past his or her bigotry.\nI understand that there are people who still consider us as animals and would be content to see us wiped from the face of the earth. What we need to be concentrating on is teaching our children that the way up is through education and realized ambitions instead of spending every waking hour dreaming of becoming the next Michael Jordan.\nAnd yes, there are police officers out there who simply cannot wait for an opportunity to put down “one of those animals” under the guise of serving and protecting. Here is a suggestion I give my son should he be confronted by a police officer.\nBe angry later and live now.\nIf you expect to live in a nice neighborhood, teach your children what garbage cans are for. I watch many of the kids in my neighborhood throw trash on the ground despite the fact that they are 10 feet from several garbage cans. Stop sitting on the front porch with distorted music blaring from a speaker while drinking beer and tossing cans on the lawn. This isn’t a race thing. I don’t want to live next door to you either under those circumstances.\nIt’s about respect. It’s about you respecting me and me respecting you. But mostly it’s about self-respect. There are a lot of horrible things going on in this country, but there is a right way and a wrong way and too often, we choose the wrong way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:34:43.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
