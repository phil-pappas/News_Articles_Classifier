A blue whale spouts near oil rigs off Long Beach, Calif.\nBy Alan Neuhauser Oct. 16, 2015 | 12:00 p.m. EDT + More The chief executives of 10 of the world's largest oil and gas companies declared their support Friday for an expected global climate agreement at a December U.N. summit in Paris.\nNo company based in the U.S. signed on to the statement, even as it was backed by corporations hailing from Britain, France, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, and even India and Saudi Arabia.\nHelge Lund, Claudio Descalzi, Emilio Lozoya, Bob Dudley, Amin Nasser, Patrick Pouyanne, Eldar Saetre and Josu Jon Imaz – CEOs of BG Group, Eni, Pemex, BP, Saudi Aramco, Total, Statoil and Repsol, respectively – pose before Friday's meeting of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative in Paris. The 10 companies – BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Royal Dutch Shell, Saudi Aramco, Statoil and Total – provide about 10 percent of the world's energy and account for about a fifth of daily oil and gas production. Last year, they formed the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which issued the declaration along with a report Friday.\n\"Our shared ambition is for a 2-degree Celsius future,\" the companies' CEOs said in a joint statement. \"It is a challenge for the whole of society. We are committed to playing our part.\"\nMany scientists say global average temperatures must be kept from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels to avoid catastrophic climate change. The planet's average temperatures have already warmed by more than 0.85 degrees Celsius since record-keeping began in 1880, pushed higher by the heat-trapping carbon emissions caused by the burning of oil, gas and coal.\nFriday's statement and report appears to be an attempt to address much of the environmental criticism leveled at oil and gas companies. Just last month, ExxonMobil – America's largest oil and gas company – made headlines when InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times revealed that the energy colossus, which has backed climate-denial efforts, had in fact been aware of the threat of global warming as early as 1977.\n[ READ: El Niño May Ease California Drought, but Not End It, NOAA Says ]\nMeanwhile, Shell and Statoil have become targets for their efforts to drill in the sensitive Arctic, where treacherous seas and storms would make a potential spill very difficult to mitigate.\nIn the report issued alongside their declaration, the 10 companies' CEOs pledged to rein in their greenhouse gas emissions by promoting efficiency, investing in research and pushing electric utilities to switch from coal to natural gas.\n\"Our companies will collaborate in a number of areas, with the aim of going beyond the sum of our individual efforts,\" the group said.\n[ ALSO: Nukes Still a Top National Security Threat for Clinton, O'Malley ]\nEnvironmental advocates remain skeptical. While natural gas burns more cleanly than coal, for example, extracting and transporting it still emits methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent in terms of its heat-trapping potential than carbon dioxide.\n\"We would certainly welcome serious climate policy proposals from the companies,\" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has led climate research and advocacy. \"But we should be skeptical. Given their track record, the onus is on them to prove to both their shareholders and the public that they are truly serious.\"\nTAGS: energy energy policy and climate change global warming oil natural gas coal Exxon Mobil BP environment", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Oil%20Firms%20Urge%20Climate%20Action%2C%20U.S.%20Companies%20Stay%20Silent&summary=As%2010%20of%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20oil%20companies%20expressed%20their%20support%20for%20a%20global%20agreement%2C%20U.S.%20firms%20remained%20on%20the%20sidelines.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Oil%20Firms%20Urge%20Climate%20Action%2C%20U.S.%20Companies%20Stay%20Silent", "http://www.oilandgasclimateinitiative.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/OGCI-Report-2015.pdf", "http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/", "http://www.oilandgasclimateinitiative.com/news/oil-and-gas-ceos-jointly-declare-action-on-climate-change/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe976o%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Oil%20Firms%20Urge%20Climate%20Action%2C%20U.S.%20Companies%20Stay%20Silent"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:13:26.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
