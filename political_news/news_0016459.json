We think we should actually try different policies and we should trial them out first on a smaller scale just doing it with one council at a time first and see whether these new policies actually work.’ \nThe New Zealand Initiative’s Executive Director Dr Oliver Hartwich told TV One’s Q+A programme, that councils should also get a share of the taxes that come from the new growth. \n‘If it works, of course the West Coast would keep some of the extra proceeds of growth; it would keep some of the taxes generated, and then we could see whether we could try something similar across other parts of the country as well.’ \nDr Hartwich told Q+A, ‘we think, rather than waiting for this faraway day where we get wholesale reform of the RMA, we could actually trial out some of the liberalisations locally. And I think the chances of that happening are far greater than waiting for this day when we actually get the reform that the RMA really needs.’ \nDr Hartwich also said, ‘if Wellington, for example, wanted to increase its foreign direct investment intake, we could actually take Wellington out of the Overseas Investment Act… \n‘..because, frankly, we are not facing the kinds of Crafar Farms, Lochinvar Station problems in Wellington because there’s not much farmland around. So Wellington would be the perfect place to try out liberalisation of the Overseas Investment Act.’ \nDr Hartwich said, ‘this country needs to have a debate about the role of local government and its relationship to central government.’ \nQ+A, 9-10am Sundays on TV ONE and one hour later on TV ONE plus 1.
