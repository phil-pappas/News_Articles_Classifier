Photograph: Bryan O’Brien/The Irish Times. \nBrian McDonald \nFri, Oct 2, 2015, 16:43 \n  16:40 Former Fianna Fáil minister of state Conor Lenihan appears to have abandoned plans to seek the party’s nomination to contest the general election in the new Roscommon-Galway constituency. When nominations for the party’s convention formally closed in recent days, his name was not among them. Mr Lenihan two months ago said he had been approached by senior Fianna Fáil members in Roscommon with a view to contesting the selection convention in the constituency. Ex-FF minister of state Conor Lenihan would consider political return He said he would not rule out such a move but stressed it was “a matter for local party members to decide who would be best to win a seat for them.” Mr Lenihan, a former Dublin South West TD, said he was “flattered and honoured” by the approach but the issues was one for local party members to decide on. Since losing his Dáil seat in 2011, Mr Lenihan has been working for a number of Eastern European energy companies. There was surprise in Roscommon when the strongly backed Castlerea councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice withdrew his nomination from the Fianna Fáil selection convention. He said he was not accepting the nomination for convention because he was unhappy at some issues within the party in Roscommon. Cllr Fitzmaurice confirmed he would be remaining a member of the Fianna Fáil party. Among those nominated to go before convention, the date for which is yet to be fixed, are councillors Orla Leyden and Rachel Doherty, daughters of former politicians Terry Leyden and the late Seán Doherty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:10:57.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
