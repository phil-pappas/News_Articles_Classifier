The angry note reads:\nHey Buddy,Stop parking in handicap spots!!!! You DO NOT have a sticker nor do you look handicapped. I have taken a picture of your license plate and sent it to the courtesy officer for towing by the courtesy. Stop being a jerk!\nMore From Cosmopolitan Oof. So much ignorance to unpack here. ​Saying someone doesn't \"look handicapped\" enough in the guise of pretending to be a hero on behalf of the rights of people with disabilities is so grotesquely offensive and flat-out wrong, I don't even know what to say. I mean, if you really were someone who actually cared about this topic you could easily find so much information about invisible disabilities and why it's never OK to tell someone that they don't \"look handicapped.\"\nWhen the veteran found the note on his car, he fired back a perfect response to the parking bully who thinks he can diagnose people with his eyes.\n\"​ First and foremost: In the state of Texas, if a vehicle has DISABLED VETERAN license plates, that vehicle is not required, BY LAW, to have a handicapped placard displayed, nor a handicapped emblem on the license plate, UNLESS that vehicle is parked on FEDERAL property,\" he wrote. \"If you had bothered to spend 30 seconds and pull the miniature computer out of your pocket to research this then you would have never needed to leave me this offensive note.\" Sick burn .\n\"Considering that you took a picture of my license plate you should have been able to very clearly see the writing at the bottom that says: DISABLED VETERAN U.S. ARMED FORCES,\" he said.\nHe is 100 percent correct . ​In Texas if you have a disabled veteran license plate, you can \"park in any spot designated for persons with disabilities,\" according to the DMV . It seems astonishing that this parking space warrior and self-anointed hero of the disabled would take a picture of the tag and not notice that it in fact belonged to a wounded veteran. ​\nThen the veteran laid down some serious truth bombs.\n\"Although I may not 'look' handicapped to you, I can assure you that the amount of pain I feel in my lower body from walking due to combat-sustained injuries far supersedes any level of pain you have ever felt in your entire life,\" he wrote.\n\"I would love to hear what your idea of a handicapped person 'looks' like,\" he said.\nAfter signing the letter \"the guy who doesn't look handicapped,\" he told the ill-informed amateur parking space guard that he kept the original copy of his nasty note. \"I'm going to frame it so I can look at it every day as to remind myself of what kind of person to NOT be. ​\"\nBoom. And that's why you don't assume things about people or their lives.\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/980x1306/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/480x640/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "http://www.npr.org/2015/03/08/391517412/people-with-invisible-disabilities-fight-for-understanding", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/3o0mj0/note_from_angry_austin_apartment_neighbor_above/", "https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201306/invisible-disabilities", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1280x1706/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "http://gov.texas.gov/disabilities/resources/parking_and_buying_gas", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x800/landscape-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "http://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/disabled-parking-placards-plates", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/768x1024/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/640x853/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg", "http://invisibledisabilities.org/educate/accessibleparking/dontjudgebyappearances/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1600x2133/gallery-1444625162-t95dngc.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:17:41.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
