He drops a token at the Prime Minister's feet before retreating a few paces.\nThis is the powhiri, a Maori welcome that begins with this, a challenge: are you friend or foe? Turnbull retrieves the token and so the warrior knows the answer: friend.\nThe warrior strikes his own right thigh, indicating to his tribe that Turnbull comes in peace and should be granted access to their marae, or meeting place: in this case, Government House in Auckland.\nMalcolm Turnbull is welcomed in an official ceremony by a Maori warrior at Government House in Auckland.

Because as Turnbull and his New Zealand counterpart John Key are at pains to make clear when they talk to the media a little while later, Australia and New Zealand are in fact more than just friends: they're family, and nothing will ever stand between them.\nAdvertisement There will be disagreements, sure. For example, New Zealand hasn't exactly welcomed Australia's new enthusiasm for detaining and deporting its citizens, even if they have lived in Australia most of their lives and have only committed minor crimes.\nBut families argue, right?\nThe disagreement certainly didn't faze our new Prime Minister. By giving Key a small concession – a fast-tracked appeal process – he did what all good diplomats seek to do: let the other country save face while surrendering nothing of value.\nTurnbull didn't exactly set himself a big test when he chose New Zealand to be his first overseas destination as PM.\nIt's a safe, friendly nation where the praise is plentiful and the controversies easily contained. Nonetheless, it was a confident and assured performance from a man who looks as comfortable on the world stage as he does on the domestic – even when warriors are coming at him with spears.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:44:50.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
