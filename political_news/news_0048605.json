(AP) - Authorities say three people have been shot at Tennessee State University in Nashville.\nTanya Stone, operations supervisor for the Metro Nashville emergency communication center, said early Friday that authorities transported three people with gunshot wounds to a Nashville hospital after a shooting on campus.\nStone didn't know if they were students and didn't have any information on their conditions.\nShe says police are \"all over the scene\" and there's no indication of an active shooter.\nThe Tennessean reports police blocked off an entrance to the university and made nonstudents leave the campus.\nA university spokesman didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. University police dispatchers said they couldn't release any information.\nThe incident comes just over a week after three people were wounded by gunfire at an off-campus party across the street from the college.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:41:41.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
