This reflect the extent of the early and ongoing public involvement in the process.\" \nFull council backed the scheme almost unanimously at a special summit last Wednesday. \nThe only rebel, Conservative councillor Ian Tait, said he wanted to \"burst into tears\" over Winchester's transformation into an expensive, \"elitist\" city. Promoted stories \n\"Winchester is wonderful, but it's not an inclusive city when people who aren't earning 70 or 80 thousand pounds a year will not be able to afford to live in Winchester,\" said Cllr Tait, criticising the council's struggle to make 40 per cent of new homes available at so-called affordable rent. \n\"I've become increasingly upset and saddened by the process, and I've not had that reassurance that over the life of this plan Winchester will not become a more expensive, more elitist city to live in. That wasn't the city that I've been brought up in.\" \nAlresford councillors Simon Cook and Ernie Jeffs abstained amid ongoing controversy over the plan's impact in the town. Many residents are furious that most of Alresford's 500 new houses are being built on one site off Sun Lane. \nCllr Margot Power, the third Alresford councillor, voted in favour. \nThe plan allocates sites for thousands of homes in Winchester – including the Barton Farm scheme – plus 3,500 at North Whiteley, 3,000 west of Waterlooville, 500 each in Bishop's Waltham and Alresford and hundreds across villages including Kings Worthy, South Wonston and Waltham Chase. \nIt is also hoped the plan will further empower the council to reject unwanted planning applications. \nConcerns were raised at the meeting about affordable housing, traffic, pollution and the council's ability to protect workplaces and play areas. Share article \nLocal Plan Part 2 will be submitted to the Government in March, with examination hearings in early summer before the inspector reports next October. \nIf approved, the plan will be adopted in November 2016.

Vikki Weston talks a lot of nonsense when she says, \"Indeed many people have supported the plans, allocations and policies. This reflect[s] the extent of the early and ongoing public involvement in the process.\" Very disingenuous - as is Ian Tait's stance who wanted to build all over Stanmore ( in inappropriate ways and he and his ilk have done nothing to stop the overcrowding with students) several years ago.Incredibly short memory some of these politicians. Some parts of Hampshire can take some more housing but much can not (Winchester is filled to the brink of ecological/cultural disaster) - there is just not the money available for an adequate infrastructure and meanwhile nobody really seems to care that the once beautiful environment is being steadily and negligently degraded. I can see that the council might claim that their playing a clever hand to the Government 'bulldozers' but we all know they're too ineffectual to make any decisions that will benefit the present City except build, build, build.
