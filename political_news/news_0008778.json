But a housing advisory group in August recommended increasing that share -- called the affordable housing set-aside -- to 50 percent . \nCity officials, who initially proposed no change, have been scrambling ever since. \nThe Housing Bureau originally planned to release a proposal by Sept. 1 but never did. Saltzman's office later scheduled a City Council work session for Oct. 13 and planned to discuss a proposal at the Oct. 21 regular meeting. \nBut no clear consensus emerged during this week's work session and negotiations Thursday didn't result in a proposal. \nEven though housing has become a top political priority, Portland's commission form of government continues to create divisions. \nSaltzman and Commissioner Nick Fish, the former housing commissioner, have expressed support for a big increase. \nBut increasing funding for affordable housing would leave less urban renewal money for redevelopment projects spearheaded by the Portland Development Commission. It would also leave less money for parks and transportation projects funded with urban renewal money. \nA zero-sum game, officials have been trying to find a balance. But Mayor Charlie Hales, in charge of the development commission; Commissioner Steve Novick, in charge of transportation; and Commissioner Amanda Fritz, in charge of parks; have all expressed some reservations. \nDuring Tuesday's work session, Saltzman said he wanted to propose a financial target -- he didn't say what that would be -- and have the City Council vote this month. \nThen, housing and development staff would scrub their budgets and return in January with details about how to actually meet the commitments, district by district. \nNovick, however, objected. He said it would be difficult to commit to promise more for affordable housing without first analyzing the specific tradeoffs. \n-- Brad Schmidt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:54:08.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
