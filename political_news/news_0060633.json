Chelsea scored through Gary Cahill but after Cesc Fabregas had a goal disallowed for offside and Matic was sent off for two yellow cards, referee Jon Moss ordered Mourinho to the stands for the second half after the manager had approached him at the end of the half. Neither Mourinho nor any of his management team attended the post-match media conference.\nLeicester City beat Crystal Palace 1-0 with Jamie Vardy scoring for the seventh successive league match, Swansea City beat Aston Villa 2-1, West Bromwich Albion won 1-0 at Norwich City and Watford won 2-0 at Stoke City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:07:01.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
