(AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul visited a mostly minority section of Louisville to promote criminal-justice reforms and tax breaks to stimulate job growth in struggling neighborhoods. On Friday, the Kentucky senator toured America's Finest Filters, a business in western Louisville. The company's president and CEO, Michael White, said nearly half of his 19 employees were previously convicted of felonies. White says he believes in giving people a second chance. Paul pitched his efforts to revamp the nation's drug and sentencing laws. It's part of his campaign to lure more minority voters to the GOP. Paul criticized disparities resulting in higher percentages of blacks going to prison for drug offenses. His proposals include restoring voting rights for some non-violent felons and making it easier for people to expunge criminal records.â€‹ Read or Share this story: http://on.whas11.com/1RmJnbl TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:51:14.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
