(AP) - A woman accused of driving her car into a crowd of people at Oklahoma State University's homecoming parade \"purposely\" went around a barricade and ran a red light before crashing into the spectators, a prosecutor said Monday.\nArguing for a $1 million bail, Payne County District Attorney Laura Thomas told the judge that if Adacia Chambers is convicted in the deaths of four people, she is \"looking at four life sentences.\"\nSpecial District Judge Katherine Thomas granted the bond request and ordered a psychological evaluation for Chambers, who is being held on preliminary counts of second-degree murder.\nChambers appeared at Monday's hearing via video. The only time she spoke was to say \"yes\" when the judge asked if she could hear her.\nProsecutors asked for more time to interview the dozens of witnesses who were at the scene Saturday and said one of the injured is in a \"fragile\" state, which could lead to more charges.\nIn Oklahoma, second-degree murder charges are warranted when someone acts in a way that's \"imminently dangerous to another person\" but does so without premeditation. Each count is punishable by at least 10 years in prison.\nChambers, 25, of Stillwater, has yet to be formally charged - a step that requires prosecutors to file additional documents in court.\nThe judge scheduled the next hearing for Nov. 13.\nAfter the hearing, Chambers' attorney, Tony Coleman, said when he told Chambers about the deaths, \"her face was blank.\" He said he was not sure Chambers is aware that she's in jail. Chambers had yet to ask to see her parents or boyfriend.\nOn Sunday, Coleman said there was no indication that she had been drinking before the crash. Police are awaiting blood tests to determine whether she was impaired by drugs or alcohol.\nHe said he spoke with Chambers for about an hour.\n\"During that entire interview, I was not satisfied at all that I was communicating with a competent individual,\" Coleman said.\nHe said Chambers was at work before the crash and that she does not remember much, only that she felt confused as she was removed from the car.\nShortly before the hearing, Chambers' father, aunt and boyfriend appeared outside the courthouse, telling reporters that they don't know what led to the crash.\nChambers father, Floyd Chambers, said his daughter had received inpatient mental health treatment several years ago. He said nothing seemed amiss recently, except his daughter had recently called and said she wanted to move back home.\n\"I thought that was kind of strange, but I don't know. She was very good about hiding her problems because she didn't want the family to worry about her, and she kept to herself about things like that,\" Chambers said, fighting back tears.\nHe said his daughter is a talented artist who loves music.\n\"I would like them (the public) not to think so badly of her, because that's not just who she was. That's not who I raised,\" he said. \"And when we get all the test results back, we'll know.\"\nHer aunt, Lynda Branstetter, said Chambers told her that she had recently quit a second job because her other job at Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers had asked her to pick up more hours. She said she saw Adacia Chambers on Friday night and that nothing seemed unusual.\n\"This is so not her. This is not her character,\" Branstetter said tearfully. \"She's one that'll give you a big hug and she's one if you're down, she'll make you smile. That's my Adacia.\"\nHer boyfriend, Jesse Gaylord, said Chambers had difficulty sleeping and only got an hour or two of sleep before leaving for work Saturday morning.\nGaylord said he never saw Chambers take any drugs - either prescription or illegal - and that the last time they drank alcohol was a few weeks ago, when they each had one beer on his birthday.\n\"As far as for her to purposefully go and do something, that would just not be possible. ... She would never do anything like that consciously,\" Gaylord said.\nGaylord said he'd never even seen Chambers break any traffic laws.\n\"She's honestly one of the most cautious drivers that I've ever ridden with. She never turns out in front of any cars. She doesn't ever run yellow lights,\" he said.\nThe crash killed three adults and a 2-year-old boy. At least 46 other people hurt, including many children.\nOn Monday, the Oklahoma medical examiner's office identified the boy killed in the crash as 2-year-old Nash Lucas. Oklahoma State University said the boy's mother, 20-year-old Nicolette Strauch, is a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering.\nThe dead adults were identified as Nikita Nakal, a 23-year-old MBA student from India at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, and a married couple, Bonnie Jean Stone and Marvin Lyle Stone, both 65, of Stillwater.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Sean Murphy and Ken Miller in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that the first name of the MBA student who died is spelled Nikita, not Nakita.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:10:29.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
