Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell are also strongly opposed; both are London MPs.\nWhile it is estimated that a third runway at Heathrow would mean 250,000 more flights a year, provide a £150bn boost to the UK’s income over the next 60 years and create 70,000 new jobs, it would also mean demolishing almost 800 homes, including most of the nearby village of Harmondsworth.\nDrew Hendry, the SNP transport spokesman, has stressed that his party is currently \"absolutely neutral\" on whether Heathrow or Gatwick should be expanded. But he has made clear it would support the option that answered Scottish demands for cheaper ticket prices and guaranteed connections to international flights.\nLobbyists from Heathrow and Gatwick are at the SNP conference in Aberdeen this week with the former paying for large banners at the conference venue.\nHeathrow told the Financial Times that it was in discussions with politicians from across the UK on how to maximise the benefits for their constituents.\n“Scotland,” it said, “like all regions and nations of the UK stands to benefit from the 180,000 new skilled jobs and £211bn in economic growth that Heathrow expansion will deliver.”\nA senior figure at Heathrow told the FT that there was a clear deal to be cut with the SNP in return for the party’s support.\nShare article He said Scottish passengers wanted a firm long-term commitment to protect existing routes such as Aberdeen but also wanted to see the opening of new ones like a route between Heathrow and Dundee or the reopening of the old direct route to Inverness.\nSpeaking at a Heathrow-sponsored conference fringe event, Stewart Hosie, deputy leader of the SNP and MP for Dundee East, said: “The first airport that offers us connectivity in abundance will be in a prime position to win our support.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-16T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:54:26.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
