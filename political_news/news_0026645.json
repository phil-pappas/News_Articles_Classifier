If they think Bihar will vote according to this then they are absolutely incorrect. Amit Shah should get his facts right about the people of Bihar. His management won't work here,\" he added.\nThe RJD leader further said the BJP must understand that the elections should be fought on political agendas.\n\"And the BJP has no such agendas. They have nothing to say with regard to the reservation policy. The vision document has already been introduced by Bhagwat sahib (RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat) and they cannot go against Bhagwat sahib,\" he added.\nThe BJP has been critical of the grand alliance post RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's remark that that even Hindus eat beef.\nLalu had stoked a controversy with his remark that Hindus too eat beef and accused the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of communalising the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:14:38.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
