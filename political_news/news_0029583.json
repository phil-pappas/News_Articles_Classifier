Bernie Sanders clashed on U.S. involvement in the Middle East, gun control and economic policy as they opened the first Democratic debate Tuesday, outlining competing visions for a party seeking to keep the White House for a third straight term.\nYet in a moment of political unity — and levity — Sanders leapt to Clinton’s defense on the issue of her controversial email practices as secretary of state.\n“The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” Sanders exclaimed as the crowd in Las Vegas roared with applause. A smiling Clinton reached over to shake his hand.\nWhile the five candidates onstage took issue with each other, they also repeatedly sounded traditional Democratic themes — such as fighting income inequality — that are sure to carry over to the general election campaign against the Republicans. They also sought to cast the GOP as a party focused on sowing division and denigrating minorities and women.\nFirst, the Democrats must choose their own candidate. And throughout most of the debate, Clinton played the role of aggressor, an unexpected shift for a candidate who had barely mentioned her Democratic rivals since launching her campaign six months ago. Until now, Clinton and Sanders have circled each other cautiously and avoided personal attacks.\nCapitalism vs. socialism After Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, derided “a casino capitalist process by which so few have so much,” Clinton said it would be a “big mistake” for the U.S. to turn its back on the system that built the American middle class. Asked whether she thought Sanders, who has a mixed record on gun-control legislation, had been tough enough on the issue, she said, simply, “No, I do not.”\nSanders is drawing crowds on the campaign trail and challenging Clinton’s fundraising prowess, but he’s unknown to many Americans. The debate offered him a high-profile opportunity to cast himself as an electable alternative to Clinton.\nSanders has sought in particular to distinguish himself from Clinton over foreign policy, an issue where she is often more hawkish than other Democrats. The former secretary of state reiterated her call for more robust U.S. action to stop the Syrian civil war and defended her judgment on international issues, despite having voted for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nSanders called the Iraq war “the worst foreign-policy blunder in the history of our country” and said he would not support sending U.S. troops back to the Middle East to fight terrorism.\nJoining Clinton and Sanders in Las Vegas was a trio of low-polling candidates: former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley; Jim Webb, a former Navy secretary and U.S. senator from Virginia; and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.\nThe Biden factor Also hanging over the debate: the lengthy deliberations of Vice President Joe Biden, who is weighing a late entry into the race. Debate host CNN kept an extra lectern on standby just in case Biden decided to show up, but the vice president watched the debate from Washington.\nFor Clinton, the debate was a much-needed opportunity to focus on policy in addition to the controversy over her use of personal email and a private Internet server during her tenure in the Obama administration. The email issue has shadowed her rollout of numerous policy positions and has hurt her standing with voters.\nClinton said her email use “wasn’t the best choice” and cast the issue as a politically motivated effort by the GOP to hurt her poll numbers. The only candidate who challenged Clinton on her email practices was Chafee, who said “credibility is an issue.”\nJulie Pace and Lisa Lerer,\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:35:37.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
