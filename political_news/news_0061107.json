Sanders wrote Monday that “China – not exactly seen as a model when it comes to human rights – provides 14 weeks of maternity leave. The U.S. provides zero.” \nIn response, Woods had this to say: China has notoriously killed female infants for population control, you utter moron. #ChinaGendercide https://t.co/GBNSaNNJaC — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) October 19, 2015 \nMany other conservatives jumped on Sanders for making the comparison between China with its “one-child policy” and the United States. Now some might say that critics missed the point of Sanders’ tweet since the candidate did address China’s human rights record, and stated that in spite of that the Asian superpower still offers maternity leave. \nSanders repeatedly called the United Stats’ failure to provide paid maternity leave an embarrassment. \nWoods also has for years trolled Barack Obama on Twitter much to the delight of conservative media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:09:38.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
