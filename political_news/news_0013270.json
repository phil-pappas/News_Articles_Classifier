Alia Bhatt explains a belief and tells us all about the new apartment\nIt wouldn’t be wrong to say that Alia Bhatt is probably one of the busiest actresses in B-town at the moment. But that doesn’t mean she has no time for fun. As we catch up with her at the Dharma Productions’ office, where she is promoting her soon-to-be released Shaandaar, we spot her busy trying to balance a bottle of water on her head. What’s with that? “I just zone off so I can totally have a great time just by myself. I also have an attention deficiency disorder. I can’t focus on what’s happening around me beyond a certain time, so I keep jumping from one place to another.”\nBesides the movies, Alia is preoccupied with thoughts of moving into her new home. “I will be shifting to my new house soon and now I realise it’s bit of a pain. Suddenly, I got to think about how my house is looking and then to manage paying my own bills. I often think ‘Oh God, I can’t be doing this’. Then I realise it’s important that I do these things because I need my own space.\nThe good part is I’m moving in with my sister Shaheen, so I won’t be all by myself. My house help has trained my staff to pack my dabba and I’m sure she will do it in the new house too. So the food has been taken care of. Plus it’s not like I’m shifting towns, it’s just a few minutes away, that thought makes me feel good.”\nAnother actress who recently moved in to her new home is Alia’s contemporary Parineeti Chopra. They have been exchanging notes, as we find out. “Pari and I are constantly discussing our new homes and our plans for it over the phone, although I’m still waiting for her to call me over. We have been through the same phase since we bought our house almost at the same time, so that has been a definite connecting factor,” Alia says.\nMoving on to films, 90s’ kid Alia confesses that Govinda’s films have had a huge influence. “I have grown up on them. So, me being an actor can be largely attributed to David Dhawan, Govinda and Karisma Kapoor. The Hero No 1s and Coolie No 1s were the movies of my life,” says the actress, who has even personally extended a note of gratitude to Karisma, who she considers her idol.\n“Yes, I told her she has had a huge impact on my life. Her energy is just so raw. The same goes with Kareena too. Both of them are supremely talented and warm. I remember once having had a nice conversation with Lolo at Karan’s (Johar) birthday party. She spoke about how it feels to be an actress and how focus is of utmost importance. I will never forget that chat,” Alia says.\nAnother of Alia’s long cherished dream will soon come true when she starts shooting with Shah Rukh Khan for Gauri Shinde’s next film. The shoot begins immediately after Shaandaar releases. “Working with Shah Rukh Khan is unbelievable because it happened so quickly. I know how involved SRK is as an actor. He’s such a charismatic man. I can’t wait to be on the sets.” Next year, Alia has two releases — Kapoor and Sons and Udta Punjab. “And I will also be starting Ayan Mukherji’s film next year. So yes, my schedule is pretty packed already.” And how does being so busy feel? “It’s actually great because I’m going to be petrified if all this time turns into free time,” she says.\nAmitabh Bachchan is next on her wish list and among directors it’s Zoya Akhtar and Raju Hirani. “I am dying to work with is Amitji. I still watch Satte Pe Satta repeatedly and I loved him in Piku too,” Alia says. In her next film, Alia has been reunited with mentor Karan Johar. They have had a long association right from the days of her debut film Student Of The Year and Alia feels KJo has changed her not just as an actor but as a person too. “One thing I love the most about Karan is his attitude. He’s so hardworking even now, after being in the industry for so long.\nI also love that even if you don’t have as much knowledge and experience as him, he will still treat you like an equal. He has made me realise that everyone’s thoughts and ideas matter — it’s not like you are the only person who matters in the world. So, I try to make as many friends as I can, unless of course someone is being really rude to me. Then I won’t even try,” she says.\nThe actress seems to have found a comfort zone in romantic comedies and she has no immediate plans of changing that. She now believes they are lucky for her as all those films have been hits. Weddings have also been an integral part of most of her films including the approaching Shaandaar. “I love Indian weddings. Our weddings are all so typical. We have a sangeet, a mehendi and a wedding and a reception. Everything is all so well planned. I think this is a great world to make films on and we have been doing it for ages now. If you think about it, all my hits have had a wedding theme.\nHumpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya had it, so did 2 States, even Highway and Student Of The Year and now Shaandaar too. I think weddings are lucky for me and I will keep being part of it.” She only means on screen, as she is quick to add, “My friends and I are too young to get married but I recently attended my best friend’s sister’s wedding and I had a blast for three days.”\n alia bhatt apartments Bollywood sunday chronicle Also Read Sooraj Barjatya visits 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo' dance rehearsals The ‘four’ce is with him Shah Rukh Khan richer than Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp Kangana and R Madhavan say 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns' will be a very real film", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/commentary-sunday-chronicle/article/‘weddings-are-lucky-me’-alia-bhatt", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Alia%20Bhatt%202_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Alia%20Bhatt%202_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:50:50.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
