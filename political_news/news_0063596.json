Dan Warner of Kelly/Warner PLLC (\"Kelly/ Warner Law \") is among the few law experts that stepped up in the defense of the victims, despite many hailing the hack as a positive event that may have exposed cheating men and women. However, knowing that this action would hurt the families of those whose names and personal data were leaked, Dan Warner of Kelly/ Warner Law made it its mission to help remove the victims' information from the Internet.\n\"There have been great strides to cater to the needs of the victims, and to help with their online issues.\" - said Dan Warner from Kelly/Warner.\nNevertheless, even if they were able to solve the problems of Ashley Madison victims, many more remain who could still be helped with the Arizona based law firm's defamation removal and privacy services. Kelly/ Warner Law has, therefore, launched a powerful awareness campaign, urging victims to step up and ask for assistance, either from them or other defamation/privacy law firms.\n\"Many don't even know that they can use services such as ours to have the information deleted. Others have given up, or are too scared to even look for information online.\" â€“ states Dan Warner .\nEven people whose coworkers have created bogus accounts in their name as a prank or individuals who have never used the services of the site have found themselves defamed - and sometimes they even lost their jobs or their marriages as a result of the hack.\nNegative defamatory content can be extremely destructive, whether based on real facts or fictional suppositions. Spread on blogs, social media or virtually any online medium, the information has the possibility of going viral extremely fast and hurting the careers and personal lives of the persons involved, as well as their friends, family, and children.\nWhile many have been affected by the fall of Ashley Madison , Kelly/ Warner Law has been one of the few law firms that actually provided quick and practical support for the victims.\nAbout Kelly/ Warner Law\nThe law firm known as Kelly/ Warner Law consists of a team of highly professional attorneys specializing in cases involving internet defamation, invasion of privacy, cyber bullying and harassment, online rumor spreading and a host of similar predicaments that clients both in the public and private sector have found themselves in.
