Wednesday night, Trump focused on Jeb Bush, a favorite target, Bush’s fellow Floridian, Marco Rubio, and their friendship turned rivalry. \n“They hate each other. They hate, trust me, I know. They hate so much. They hate more than anyone in this room hates their neighbor. Anyway, but its political bull do you understand? “ \nTrump’s attitude has tended to be just as dismissive when it comes to discussing specific policies, save for immigration, the issue that fueled his political rise. But earlier this week, Trump released a tax proposal, and in Keene, he worked at length to sell it. \n“Number one we are cutting down from seven brackets to four. And the rates are going from 25 to 20 and to 10 and to zero. When somebody is not making enough to live, what’s the purpose for them doing lengthy returns, going to get help from H&R Block, who we intend to put out of business.” \nThe billionaire businessman was also out to make news on another topic --Syria’s migrant crisis. \n“And I’ll tell you right now and I’m putting everyone on notice, and hopefully this gets outside the room, and I guess it will with all these crazy cameras going back there. I’m putting the people on notice who are coming here from Syria, as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they are going back.” Donald Trump autographs a supporter's sign at a Keene, N.H. rally that drew more than 4000 people on September 30, 2015 Credit Josh Rogers for NHPR \nEarlier this month Trump said the U.S. should accept some Syrian refugees for humanitarian reason. But in Keene, Trump noted many of the migrants crossing into Europe seemed to be “strong-looking guys,” who could even be members of ISIS, using the migration crisis as a cover to export a terrorist fighting force . \n“This could be one of the greatest tactical ploys of all times: a 200,000 man army, or if you said 50,000 or 80,000 or 100,000. We’ve got problems, and that could be possible.” \nTrump was swarmed by supporters as he made his way out of Keene High School. As he left he said it could also be possible he’ll be back in New Hampshire as soon as next week.
