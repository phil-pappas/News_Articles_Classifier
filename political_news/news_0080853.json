The race pits Democrat Kevin Silliman against Republican Joann Bush for one of three seats on the Eldred Township Board of Supervisors. It is a six-year term. Bush is the co-owner of Mrs. Bush’s Personal Care Homes in Kunkletown, where she helped build it from eight licensed beds to more than 65. She's trained and educated 55 employees, developed policies and procedures and managed the company’s finances for the past 32 years. Bush is a graduate of Easton Hospital School of Nursing. Silliman served in the Navy and then went to work for Blue Ridge Cable, where he’s been for the past 26 years. He is a current and past member of Eldred’s planning commission. Silliman filled in as a township supervisor for 14 months in the early 2000s. He’s a member of the Kunkletown Volunteer Fire Company and served as chief between 1999 and 2001. The most important decision the township faces will likely be regarding Nestlé Waters North America's plan to extract water on a local property for its Deer Park Natural Spring Water brand. If the company’s testing shows its Chestnut Springs site to be viable, it will need a zoning permit with a special exemption from the township. Although the permit would be issued by the Zoning Hearing Board after a hearing is held, the supervisors can try to have Nestlé attach conditions to the permit that the township believes are necessary. Bush is against the project, believing it will change the nature of the rural township forever. “I’m definitely without a doubt not in favor of bringing this business into the community. It is coming into a relatively small village that’s not set up for the type of truck traffic, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” she said. “There are no benefits to any of the residents except the homeowner (who is leasing the property to Nestlé).” Bush is also concerned about the effect of Nestlé’s water withdrawal on the local water supply. “The aquifer could be affecting people between 25 and 50 miles, I was told by a hydrogeologist,” she said. Silliman believes the Deer Park decision should be based on whatever is in the best financial, environmental and legal interest of the township. “The whole idea about planning and zoning is balance,” he said. “Changes happen, but all the changes have to be for the good of the township and its citizens.” The township’s highest priorities, Silliman said, are budget, zoning and planning issues. He decided to run for supervisor out of a sense of community involvement. “I’m not a politician,” he said. “I’m just there to put out a helping hand where the need is.” Bush thinks there’s a need to improve communications between the township government and its residents. “We need to bring more clarity to the community as to what is going on on a regular basis. Yes, you have a supervisor meeting every month, but there are a lot of people who aren’t going to make it or can’t,” she said. “There’s no reason the information can’t be shared with the residents.” Bush suggested the township produce a newsletter that could be handed out, especially for residents who do not have email. Bush also advocates for improved fiscal responsibility developing policies and procedures for the township manual. She intends to “make decisions based on what is financially, environmentally and culturally best for township and for individuals’ property potential,” she said. Residents can vote on Election Day at the Kunkletown Firehouse on 490 Kunkletown Road, Suite 101. The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. By Howard Frank", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:08:13.860+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
