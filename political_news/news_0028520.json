The city would provide another $2.5 billion. The plan will pay for subway cars, buses and a new Second Avenue subway line. \n“The increased commitment from the city and state reflect a history of strong, stable support from MTA’s partner governments, both through direct funding and tax subsidies generated by the regional tax base,” Baye Larsen, a Moody’s analyst in New York, wrote in a report Friday. \nThe state agency, the largest mass-transit provider in the U.S., had $36 billion of debt as of Sept. 4. Moody’s raised its rating in July to A1 from A2 because of the strengthening finances of the city and state and a rise in ridership. The MTA serves an average 8.7 million riders each weekday through its buses, subways and commuter rail lines. \nThe MTA is set to approve the five-year capital plan at its Oct. 28 board meeting. It may allow for borrowing as much as $6.3 billion, or 24% of that budget, according to Larsen. That would decrease the agency’s reliance on debt: About 47%, or $10.5 billion, of the MTA’s capital program from 2010 to 2014 came from bonds, she wrote. \nMTA bonds maturing November 2028 traded for an average yield of 2.4% Friday, or 0.75 percentage point above benchmark municipal bonds, on trades of at least $1 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s similar to the yield difference at the start of 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:08:14.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
