PAUL, Minn. (AP)  A Minnesota congressman has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Rep. Keith Ellison on Monday became the second member of Congress to publicly back Sanders after Arizona Rep. Raúl Grijalva. The Minnesota Democrat says he supports Sanders because of his commitment to raising the minimum wage, abolishing private prisons and other liberal goals. Ellison is a fifth-term representative who became the first Muslim to win a seat in Congress. He's also Minnesota's first black member of Congress. His support comes after front runner Hillary Clinton has piled up endorsements from Congress and beyond.
