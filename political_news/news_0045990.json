The BJP has been implicated in the lynching.\nBut just like Goans and the residents of North Eastern India have vigorously protested against BJP’s illiberal, autocratic policies, a number of people are now insisting they will eat beef, and challenging Modi/RSS to dare kill them.\nBJP/RSS can’t falsify the basic facts about Hinduism. Hindus have eaten beef in VAST QUANTITIES since time immemorial. Arthashastra clearly documents the sale of beef. Fully allowed. No issues. Till today, beef is a regular part of the diet of Hindus in the heart of Hindu Nepal.\nOnly those who were influenced by Jainism stopped eating beef/ meat. Jaini “Hindus” can’t force their view on the rest of the world.\nBut whether Hindus eat beef is neither here nor there. The point is that NO ONE can impose their dietary preferences on others.\nThis is a placeholder post, to record the actions of the brave souls who are challenging the BJP/RSS’s violence.\nHindus in Kerala thrown the gauntlet at Modi’s lunatic “Hindu” followers.\n( Photos )\n2) Shobhaa De\nI just ate beef.
