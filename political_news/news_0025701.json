He was being held without bail following an arraignment on Tuesday; there was no immediate response to a message left on Wednesday with his attorney. \nThe takedown follows a series of similar investigations over the past several years, including recent ones targeting guns smuggled from the South in private cars and commercial airliners. While New York City has some of the strictest gun-control laws, the cases show the need for federal legislation to help address the problem, said Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson. \n“So we had guns in a car, guns on a plane and now guns on a bus,” Thompson said. “How many different ways to we have to try to get to these guns before we wake up as a country and realize that we have to stop the bloodshed?” \nAn undercover New York Police Department officer using the alias “Zoey” infiltrated the ring last year and persuaded Bassier to make him his exclusive customer, authorities said. During the course of the investigation, the suspect made 12 trips by Chinatown-based buses to Atlanta and six trips by car to Pittsburgh to purchase semi-automatic pistols and assault weapons, they said. \nBassier recruited straw purchasers to pay between $150 to $300 per gun at gun stores and pawn shops and on websites in their home states, then resold them for $800 to $1,200, authorities said. In all, he provided 112 weapons to the undercover in transactions that often took places in a Walgreens parking lot in Brooklyn, authorities said. \nThe wiretap evidence shows Bassier knew exactly what he was doing, prosecutors said. \n“I’m selling them the right way and the wrong way,” he told his ex. “When I’m out of state, like Atlanta and Georgia and all that, it’s all legal … but in New York, it’s completely illegal.” \nThe woman expressed dismay, telling Bassier, “I thought you said you’ve changed.” \nHis response: “I have.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:19:26.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
