That is despite John McDonnell, shadow chancellor , issuing a three-line whip for colleagues to vote against the proposals. \nMr McDonnell’s announcement came as a surprise to many MPs given that only a fortnight ago he had endorsed the same plans, albeit with caveats. \nSome MPs are determined to ignore his orders, not least because Labour’s new leaders have a track record of rebelling on countless occasions. \nMr McDonnell prompted outrage when he announced his U-turn at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party on Monday night. MPs castigated the shadow chancellor — and new leader Jeremy Corbyn — over several issues. “It was like Reservoir Dogs , starring The Muppets ,” said one MP. \nBut any rebellion on Wednesday evening may turn out to be muted, with some MPs just staying away from Westminster rather than making a point of abstention. “I think I’ll just make sure I’m not around after 7pm,” said one Labour MP. \nNone has indicated they would vote with the Conservatives on what is widely seen as a political trap set by George Osborne, the chancellor, designed to make Labour look profligate with the public finances. \nMany are more angry with Mr McDonnell for apparently flip-flopping over such an important issue than with the position he has now taken. They also feel the shadow chancellor only played lip service to the idea of consulting them on the change of position. \nRead more \nMr Corbyn, who has endured a rocky few first weeks as leader of the opposition, was widely seen to have performed well at his second session of PMQs, where he probed the prime minister over tax credits and housing. \nHe told the Commons that he had received thousands of questions from members of the public about cuts to tax credits, pressing Mr Cameron on the impact that this would have on a working single mother with a disabled child. \nAmid tittering from Tory MPs, Mr Corbyn said: “This might be funny to some members but it’s not funny to many others.” \nThe prime minister replied that the government was lifting the minimum wage, providing more childcare for working parents and cutting social rents. \nLater Mr Cameron sought to turn the tables on Mr Corbyn by urging Labour MPs to vote with him in favour of the fiscal charter, which requires governments to run budget surpluses “in normal times”. He suggested Labour wanted to “borrow money forever”. \nMr Corbyn adopted a serious, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger approach to his questions although he threw in a few old-style jibes: “I know the prime minister is doing his best,” he said at one point. \nThe tensest exchanges came when Angus Robertson, leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, warned of the consequences of bombing Syria — citing the precedents of Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq — and said the UK had not done enough to help refugees. \n“I can’t remember a question with so many errors,” Mr Cameron replied, saying the UK had given more aid to Syrians than any other European country. The consequences of non-intervention were also “worth considering”, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:48:20.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
