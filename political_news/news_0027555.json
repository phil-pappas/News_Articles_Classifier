Pent-up investor demand fueled a jump in Shanghai stocks after Chinese markets reopened Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, following an extended holiday but other world bourses were lackluster ahead of the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 9, 2015 | 2:36 a.m. EDT + More By ELAINE KURTENBACH, AP Business Writer\nTOKYO (AP) â€” Asia stock markets rose Friday on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at a record low for several more months. Energy stocks advanced with the price of oil.\nKEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.4 percent to 18,395.29 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.3 percent to 22,633.78. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 1.3 percent at 5,279.70 and China's Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9 percent to 3,171.34. Southeast Asian stock markets also rose. South Korea's markets were closed for a holiday.\nFED FACTOR: Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting showed officials expressing confidence that the U.S. economy was improving. But policymakers worried that inflation remains abnormally low, noting the recent drop in commodity prices. That was the main reason the Fed did not raise interest rates in September. Markets now think the Fed won't hike at its meetings in October or December, particularly after weak monthly U.S. employment numbers.\nTHE Quote: : \"The Fed minutes released overnight seemed to cement investor expectations for the Fed to delay their first rate rise until 2016,\" Angus Nicholson, market analyst at IG, wrote in a commentary. \"The big question now is how far can this relief rally go for?\"\nWALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 138.46 points, or 0.8 percent, to 17,050.75 on Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 17.60 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,013.43 and Nasdaq composite rose 19.64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,810.79.\nENERGY: The price of oil and energy stocks rose as Russia's military actions in Syria raised the risk of a wider conflict in the region. Benchmark U.S. oil gained 96 cents to $50.39 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose $1.62, or 3.4 percent, to $49.43 a barrel in New York on Thursday. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, rose 78 cents to $54.16. It gained $1.72, or 3.4 percent, to $53.05 a barrel in London.\nCURRENCIES: The U.S. dollar rose to 120.12 yen from 119.90 in the previous session. The euro slipped to $1.1283 from $1.1291.\n___\nFollow Elaine Kurtenbach: www.twitter.com/ekurtenbach\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
