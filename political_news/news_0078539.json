In a Sept. 23 letter, the ACLU states that the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles, \"citing problems accessing a database run by Puerto Rico that could be used to electronically verify the status of those licenses,\" is requiring those new residents to pass the written knowledge exam and road skills test \"that all new drivers must take.\" \"In other words, regardless of whether they have been driving for five, ten or forty years, U.S. citizens moving here from Puerto Rico are being treated like 16-year-olds seeking their first driving permit,\" wrote ACLU executive director Steven Brown. \"The DMV's treatment of these citizens is appalling.\" DMV Administrator Walter R. Craddock said Thursday, \"The DMV will be responding to the [ACLU] letter in the next few days.\" In an email, Craddock ascribed the problem to a systems communications issue that \"has been ongoing for several years.\" He wrote, \"To be clear, applicants from Puerto Rico are not being denied a license, it just cannot be done as a license transfer without authentication from Puerto Rico.\" Brown said three unrelated people recently brought complaints to the ACLU. (A separate complainant wrote about the problem in a Sept. 19 \"Ask the DMV\" column in The Journal.) Brown noted, \"Although we are willing to stand corrected, we have not heard of any other state where Puerto Rican driver's license transferees are facing the problems that licensees here are facing.\" Brown asked Raimondo to immediately order the DMV to accept and transfer licenses from former Puerto Rican residents, \"notwithstanding any 'electronic verification' problems with the Commonwealth,\" as long as those individuals comply with all of the agency's documentation requirements, and that the DMV enforcement office \"has no reason to suspect any fraudulent activity.\" Brown said the fact that applicants have provided \"the very thorough list of official documents that the DMV policy requires of them,\" including an original certified birth certificate, and a recent officially certified driving record from Puerto Rico, should be enough. Those documents are also being screened for fraud. Craddock said, \"The license and driving record of every person moving into the state — whether from Massachusetts, California or Puerto Rico — is checked to ensure that they are capable of safely operating a motor vehicle and that there is nothing in their driving history to preclude issuance of a RI license. \"At the present time, Puerto Rico does not put these records on file, which means we don't have a way to verify the documents as we do with other states. We hope Puerto Rico can correct this, so we can have a smooth, streamlined process for all customers,\" Craddock wrote. Page 2 of 2 - Craddock said several attempts have been made \"within the last couple years ... to determine why Puerto Rico was failing to respond to inquiries.\" Those attempts have been unsuccessful. He said the RI DMV will send a request for a particular license number \"and the consistent response to queries is, 'nothing on file' or 'no record found.'\" A second requests generates \"the same responses.\" kziner@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:05:07.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
