According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer for women in America, but with early detection this disease can be treated effectively 96 percent of the time.\n\"The City of Chicago is going pink all of October in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month,\" said Mayor Emanuel. \"We are lighting nearly 200 buildings across Chicago - from the tallest skyscrapers to Soldier Field - because we want every woman and every family to stand as informed advocates.\"\nThe city lighting campaign, titled \" Light the Way to Find a Cure ,\" works with hundreds of Chicago buildings, landmarks and businesses to participate by illuminating their structures pink or by displaying pink banners and flags throughout the month of October. This year's lighting also holds a special meaning for LSCRF, as it marks the philanthropic group's 30 year anniversary in 2015 since it was first formed in 1985.\n\"In the fight against breast cancer, we know that early detection is often the most critical factor in the successful treatment of any breast cancer, but it is also important that we continue to support innovative research into new breast cancer treatment and prevention methods,\" said Valentine Ecker Klutznick , LSCRF's lighting campaign chair. \"Throughout our 30 year history, our mission has been to support the advancement of breast cancer research, treatment and prevention in partnership with Northwestern Medicine and the Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University .\"\nIn 30 years, LSCRF has raised more than $29 million for breast cancer research and care. Through their support, LSCRF was able to establish the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, fund 45 doctoral fellow appointments in breast cancer and provide grants for a wide range of breast cancer research, including digital mammography, which is now accepted as a standard of care.\n\"We are proud to join the Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation in raising breast cancer awareness in Chicago,\" said Michael Kelly, general superintendent and CEO of the Chicago Park District . \"We hope by lighting the Maggie Daley climbing walls pink, Chicagoans and tourists will be reminded of the importance of early detection and treatment.\"\nIn addition to lighting the city of Chicago this October, LSCRF will close out Breast Cancer Awareness Month by hosting its second annual Lynn Sage Cancer Research Foundation 5K on Sunday, October 25, 2015 . The event will not only serve as another way to raise awareness in Chicago , but all proceeds from the 5K will also support innovative breast cancer research and educational programs. The LSCRF 5K will take place in Chicago's scenic Lincoln Park .\nParticipants of the LSCRF 5K can choose to run, jog, or walk the course , and the event is also stroller friendly. For those that choose to run, the 5K will provide a certified course with bib-chip timing. Anyone who is unable to participate, but who would still like to support the event, can also choose to donate or volunteer .\nFormed in 1985, LSCRF partners exclusively with Northwestern Medicine and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to raise resources for breast cancer research and education.
