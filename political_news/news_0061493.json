The Siksika First Nation in Alberta only had 400 ballots for a community of 7,200 people , reported APTN. \nThe election day turnout followed a record-breaking number of advance voters over the Thanksgiving weekend. \nAbout 3.6 million people cast their ballots in four days, up 16 per cent from the same period in the 2011 election, which featured three days of advance voting. \nThe Liberals will form a majority government with Monday's results, with Justin Trudeau poised to be Canada's next prime minister.   Liberal leader and incoming prime minister Justin Trudeau hugs his mother Margaret Trudeau as he makes his way on stage at Liberal party headquarters in Montreal.
