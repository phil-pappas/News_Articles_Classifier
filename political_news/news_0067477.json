And the real estate mogul wants everyone else to follow his lead.\n\"I am self-funding my campaign and therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long. I have disavowed all Super PAC's, requested the return of all donations made to said PAC's, and I am calling on all Presidential candidates to do the same,\" Trump said in a statement released through his campaign. \"The character of our country is only as strong as our leaders---the only special interest I am beholden to is the American people and together we will Make America Great Again!\"\nThe announcement comes a day after the main super PAC backing Trump closed amid scrutiny about its relationship to the campaign itself. Trump has never given his endorsement to that super PAC (Make America Great) or any of the other eight super PACs supporting his run.\nAccording to a statement released by Trump's campaign, the candidate's legal counsel sent letters to all of the groups on Wednesday, citing confusion that their involvement could cause it could cause with supporters.\n\"We are providing this written notice that your organization is not authorized to use Mr. Trump's name and likeness in connection with its fundraising activities, and we are formally disavowing such activities. Thus, given the invocation of Donald J. Trump in connection with your activities, we ask that you refund all funds received by you in connection with any fundraising undertaken to specifically support and/or done in the name of Donald J. Trump...The campaign has never received money from your PAC, nor does the campaign want any money, services or goods from your committee,\" the letter said, according to the campaign.\nIn the last quarter, Trump raised $3.9 million from roughly 75,000 individual donors.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:19:58.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
