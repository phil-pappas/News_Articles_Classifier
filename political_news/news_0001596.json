This ad features a woman talking straight to the camera.\nScript: “Let’s talk about the plan to legalize marijuana. The politicians are playing games by calling it a monopoly. They’ll do anything to trick voters. It’s not a monopoly. It’s a plan that initially limits the growers for strict regulation before adding more.\n“It provides medical marijuana for those in need. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. If you think it’s time to legalize marijuana, this is our chance. Vote No on 2. Yes on 3.”\nAnalysis: What is a monopoly? In ResponsibleOhio’s fourth ad of the campaign, marijuana-legalization backers argue politicians are trying to trick Ohioans by labeling the amendment a pot-growing monopoly controlled by 10 wealthy investment groups. The ad describes it instead as “a plan that initially (emphasis added) limits the growers for strict regulation before adding more.”\nThe reality is the amendment would grant a monopoly to 10 growers for at least four years after passage. At that point, the Marijuana Control Commission would measure consumer demand for marijuana in the state and “may” issue a license for an additional grow facility. However, that is neither required nor certain.\nPerhaps more to the point is the line saying, “If you think it’s time to legalize marijuana, this is our chance.” That is almost certainly true. If this issue fails, another isn’t likely to come anytime soon.\nAlso, while state officials, including Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine, suggested state lawmakers ought to think about legalizing medical marijuana if Issue 3 fails, there is no support in the General Assembly for full-blown legalization.\nOhioans Against Marijuana Monopolies, the opposing group, has not yet run a broadcast television commercial. A shortage of funds has limited the group to cable advertising.\najohnson@dispatch.com \n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:12:18.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
