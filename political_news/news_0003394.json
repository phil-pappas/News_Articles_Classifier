The officer then shot the teenager dead. More Isis Inc how oil fuels the terrorists \n“All of a sudden, she drew out a knife and tried to stab me in the neck,” the policewoman, identified only as Corporal M, told Israel’s Ynet news website. The officer described how she “neutralised” Esseili. “I took a step back and shot the terrorist without hesitating.” \nAs Israeli security officials seek to end a month-long wave of knife and other attacks using roadblocks and body searches, they are struggling to understand the motives of attackers, many of whom are young and acting alone, in the region’s worst upsurge of communal violence since the second intifada. \nEleven Israelis, one Eritrean, and about 50 Palestinians, attackers and others, have died in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip since the unrest erupted at the end of September. \nWith thousands of police and soldiers now deployed in Jerusalem, where the violence began, the attacks are spreading to the West Bank, a much larger area where Palestinians come into daily contact with Israeli security personnel and settlers. \nThe clash between the policewoman and Esseili attests both to the young age of many of the Palestinians involved in the violence, and the jumble of motives behind it, at which older Israelis and Palestinians can only guess. Decades of mutual suspicion and conflict only fuel the confusion. Poster of Bayan al-Esseili describing her as a 'martyr' \nThe deadly incident in which Esseili lost her life was one of three alleged attacks on Israelis that day in Hebron, the West Bank’s largest city, where about 800 Jewish settlers live under army and police protection, surrounded by some 200,000 Palestinians. \nFadel al-Qawasmeh, an 18 year-old house painter, was also shot and killed after passing through a police checkpoint in Hebron’s Old City. Israeli police say he tried to stab a settler; Qawasmeh’s family and other Palestinians insist he could not have passed the checkpoint’s metal detector with a weapon, and allege the knife was planted at the crime scene. \nIsraeli officials and security analysts say the attackers are being encouraged by false rumours, inflammatory statements and violent images on social media sites, some of which use blood-drenched iconography reminiscent of jihadi groups such as Isis. \n“The intelligence establishment cannot get between the ears of a teenager who decides when he wakes up that he’s going to perform a terror attack,” says Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. \nPalestinian officials attribute the violence to young people’s pent-up grievances over a failed peace process, the continued growth of Israeli settlements, and violence by settlers and security forces against Palestinians. \n“When we look at this latest protest movement, it is primarily by younger people, by youth, by teenagers, by high school and university students . . . who felt they had had enough of unbridled Israeli violence, of ongoing violations,” Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestinian official, said on Monday. More video \nMany of the violent acts, she said, were “revenge for the killing of their own friends or their relatives or injustices that they have seen”, Ms Ashrawi added. \nBecause so many of the alleged attackers have been killed, it is difficult to get a sense of their motivation. Esseili’s mother, Ghadir, described her daughter as someone who “loved the homeland; she followed the news in Palestine and the rest of the world”. She was also following “events at al-Aqsa”, the mosque complex at the Jerusalem holy site known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount. \nThe mosque, both a Muslim shrine and Palestinian national symbol, has been a flashpoint during the violence. Palestinians accuse Israel’s government and rightwing religious Jews of seeking to upend a status quo prohibiting Jewish prayer there, accusations denied by the Israeli government. \nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly denied Israel will do this, and accuses President Mahmoud Abbas and other Palestinians of promulgating a “big lie”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:51:25.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
