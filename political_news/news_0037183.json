He is not the player he used to be\n—Mohammad Azharuddin\nHe has been a great player for India, but you don't want him to become a liability for the team. And he needs to perform a lot better than he has been. Just because he has done it over the years, doesn't mean it's okay for him to fail\n—Ajit Agarkar\nMahendra Singh Dhoni is used to criticism. Any cricketer is. But how often do you hear someone questioning his very place in the team? Whether you like it or not, these are no longer whispers. And this has got to do with his diminishing returns as a batsman (see box) coupled with his waning powers as far as finishing games is concerned.\nAfter failing to take India past the finish line in Kanpur on Sunday, Dhoni said, \"The outcome was not great for us. There were quite a few things that went wrong, but I think we showed great character to fight on this wicket. We should have won the game.\"\nA little later, he launched a veiled attack at the top order batsmen — Virat Kohli, if you may please — whose good work he undid with some uncharacteristic batting at the death.\n\"I thought that the partnership between Rohit (Sharma) and (Ajinkya) Rahane was very good. They made it (run-scoring) look easy. It was a bit difficult to bat out there as it (the ball) did not come on nicely if it was banged short. We lost a bit of momentum from the 34th or the 35th over to the 40th or the 41st over. There were runs on offer, but we didn't hit the gaps,\" he said.\nIndia lost Rahane (60, 82 balls, 5x4) in the 34th over. In other words, Virat Kohli walked in at 191/2, with 113 runs needed off 98 balls. When Kohli fell for 11 (18 balls) in the 40th over, India were 214/3. In walked Dhoni. By the end of the 41st over, the scoreboard read 225/3, leaving India with 79 to get off nine overs.\nSo India scored 23 runs between the departure Rahane and Kohli. And they did so in 6.2 overs. That's an average of less than four runs an over. Bad no doubt, but not as poor as Dhoni, who couldn't produce the big hits in a situation seemingly tailormade for him.\nDhoni's biggest strength is his ability to find the rope or the area beyond with ridiculous ease. Of late, that quality seems to have deserted him. His 30-ball 31 was punctuated with just one boundary and a string of ones and twos. With a couple sixes required, Dhoni could only offer a return catch to Kagiso Rabada, who kept his cool against someone who he admired watching on TV.\n\"It's not an easy job, it doesn't always work your way, especially you know, you have to play the big shot. At times, the wicket is great and is coming on nicely to the bat, more often than not, you use the pace of the bowler and get away with it. But on wickets like these where the average bounce is a bit low, they can still hit the deck hard and the ball doesn't really bounce as much as it should. So it becomes it slightly difficult,\" Dhoni admitted.\nWhether you like it or not, India are yet to win a game in this series. That's two (completed) Twenty20 matches and an ODI gone. Mind you, we are playing at home. And don't forget, R Ashwin — Dhoni's trump card and the team's in-form bowler — is out for now. The least Dhoni can do is find his mojo. Otherwise, the daggers will be out before he knows it.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://profiles.google.com/101061788010040353388/about"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:52.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
