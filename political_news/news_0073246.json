Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., in joining with Republicans, some Democrats and veterans to urge the passage of legislation to lift the 40-year-old ban on oil exports, while hinting that a new move may be afoot on pushing forward the pipeline project.\nBishop joined the group Vet4Energy Thursday at a rally announcing a lobbying push by America's servicemen to get Congress to pass legislation to lift the ban soon. Aides says they are hopeful a bill will be passed in the House next week.\nThe Keystone XL pipeline has been stalled for almost seven years by the Obama administration. Most Democrats raise the specter of climate change when citing the embattled project, which has been long a GOP priority. The pipeline would connect Canadian oil from the oil sands in Alberta to refiners on the Gulf Coast.\nMore from the Washington Examiner D-Day for debt ceiling: Nov. 5 Treasury secretary says cap will be hit earlier than expected.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/01/15 6:05 PM Bishop paired the lifting of the oil-export ban and approval of the pipeline as energy priorities for Congress.\n\"Both Keystone and crude send ... an important signal to both the American public and our adversaries overseas that the U.S. will not be bullied by foreign interests in regard to energy and oil,\" Bishop said.\nHe was joined by Republicans Reps.
