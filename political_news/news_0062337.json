In partnership with Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. - a nonprofit organization that provides bullet- and stab-protective vests to police departments nationwide - the group donated three protective vests to help keep the Arkansas -based K-9 officers safe.\nThousands of law enforcement K-9s put their lives on the line to protect America on a daily basis. They are usually the first officer to enter a dangerous situation, and help track and neutralize violent criminals, sniff out illegal or explosive materials and search for survivors of natural disasters. In most cases, law enforcement agencies do not have the budget to purchase K-9 protective vests because they cost $1,050 each. As a result, police dogs are left unprotected while fighting crime.\nBentonville K-9 officer Corporal Guary Morgan said, \"Our K-9s give their new vests a tail-wagging approval as they continue to protect the citizens of Bentonville .\"\nThe K-9 vest recipients are:\nTyson, assigned to Officer Andy Ball Merlin, assigned to Officer Guary Morgan Nico, assigned to Officer William Cooper The protective vests will be awarded to the K-9 officers during a ceremony at the Bentonville Walmart Supercenter, located at 406 S.
