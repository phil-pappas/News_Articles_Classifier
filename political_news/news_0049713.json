On the fundraising front, the former U.S. secretary of state was lagging on grass-roots donations. \nNow: Gone is the notion that Clinton is the runaway favorite. Clinton has encroached more and more into Sanders' territory on issues. She also does more news interviews, answering endless questions about her use of a home email server as the nation's top diplomat. At 48 percent, she's 7 points above Sanders among likely Democratic caucusgoers, the new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll shows. \nNext 100 days: To win the Iowa caucuses, Clinton needs to ignore outside distractions and keep focusing on building her statewide organization and offering her progressive vision for the country, Iowa Democratic campaign strategist Brad Anderson said. \"It is incredibly easy to get distracted by the day-to-day horse race and partisan attacks,\" Anderson said, \"but if Hillary Clinton continues to beat expectations in debates and candidate cattle calls and the Clinton volunteers and field organizers continue to sign people up in all 99 counties, they will inevitably do very well on Feb. 1.\" \nFollow Iowa Caucus news, photos, videos with Iowa Caucuses App: Sign up for Caucuses Newsletter BERNIE SANDERS \nSen.

(Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images) \n100 days ago: The Vermont U.S. senator and liberal rebellion leader was getting attention for saying on CBS’s “Face the Nation”: “I will be able to deliver in Washington. I will be able to win the election.” The self-described democratic socialist was no longer dubiously viewed as a no-chance candidate; Clinton aides were admitting they were worried about his rise. Exactly 200 days before the caucuses, he threw a grand opening celebration for his new Des Moines headquarters, a spot much bigger than his previous one. He was already attracting Iowa crowds as big as 2,500. \nNow: The grass-roots fervor still appears to favor Sanders, who snagged 77 percent of his third-quarter contributions from small-dollar donors, compared to about 18 percent for Clinton. And he nearly matched her in total fundraising, $29.9 million to $26.2 million. His 41 percent support in the new Iowa Poll places him within striking distance of Clinton, at 48 percent. \nNext 100 days: It will all be about organizing power. Much of Sanders' support comes from nontraditional caucusgoers, said Anderson, Iowa director for the Obama campaign in 2012. \"If these new folks fail to turn out, it will be reminiscent of the Howard Dean campaign, and if they show up, it may be packed gymnasiums and Obama 2008 all over again,\" Anderson said. MARTIN O'MALLEY Buy Photo \nMaryland governor Martin O'Malley is pictured inside The Des Moines Register newsroom on Saturday, March 21, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo: Charlie Litchfield/The Register) \n100 days ago: He had faded from the conversation before becoming a part of it, despite firing off detailed policy proposals, such as his call for 100 percent clean energy by 2050. The former Maryland governor’s poll numbers were stuck in the mud in Iowa — an NBC/Marist poll had him at 3 percent — despite out-hustling his Democratic rivals on the campaign trail here. He had been wooing Iowa Democrats since he visited them at the 2012 national convention in North Carolina. \nNow : He has done more than 100 events here this cycle, a third more than Sanders and doubling Clinton's. His national poll number is half a percentage point. In Iowa, O'Malley has only 2 percent support, the new lowa Poll shows. He raised only $1.3 million in the third quarter. \nNext 100 days: The next Democratic debate, on Nov. 14 in Des Moines, will be another opportunity for O’Malley to recast the race narrative reinforced by the first debate — that this is strictly a one-on-one battle between Clinton and Sanders. He also needs some luck, which all politicians need at some point in their careers, Anderson said. \"Second choice matters on the Democratic side, and while it's difficult to see an outright victory for O'Malley, a Clinton stumble, a Sanders flame-out, or some combination of the two could give O'Malley the opportunity to beat expectations on caucus night.\" NEVER ENTERED JOE BIDEN Buy Photo \nVice President Joe Biden waves to a crowd of supporters during a campaign stop at the University of Iowa campus on Sept. 7, 2012. (Photo: The Register) \n100 days ago: It was six weeks after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau, a loss that devastated the Biden family. For years, Biden had telegraphed his Oval Office interest to Iowans. In January 2013, at the State Society of Iowa's event in D.C., he said: \"I am proud to be president of the United States.\" Beau Biden interrupted the roar of laughter and cheers to say his dad misspoke. Joe Biden, grinning, then amended his comment to say he was proud to be Barack Obama's vice president. \nNow: He captured 12 percent support in the new Iowa Poll, but on Wednesday, about 4½ months after his son died of brain cancer, Biden announced he wouldn't seek the presidency in 2016. During his grieving process, the window for mounting a national campaign had closed, he said. ALREADY DEPARTED JIM WEBB Buy Photo \nDemocratic presidential candidate Jim Webb speaks at the Register's Soapbox at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 13. (Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Register) \n100 days ago: The former secretary of the U.S. Navy was in the headlines for saying on Fox News that “the party has moved way far to the left. That's not my Democratic Party in and of itself.\" \nNow : Webb, who raised just $700,000 in the third quarter, stepped out of the Democratic race on Tuesday, Oct. 20, saying he's considering running as an independent. He had actually lost ground in the polls: He was at a high water mark of 3 percent in Iowa in January, but was an asterisk before his departure. LINCOLN CHAFEE \nFormer Rhode Island Gov.

(Photo: John Locher, AP) \n100 days ago: Chafee made his debut Iowa visit for the Iowa Democratic Party's Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids. \nNow: The former Rhode Island U.S. senator and governor showed up for just nine events in Iowa this cycle, almost none organized by his own campaign. His performance in the first debate led to questions about when he would drop out. Americans donated just $15,500 to his campaign. He exited the race on Friday, Oct. 23.
