Foster children who were surveyed reported that they were prohibited from trying out for cheerleading, going on field trips or having senior portraits taken. \nThe report was based on input from more than 300 stakeholders in Nebraska's foster care system, including current and former foster children, child welfare advocates, foster parents and the Department of Health and Human Services. \nChild advocates urged lawmakers to adopt the recommendations of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, a federal law passed last year to promote safety and a sense of normalcy for foster care children. The Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee convened the hearing Thursday to hear public input on the issue. \nJennifer Rodriguez, executive director of the San Francisco-based Youth Law Center and a former foster child, said foster children should have a support system while being allowed to make mistakes. \nThe report recommended that Nebraska law make clear that children in care have a right to participate in age-appropriate activities. \nIt also suggested creating a grievance procedure for children who feel their wishes aren't being heard, and requiring Nebraska's juvenile courts to provide oversight to ensure that caregivers are giving children a chance to participate in activities. The state should also clarify the rights of foster parents, the report said. \nRaevin Bigelow, who aged out of the foster care system three years ago, said she wasn't allowed to attend a church while in a group home because she hadn't earned enough \"points\" for the week to earn the privilege. \n\"When you spend time in foster care, you're reminded plenty of times that your life is different from other kids,\" said Bigelow, 21. \nNebraska had 4,099 state wards as of Monday, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Doug Weinberg, director of the department's Children and Family Services division, said the agency now tells foster parents to use \"reasonable and prudent\" parenting standards when deciding whether to allow a child to participate in activities. \nWeinberg said his division has also proposed new regulations to protect the licenses of foster parents who follow the standards. \nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:11:48.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
