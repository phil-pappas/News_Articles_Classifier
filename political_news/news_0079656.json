The 30-minute news conference will air live on NASA Television and agency's website.\nStation Commander Scott Kelly and Flight Engineer Kjell Lindgren of NASA, Flight Engineers Mikhail Kornienko , Oleg Kononenko and Sergey Volkov of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and Flight Engineer Kimiya Yui of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency will take questions from U.S., Russian and Japanese media during the news conference.\nDue to time limitations, questions will be taken only from media participating in person at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston or the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. International media accreditation for this event is closed.\nTo apply for accreditation at Johnson , media must call Johnson's newsroom at 281-483-5111 by 8 a.m. Friday, Oct. 30 . To apply for accreditation at Kennedy, U.S. media without permanent credentials must apply for accreditation by 8 a.m. Monday, Nov. 2 , at:\nhttps://media.ksc.nasa.gov\nTwo forms of government-issued identification are required to receive a badge, including one form with a photo, such as a driver's license or passport. Badges will be available for pickup at the Kennedy Badging Office, located on State Road 405 east of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. Hours for the Kennedy Badging Office are 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. Questions about accreditation may be addressed to Jennifer Horner at 321-867-6598 or jennifer.p.horner@nasa.gov .\nExpedition 1 arrived at the orbital outpost Nov. 2, 2000 , its first residents including Commander William Shepherd of NASA and cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko of Roscosmos. Their mission marked the start of an uninterrupted human presence on the complex that has seen the station grow from a modest pair of U.S. and Russian modules, to a sprawling laboratory and home the size of a football field.\nOrbiting 250 miles above the Earth, astronauts aboard the station are conducting research not possible on the ground, such as the one-year mission with Kelly and Kornienko to research the effects on the human body of an extended stay in a microgravity environment. The space station also is facilitating the growth of a robust commercial market in low-Earth orbit for research, technology development, and crew and cargo transportation.\nFor more information about the International Space Station and its crew, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/station\nFor NASA TV streaming video, schedule and downlink information, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/nasatv\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\n releases/space-station-crew-celebrates-15-years-of-human-space-exploration-in-low-earth-orbit-300166021.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/space-station-crew-celebrates-15-years-of-human-space-exploration-in-low-earth-orbit-300166021.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.nasa.gov/station", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC38196&Transmission_Id=201510261149PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC38196&DateId=20151026", "http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv", "https://media.ksc.nasa.gov/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:50:29.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
