(AP) — For a driver on the brink of championship elimination, Kevin Harvick might have the biggest target at Dover.\nThe mission is clear: Knock out Harvick, knock out a champion.\n\"Everyone in this Chase knows they are the biggest threat for the championship,\" four-time champ Jeff Gordon said. \"If they get eliminated then that takes the biggest threat out of it.\n\"Kevin and that team are going to be working hard and all the other teams are going to be working hard to win this race and potentially eliminate one of the biggest threats.\"\nHarvick and his team have been doing a pretty good job of taking themselves out of the running in their title defense.\nTime may have run out on the No. 4 Chevrolet.\nThe third race in NASCAR's playoffs is a crucial one — the bottom four drivers out of the 16 in the field are cut and gone from the title picture.\nHarvick is 15th and will have to win to advance and remain in championship contention.\nKyle Busch, Paul Menard, Harvick and Clint Bowyer are in the bottom four and most at risk of elimination Sunday.\n\"We've still got racing to do,\" Bowyer said.\nJust not Friday.\nThere was no action on the track because rain wiped out qualifying at Dover International Speedway.\nEven when it rains, the sun shines on Joe Gibbs Racing.\nWith the field set on points, Matt Kenseth has the pole and is followed by JGR teammates Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards. Hamlin won the Chase opener at Chicagoland and Kenseth won last week at New Hampshire to earn automatic berths in the next round.\nThe rest of the Chase grid looks like this: Jimmie Johnson is fifth, followed by Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., and Jeff Gordon. Jamie McMurray is 11th and Dale Earnhardt Jr. 12th.\nJohnson won at May in Dover for the latest of his 10 career wins on the mile concrete track.\nHarvick is 0 for 29 at Dover. He has two wins and a series-best 18 top-fives, but has busted out in the Chase. Harvick finished 42nd in the Chase opener and was 21st last week at New Hampshire. He was runner-up to Johnson in May in the first Dover race.\nHarvick thrives on pressure and took the checkered flag in must-win races last season at Phoenix and Homestead to take the championship.\n\"It's just really part of sports and that's what makes it exciting,\" Harvick said.\nThe only excitement Friday was found inside Dover's media center.\nGordon, a five-time Dover winner, was feted by the track as he winds down his 23-year career. Gordon received proclamations from the city of Dover and Delaware's House of Representatives and Senate. Dover also presented him with 90 miniature Monster trophies for his entire No. 24 team and his family.\n\"I don't know how we're going to get all those home,\" he said.\nBut the nicest gift may have been the addition of Nick Odell as the No. 24's starting front-tire changer. Odell, the best in the sport, was released by Joe Gibbs Racing after the Chase opener. Scott Brzozowski will move from the No. 24 team to Earnhardt's No. 88 team as its starting front-tire changer.\nGordon's last victory came in this race last season, and hoped it wouldn't be remembered as the final one of his career.\n\"We didn't have to win that race in order to move on, we just needed to have a solid day,\" Gordon said. \"I feel like we are in a very similar position this weekend.\"\nGordon was among the drivers who praised NASCAR's decision to double the restart zone for this weekend's race from 70 feet to 140 feet.\nThe restart rules were unchanged, and drivers will still line up double file. The leader is the control car and the second-place car can't pass the leader in the restart zone.\nBrad Keselowski was penalized last week at New Hampshire for jumping a late restart. He complained that NASCAR was entertainment and unfair after the penalty.\nDrivers have been outspoken in wanting NASCAR to take a harder look at restarts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:46:35.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
