A legal complaint was never filed in district court, a fact that creates a void that allows both sides to make opposite arguments.\nThe ultimate truth test, according to legal experts, is the ballot. \"The registered electors,\" the state constitution reads , \"shall be the sole and exclusive judges of the legality, reasonableness and sufficiency\" of grounds for recall.\nTo justify the claim, the recall petitioners point to the board's split decision to hire attorney Brad Miller at the Dec. 12, 2013, meeting.\nThe board held the vote in public at a regular meeting, as required by state law, but it did not conduct a public interview process. Instead, the Republican board members spoke with candidates in private on their own. The state's sunshine law requires all formal board action to take place in public meetings.\nAdvertisement An open government expert, attorney Thomas Kelley, suggested at the time that the hiring may violate the open meetings law.\n\"Whether it's formal or informal is irrelevant and it appears calculated to evade the open-meetings law,\" said Kelley, who represents the Colorado Press Association and The Denver Post. \"I'm not sure a judge would buy that.\"\nThe recall supporters argue that the board majority made the decision to hire the Miller Sparks law firm before the meeting, even if the final vote was taken in public. A piece of evidence they cite is a discussion at the Thompson School Board meeting in Loveland the day before the Jefferson County meeting.\nIn a discussion about hiring their own board attorney, Thompson board Chairman Bob Kerrigan said Jefferson County had a board attorney.\nIn an interview, Kerrigan said his information came from his own research but he didn't speak with Jeffferson County about the topic.\nLynea Hanson with JeffCo United for Action , the organization leading the recall effort, said the board's critics didn't take the matter to court because \"we wouldn't get anything from it.\"\nEven if a judge found that the board violated the law, it would only force a re-do of the vote, rather than block the move, experts said.\nMiller said he never spoke to the board majority before the vote, beside one-on-one conversations with Witt and Newkirk. \"The blanket allegation of secret meetings — it's a misnomer,\" he said.\nWitt said the GOP members \"have not met together in secret and arranged a vote. We have not violated open meetings laws.\"", "external_links": ["http://jeffcounited.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sample-Recall-Ballot.pdf", "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/education/ci_24715233/thompson-school-districts-board-consider-contract-separate-legal", "http://jeffcounited.org/", "http://coloradofoic.org/files/2013/12/Title-24-Article-6.pdf", "http://tornado.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/olls/constitution.htm#ARTICLE_XXI"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:19:19.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
