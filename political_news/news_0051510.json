Credit Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press In announcing Wednesday that he would not be a presidential candidate in 2016, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. counseled Democrats to campaign on President Obama’s record. But Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who calls himself a democratic socialist, suggested in a television interview hours after Mr. Biden’s Rose Garden speech that he didn’t intend to heed that advice. Calling Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden “wonderful people” who have “done a damn good job” after the fiscal crisis of 2008, Mr. Sanders suggested that the nation needed to follow a new course for the future. He credited the president and the vice president with forging a path forward in the face of “terrible obstructionism” from Republicans in Congress, and “bringing us to a place where we’re obviously a lot better than we were seven years ago,” Mr. Sanders told the journalist Chris Hayes on MSNBC. But the country still has “an enormous amount of work to do,” Mr. Sanders said. When pressed by Mr. Hayes, Mr. Sanders said he saw no “tension” between praising the president and calling for a new path forward. “I personally believe, given the crisis we face right now with the power structure in America,” Mr. Sanders said, that “a political revolution” is needed. Was that the goal of the administration? “Not really,” Mr. Sanders said. The comments are consistent with how Mr. Sanders has described his political views. He has tapped into a well of deep populist anger within the base of the Democratic Party, and has been praised for sounding a note of authenticity. Still, Mr. Obama remains popular among the Democratic voters Mr. Sanders is seeking to court. This weekend, Mr. Sanders will be among the speakers at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, an event that helped vault Mr. Obama in 2007 when he was running against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
