The staff offers support to educate them on improving and understanding credit and lending basics. And they have always been supportive in helping us host neighborhood and community events.\"\nRed River Bank Vice President and CRA Officer Jannease Seastrunk Jannease Seastrunk expressed her gratitude for the opportunities provided through the Highland Center.\n\"Red River Bank is committed to strengthening our communities,\" she said. \"The life-changing work of the Highland Center has greatly helped the Highland neighborhood, and our bank is so pleased to support their work.\"\nU.S. Census figures showed that more than 198,000 people lived in Shreveport in 2014, with more than 21 percent of them living below the poverty level.

The funds may be used for research, organizational capacity-building, grant- and funding-application assistance, or contractual services. The structure of the PGP allows FHLB Dallas member institutions, such as Red River Bank, to make a contribution to a CBO, which FHLB Dallas will match. The member's contribution may range from $500 up to $4,000 and is matched at a 3:1 ratio. In 2015, FHLB Dallas awarded $225,000 in PGP funds to support 25 organizations.
