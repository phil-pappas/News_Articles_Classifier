The $500 million program was ended this week after it came under fire for training only a handful of rebels in the fight against the Islamic State. Many of the weapons the U.S. sent to the moderates quickly passed to al Qaeda in Syria and other jihadist groups.\n  Union membership collapses when workers allowed to exit The decline   Quinn.\nBy Sean Higgins • 10/12/15 12:01 AM Ford told Attkisson that the worst refugee crisis since World War II would only grow worse and up to 400,000 will die if the crisis in Syria is allowed to fester.\nFord's comments come on the heels of several setbacks to the administration's Syria policy. Russia announced it was launching airstrikes inside Syria to wipe out the Islamic State there, but the U.S. and its allies charge that the Kremlin is bombing moderate Syrian opposition. Putin is allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is accused of using chemical weapons against his own people.\nAttkisson asked if the U.S. is handling the refugee crisis properly and what is causing it, as well as whether we \"should be\" handling the crisis at all.\nCalling the crisis \"a terrible human tragedy,\" Ford responded that trying to fix the refugee problem in Europe will not solve the \"refugee problem at all because it goes back to the horrible fighting and destruction in Syrian cities, and now well over 200,000 Syrians killed.\"\n\"And, the number is rising very quickly,\" said Ford. \"It will be, I hate to say it, but it will be 300,000 and if it goes on, 400,000.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Skipping the first debate won't put Biden behind CNN said that even if Biden announced on the afternoon of the debate, there would be a spot for him onstage.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/12/15 12:01 AM Over 4 million Syrians have fled the country, now in its fifth year of civil war. Many European countries have been unable to handle the tide of refugees, most of whom say they would like to return to a peaceful Syria.\nThe former ambassador said that Syria needs \"a new national unity government\" that can put an end to extremism and begin \"to rebuild the country with international support.\"\n\"That's the way you're going to being not only to stop the flow of refugees going out, but actually then to encourage many Syrians to come home,\" said Ford. \"Rebuilding Syria will take decades.\"\nFord spent his career in the foreign service. He served as the U.S. ambassador to Algeria from 2006-2008 and ambassador to Syria from 2010-2014.\nConsidered \"one of the best Arabists\" during his tenure at the State Department, Ford hasn't been shy criticizing Obama's Syria policy in the past. In an interview with CNN shortly after his resignation, Ford said he could not \"defend the American policy\" because it had been \"unable to address either the root causes of the conflict in terms of the fighting on the ground\" or the \"growing extremism threat\" from the Islamic State.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Need a pick me up?
