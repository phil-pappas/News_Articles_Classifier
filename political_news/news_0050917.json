Of course the support people he hired were treated like shit by the rude American customers. But then he found solution, hire black support people with strong obvious black accents. The moronic liberal American customers are intimidated by blacks and are reluctant criticize blacks because of American liberal pro-black racism. Makes sense to me, take advantage of the pro-black American racism. So I will be hiring black support people soon. If you are selling to a black market then you need black customer support. Speaking and understanding a common language is the best way to communicate and have a successful business.
