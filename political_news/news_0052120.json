Donald Trump's presidential campaign filed its first report with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday, revealing a campaign powered more by grassroots donors than the famous billionaire at its helm, NBC News reported. Trump has said that he is willing to self-fund his campaign with up to $100 million, but through September, his campaign actually spent slightly more money from Trump supporters than from Trump himself. The filing shows Trump has invested $1.9 million of his own money into running for president, while his campaign spent $4.2 million this quarter, drawing from $3.9 million in mostly online donations. Trump has not prioritized fundraising events like other candidates, but his website features a prominent \"donate\" button.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:32:00.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
