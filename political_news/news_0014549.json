Terrill, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPLANO, Texas ( USA TODAY ) — A half-dozen Republican presidential candidates will attend a Sunday service with an influential audience: Religious conservatives. \nBen Carson, Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum will discuss faith and other issues during an election forum at Prestonwood Baptist Church near Dallas. \nCo-sponsored by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, the forum gives candidates a chance to appeal to a constituency that has big influence in early contest states such as Iowa, South Carolina, and Texas. \nThe idea is to \"connect candidates and their messages with people of faith who are potential voters.\" said Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition. He added: \"The conservative Christian vote still remains the largest political constituency in all of American politics.\" Trump faces backlash for blaming ex-President George W. Bush for 9/11 \nAmong the issues likely to surface in the forum: Abortion, the role of faith in political life, federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and religious liberty in the wake of the Supreme Court sanctioning gay marriage. \nOrganizers of the Prestonwood Baptist Church event invited all the presidential candidates from both parties. The six Republicans who accepted are all chasing one of the candidates who declined: Donald Trump, who is leading the pack in GOP preference polls. \nCarson, the retired neurosurgeon who is second to Trump in many surveys, is looking to consolidate his already strong support among evangelical voters. They are a large part of his support in Iowa, where February caucuses will be the first delegate selection contest of the 2016 race. \nSouth Carolina, which also has a high number of evangelicals in its Republican electorate, hosts the first southern primary of the contest later in February. The Texas primary is on March 1; it's one of several southern states holding primaries that day. \nFiorina — a businesswoman and another of the \"outsider\" Republican candidate who have never held public office — will be looking to build support among religious conservatives, who are not her natural constituency. \nBush faces a similar situation. The former Florida governor has less support among evangelicals and religious conservatives than brother George W. Bush did when he won the presidency twice. \nOne of the speaker at the Faith & Freedom Coalition has a home field advantage: Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. Cruz is also making an appeal to evangelicals a major part of his campaign in Iowa. \nSunday's forum also features the winners of the last two Iowa Republican caucuses, both with big support from evangelicals: Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum in 2012.
