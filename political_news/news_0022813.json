Now imagine that, despite medical evidence stating otherwise, you were blamed for the death of your infant and essentially considered a murderer in the eyes of the law. It sounds like something from medieval times, when public opinion and superstition had more sway than science, but it's not. That's what one mother of three, ​Amanda Kimbrough ​, has gone through in Alabama thanks to the \"chemical endangerment\" laws that can criminalize expecting mothers who test positive for trace amounts of drugs at any point in their pregnancy — even after giving birth to healthy children, and even if the drugs are medically approved.\n According to a recent report in ProPublica, Kimbrough ​is one of at least 479 women who have been found guilty of chemical endangerment in Alabama since the law's inception in 2006. Her case was brought to the Alabama Supreme Court \" in what is thought to be the only full trial hearing of its sort in the country,\" The Guardian reports. The outlet corresponded with Kimbrough via mail during the last two years of her prison term at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, deemed one of America's 10 worst prisons by Mother Jones in 2013. ​\n ​ Like two of Kimbrough's other children, Timmy was born premature. Kimbrough went into labor at 25 weeks and five days. He died about 19 minutes after birth. Her doctor attributed his death to a rare condition called \"occult cord prolapse,\" where the umbilical cord came through the uterus before the fetus did, cutting off the baby's blood flow. But prosecutors came after Kimbrough after they discovered trace amounts of methamphetamines in her urine, the Guardian reports. ​\nKimbrough was a recovering drug addict and maintains that she had been sober for two years ahead of her pregnancy with Timmy. However, she admits that she slipped one day when a friend came over and offered her a line, three days before she went into labor. An expert medical witness was willing to testify that the baby didn't die due to any drug use, but the testimony was not allowed in court. With few options, Kimbrough pled guilty to chemical endangerment and was sentenced for 10 years. She was released a little over three years later.\nThe mother told the Guardian that doctors recommended getting an abortion at 20 weeks, after they detected the baby may have Down syndrome. But the mother refused on moral grounds. ​The great irony of all of this is, of course, that if Kimbrough had had an abortion, ​​the outcome for her child would have been no different ​, but she would not have gone to prison. ​\nWhile abortion is legal, in Kimbrough's case, the state of Alabama has effectively decided that the unborn fetus is a person — and this person seemingly has more rights than its mother's. From the Guardian :\nThe judges ruled that the word \"child\" in the chemical endangerment law could be applied equally to unborn fetuses. To the astonishment of experts in reproductive health, the court went further and said that the law did not have to be restricted to viable fetuses — the standard set for abortion in Roe v Wade — but could in effect be used to prosecute pregnant women from the moment of conception.\nLynn Paltrow, the executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women told the Guardian that this interpretation \"creates a burden on all fertile women — because once there is a fertilized egg something they did yesterday that wasn't a crime could be a crime today. So if they are taking painkillers for a painful back, they are now guilty of a crime.\"\nAfter Kimbrough tested positive for meth, social services got involved and took her away from her kids while she sought treatment and took parenting classes. But then prosecutors came after her for Timmy's death, and now she says her three other children are suffering because of her punishment. \"I think it's wrong that I've been taken away from them. I think they should've offered me some type of drug rehab,\" she wrote in one letter. \"People make mistakes in life every day. I made mine, but my children shouldn't be punished for it.\"\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=hlp", "https://www.propublica.org/article/when-the-womb-is-a-crime-scene", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/magazine/the-criminalization-of-bad-mothers.html?_r=0", "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/americas-10-worst-prisons-julia-tutwiler", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2448410-pregnancy-criminals-al-ruling.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/07/alabama-chemical-endangerment-pregnancy-amanda-kimbrough", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2448410-pregnancy-criminals-al-ruling.html#document/p55/a247584"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:26:31.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
