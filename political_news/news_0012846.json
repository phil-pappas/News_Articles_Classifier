(Photo: Jason Noble/The Register) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRepublican presidential candidate Rand Paul wants one in every 13 Iowa college students to not just attend the Iowa caucuses, but to caucus for him . \nThe libertarian-leaning U.S. senator from Kentucky pitched his candidacy and highlighted a goal of turning out 10,000 students on caucus night during visits to nine college campuses across the state this week. \nPaul campaigned river-to-river on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, from Loras College in Dubuque to Morningside College in Sioux City, and hit three of the state’s largest universities on the way: the University of Iowa, the University of Northern Iowa and Drake University. \n(The tour initially called for 11 campus rallies; two were scrapped on Monday after travel delays.) \nAt Drake, the campaign culled attendees’ email addresses, hawked “Iowa 10,000” T-shirts for $10 apiece, and set up a photo booth for perhaps 150 students to pose with a generally quiet and unsmiling Paul. \nOn stage, Paul noted his appreciation for civil liberties but devoted most of his remarks to a critique of Democratic and Republican foreign policy. He argued that the U.S. should be far less engaged militarily in the Middle East, and tailored that message to the college crowd by reminding them of their potential role in violent conflict. \n“You will have a choice, and a lot of this is up to you. You’re the ones who fight the wars,” he said. “So think long and hard about it, whether you’re ready to volunteer to go to another Iraq war.” \nDrawing 10,000 college students to the Republican caucuses on Feb. 1 and coalescing them behind a single candidate would undoubtedly make a difference in a competitive race among 15 candidates. \nThe question is whether it can be done. \nUniversity of Iowa political scientist Tim Hagle said it was certainly possible, but called such an effort a “tough slog” that would require a superior campaign organization in addition to authentic, widespread enthusiasm for the candidate. \nAnd while Paul’s father, former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, generated genuine enthusiasm during his 2012 presidential run, Rand Paul has largely failed to connect with voters so far. He’s currently polling at around 3 percent nationally and in Iowa. \n“The problem for Rand Paul is that he doesn’t seem to be capturing that same excitement,” Hagle said. “That’s where I think the challenge is for him. They’re going to have to work very hard on the organizational side to come close to that 10,000 number.” \nIowa Board of Regents data estimated total public and private four-year college enrollment in Iowa at 130,945 in the fall of 2014, the latest year for which full statistics are available. \nBut given the competitive caucus contests underway in both parties and the fragmented nature of the Republican field – never mind young voters’ uneven record of political engagement – the pool of voters from which Paul can draw 10,000 caucus commitments is almost surely much smaller. \nHagle noted, too, that organizing college campuses is further complicated by many students’ desire to remain registered to vote in their hometowns – requiring them to leave campus on a Monday night in order to participate in the caucuses. \nStill, Paul adviser Steve Grubbs insists that five-figure college turnout is possible – and that it could be decisive. \n“We’re not talking about 50 percent turnout,” Grubbs said of the college voter electorate. “We’re talking about essentially less than 10 percent.” \nHe noted that the influence of student voters has been minimized in recent cycles because caucuses have taken place during college’s traditional winter breaks. With a Feb. 1 caucus date, students will be back on campus. \n“Ten thousand college students could not only be the difference maker on caucus night,” Grubbs said, “but they could also create the first Republican caucus campaign carried by college students.” \nRick Santorum won the 2012 caucuses with fewer than 30,000 votes. Grubbs estimated that the large field in 2016 could make it possible to win with between 22,000 and 27,000 votes – and that Paul could get there by adding thousands of newly engaged college students to the libertarian coalition forged by Ron Paul in 2012. \nAcross the state, though, interest in Paul’s campaign among college students appears uneven — or at least unfocused. \nGrubbs bragged of more than 20 active “Students for Rand” chapters at campuses across the state, and said the campaign signed up 200 supporters at the Wartburg College event on Tuesday. \nAbout 400 attended his rally at the University of Iowa on Monday evening. Among them were UI students Logan Manders and Marda Rude, who said they’re following the race but remained undecided. \n“I enjoyed that he can see both sides — both the right and the left — and validate parts of each,” said Manders, a freshman. “I haven’t made up my mind yet. It’s really hard for me to do so because there’s so many options and I’m still getting to know everybody.” \nRude, a sophomore, said she appreciated Paul’s support for criminal justice reforms, but didn’t like his criticisms of Democrat Bernie Sanders — another candidate likely to court young voters in the caucuses. \nAfter the Drake event, freshman Evan Beranek was similarly appreciative of Paul’s point of view, but noncommittal about supporting his candidacy or even attending the caucuses. \n“I’ve got to look at some other candidates a little more, but it was nice to hear what he had to say,” Beranek said. \nJosh O'Leary contributed to this article.
