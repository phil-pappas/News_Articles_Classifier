The pitcher also seemed to always stop short of challenging Maddon’s authority or intentions.\n“At some point the character comes out in the team,” Hammel said,”where you second-guess, or you don’t second-guess and check your ego, and then you’re like, `What’s the ultimate goal here? It’s to win.’ ”\nThe fact the Cubs hired this 61-year-old version of Maddon – the one whose often unorthodox methods had a successful nine-year trial run with the Rays — almost certainly eliminated the kinds of clubhouse skepticism and grumbling that might have otherwise slowed this year’s rapid ascent.\n“There was a lot of tough conversations that first year [in Tampa] with guys that really weren’t very good major league players that thought they were,” Maddon said. “Wow. That was like some really delusional stuff you had to deal with, behind closed doors.”\nIt got better over time with communication, turnover and some success, he said.\n“I can’t disagree that I think it’s somewhat easier to get my point across now,” he said. “I’m sure they were questioning me a lot more behind my back then than maybe they do now.”\nEven with the occasional veteran eye roll over pajama-themed charters or magic shows, this mix of ages and backgrounds in the clubhouse has seemed to uniquely buy in as a whole to the play-in-the-moment, reach-for-the-grail, expect-the-unexpected-from-the-manager ethos brought by Maddon.\nThe sudden-impact rookie talent and October-veteran influence of guys like Lester and David Ross haven’t hurt, either.\n“I just know that he’s more confident in [his methods] than he was probably in ’08 and ’09, just because the credibility might not have been there because he’d never really had the manager’s role,” Hammel said.\n“Still, at some points you don’t get it, when you’re coming out of games early,” Hammel said. “But we can question and be disappointed as much as we want. It’s all about the ‘W,’ and we’ve done a lot of that this year, so you really can’t question it.”", "external_links": ["http://sportschatter.com/slideshow/national-league-cy-young-predictor/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:15:45.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
