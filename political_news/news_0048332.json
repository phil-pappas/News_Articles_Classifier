The punctured lung in many cases 6 weeks would be the convalescence time, yes the chap injured should get compensation but the rest of the family sitting round saying that this incident has put their entire future at risk and then the reported immediately states that the family, not just the injured party are seeking compensation.Just for the injuries or the disruption to their lives, this is to question I was asking badly earlier. Edited by gruffalo on Friday 2nd October 11:54 Not sure of the full facts, but if he has got a broken ankle then he will require someone to look after him and if there is no one else then the daughter or son may well need to provide that care. When my missus broke her foot I had to have time off work, and we made use of friends/grandparents to ferry the kids about. She couldn't get upstairs, couldn't drive and couldn't do anything like shopping (how do you carry bags or push a trolley on crutches?) for food.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:55:02.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
