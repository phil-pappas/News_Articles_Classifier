(AP) - As he participated in his second TV debate with his competitors in the governor’s race, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter blamed the state’s financial problems Thursday on a “broken and dysfunctional” Baton Rouge, suggesting his three rivals helped create the troubles. \nVitter has positioned himself as an outsider over the years and turned that into a successful political career, and he returned to that approach in the latest debate as he sought to maintain his front-runner status among GOP contenders. \nHis rivals said Vitter couldn’t be trusted to fix Louisiana’s problems, describing him as part of a divisive Washington political culture that has been unable to effectively manage the nation’s finances. \nLouisiana has struggled with repeated budget shortfalls during Gov. Bobby Jindal’s two terms in office. The state closed last year’s books with a deficit, has seen gaps appear in this year’s budget and faces a more than $700 million shortfall next year. \n“Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,” Vitter said. \nRepublican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle replied that Vitter voted multiple times to raise the nation’s debt ceiling and said “a Washington, D.C., guy coming to Baton Rouge” won’t help repair the financial problems. \nEchoing a similar theme was Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne: “When Sen. Vitter returns to Washington next, I hope he’ll start working on the $12 trillion national deficit that he helped to create.” \nVitter, Angelle, Dardenne and Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards each talked of a plan to hold one or more special legislative sessions to address the state’s budget woes and to restructure the state’s tax system. \nWith a solid Democratic base of support, Edwards appears certain to secure a place in the Nov. 21 runoff. The competition is largely for the second spot, with Vitter slipping in the polls but still ahead of Angelle and Dardenne so far. \nThursday’s debate at Louisiana Tech University was only Vitter’s second appearance in five televised debates ahead of the Oct. 24 election. It was expected to be his last before Election Day, even though his three competitors planned to face off in two more TV events. \nThough it was held on a university campus, the debate was closed to college students, the general public and members of the media who weren’t panelists. Angelle, Dardenne and Edwards criticized the restrictions and said they believed Vitter was behind them. \n“I absolutely believe his hand was in play today,” Angelle said. \nVitter didn’t speak to reporters after the debate, to respond to the allegations. \nThe men have repeatedly accused Vitter of limiting public access, refusing most unscripted events and seeking sterile environments where he’s less likely to be confronted with questions about his 2007 prostitution scandal. \nThe scandal didn’t come up during the debate, which focused mainly on the state’s deep budget woes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:51:35.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
