Proponents of gun restrictions have shot back with their own take on gun-free zones. \nThe college's no-guns policy seems to be obvious evidence that the Umpqua campus was such a place. But Oregon gun owners with concealed firearms licenses know those licenses entitle them to carry loaded guns in nearly all public places. \nAbout one in 16 Oregon adults have such licenses, Oregon State Police figures indicate. \nJohn Parker, a 36-year-old Army veteran studying to become a drug and alcohol counselor, is among the UCC students who hold weapons permits and bring guns to campus. He had his gun and his license with him on campus Thursday when the shooting took place. \nHe was in the college's veterans center, just a few buildings away from Synder Hall, with some other students who were similarly permitted and armed, he told The Oregonian/OregonLive. \nA college employee talked them out of leaving to try to use their guns to save others. The active shooter could have taken them down first. Law enforcement officers already on the scene would not have known their guns would be used to defend students and instructors, not hurt them, he said. \n\"If we would have run across the field, we would have been targets,\" he said. \"We made a good choice at the time.\" \nRules at Umpqua Community College do mean that knives, air guns, paint ball guns and fireworks are prohibited on campus, as is smoking, drinking alcohol except at specially permitted functions, and skateboarding on central campus. \nGuns, including handguns and rifles, are allowed on campus for people who have passed all background checks and conditions to qualify for a concealed weapon permit. \nPenny Okamoto, executive director of Cease Fire Oregon , which favors gun restrictions, said allowing people with firearms licenses to bring guns on campus endangers student safety rather than helps it. To qualify for a license, an Oregonian \"doesn't need to show he can hit the broad side of a barn\" with a gun, let alone that he or she is trained to respond to an active shooter or deescalate a crisis, she said. \nThe best way to prevent mass gun deaths on campus, Okamoto said, is to prevent dangerous people from getting guns, especially semi-automatic ones. \nMany Oregon college and university leaders dislike having armed people on campus, and public colleges have tried to make rules prohibiting the practice. \nPublic colleges have no grounds to restrict concealed weapons permit-holders' rights, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled . \nKevin Starrett, executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation , says too many colleges and other public agencies try to mislead people from thinking all guns are banned, despite the clear laws to the contrary. \nCarli Brosseau reported from Roseburg and Betsy Hammond reported from Portland. \n-- Carli Brosseau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:34:57.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
