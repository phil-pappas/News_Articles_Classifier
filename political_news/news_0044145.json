Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, has opted to play the role of potential kingmaker rather than contender as Republicans in Congress scramble to assemble a new leadership roster after Speaker John Boehner’s surprise decision on Friday to step down.\nBut another Dallas Republican, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, continues to mull whether to make a bid for majority whip, the chamber’s No. 3 slot.\nA Hensarling spokeswoman said early Monday that her boss had decided to stay put as House Financial Services Committee chairman, ending speculation over the weekend that he’d seek to become either the speaker or majority leader.\n“After prayerful consideration, Chairman Hensarling is not a candidate for a leadership position,” spokeswoman Sarah Rozier said in a prepared statement.\nShe said Hensarling would support Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., for majority leader.\nHensarling’s support for Price, the banking committee chairman, was quickly followed by a second endorsement by Paul Ryan, R-Wis., another powerful House member who had been immediately seen as a potential successor to Boehner. Ryan was the GOP’s 2012 nominee for vice president.\nTogether those endorsements put three of the House’s top money men — the chairmen of the Budget, Ways and Means, and Financial Services committees — all on the same page. That makes Price a contender against Majority Whip Tom Scalise, R-La., who also wants to be majority leader.\nThe majority leader job will be open only if, as is widely expected, its current occupant, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is elected speaker to replace Boehner. The job would put him second in line to the presidency behind Vice President Joe Biden.\nHensarling and Sessions flirted with running for majority leader last June, when the job was suddenly vacant with the surprise election defeat of Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.\nHensarling quickly bowed out of consideration, saying the time was not right, and Sessions quit soon after, though not before being touted as an obvious candidate for leadership by senior members of the Texas delegation. He cited the inevitable distractions of an intra-party contest.\nIn the past, Hensarling has also cited staying put to tackle his large, unresolved ambitions as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. From that perch, he’s battled against powerful interests, including secondary housing finance agencies Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae, and the Export-Import Bank of the United States. He’s also been committed to undo portions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms.\nHe has previously served as House Republican Conference chairman and prior to that as chairman of Republican Steering Committee.\nThe alignment of the chairmen of the money-related committees could be significant as Congress prepares to deal with a series of debt-related measures that could lead to another government shutdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:47:22.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
