David Vitter , R-La., introduced a revised version of his legislation Wednesday (Oct. 7) that would withhold some federal funding to cities and states that refuse requests from the federal government to detain undocumented immigrants.\nVitter aides said that the senator's original bill drew concerns from law enforcement officials on whether they had the authority to hold undocumented immigrants past their scheduled release dates based on a request from the Department of Homeland Security bureau of Immigration and Enforcement. His new bill would free states and cities from civil liability for complying with a request to hold a person, though it retains the right of individuals to raise due process claims if they believe they are being held for unreasonably long periods.\nVitter said he hopes his bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, among others, could get a quick vote by the Senate. Vitter has introduced similar legislation for years, but it gained new attention after Kate Steinle, 32, was killed July 1 in San Francisco, allegedly by a man who had been deported five times and who the federal government had asked to be retained by the city's sheriff's department. At issue are so-called sanctuary cities that generally refuse requests from federal agencies to hold undocumented immigrants.\n\"Our legislation will stop sending sanctuary cities federal taxpayer dollars, so hopefully they get a clue,\" Vitter said. \"Three months ago, Kate Steinle was murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who should have never been walking the streets in the first place. In the time since Ms. Steinle's death, we have seen similar murders and other terrible acts of violence against law-abiding citizens across the United States; it is outrageous that the policies allowing these crimes to happen have not changed.\"\nThere are an estimated 300 sanctuary cities in the United States, including New Orleans.\nVitter's bill also incorporates a proposal that has become known as \"Kate's law,\" establishing a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for undocumented immigrants who are convicted of re-entering the United States after being convicted of an aggravated felony or being convicted of having illegally re-entered the United States twice before.\nThe House voted 241-179 on July 23 to cut some criminal assistance program for sanctuary cities, as does Vitter's bill.\nThe legislation has critics.\n\"Those convicted of committing acts of criminal violence must always face the full force of the law,\" said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., in arguing against passage of the House bill in July. \"However, this legislation would only undermine the trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.\"\nVitter aides said his bill does not require that officials turn in illegal immigrants who are reporting crimes or are witnesses to crimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:52:35.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
