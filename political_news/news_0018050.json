Friday, 9 October 2015, 9:29 am Press Release: Affordable Auckland \nWHY CAN’T THEY JUST DO THEIR JOBS? \n“Spending $25,000 on an artificial beach pales in comparison to what it costs to run a Council committee meeting. At $20,000 an hour ratepayers expect to get value for money,” says Affordable Auckland Albany candidate Stephen Berry. “They didn’t get that on Thursday morning as Councillors spent two and a half hours debating a motion put forward by Albany Councillor Wayne Walker on the TPPA.” \nOne of the biggest issues Stephen Berry has with Auckland Council is their refusal to stick to their core role as defined in the Local Government Act. “Council is meant to focus on delivering us services such as waste collection and managing storm water. The Trans Pacific Partnership has absolutely nothing to do with Auckland Council and their discussion of it is a complete waste of time and money.” \nAfter spending the morning discussing the notice of motion, which included a request for clarification on how Local Board recommendations had been applied during the TPPA negotiations, Walker’s motion was voted down. “Putting aside the likely dubious quality of such recommendations, discussing the TPPA is not the job of Local Board either. I shudder to think how much time and money was wasted by them collectively on this issue instead of doing their actual jobs.” \n“The residents of Albany deserve a representative who is serious about get real value out of the spending of their money. Wayne Walker proved today that he is not that representative.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:38.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
