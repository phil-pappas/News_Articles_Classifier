Obviously what I would like to see is working with the tax and benefits system and the living wage to make sure that hard-working people on low incomes are protected, and I'm sure the chancellor can do that.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34566152", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/158D8/production/_86208288_de06-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:03:31.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
