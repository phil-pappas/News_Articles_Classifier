I hear people in my closed circle of friends — almost daily — call Donald Trump a joke.\nI get it.\nFor decades we've all laughed at his gaudy gold home, his orange hue, his hair, his puckered lips, his faux seriousness on reality TV, his guest appearances at Wrestlemania, but I think we've crossed a point where we can safely say that Donald Trump and his candidacy for President of the United States are no laughing matter.\nBrand new polls show him actually surging up to 36% in the early primary state of South Carolina. He more than doubles his next competitor, Ben Carson, and has between four and 10 times the support of nearly every other candidate there.
