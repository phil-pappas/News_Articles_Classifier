Photo: David Foote\nThe men, who have followed remarkably similar career trajectories and share many of the same beliefs, were effusive in their praise for each other – despite the detention and deportation issue that has angered many Kiwis.\nAdvertisement Hundreds of New Zealanders are currently being held in Australian detention centres, including 40 on Christmas Island, and it's believed up to 1000 are in the pipeline for deportation – some of whom have lived in Australia most of their lives and have committed only minor crimes. The growing numbers come as a result of new immigration laws under which people can have their visas cancelled if they've been cumulatively sentenced to 12 months or more in prison.\nMr Turnbull said Mr Key was very direct with his concerns.\nIllustration: Matt Golding.\n\"We do understand the problem; we do understand how it's perceived in New Zealand and John has been very forthright in our discussions,\" he said.\nHe has asked Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to devote \"considerable extra resources\" to get the appeals going faster but says he is not considering any changes to give New Zealanders special treatment.\nThe Prime Minister also announced his government will introduce legislation into Parliament next week that will make around 2600 New Zealanders eligible for student loans to help them pay for tuition at Australian universities or TAFE.\nThe changes will apply to Special Category Visa holders who came to Australia as dependent children and have lived here for at least 10 years. If the bill passes this year as planned the changes will come into effect on January 1, 2016.\n\"This bill represents important opportunities for New Zealanders who have long called Australia home, and provides fairness given Australians on certain visa categories have long had access to New Zealand's student loan scheme,\" Mr Turnbull said.\nIndeed, Australians in New Zealand are able to access a range of entitlements that Kiwis in Australia can't, including unemployment benefits.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister John Key welcomed the announcement but made it clear more needed to be done.\n\"I just hope over time that we can make some more progress,\" he said. \"We are lifters in the Australian economy; we are not leaners. We don't go to Australia looking for a free lunch.\"\nMr Turnbull has pledged to do all he can to further improve Australia's relationship with New Zealand, describing it as a \"love affair\" that needs work.\nMr Key has been in power for seven years, increasing his majority at every election, while Australia has churned through five prime ministers in as many years. But he believes Mr Turnbull will be the one to break the cycle.\n\"I think you'll not only be a fine prime minister of Australia, you'll be a long-term leader of Australia,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:05:49.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
