Chin and Brewer want to limit the number of active tour bus licenses to 225 — currently, there is no limit. \nAccording to Chin's office, there are presently 229 licensed tour buses in the city, with nine sightseeing bus licenses pending. The number of double-decker buses has ballooned over the past 10 years — in 2003, there were just 54, Chin's office said. \nThe goal of the bill is not to stifle the tourist industry, Chin's office said, but to ensure the buses don't become an overgrown problem for city residents. In September 2014, there were upwards of 299 registered tour buses in the city. \n\"Often nearly-empty of tourists, these buses serve as rolling billboards for an audience of New Yorkers who are negatively affected by the noise, negative air quality and congestion these buses create,\" Chin said in a statement. \"Our legislation seeks to institute a better balance between accommodating tourism and ensuring the safety and well being of residents in neighborhoods throughout the city.\" \nCouncilman Corey Johnson, who represents Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen, another area popular with tour buses, also lent his support to the bill. \nResidents in especially tourist-heavy neighborhoods have long complained that along with congestion on narrow streets, the buses bring noise, as well as pollution. \nRequests for comment from several tour bus companies operating in the city were not immediately returned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:56:27.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
