(AP) - North Carolina State Treasurer Janet Cowell has changed her mind and won't run for re-election next year. \nCowell made the announcement Tuesday to supporters by email. She says she made the decision after careful deliberation and prayer. \nThe Democrat also says she won't seek any elected office in 2016. She had been considered a potential U.S. Senate candidate but said during the summer she planned on seeking a third term as treasurer. \nThe decision creates an open seat on the Council of State in the November 2016 election. \nCowell is a former Raleigh city council member and state senator who was elected treasurer in 2008.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/13/cowell-wont-run-for-n-carolina-state-treasurer-next-year/73864318/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:33:31.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
