He has the toppest​ job in the country, a new spare harbour front mansion and the opinion polls LOVE him.\nForeign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop is never far from her iPhone, where she emojis the world. Not that the death stare master needs help expressing herself.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten is giving his best impersonation of Grumpy Cat. The opinion polls most definitely do not love him.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison is the nation's new money man and coiner of three-word slogans. He wants you to work, save, invest.\nMember for Warringah Tony Abbott is processing a lot of stuff right now.\nLabor Senate leader Penny Wong is sleuthing. She's had a huge week working out what happened to *that* marble table and what an unhappy face means.\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton is saying as little as possible. He has the immigration portfolio!\nOutgoing MP Joe Hockey is enjoying a cigar. Now that he's quit Parliament he has more time for a puff.\nLabor frontbencher Anthony Albanese is enjoying the fact that he isn't leader in these rocky times. And that a micro-brewery has named a corn ale beer in his honour .\nAgriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce is puce in the face. This always happens during question time.\nLiberal senator Eric Abetz is angry about a variety of things. From losing his ministerial gig to losing Abbott as PM and a looming same-sex marriage plebiscite, he is one cranky cookie.\nAssistant Minister for Innovation Wyatt Roy is on the frontbench at an age when most kids are still wondering what they want to be when they grown up.\nAttorney-General George Brandis is no longer the Minister for Arts. But everyone knows he's still the most cultured guy around.\nPalmer United leader Clive Palmer is still turning up to Parliament occasionally.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Joyce.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/introducing-the-anthony-albanese-ale-20150717-gieysj.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Shorten.png", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/emoji-plomacy#.rkNDZdQ7e", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Turnbull.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Wong.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/politicons_all.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Dutton.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Morrison.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Palmer.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Bishop.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Brandis.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/emoji-diplomacy-dfat-asked-meaning-behind-julie-bishops-use-of-a-redfaced-emoji-to-describe-vladimir-putin-20151022-gkfgoc.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Roy.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Abbott.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Albanese.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Hockey.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Abetz.png", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:36:51.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
