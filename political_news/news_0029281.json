I am hoping that this year’s winner will be: “When hovercrafts are outlawed, only outlaws will have hovercrafts.”\nMcConnell, a former federal judge and current Stanford professor, was challenging a federal agricultural program that required growers to turn a portion of each crop over to the government. (He won.) Hovercrafts are the issue in Sturgeon v. Masica, which asks whether the federal government can keep John Sturgeon, a 75-year-old Alaska outdoorsman, from using his personal hovercraft to stalk the wily moose in the wilds of the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve. The Court’s cert. grant on October 1 was greeted with some confusion. The question is whether, in some way not readily discernible, the case is a stalking moose for an attempt to cut back on the power of the federal government to manage lands entrusted by statute to its supervision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:29:13.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
