So I do think that it's going to be hard to dig out of something like that,\" Priebus told the Examiner. \"I don't anticipate that. I think ... history is on our side.\"\nThe chairman went on to discuss issues surrounding Hillary Clinton and the \"vastly improved\" efforts undertaken at the RNC, adding that the \"whole big picture\" looks good for the GOP in 2016.\nThis is not the first time Priebus has hinted at the troubles facing the GOP on the national stage. In June , Priebus told radio host Laura Ingraham that a third straight presidential loss for the party would result in them relinquishing their spot as a national party.\nThe complete interview with the RNC chairman will appear in the Oct. 26th edition of the Washington Examiner magazine.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Boehner's bucket list: Find a speaker, solve fiscal train wreck The current House speaker had hoped he could retire on Oct. 30.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/16/15 12:01 AM Top Story Bush and Rubio squabble while Trump runs away with it After Bush announced his fundraising total, his campaign started a spat with Rubio over who did better.\nBy Byron York • 10/16/15 6:19 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:31:34.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
