In that span, the business has earned him a more than respectable income, as well as enabled him to manage a team of full-time and part-time workers to clean litter from approximately 150 parking lots. Cleanlots meets the needs of commercial property managers who appreciate litter-free properties but don't know where to turn for service.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278645\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278646\nWinch got his work ethic from his father Joe, who was a janitor for the Public Board of Education. His father picked up jobs on the side to help supplement the family's income, and he sometimes took his children along with him as \"little helpers.\"\nCleaning was what Winch knew when he started his career in 1981. So naturally, his first business was a cleaning business. One of his earliest clients remarked on the problems of parking lot litter cleanup, and that was what motivated Winch to focus his efforts there. The business has been growing ever since.\n\"It's almost as easy as going for a walk in the park,\" explains Winch. \"Cleanlots has been my ticket to financial independence, all while contributing to a cleaner environment. When I started out in the parking lot litter cleanup business, it was a learning process. Now, I have a sustainable and successful business that provides an important service to the community.\"\nWinch graciously shares his most important insights on this unique home-based business opportunity in the Cleanlots business manual, which has already helped hundreds of self-starting entrepreneurs open their own low-cost cleaning businesses.\n( http://www.cleanlots.com/ ).\nThe response to the Cleanlots manual has been strong. \"I have wanted to open a business of my own for some time,\" remarked one customer. \"I thought the only way to do this was to buy an expensive business package. Brian Winch has created a successful business that required brains instead of big bucks. It reaffirms my faith in our country and in our abilities.\"\nCleanlots is an eco-friendly business model in several ways. On the one hand, the business doesn't require noisy gas-guzzling power tools. All that's needed for thorough litter cleanup are simple hand tools and a walk around the property. On the other hand, clean parking lots means less garbage potentially clogging storm drains, polluting waterways and a litter-free community.\nWinch and his team strongly support the work of Keep America Beautiful , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to reduce waste, prevent litter and beautify communities. Everyone makes a difference in keeping American beautiful. \"Get involved with one of KAB's programs or start your own 'green' litter cleanup service,\" says Winch. \"Either way, you'll feel proud seeing the results of your work.\"\nContact Information\nTo see sample excerpts from the Cleanlots e-book, visit this link:\nhttp://www.cleanlots.com/e-book-sample-pages.html\nBrian Winch\nWinch Enterprises\n+1 (403) 236-7551\nEmail\n releases/man-cashes-in-by-cleaning-up-300163371.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH33279&Transmission_Id=201510210835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH33279&DateId=20151021", "http://www.kab.org/site/PageServer?pagename=index", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.cleanlots.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278646", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278645", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292867", "http://www.cleanlots.com/e-book-sample-pages.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/man-cashes-in-by-cleaning-up-300163371.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:39:58.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
