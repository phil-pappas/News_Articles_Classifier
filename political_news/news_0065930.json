(AP) â€” Missouri's education department says it's removing schoolchildren's Social Security numbers from a state database. \nThe Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said in an audit report released Wednesday it will stop the practice by the end of June 2016. \nThe state audit report said collecting Social Security numbers for the student-level record system wasn't necessary and put children at risk in case of a data breach. \nThe report was the first released following Auditor Nicole Galloway's announcement that her office would make a point of reviewing data security. \nOther recommendations in the report included adopting a formal response policy in case of a breach and eliminating shared accounts to access student data. \nThe agency in the report says it will follow those suggestions. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
