Office bearers will not have access to membership data, and no meetings of the branch should take place.\n“I would envisage the branch structure remaining in abeyance until it is time for the Annual General Meeting at the start of 2016.\n“I do not take this action lightly, but the opportunity to sort things out within the branch has been on offer for some time, and the required progress has simply not been made.”\nThe suspension is an added headache for Freeman, who has already had to deny sniping in the local press that she was “parachuted” into the seat as an SNP favourite.\nAlthough born in Ayr, she currently lives 70 miles from the seat in Glasgow’s West End.\nA Labour spokesperson said: “This is extraordinary. We know the SNP aren't fans of internal debate or independent thought but for party HQ to step in and effectively shut down a local party until the turn of the year makes a mockery of democracy.”\nShare article Freeman said: “The temporary suspension relates to branch organisation but does not affect members campaigning and I'm delighted to be working with enthusiastic and energetic SNP members right across the constituency in an already very active campaign.”\nDalzell did not respond to email.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:03:54.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
