This increased connectivity, however, and our ever-growing number of connected devices has also made us more vulnerable to cybercrime. Against this backdrop, National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM), which is co-led by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), is focusing its third week on making our families and our communities more secure.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center [1], nearly two-thirds of Americans are now smartphone owners and for many, these devices are a key entry point to the online world. At the same time, 62 percent of Americans fear that their smartphone or computer will be hacked[2]. This penetration all but erases the static notion of \"going online\" and underlines our new reality, where Internet connectivity is actively a part of many consumers' day-to-day, personal, professional and community lives. As such, a major call to action this October is for every family to designate a family online security officer – someone who spends time thinking about all the digital components in their lives, assesses what security systems need fixing or upgrading, determines a family action plan and makes cybersecurity discussions a regular part of family conversation.\n\"The days of making the 'family' computer secure with anti-virus protection and common sense decisions are long gone. The sheer number of new, connected devices have changed the game,\" said Michael Kaiser , executive director of NCSA. \"Most American households have numerous devices ? cars, wearables, TVs, smartphones and even baby monitors ? that provide functionality through an Internet connection. This always-on, always-connected world requires a new, proactive attitude that will allow us to enjoy the benefits of the Internet with the greatest confidence. Appointing the most digitally literate member of the household to make the safety and security of these devices and the way family members use the Internet a regular priority can help make this a reality.\"\nLife After Breach\nClose to 432 million accounts were hacked in 2014 – revealing personal information such as names, debit or credit card numbers, emails, birthdays, phone numbers, passwords, security questions and physical addresses[3] ? but those affected are becoming more proactive. According to a soon to be released victim impact survey by the Identity Theft Resource Center, in the aftermath of a breach, 69 percent of consumers are placing more onus on themselves to protect their digital identities while acknowledging that retailers, government, data brokers, Internet service providers and device manufactures also share significant responsibility in protecting their personal information. Breach victims are also taking these top six steps to once again enjoy the Internet more safely and securely:\nChanging their passwords: 68 percent Becoming more careful about clicking or downloading links: 56 percent Installing or updating security software such as anti-virus: 42 percent Updating privacy settings on social networking sites: 38 percent Removing or trying to remove personal information from the internet: 39 percent More than 1 out of 3 are now abandoning suspect online purchases: 36 percent \"Now more than ever it is important for families to understand their online vulnerabilities and identity theft risks,\" said Eva Casey Velasquez , President/CEO of Identity Theft Resource Center. \"This year's aftermath study reinforces the fact that identity theft creates barriers in the lives of its victims and takes a devastating emotional toll beyond the most commonly understood financial impact.\"\nFor tips on how we can all help keep the Internet safe, see NCSA's new infographic, \"Do You Want to Help Make the Internet Safer?\": http://ncsam.info/1WR4a9L\nConnected Home, Connected Kids – New Research, Keystone Event\nAgainst the timely backdrop of the week's theme, \"Connected Communities and Families: Staying Protected While Always Connected,\" NCSA and ESET® ? the global leader in proactive digital protection ? will launch a new body of research providing unique insights into the world behind our digital doors, as cybersecurity seeps into nearly every household activity. The results will be revealed at The Globe Theatre at Universal Studios in Los Angeles at a NCSAM keystone event featuring 300 local public school students, parents and teachers who will discover the best online safety practices. Co-hosted by Comcast NBCUniversal, CreativeFuture and NCSA, connected kids will learn more about safe, secure and responsible Internet use from experts that include representatives from DHS and iKeepSafe.\nThe event will explore issues young people face every day including respecting others online, protecting personal information and the legitimate and legal use of media, software and games. \"It's a thrill to be a sponsor of this extraordinary and necessary event for kids. All of us are dedicated to the ongoing commitment of teaching children how to use the Internet safely, responsibly and ethically. We hope the students learn some good lessons here today while having some fun too,\" said Jim Janco , Sr. Director, Operations Compliance for Comcast Cable.\nNCSA urges all families to be cyber safe by utilizing these tips:\nCreate an inventory of all Internet-connected devices in your home. Use two-step authentication – also known as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication (where available) ? and long, strong and unique passwords for all accounts. Own your online presence. Review privacy settings available on social networking sites, cell phones, and other social tools the family uses. Decide together which settings provide the appropriate amount of protection. Secure your router: Make sure your router has a strong password and does not broadcast who you are through its name, such as \"the Jones Family\" or \"123 Elm Street\". Take action if your personal information is compromised: If you are a victim of cybercrime, report to law enforcement and other appropriate organizations, such as banks and credit card companies, etc. Connect smartly: Before connecting new devices understand how to use any security and privacy settings and how to maintain the security of the device. Families can also encourage safe cybersecurity practices by assigning regularly practiced \"digital chores\" to both kids and parents. Just like many families have household jobs, make sure someone is responsible for digital chores as well.\nFor Kids:\nKeep a clean machine: On a weekly basis, check every device to make sure everyone is keeping their devices secure by installing updates of apps, operating systems and security software to prevent against malware infections. Back it up: It's a good practice to protect homework, pictures, music and other vital family information by creating an electronic copy and storing it safely in the cloud, on a CD, USB or external hard drive once a week. For Parents:\nShare with care: Always remember that before posting online about your kids, think about how it may be perceived now, how he or she might feel in the future, and who might see it. Engage in a conversation with your children about what they are comfortable with you posting and start by deleting posts that may make them feel uncomfortable. Turn on two-step authentication. Doing this will prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. Stay current: Keep pace with new ways to stay safe online by visiting staysafeonline.org or other trusted websites weekly for the latest information about ways to stay safe while connected. Keep the conversation going: Include discussions about online safety and security as part of your regular conversations with your kids. Ask them what they do online, what new websites or apps they have used or want to use, and what their friends are doing online. Conduct a quarterly clean up: Go through files on your devices and delete things no longer needed, such as numerous draft documents, unflattering or no longer needed photos, old bookmarks, etc. Join these virtual events:\n#ChatSTC Twitter Chat: Digital Parenting – Keep Your Connected Family Safe ( Virtual: Twitter Chat) , Oct 15, 2015 , 3-4 p.m. EDT / 12-1 p.m. PDT : There are many ways parents can educate their kids on good cyber habits, whether they're using social media, playing games or shopping online.
