The videos were not shot in Ohio, and state officials have found no wrongdoing by the organization here . State lawmakers plan to pass legislation this year to block state and federal dollars from reaching Planned Parenthood centers.\nPlanned Parenthood offers birth control, cancer screenings, tests for sexually transmitted diseases and well-woman exams at its 28 centers across the state. Three centers perform abortions. By law, federal and state funding cannot be used to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or a medical issue that threatens the life of the mother.\nAbout two dozen people, including several state legislative staff members, gathered outside to hear from the bus tour's promoters and sign the bus.\nStephanie Krider, executive director of anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life, said federal funding should go to the more than 200 federally qualified health centers, which could provide non-abortive health services.\n\"Women have options,\" Krider said. \"We don't need Planned Parenthood.\"\nGabriel Mann, spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said redirecting those dollars would prevent Ohio women from obtaining important health care. Mann said many of the federally qualified health centers Krider mentioned do not provide HIV testing, pap smears, or other services offered by Planned Parenthood.\n\"If a woman goes to Planned Parenthood, she goes there because she chose Planned Parenthood -- that's the doctor she wants to see,\" Mann said.\"We're trusting she's making up her own mind and making her own health-care decisions.\"\nColumbus was the fifth and final stop for the bus tour, but the groups plan to promote the message on 80 college campuses this fall.\nThe groups chose college towns and campuses because Planned Parenthood locations are often close to colleges and universities. In Ohio, about 60 percent of abortions are for women age 20 to 29.\nMembers of Ohio State University's Pro-Life Club were supposed to attend Friday's event, but organizers said they decided to stay on campus to challenge protesters who had gathered there.\nIn addition to defunding Planned Parenthood, lawmakers are considering bills that would ban abortions after 20 weeks and after tests show the fetus might have Down syndrome.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:47:55.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
