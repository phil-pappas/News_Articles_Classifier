A report released on Tuesday indicates that hate crime has surged by about 18% in England and Wales over the last year.\nOn average, over the last two years, there are an estimated of 222,000 hate crimes according to Crime Survey for England and Wales data between 2012/13 to 2014/15.\nOf those crimes, 80% are racist crimes and 20% relate to varied other others forms of hate, including religion, sexual orientation, and transgender victims. British police keeps a record of similar crime incidents, which is not necessarily the rule across the E.U.\nUnsurprisingly, of explicitly religious hate crime has risen by 45%, targeting mainly Muslims. David Cameron noted that crime against Muslims will be recorded separately henceforth.\nSurprisingly, such events do not surge around major events, such as the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January.\nBritish hate crime is measured, with a consistent methodology, year on year. And it is up. The actual scale of hate crime is likely to be higher, but recorded crime is a reliable indicator.\nIn sum, Britain is monitoring and addressing hate crime as a matter of public policy. This is not the case in the overwhelming majority of EU member states.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:46:34.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
