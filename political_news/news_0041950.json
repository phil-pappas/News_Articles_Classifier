Daniel Webster, R-Fla., as its pick for House speaker to replace outgoing John Boehner of Ohio. The endorsement, which was not unanimous, was intended only to apply to Thursday's House conference vote, which was canceled after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's announcement that he is dropping his bid.\n\"When the speaker resigned and they pivoted to focusing on the leadership race, I withdrew,\" continued Ribble. \"I spent thirty years as a leader in the private sector, and I have a clear idea of the qualities a leader will need to unite our conference.\"\n  Dubya's big role pushing brother Jeb for president George W.
