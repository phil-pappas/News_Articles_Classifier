Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Sanders speaks during the debate. CNN's Mark Preston said Sanders' opening remarks \"hit on all of the hot-button liberal issues: Take back the government from billionaires, climate change. He all but said it is time for a revolution.\" Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Clinton is the national front-runner in the Democratic race. \"I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name,\" she said during the debate. \"I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what Americans are looking for ... and I can take the fight to Republicans.\" Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Webb listens to moderator Anderson Cooper during the debate. Webb is a former Marine who also served as secretary of the U.S. Navy. \"You may be sure that in a Webb administration, the highest priority will be the working people who every day go out and make this country stronger at home, and who give us the right reputation and security overseas under a common-sense foreign policy,\" Webb said.

He went after Sanders on gun control early in the debate, and -- in what could be interpreted as a veiled swipe at Clinton -- he said, \"I am very clear about my principles.\" Hide Caption 6 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Chafee touted his experience, saying he is the only candidate who has been a mayor, senator and governor. \"I have had no scandals. I've always been honest. I have the courage to take the long-term view, and I've shown good judgment,\" he said in his opening statement. Hide Caption 7 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate One of the debate's memorable moments was when Sanders and Clinton shook hands following Sanders' take on the Clinton email scandal. \"Let me say something that may not be great politics, but the secretary is right -- and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about the damn emails,\" Sanders said. \"Enough of the emails, let's talk about the real issues facing the United States of America.\" Hide Caption 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Audience members watch the debate.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 Story highlights David Axelrod: Hillary Clinton's commanding performance reduces opportunity for Joe Biden to make a difference in Democratic race Axelrod says Sanders had rocky start on guns but then roused his base effectively David Axelrod is CNN's senior political commentator and host of the podcast \" The Axe Files. \" He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN) She did what she needed to do. David Axelrod Poised, passionate and in command, Hillary Clinton emerged from Tuesday's debate as a stronger front-runner for the Democratic nomination than she was going in. Bernie Sanders also had something to celebrate. After a rocky start, punctuated by an awkward exchange over his mixed record on gun safety issues, the senator from Vermont came on strong and rallied his base with rousing jeremiads about inequality and the corrupting power of money in politics. He also brought the house down with a showstopping declaration -- aimed at the media as much as Clinton -- that the \"American people are sick and tired of talking about your damned emails.\" Opinion: Why Clinton dominated Read More Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, who had hoped to be the progressive alternative to Clinton before being \"Berned\" by Sanders, had hoped for a breakthrough night. But a decent performance may not have been good enough to lift him from the Valley of the Statistically Insignificant.
