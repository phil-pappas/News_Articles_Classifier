However, this was the lowest number since 2003/04. Hate crime against disabled people has almost tripled in the last five years. The Scottish Government is to hold a summit aimed at tackling hate crime next week. \nIn July, Mr Cameron announced a five-year strategy to counter extremism and identified four areas which he said attracted people to extremist Islamist ideology. They were: a failure to counter the narrative of extremists; non-violent views that acted as a “gateway” for radicalisation; the drowning out of moderate Muslim voices and a failure to integrate different groups.

Share article \n\"I want British Muslims to know we will back them to stand against those who spread hate and to counter the narrative which says Muslims do not feel British. And I want police to take more action against those who persecute others simply because of their religion.\" \nPolicies to be brought forward as part of the counter-extremism strategy include: encouraging broadcasters to give more airtime to moderate Muslim voices; cracking down on radicalisation in prisons; incentivising schools to integrate pupils better; challenging extremist preachers at universities; enabling parents to cancel their children’s passports if they are worried they might try to join Isis and pressuring IT companies to remove swiftly any Isis propaganda.
