An oil tanker sails through the English Channel.\nBy Alan Neuhauser Oct. 9, 2015 | 3:00 p.m. EDT + More A bill that would repeal a 40-year-old ban on U.S. exports of crude oil cleared its first major hurdle Friday, winning approval from the House of Representatives amid disarray within the Republican Party's leadership and opposition from the Obama administration that all but erased its prospects for becoming law.\nVoting two days after the White House pledged to veto the measure and urged lawmakers to instead focus on promoting clean energy, lawmakers moved mostly along party lines, 261-159, to broaden oil exports, a signature issue for the GOP and an oil and gas industry challenged by record-low oil prices and slowing consumer demand. Twenty-six Democrats broke ranks in favor of the measure. A similar bill has been making its way through the Senate, but Republicans there hold as few as 54 of the 60 votes needed for its advance.\nThe ban, which dates to 1975, was approved by Congress and President Gerald Ford in an attempt to insulate U.S. markets from price shocks in the wake of the Arab oil embargoes.\n[ READ: White House Threatens Veto of Bill Lifting Oil Export Ban ]\n\"America’s energy boom has sparked a jobs boom, but continued job growth is now in jeopardy without access to global markets,\" said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, who introduced the bill in February. He added the measure \" presents a rare opportunity to help the economy at home, enhance our influence abroad, and strengthen our national defense, and all at no added cost to the American people and I’m glad it passed the House today.”\nUntil this week, the drive to end the ban had built considerable momentum, attracting modest bipartisan support from lawmakers and made a top priority by one of the most powerful lobbies on Capitol Hill. While the U.S. exports some crude to Canada and the Obama administration recently approved swaps with Mexico, domestic energy producers – holding a glut of oil from the fracking boom and forced by the ban to sell it at a discount to refiners – aimed to repeal the ban to be able to sell in growing markets overseas where crude oil fetches higher prices, especially in Asia.\nEnvironmentalists, by contrast, counter that lifting the ban would increase consumers' reliance on fossil fuels, incentivize riskier drilling in more treacherous areas and undercut President Barack Obama's high-profile second-term efforts to rein-in greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming . Some refineries, chemical companies and labor unions that have benefited from cut-rate crude have also lobbied against repeal.\nBoth sides of the debate have reached differing conclusions on how ending the ban would affect gasoline prices.\n[ ALSO: What Overreach? GOP Urges Obama to Flex Executive Power on Oil Exports ]\n“Lifting the oil export ban would be a blessing on the oil companies but a curse on the climate and our health,\" Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America, said in a statement after Friday's vote. \"To avoid more global warming impacts like the floods, drought and intense storms already devastating parts of our country, we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground and transition to 100 percent pollution-free energy.\"\nOpponents were handed their first big win Wednesday. Highlighting how the administration has already supported \"safe and responsible production growth,\" the White House declared \"legislation to remove crude export restrictions is not needed at this time,\" adding, \"Congress should be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy.\"\nLacking the votes to override a veto, supporters still held out hope for a deal with the White House – that with the right concessions perhaps in the areas of environmental protection and climate change, Obama might just be willing to give on exports. That prospect all but fell apart barely 24 hours later, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. and front-runner to replace Ohio Republican John Boehner as speaker, abruptly announced he was withdrawing from consideration , pitching the Republican Party into chaos and increasing the chances of a conservative hard-liner winning the speaker's gavel.\n[ MORE: Quarter of World's Electricity to Come From Renewables by 2020 ]\nStill, following Friday's votes, lawmakers and lobbyists vowed to push on in their fight to repeal the export ban.\n“It defies logic that this administration wants to lift sanctions on Iran while keeping de facto sanctions in place on the United States,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who introduced legislation in May with North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp that would repeal the ban, said in a statement. \"I will continue pursuing all available options for ending the oil export ban in close partnership with Sen. Heitkamp and our colleagues.”\nTAGS: energy global warming energy policy and climate change House of Representatives oil environment Congress", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/256313-supporters-of-ending-the-oil-export-ban-eye-a-deal", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/114/saphr702r_20151007.pdf", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=House%20Approves%20Oil%20Exports%20Despite%20Veto%20Threat", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/702", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=House%20Approves%20Oil%20Exports%20Despite%20Veto%20Threat&summary=A%20bill%20that%20would%20allow%20the%20sale%20of%20U.S.%20crude%20oil%20overseas%20advances%2C%20even%20as%20its%20chances%20for%20becoming%20law%20remain%20slim.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1lqg%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=House%20Approves%20Oil%20Exports%20Despite%20Veto%20Threat"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:45:41.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
