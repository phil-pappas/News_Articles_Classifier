A study by HealthPocket, a technology company, found that nearly half of health plans sold in the federal insurance marketplace did not provide coverage for services outside the network, so patients bore most of the cost. A separate study by America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers, said that out-of-network providers typically billed patients for amounts far exceeding what Medicare pays for the same services. “Choosing a health plan is really complicated,” said Dr. Charlene A. Wong, a pediatrician and health policy researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. “With the rise of narrow networks, it is increasingly important for consumers to have provider-lookup tools so they can see which plans include their preferred doctors and hospitals.” Under a new federal rule, insurers must publish their drug lists and doctor directories in a “machine readable” format that allows software developers to manipulate the data for myriad purposes, just as they do with stock quotations and sports scores. In the last two years, the federal marketplace tended to steer people toward health plans with the lowest premiums, even though such plans often have high out-of-pocket costs so consumers end up spending more. The changes to HealthCare.gov will include a cost-comparison tool that allows consumers to estimate their probable out-of-pocket and total costs, including premiums, deductibles and other charges, under different health plans. To make such estimates, the website will ask consumers if they think their use of medical care in 2016 will be low, medium or high, and the website then will provide an estimate of costs for each plan. In making these calculations, the government takes account of a person’s age, sex, income and ZIP code. The website will show premiums reduced by the amount of any subsidies that a family may receive in the form of tax credits, but consumers can also see the full price if they want. Some private groups have even more sophisticated tools. Mr. Krughoff’s group, Consumers’ Checkbook, has developed such a tool, based on more than 30 years of experience in providing advice to federal employees on their health insurance options. The tool, already used in Illinois, will be available this fall to consumers in Minnesota, Missouri and Washington, D.C. In addition, Enroll America , a nonprofit group trying to expand coverage, has developed a digital tool to help consumers estimate their likely out-of-pocket costs for each plan available in their area. Consumers can also use it to find health plans that cover their drugs and preferred providers. Enroll America devised the tool with Clear Health Analytics, based in Stamford, Conn. To help estimate costs, they ask if consumers have any of 11 common conditions. The conditions include asthma, back problems, diabetes, heart disease and breast, lung and prostate cancer. Women are asked if they are or plan to become pregnant. Anne Filipic, the president of Enroll America, said such tools could transform the experience of shopping for insurance. “In the past,” Ms. Filipic said, “people often got stuck trying to pick a plan that was right for them. They found the process overwhelming. If people can find a plan that better meets their needs, they are more likely to stick with it and stay insured.” \nFollow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
