Miller and Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times   \nMore than 5 percent of the latest batch of emails from former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , released Wednesday, contain classified information — or twice the rate of the previous releases, raising tricky questions about whether the department is finding more secrets or being more thorough in screening the messages. \nAll told, there are at least 400 messages that contain information the government now deems classified, out of nearly 12,000 emails released so far. \nBut 214 of those messages came in the latest batch of 3,869 messages, for a classification rate of 5.5 percent. \nSEE ALSO: Hillary aide paid by private firm to stage event with Bill Clinton while at State \nNone of the messages were marked classified at the time they were sent — usually in 2010 or 2011, for the latest batch — but the government has gone back and determined they contain information that shouldn’t be out in public. \nThe State Department is making monthly releases of the emails as it complies with a court order to release more than 30,000 messages by the end of January. \nMrs. Clinton kept the messages from public disclosure during her four years in office and for nearly two years afterward by using an account tied to a server she kept at her New York home, rather than using a standard State.gov account. \nA federal judge and a top department transparency official have both said Mrs. Clinton violated policy, but she has insisted she what she did was not against the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:18:14.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
