Taravella High School in Broward County, Florida .\nThe VEI Program, which emphasizes college and career readiness is being implemented in close to 400 secondary schools nationwide and is being launched for the first time at J.P.

The in-school program will offer students a competitive edge through project-based, collaborative learning that focuses on entrepreneurship, global business, problem solving, communication, personal finance and technology.

This success did not happen overnight; like many successful startup companies, Digital Risk started out as a vision among a few young entrepreneurs. Through their passion for lifelong learning and entrepreneurial spirit, the company's founders were able to turn their vision of making mortgage safe into a reality.\nNow, celebrating its 10th year anniversary in mortgage industry, Jeff Taylor and team found it important to give back to the local community by investing in young entrepreneurs and business leaders who are passionate about learning.\n\"Partnering with VEI and J.P. Taravella High School seemed like the perfect fit to do just that,\" said Jeff Taylor . \"With 20 years of experience under its belt, VEI has an exciting plan for growth and is primed to expand across the country in partnership with the education and business communities. We hope other successful businesses and leaders will also be inspired to give back and invest in our future leaders.\"\nIn his first visit at the school, Jeff sat down one-on-one with VEI's new CEO, Aaron Mitchell , a J.P. Taravella High School student, who was selected for the role after interviewing with school board officials and surrounding businesses leaders. Jeff will act as a resource for Aaron to look to for sound advice and direction on leading his team to great success. Jeff also met with VEI's on site coordinator, Laurie Acosta , who will be a key player in helping Digital Risk support the program.\nDigital Risk is proud to partner with VEI and looks forward to fostering the future success of young entrepreneurs. In fact, the company is already in the works of partnering with Lyman High School , located in Seminole County , which will be launching its very first VEI program in the 2016-2017 academic year.
