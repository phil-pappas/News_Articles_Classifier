Almost two years on, many have not yet even received ‘Emergency Shelter Assistance,” said Efleda Bautista. \nIn Wellington, Bautista met with Members of Parliament (MPs), from the Green Party, Labour Party and NZ First, requesting them to investigate how NZ aid money was spent. \n“The Philippine Commission on Audits reported millions of pesos in Haiyan relief donations to the Philippine government are sitting in banks. There have also been many reports of spoiled food packs and expired medicines in storage. This tells us the government sees no urgency in delivering much-needed aid for the people,” Bautista noted. \n“The poor Filipinos devastated by Koppu and Haiyan, especially those in farming and fishing communities, need urgent livelihood assistance. We hope that increased scrutiny on how international aid is administered will remind the Philippine government of its duty to be accountable to the people,” said Cameron Walker, APS spokesperson. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:36:31.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
