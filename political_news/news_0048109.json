A candlelight vigil for the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting.\nBy Robert J. Spitzer Oct. 2, 2015 | 5:15 p.m. EDT + More President Barack Obama's anguish and frustration over the sorry state of gun policy in America, expressed after yet another senseless mass shooting – this time at a community college in Oregon – echoes the feelings of most. Yet it also reminds us that nothing is likely to happen, at least at the national level, in response. After all, legislation in the U.S. Senate fell short in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. Why should anything be different now? And what of Obama's call for the public to hold officeholders accountable for their inaction?\nThe reasons for inaction are several. First, the current hyper-partisan environment in Washington all but guarantees that Congress will oppose any initiative linked to Obama. That's hardly a surprise. Second, while large majorities of Americans (and of gun owners) favor tougher laws that could actually have some effect on gun violence, including uniform background checks and better data collection and reporting for those with serious mental illness, the issue sits far down the list of concerns for average voters. Incidents like the Umpqua Community College shooting mobilize the public and focus outrage, but that effect doesn't last long. As the public turns back to other concerns, the gun policy debate is yielded to those who most care about the issue – gun rights proponents.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Gun Control and Gun Rights ]\nThird, as Obama noted, the country has, to some degree, become inured to gun violence. With each new mass shooting, the sense of horror erodes, and so does pressure on lawmakers. That in turn heightens feelings that nothing effective can be done. And for all its protestations, the gun lobby counts on that sense of hopelessness.\nFourth, gun rights advocates have scored great success in changing the narrative of the gun issue. Guns aren't the problem, it is bad people who do bad things, they say; gun laws don't work; and Second Amendment gun rights must be preserved and protected.\nTo be sure, none of those pro-gun propositions withstands scrutiny. Many products can cause injury and death, but firearms are uniquely efficient and effective tools for killing. As criminologist Philip Cook has noted , guns don't kill, they just make it much easier; and you can hardly have a mass shooting without guns. Gun laws do work if we want them to: The very fact that gun deaths decline with the strictness of state gun laws makes this clear. And as the Supreme Court said in its 2008 ruling in D.C. v. Heller, and as our own history demonstrates, gun laws are perfectly compatible with gun rights. Indeed, for most of American history, guns were much more heavily regulated by the states than in recent years.\n[ READ: Suicide Is the Other Side of America's Gun Problem ]\nYet beyond decrying government inaction, Obama did something else in his speech: He called on the public, and specifically gun owners, \"to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives,\" suggesting the issue should be a \"relevant factor\" in deciding who to vote for and for contacting local officials.\nWhether consciously or not, Obama's call to arms mimics an NRA tactic that has served it well – the ability to mobilize grassroots support. Gun rights advocates have a long track record of making life miserable for elected officials they oppose – called the \"hassle factor.\" Whether they prevail or not is secondary to the discomfort they can visit upon opponents. That alone is often enough to dissuade politicians from wading into the issue.\nIn recent years, the money gap between the NRA and gun control groups has closed, thanks in part to the efforts of new groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Americans for Responsible Solutions, but the enthusiasm gap has not – at least, not yet. In politics, the voices that matter are the ones that are heard, and if Americans heed Obama's call in visible numbers, this gap may close as well. If it does, that will be a game-changer.\nTAGS: gun control and gun rights Oregon school shootings Obama, Barack NRA", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/11/AR2010061103259.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Oregon%20Shooting%20Probably%20Won%27t%20Change%20the%20Politics%20of%20Gun%20Control", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Oregon%20Shooting%20Probably%20Won%27t%20Change%20the%20Politics%20of%20Gun%20Control&summary=Obama%20is%20right%3A%20Grassroots%20support%20is%20the%20only%20thing%20that%20will%20change%20the%20politics%20of%20gun%20control.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/01/watch-president-obamas-statement-shooting-oregon", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Oregon%20Shooting%20Probably%20Won%27t%20Change%20the%20Politics%20of%20Gun%20Control", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdu19e%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:45:30.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
