This time, we have approximately 20 pages of text with maybe 300 square brackets”. \nWhile the outlook is optimistic, many challenges remain. A key question for the negotiations is whether or not any emission reduction commitments made will be legally binding. \nMinister Groser said “we need to avoid compliance-centric, heavy top-down approaches to addressing climate change so as to facilitate participation”. \nEU Charge d’Affaires, Michalis Rokas, agreed that obtaining legally binding obligations will be “very difficult to achieve and some countries think they are not necessary.” \nDr Macey highlighted the need for a global response to meet the required emission reduction and, given this imperative, it may be necessary to prioritise engagement over legal commitment. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:05:18.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
