I'm looking for options for dry foods to what I have been feeding my Chihuahuas. They've been getting Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Fish. It's expensive stuff, but that's not my real issue. I want to offer them some variety, and I'm also looking to \"firm\" up their poop. We believe chicken is an issue with one of our Chi's - so I try to stay away from all poultry foods. Any suggestions based on experience? Thanks Re: Dry Dog Food For Teeny Tiny Dogs Best to go with a brand endorsed by vets.

Any suggestions based on experience? Thanks I would just go with a regular brand like pedigree small breed, ive always noticed the fancy food doesnt work any better than the regular stuff. Off topic but anyone been to a petco lately? an expensive brand like natural balance is even too cheap to be carried there. The food there is more expensive per pound than real NY strip steak, like WTF is wrong with people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:04:20.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
