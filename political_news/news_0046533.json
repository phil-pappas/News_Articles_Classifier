Text bigger Mike Huckabee \nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, whose numbers in the polls for president have hovered around the middle of the Republican pack, said in answer to a direct question on “Fox & Friends” on Monday about his campaign’s chances that he’s still pretty positive – that his race is far from ended. \nFirst, the question: What do you say to those who say your campaign is “on life support?” \nThen, Huckabee’s response: That’s not true. \n“That’s nonsense,” he said. “People who say that sit in their little buildings in Washington … if they want to look at a [real] campaign, come to Iowa.” \nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

And in recent polls, Real Clear Politics puts him at seventh place with 3 percentage points. \nIn the Hill , GOP strategist Ford O’Connell, one of former presidential contender John McCain’s leading political operatives, said: “Donors want to back the winner and it’s becoming completely clear who the winners are likely to be.” \nWho do you love?
