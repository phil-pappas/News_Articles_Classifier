Get me out of here!.\nThe TV series has a history of inviting MPs onto the show, notorious examples being Conservative MP Nadine Norris and former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik, neither of which lasted more than two weeks in the Jungle.\nWriting in the Guardian, Jamie Reed said:\nMe? I’m not a celebrity, I’m not going in there and I’ve politely declined to meet the producers of the show. Copeland is set to become one of the fastest-growing parts of the UK economy, there’s a lot of work to be done and if you really want to see me in late November and early December, I’ll be holding my usual surgeries – but please remember, planning issues are a matter for the council.\n– Jamie Reed MP for Copeland Jamie Reed was approached after dramatically resigning from the Labour frontbench immediately following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Leader.\nCorbyn swept to an unprecedented victory on a wave of anti-austerity resentment, but is opposed to nuclear power, which is a key industry in Reed's Copeland constituency.\nDespite Corbyn winning over 60% of the vote share in the leadership poll, Reed refused to serve under him.\nIn his resignation letter, Jamie Reed said:\nOver 10 years I have managed to secure funding for new hospitals and schools and to establish new nuclear policy.\nYour opposition to this, as with David Cameron when he became Leader of the Opposition, is poorly informed and fundamentally wrong.\n– Jamie Reed MP Reed's principled stance was met with accolades from some, but met with contempt by Labour loyalists, prompting former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to quip to BBC journalist Jane Hill:\nWho is Jamie Reed? Is he in our party?\n– Lord John Prescott Last updated Fri 23 Oct 2015 Politics Cumbria", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2015/oct/23/jamie-reed-mp-why-i-turned-down-im-a-celebrity"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:43:09.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
