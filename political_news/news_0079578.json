Jason Chaffetz on March 25, almost a week before a story was published about the Utah Republican's failed application to join the Secret Service. \nA Homeland Security Inspector General's report said Clancy didn't know about efforts to smear Chaffetz until nearly a week later. Chaffetz was leading a congressional investigation of the agency. \nClancy says the rumors he heard initially weren't credible and didn't know that agents, including senior executives, had accessed the file in violation of federal law and agency policies until about a week after the first agent found the file.
