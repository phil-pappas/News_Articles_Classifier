In the coming days speeches from President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, President Barrack Obama of the United States, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Salil Shetty from Amnesty International, and of course UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. On the heels of such a prominent group of speakers comes perhaps the most difficult series of challenges in recent General Assemblies.\nThe first item of business will be the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which must be approved to begin the post 2015 development framework to develop while slowing climate change. Next up will be an Anti-ISIS summit, raising the Palestinian flag, Raul Castro’s General Assembly debut, and a meeting discussing the beefing up of UN peacekeeping forces. However, most eyes will be on Vladimir Putin attending his first meetings at the UN in 10 years and will be watching his much talked about meeting with Obama even more closely.\nAnti-ISIS Summit\nWhile the need to pass the SDGs remains a top priority for the 70th UN general assembly, Obama’s anti-ISIS summit is the most eagerly anticipated event as the crisis in the Middle East continues to ripple throughout the world. Last year, President Obama called for a coalition at the UN General Assembly and now billions of dollars spent and a year having elapsed, the war with ISIS is currently at a stalemate .\nThough thousands of airstrikes have been launched and assistance was given to the Kurds to protect their territory, the vital retaking of Ramadi by the Iraqi from ISIS has stalled out despite assistance from the US and others and has left many pondering options going forward. Now, as Russia takes more of a role in helping prop up the Assad regime in Syria it will be up to Obama and the rest of the world to decide how to proceed going forward. Francois Hollande has ordered air-strikes against ISIS, but has also claimed “the future of ISIS cannot be with Bashar al-Assad.” These choices will characterize the debate, as Putin and his camp push an anti-ISIS campaign, while Obama and the West grapple with what the worst of two evils will be.\nRaising the Palestinian flag\nIn a symbolic gesture, the Palestinian flag will be raised at the UN with a large majority of 119 nations voting in favor of the resolution earlier this month. Many see this as a step to full recognition by the UN at some point in the future, while Israel and its allies were vehemently opposed to the resolution.\n“It’s a step to the recognition of Palestine as a full member state of the United Nations,” Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah remarked, and most expect the flag to officially be flown on September 30 when Palestinian PM Mahmoud Abbas addressed the General Assembly.\nObama-Putin summit\nToday, Barrack Obama and Vladimir Putin will speak face to face for the first time in 10 months and the distrust between the two leaders is at an all time high. Putin himself has not appeared at UNGA in almost 10 years , and with the crises in Syria and Ukraine hitting new pressure points Putin is in New York to push his own agenda forward.\nPolitical gamesmanship is already occurring over the meeting, as Obama and his media team claim the focus of the meeting will be on encouraging Russia to keep to its commitments to withdraw from Eastern Ukraine while Putin’s camp has said the main agenda will be impressing upon Obama the need to focus on ISIS rather than removing Bashar al-Assad.\nSyrians loyal to Assad have seen the presence of Russian bombers of military equipment recently, as Putin continues to aid the Assad regime and help defeat ISIS in Syria. The goal of the meeting, and the appearance of Putin in New York is to attempt to break out of the diplomatic isolation imposed on him by Washington and the West since the seizing of Crimea. This highly important and tense summit will be the talk of New York today, and its ramifications will be felt throughout the rest of the week.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/24/obama-vladimir-putin-un-general-assembly", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/27/un-70th-general-assembly-new-york-putin-obama-syria", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/world/europe/russia-vladimir-putin-united-nations-general-assembly.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/26/russian-planes-hope-fear-syria-assad-heartland", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/world/middleeast/un-general-assembly-syria-isis-refugees.html?_r=0", "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51996#.VgkAF3h0u0s", "http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2015/09/27/war-on-isis-a-focus-of-un-general-assembly-amid-stalemate/72927276/", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/19/us-russia-in-talks-rival-military-operations-syria"], "published": "2015-09-28T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:52:26.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
