In an address to The National press Club Friday he said, \"The Holocaust issue, that is just the left wing press trying to stir up a controversy.\" \"Basically what I said is that when tyranny occurs traditionally around the world they try to disarm the people first, and that is exactly what happened in Germany..the the mid to late 30s. \" He added, \"Daniel Webster said tyranny would never occur in America because the people are armed. So that is the reason we have the second amendment. And that doesn't mean I am not happy to look at ways to keep these tragedies from occurring, as long as they don't interfere with the Second Amendment.,\" Last Wednesday Carson's campaign said it has raised $20 million since July, a campaign spokeswoman said. That brings the total raised since Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, launched his campaign for the 2016 presidential election in May, to some $30 million.
