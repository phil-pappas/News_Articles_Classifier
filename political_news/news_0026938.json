Comment Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 12:01 AM By Jennifer BogdanJournal State House Bureau Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 12:01 AM PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The state Department of Children, Youth and Families is in negotiations with the Center for Southeast Asians over its attempt to recoup $498,234 from the nonprofit. Following an audit of the center released last week, DCYF said it had demanded it repay the money, most of which had gone unspent under contract with the agency. The DCYF also contends that the center should repay the state for money improperly spent on meals, entertainment and meetings, as well as pay interest on the funds. Jamia McDonald, who has been tapped by Governor Raimondo to head DCYF, met with center representatives on Oct. 7. Michael Raia, a spokesman for DCYF, called the meeting productive and said conversations will continue. He indicated that the state will consider whatever offers the center makes. \"Our top priorities are protecting the safety of the children in our care, strengthening families and ensuring the integrity of the investments we make in social services on the taxpayers’ behalf,\" Raia said. \"We are willing to review any proposal that addresses the problems identified in the audit and is fair to Rhode Island taxpayers.\" Bill Fischer, a spokesman for the center, also said negotiations are ongoing. \"From our standpoint, we viewed the meeting as productive,\" he said. \"Discussions are ongoing, and we remain hopeful to find a resolution to this matter that meets the goals of both the center and the department.\" jbogdan@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:12:34.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
