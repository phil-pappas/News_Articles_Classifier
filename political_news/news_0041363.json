(AP) - Rep. Becky Hutchins, R-Holton, introduced a bill to ban relatives of school employees from serving on school boards. \nThe unspoken irony? She didn’t support it. \n“It’s too broad,” Hutchins said of the measure, which she submitted on behalf of Rep. John Bradford, R-Lansing, with whom she shares an office. “It does put small districts really in a bind.” \nThe proposal would have banned anyone with a sibling, parent or spouse employed at a Kansas public school from serving on any school board, even hundreds of miles away, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported (http://bit.ly/1S5SxJu ). \nBradford asked Hutchins to bring it to the judiciary committee she sits on, and she agreed. Neither her name nor his appeared on it. \nMore than 90 percent of bills in the 2015 session didn’t bear the names of anyone involved in authoring or introducing them. \nOver several decades, Kansas’ lawmaking system has evolved into one in which legislators introduce hundreds of bills yearly - bills that cost taxpayer money to draft and print - but only put their names on a small number for which they want to take credit. \nPublic efforts to explore the origin of bills face obstacles: Lawmakers file proposals for each other, written meeting minutes are user-unfriendly and legislators themselves say some are engaging in a cat-and-mouse game to conceal involvement in controversial pieces of legislation. \n“It’s a very serious issue,” said Marge Ahrens, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas. “Anything threatening the right for us to understand the source and the need for legislation is of great concern to us for the workings of representative government.” \nLawmakers across the political spectrum defend the practice, saying it has strategic value and a bill’s source isn’t as important as the stances legislators take during debates and by voting. \nKansas offers lawmakers two options for dropping bills in the hopper: introducing them under their own names or requesting a committee file them. \nThe Topeka Capital-Journal reviewed legislative indexes recording thousands of bills dating as far back as the 1920s and found a trend in which Kansas shifted from a state with obvious authorship of most bills to one with increasing anonymity. \nIn 1925, 80 percent of bills had the names of lawmakers on them, but 50 years later only half did. By 2005, three-quarters were committee bills. In 2015, 92 percent were. \nTo compare with procedures in the 49 other states, The Capital-Journal contacted legislative bill-drafting, research and clerk offices in their statehouses and pored over bill lists and chamber rules. This research indicates Kansas is alone in conducting business this way. \nBradford, who joined the House in 2013, said he wasn’t dodging public scrutiny when he sought Hutchins’ help, and that he openly claimed authorship in town-hall discussions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:42:17.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
