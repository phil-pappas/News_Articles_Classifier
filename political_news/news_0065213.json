Russia has supported the Syrian government throughout that nation's civil war. (Kremlin) By Charles Krauthammer Opinion writer October 22 at 8:27 PM Follow @krauthammer Guess who just popped up in the Kremlin? Bashar al-Assad, Syrian dictator and destroyer, now Vladimir Putin’s newest pet. After four years holed up in Damascus, Assad was summoned to Russia to bend a knee to Putin, show the world that today Middle East questions get settled not in Washington but in Moscow, and officially bless the Russian-led four-nation takeover of Syria now underway.\nDoes the bewildered Obama administration finally understand what Russia is up to?\nCharles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive Facebook RSS President Obama says Russia is doomed to fail in the Syrian quagmire. But Russia is not trying to reconquer the country for Assad. It is consolidating a rump Syrian state in the roughly 20 percent of the country he now controls, the Alawite areas stretching north and west from Damascus through Latakia and encompassing the Russian naval base at Tartus.\nIt’s a partition. It will leave the Islamic State in control in the interior north and east. Why is this doomed to failure?\nPutin’s larger strategy is also obvious. He is not reconstructing the old Soviet empire. That’s too large a task. But he is rebuilding and reasserting Russia’s ability to project power beyond its borders. Annexing Crimea restores to the motherland full control of the warm-water Black Sea port that Russia has coveted since Peter the Great. Shoring up a rump Alawite state secures Russia’s naval and air bases in the eastern Mediterranean. Add to that Russia’s launching of advanced cruise missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea to strike Syrian rebels 900 miles away and you have the most impressive display of Russian military reach since the Cold War.\nFor Obama, of course, these things don’t matter. “In today’s world,” he told the U.N. last month, “the measure of strength is no longer defined by the control of territory.” That he clearly believes this fantasy was demonstrated by his total abandonment of Iraq, forfeiting U.S. bases from which we could have projected power in the region (most notably preventing, through control of Iraqi airspace, the Iranian rearming and reinforcement of Assad’s weakening regime).\nWhile Obama counts on the arc of the moral universe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@krauthammer", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/30/world/middleeast/syria-control-map-isis-rebels-airstrikes.html", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/posttv-thumbnails-prod/thumbnails/56278071e4b0c17574f16fcb/20151021_ASSADPUTIN_image.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:23:22.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
