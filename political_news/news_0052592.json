In a Medium post set to publish Wednesday, Bush blasts the Obama administration for making \"more resources off-limits to human beings\" and \"not listening to the Western communities and the individuals who know Western lands best.\"\nOne solution, he proposes, is moving the Department of Interior headquarters from the nation's capital to somewhere like Denver, Salt Lake City or Reno.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, 90% of land that the government owns and manages is in the West, including Alaska. It owns just 4% of the remaining 37 states in the more densely populated East.\nRead More It's a statistic Bush uses in the Medium post to illustrate what he considers federal overreach, in which he thinks the government is purchasing and holding on to too much land, interfering with recreational and private purposes.\nBush calls for more state and local control of land ownership decisions. And he proposes what he calls \"states-first\" wildlife conservation policies that give more deference to governors and state legislators in determining solutions to protect animals.\nThe hottest bird in politics at the moment is the greater sage grouse, which has seen declining numbers in its 11-state habitat. It was at risk for appearing on the Endangered Species List, a designation that would have affected multiple stakeholders throughout the West.\nBut last month the Interior Department announced the sage brush averted the dreaded listing, thanks to partnerships between government, private land owners, oil companies, and non-profit groups.\nTo address the maintenance backlog in the National Park Service (of more than $11 billion), Bush supports providing the NPS a \"100th anniversary gift\" next year by redirecting acquisition funds to help with maintenance projects in the parks, though he doesn't say how much money he has in mind.\nHe's also in favor of the permanent re-authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which expired earlier this month for the first time.\nBush, when he was governor, famously paired up with President Bill Clinton to lock hold of an $8 billion restoration plan for the Everglades in South Florida, an achievement he regularly mentions on the campaign trail to show his concern for the environment.\nWhile he's known as a Republican who fought for a major environmental project, he still staunchly defends protecting local economies just as much as the environment.\n\"You can be a conservative and believe in conservation,\" he said earlier this month in Iowa. As he's been introducing his energy policy, for example, he's been a big supporter of fracking and completing the Keystone XL pipeline -- two issues that avid environmentalists oppose.\nPublic land issues occasionally boil into national political debates. In recent memory, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy rallied conservatives to his defense when he protested grazing fees by the Bureau of Land Management.\nFor years, Bundy has refused to pay the fees for his cattle, like many other ranches, but last year tensions flared into an all-out standoff between Bundy's allies and government officials.\n\"He is breaking the law,\" Bush told reporters this summer during a stop to Carson City, Nevada, when asked about Bundy's refusal to pay. \"I think people, and the law ought to be enforced, and I'll let the federal government authorizes figure out how to do that.\"\nAt the same time, however, Bush criticized the government for expanding its ownership of lands out West, including the creation of national monuments.\n\"I don't think narrowing uses of public lands is appropriate,\" he said. \"There are ways that you can build consensus to protect the natural environment and allow people to access their land.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-17/oilmen-join-naturalists-in-unlikely-coalition-to-save-sage", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:01:37.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
