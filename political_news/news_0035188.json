Phil Bryant, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and House Speaker Phil Gunn bring Initiative 42 opposition to South Mississippi The three most powerful men in state government came to Gulfport on Thursday to rail against a school-funding ballot initiative. The three, all Republicans, and GOP Chairman Joe Nosef, said the initiative was an attempt to hand legislative powers to a judge, specifically a chancery judge in Hinds County. \"When you remove the Legislature, you remove the people,\" said House Speaker Philip Gunn, who appeared with Gov. Phil Bryant and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves before about a dozen people, most of them from the media. \"The danger is the judge could decide matters of funding, and the other side readily admits that, but he also could decide consolidation, he could also decide curriculum.\" SunHerald Posted October 23, 2015 - 4:59 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
