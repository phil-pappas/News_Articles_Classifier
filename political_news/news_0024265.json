Nikki Haley took an aerial tour of areas near the coast and warned coastal residents to monitor rivers swelling during the next couple of days as the mass of rainwater works its way toward the ocean.\n\"While the sun is shining, we want to remind everybody the waters are flowing down. We very much flew over and saw that water flowing. We see what's coming,\" she told reporters Wednesday in coastal Horry County.\nHaley said there will be more road closures in counties near the coast because of the water draining downstream.\n___\n5:40 p.m.\nRichland County authorities say two men who died after falling through a washed-out road did not drive around a barricade.\nLt. Curtis Wilson with the Richland County Sheriff's Department says there was a barricade on the road but it was in the wrong lane. Regardless, Wilson said the workers should not have been driving because there was a curfew in place.\nThe men were workers for the Kentucky-based R.J. Corman Railroad Group. Company spokesman Noel Rush said the men were among about 95 workers the company had sent to the area to repair a washed-out railroad for Norfolk Southern.\nThe accident happened just before 3 a.m. on Wednesday. Authorities had a curfew in place between midnight and 6 a.m.\nOne of the men who died was from Lexington, Kentucky, and the other was from Chesapeake, Ohio. The company did not release their names.\nA company jet flew the three who survived back to Kentucky, where they met with their families and grief counselors Wednesday.\nWilson said he did not know why the barricade was in the wrong lane.\n___\n5:30 p.m.\nSouth Carolina National Guard and Columbia utility crews have paused work dropping sandbags on a breach in the city's canal.\nA break in the levee that separates the canal from the Congaree River was brought on by the massive rainstorms and has threatened the water supply of 375,000 people in the city.\nGuard spokeswoman Col. Cindi King said work was suspended because of issues with nearby power lines and what she called \"shifting earth.\"\nKing said officials from South Carolina Electric and Gas were evaluating the stability of the situation.\nShe said they hoped to resume Thursday morning.\nThe operation involved moving heaving track hoes into place, which were to assist dropping a barge into the canal to reinforce it. Also, heavy rock bags and sand bags were being placed along portions of the levee and into the break in the canal.\nKing said about 100 heavy bags had been dropped by CH-47 Chinook helicopters by the time the operation was paused.\nThe canal was built in the early 1800s and supplies 35 million gallons of water to the city's water plant each day.\n___\n4 p.m.\nAuthorities say the two men killed in South Carolina when the pickup truck they were in drove around a barricade and off a washed out road into the water were out-of-state contractors working to check damaged railroad tracks.\nRichland County Coroner Gary Watts said divers found the bodies of 58-year-old Robert Vance of Lexington, Kentucky, and 53-year-old Ricky McDonald of Chesapeake, Ohio, on Wednesday afternoon.\nDeputies say five men were in the truck when it drove around a barricade around 3 a.m. Wednesday and hit a 20-foot section of road that had been washed out, plunging into the floodwaters below. The other three men swam to safety.\n___\nFederal disaster aid has been opened up for three additional South Carolina counties.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency says Wednesday it has amended the disaster declaration for the recent flooding in order to make survivors in Berkeley, Clarendon and Sumter counties eligible for its individual assistance program.\nPresident Barack Obama has already signed a disaster declaration, ordering federal aid to help recovery efforts in South Carolina. The action taken Monday made federal funding available to people in eight counties.\n___\n2:55 p.m.\nOfficials say two people who disappeared in waters after they drove around a barricade on a closed road have died, bringing the death toll from days of historic rain and floods to at least 19 in the Carolinas.\nDeputies in Richland County, South Carolina, said Wednesday that the pair's truck plunged into water at a 20-foot gap where the pavement was washed out.\nSheriff's spokesman Lt. Curtis Wilson said three people in the pickup managed to get to safety around 3 a.m., but divers found the two others dead inside the truck by divers hours later. Their names weren't released.\nNine people have now been killed in the flooding in Richland County. All were in vehicles. Seventeen of those killed since the storm started last week were in South Carolina.\nRichland County Sheriff Leon Lott says deputies have found other vehicles of people who haven't been seen since the flood. He did not give specifics on how many people may be missing.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nOfficials in Richland County say they've gotten reports that caskets are popping out of grounds swollen from days of historic rainfall.\nRichland County Coroner Gary Watts would not say Wednesday where caskets have surfaced but said officials would work to relocate them.\nThe state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it is monitoring cemetery flooding across the state and is surveying cemetery operators to assess their needs.\nThe agency says it has 11 confirmed instances of disinterment from six counties\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nGov. Nikki Haley is taking a trip toward South Carolina's coast to assess flood damage and talk with reporters.\nHaley's office says she is planning to hold a media availability at 3:45 p.m. Wednesday at the Horry County Emergency Management Division Headquarters in Conway.\nDuring a briefing in Columbia earlier Wednesday, Haley said the central area of the state is recovering as flood waters recede, but officials are keeping a close eye on the southeastern portion.\nHaley also said 62 dams across the state are being monitored and that 13 had already failed.\n___\n12:20 p.m.\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley says state wildlife officials have made at least 600 rescues during the flooding that has ravaged the state.\nShe says the central area of the state is recovering as the waters recede, but officials are keeping a close eye on the southeastern part of the state.\nShe says 62 dams across the state are being monitored and 13 had already failed.\nShe says she understands that questions are being raised about the state's infrastructure, but she says they are still in response and recovery mode. She says there will be time for analysis later.\nHaley was joined by FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, who said the agency would be here \"for a long time.\"\n___\n12:05 p.m.\nThe University of South Carolina's game against No. 7 LSU has been moved to the Tigers' home field as Columbia works to rebuild following days of historic rainfall and treacherous flooding.\nThe school says Wednesday that the game slated for Saturday in Columbia has been moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nCoach Steve Spurrier says his team wants to \"do the right thing\" and trusts the decision of Gov. Nikki Haley and others to move the game.\nAll of Columbia has been under a boil water advisory for days due to pipeline breaks and flooded areas. A crowd of about 80,000 was expected for the game, and Spurrier says he thinks it's the right call for the game to be moved rather than further tax Columbia's infrastructure.\nSpurrier says a game time for the new location has not been set.\n___\n11:45 a.m.\nA North Carolina-based relief organization headed by Franklin Graham is sending truckloads of supplies to help residents in flood-ravaged South Carolinians.\nSamaritan's Purse says it is sending two tractor-trailers full of supplies like heavy-duty tarps, generators and chain saws.\nThe organization says it is also bringing volunteers to help clean out homes damaged by flood waters and help families in need. The group is also bringing chaplains to help provide emotional and spiritual care.\nThe group will be based at Shandon Baptist Church in Columbia.\nSince 1998, Samaritan's Purse says it has helped more than 29,000 families in 35 states after floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires and ice storms.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nOfficials say it is now safe for some people to return to their homes after they evacuated early Wednesday because of a dam that was expected to collapse.\nRichland County Sheriff Leon Lott said late Wednesday morning that the Beaver Creek dam is now stabilized and it is safe for residents to return home.\nHe says, \"We've passed the critical stage we had earlier today.\"\nAuthorities had ordered residents in about 1,000 homes downstream from the dam to evacuate and seek higher ground.\nLott says, \"There is no danger of any dam break whatsoever.\"\nThe sheriff said the decision to evacuate was based on the recommendations of engineers at the dam.\nTrucks carrying about 400 tons of rocks were brought in to stabilize the dam.\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nA senior South Carolina Army National Guard official working with the operation to shore up the Beaver Creek Dam in the Columbia says he's hopeful the worst has been averted at the scene.\nCol. Brad Owens says crews from the Guard and the South Carolina Electric and Gas worked through the night and into Wednesday morning using sandbags and dropping rocks to hold back the Beaver Creek Dam waters along Polo Road. Owens says part of the roadway has been eroded and has been closed for days.\nHe says the operation has focused on shoring up the area around a culvert and pipe that allows water to flow from the dam and into the area of Sesquicentennial State Park. Because of the possibility of a dam failure, the residents of the nearby Wildewood Downs area have been urged to evacuate.\nOwens, the director of the Joint Staff for the National Guard, says, \"We are putting in more rock and sandbags as we speak, but we believe the situation is improving, not degrading.\"\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nRepublican presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham says historic flooding in South Carolina could \"break the bank\" of federal emergency officials, forcing Congress to step in to appropriate possibly more than $1 billion to help with relief efforts.\nThe South Carolina lawmaker on Wednesday morning visited A.C. Flora High School, where dozens of people sought shelter after the latest dam breach threatened their homes. Graham says he wanted to assess the damage personally and determine what role the federal government can play in cleanup efforts.\nHe says: \"It's going to take weeks to really get a good assessment of the damage. We're talking hundreds of millions (of dollars), maybe over a billion.\"\nBut he warned state and county officials not to use the disaster as an opportunity to ask for money unrelated to flood damage. He criticized the federal government's aid package to the northeastern United States following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, calling it a \"pork-laden monstrosity.\"\n___\n8:55 a.m.\nCrews are working to repair a breach in the Columbia canal that is threatening the main water supply for 375,000 people.\nColumbia Utilities Director Joey Jaco says officials were working Wednesday to build a rock dam a few hundred feet north of the breach, which is near the city's hydroelectric plant in view of morning commuters crossing the Gervais Street bridge.\nJaco says officials had hoped to have the dam completed by Wednesday morning. But the normally calm waters of the canal looked more like a whitewater rapids course after days of record rainfall, making it difficult for workers to move equipment to put the dam in place.\nJaco says the National Guard is helping by using helicopters to bring in sandbags and says the dam should be in place sometime Wednesday. Jaco says the only danger now is for the canal to breach in a second spot. But he says the levy shows no signs of buckling.\nThe canal was built in the early 1800s and supplies 35 million gallons of water to the city's water plant each day.\n___\n8:55 a.m.\nGov. Nikki Haley plans to give an update on statewide efforts to clean up and contain damage in the wake of historic rainfall and historic flooding.\nHaley's office says the governor will be available to speak with news outlets at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday at the South Carolina Emergency Operations Center in West Columbia.\nHaley has warned that areas downstream of Columbia could be the next endangered by waterways swollen and overflowing after record-setting rainfall in the state.\n___\n8:30 a.m.\nCrews are filling a sinkhole with rocks in the hope that it will keep a compromised dam in the Columbia area from breaching after historic flooding hit the state.\nLocal news outlets report that dump trucks were seen arriving at the Beaver Dam on Wednesday morning with about 400 tons of large rocks.\nAuthorities have ordered residents in about 1,000 homes downstream from the dam to evacuate immediately and seek higher ground in the event the dam doesn't hold.\nAuthorities worked overnight to try to stabilize the dam after a sinkhole formed nearby, pumping water out of the pond to relieve pressure on the dam.\n___\n8:05 a.m.\nCharleston County schools are open for the first time in almost a week, but it's likely that some students still won't able to get to classes because of the fallout from historic rain and flooding.\nThe district said Wednesday that buses would not be able to make it to a number of stops because of high water or because students live along dirt roads that the buses are not driving.\nThe district says students who could not make it to school should contact their schools. The district has 48,000 students and 84 schools. Charleston County schools were last open Thursday. Schools remain closed in several nearby counties\n___\n6:55 a.m.\nAuthorities are ordering people living near a compromised dam in the Columbia area to evacuate immediately.\nThe South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Wednesday morning that people living in the area that surrounds the Beaver Dam in the Wildewood area should leave their homes now.\nRichland County authorities say the dam could breach at any time. People living in the area are urged to move to higher ground or to seek shelter at A.C. Flora High School in Columbia.

Three people managed to get out safely but told emergency crews that two others did not.\nTeams are searching the area in rescue boats and dive gear.\nRichland County was under a curfew from midnight Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n___\n5:45 a.m.\nClasses are still closed at the University of South Carolina's Columbia campus due to flooding, but officials say they're allowing faculty and staff to return Wednesday.\nClasses at the school's flagship campus that's attended by more than 30,000 students are canceled all week as Columbia and its surrounding areas assess damage from record-setting rainfall and the flooding that has followed.\nThe school says it's following closing determinations set by Richland County, where government offices are also reopening Wednesday.\nColumbia is also still under a boil water advisory, meaning all water must be boiled for a minute before cooking or drinking. Schools in the area have also canceled classes through Friday.\n___\n5:35 a.m.\nAuthorities in South Carolina are still working to stabilize a Richland County dam that was compromised as a result of historic flooding.\nSheriff Leon Lott tells local news outlets Wednesday morning that crews worked through the night to repair a sinkhole that formed near the Beaver Dam in the northeast part of the county.\nCrews from the South Carolina Electric and Gas Co. are pumping water out of the pond to relieve pressure on the dam.\nThe Emergency Management Division says a reverse 911 call went out just before 10:45 p.m. Tuesday urging residents within a half-mile radius of Beaver Dam to seek higher ground immediately.\nLott says evacuations are voluntary and that he doesn't think more will be needed.\n___\n4:40 a.m.\nThings are starting to return to normal in South Carolina after days of devastating rains, with the weather clearing and electricity largely restored. But some residents are still worried about a second round of flooding from rivers swollen by the deluge.\nSome residents of Georgetown, between Charleston and Myrtle Beach, were preparing by stacking sandbags or moving their possessions as rivers crest upstream causing the potential of more flooding in an area where water was a foot deep or more in places over the weekend.\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley says the state is monitoring the situation closely and warns there may have to be evacuations from areas along the coast.\nShe says the sun coming out is good news for the storm-weary state but says officials continue monitoring any potential for additional flooding.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:22:50.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
