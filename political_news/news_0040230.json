Lynn Posey and two others ruled unanimously against a motion by Thomas Blanton, who's running for the commission's Southern District seat as a Democrat. Blanton wanted to disqualify Posey, a Union Church Republican who represents the Central District. Blanton argues Posey shouldn't be able to vote because he took campaign contributions in 2013 from 10 companies that Mississippi Power has paid $86 million to work on the $6.3 billion Kemper plant.
