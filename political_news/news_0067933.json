As secretary of state, Clinton advocated for the agreement and called it the \"gold standard of trade agreements.\" \nBut last week she announced her opposition to the deal , because of the lack of controls on currency manipulation and the treatment of pharmaceutical companies and their patents, which she thinks favors big PHARMA over consumers. Biden supports the deal and will fight for its passage in Congress. \nThe second Democratic debate is set for November 14 in Des Moines, Iowa and the hosts, which include CBS News, have not yet released the criteria for candidates who wish to participate. But Biden may need to make a decision before that date -- two states have primary filing deadlines in the first two weeks of November, according to the University of Virginia's Center for politics. The Democratic candidate who won't be on stage \nLarry Lessig, a law professor at Harvard, launched his campaign last month after raising $1 million to back the singular purpose of his bid: campaign finance reform . Lessig won't be on stage Tuesday night because he fails to meet CNN's polling requirement. \n\"The debate criteria worked well for politicians and billionaires,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"If you're a billionaire, you can afford to spend a year or two years getting the name recognition necessary to get a 1 percent and if you're a politician, you can get paid by the government while you run for president.\" \nLessig said that rules should instead consider a candidate's \"viability,\" something he said his campaign demonstrated by raising money faster, going on the air with ads sooner and hiring key staff before Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, who both qualified for the debate. Webb has not yet released his first fundraising report. \n\"I wish I could be up there,\" Lessig said. \"For all the people who stepped up and supported my campaign, I wish I could be up there.\" \nLessig said he would now focus wholly on getting into the second debate. \nHe has said the Democratic National Committee could help by welcoming him to the race and, in turn, signaling to the media and pollsters that he is a legitimate contender. A spokesperson for the DNC, Holly Shulman, told CBS News that the DNC has treated Lessig fairly. \n\"Lessig and his staff were briefed by DNC staff on the ballot and delegate process, as offered to all Democratic presidential candidates and potential candidates,\" Shulman said in a statement. O'Malley, before and after \nDespite spending more days in Iowa than any other candidate, O'Malley has struggled to get his poll numbers out of the single digits. \nCornell Belcher, who was part of Barack Obama's polling team in 2008 and 2012 and now runs his own strategy firm, said that the stakes are especially high for O'Malley because of the faith he has placed in the debate to get his message out. \n\"If there's a future for O'Malley he's got to have a Carly Fiorina moment where people notice him,\" he said, referring to Fiorina's rise from the first \"undercard\" debate to a memorable performance on the main stage in the second debate, \"or he's going to languish.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:02:40.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
