The Wages were among the very first to receive permission from the state to use low-dose cannabis oil without fear of prosecution. Curtis Compton / ccompton@ajc.com Seizures were also down among patients with other forms of epilepsy, Park said, while 9 percent of all patients were seizure-free. The trials officially began enrolling children late last year and updated data will be available by December, he said.\nGov. Nathan Deal backed the use of clinical trials in Georgia last year to study cannabis oil’s effect on children suffering from seizure disorders, and lawmakers earlier this year passed a landmark law allowing formally approved the use of a limited form of cannabis oil to treat severe forms of eight illnesses including cancer, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.\nMore than 200 families have since qualified for the state’s new medical marijuana registry, allowing them to use the oil in treatment.\nThe new law, however, only allows families to possess cannabis oil, making no attempt to address the oil’s manufacture or how to buy or obtain it —an important point given that the sale of any form of marijuana is and remains a violation of state and federal law, as does transporting it across state lines.\nA number of parents and advocates have said they remain stymied over how to access the oil , and are encouraging the commission to develop guidelines related to cultivation and production in Georgia.", "external_links": ["https://shar.es/17Ikr9", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/30/43/ea/medical-marijuana-registry-card.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:33:35.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
