The money is in the custody of a court-appointed trustee after President Barack Obama in 2012 ordered Iranian assets blocked, including those of Bank Markazi. \nIn its appeal, the bank asserts that Congress overstepped its authority when it passed a 2012 law allowing plaintiffs in the lawsuit to be paid from Bank Markazi's assets. The bank argues that a law aimed at directing a result in a specific court case violates the separation of powers. \nThe lawsuit also includes victims of the 1996 terrorist bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 service members. Each family was expected to receive about $5 million after attorney fees. \nThe Supreme Court agreed to take up the case even though Solicitor General Donald Verrilli had urged the justices to let the appeals court ruling stand. \nThe Beirut bombing was blamed on the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. Lawyers for the victims argued that evidence showed that Iran's late supreme cleric, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and other top leaders authorized and planned the bombing. \nIn the early morning hours of Oct. 23, 1983, a truck filled with more than 2,000 pounds of explosives sped past a guardpost and exploded outside the four-story Beirut barracks while most servicemen were still sleeping. The soldiers killed and wounded in the attack were part of a multinational peacekeeping mission to help stabilize a violent civil war between Christians and Muslims. \nThe lawsuit against Iran was filed under a 1996 U.S. law that allows Americans to sue nations that the State Department considers sponsors of terrorism for damages suffered in terrorist acts. \nThe high court is expected to hear arguments this winter in Bank Markazi v.
