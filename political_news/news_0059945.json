She also pushed for digital women inclusion as the recently signed sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are being implemented.\n\"We need to challenge the approach of what is appropriate for women,\" said Mrs. Kagame.\n\"I have no doubt that Rwanda , and Africa as a whole, has not seen the last of young promising female innovators.\"\nJeannette Kagame's charity Imbuto Foundation promotes girls' education in the country.\nThe organization since 2001 has supported thousands of young girls and boys access education.\nMrs. Kagame, who also doubles as the patron of the 'New Faces New Voices' Rwanda chapter - a global women empowerment initiative, has set a target to raise $20 million to support women to access finance.\nIngrid Brudvig , from World Wide Web foundation said that 62% of women value the web as a space for commenting on important issue, while 25% less likely than men to look for a job online.\nRwanda has emerged among the few countries moving quickly to cut down the gender digital divide.\nFor instance, more than 100 girls in science have recently graduated from Gashora Girls' Academy in eastern Rwanda . Government incentives are making girls out-compete boys in science subjects.\nRwanda recently organized a holiday science camp for 120 girls from nine countries including South Africa and the United States .\nThe initiative, the first of its kind in Rwanda , was a collaboration involving Microsoft, the US First Lady Michelle Obama and the US State Department.\nSpeaking at Transform Africa in Kigali , Jeannette Kagame told girls \"to be bold, be curious and never doubt your ability to change things for the better.\"\nFor Media Enquiries\nDan Ngabonziza\nKT Press\nEmail\n+250784507033\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-lady-vows-rwanda-to-end-digital-gender-divide-a-kt-press-report-300164634.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-lady-vows-rwanda-to-end-digital-gender-divide-a-kt-press-report-300164634.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=293033", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH35636&Transmission_Id=201510220809PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH35636&DateId=20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:30:23.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
