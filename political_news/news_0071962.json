La Rosa opts against Congress run Gray Rohrer Osceola state Rep. La Rosa eschews run for Congress \nTALLAHASSEE – State Rep. Mike La Rosa, R-St. Cloud, has decided not to run for Congress. \n\"Looking ahead to 2016, I've received overwhelming encouragement from my family, community and colleagues, and although I'm totally fed up with politicians in Washington D.C. and believe that Washington and Congress need a complete and total overhaul, I've decided not to run for the U.S. House next year,” La Rosa said in a released statement. \nHe had been seen as a top GOP candidate for District 9, which largely covers his current state House district in Osceola County. But a Leon Circuit Court judge ruled last week affirming redrawn congressional maps that favor Democrats in that district. Voters in the district favored President Barack Obama by 56 percent in the 2012 election. \nThe Florida Supreme Court will review the ruling by the end of the month. \n“For now, I will continue to serve the people of Central Florida as their State Representative. There is still much work to be done in the Florida legislature, including funding our educational institutions and cutting taxes for Florida families,” La Rosa added. \nThe race for the District 9 seat, which is being vacated by U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, in favor of a run for U.S. Senate, is already crowded with Democrats. State Sen. Darren Soto of Orlando, former Grayson aide Susannah Randolph, Dr. Deborah Mining and Valleri Crabtree are all vying for the Democratic nomination. Wayne Liebnitzky is the lone Republican in the race so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:32:46.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
