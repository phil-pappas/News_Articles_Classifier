The move rocked the political landscape and has the house in limbo over who will be the next leader of the majority party. \nIf you’re a Republican from Central Florida you should be rooting for Congressman Daniel Webster . Why? Because you’re a Republican from Central Florida. If that reason alone is not enough for you, then I encourage a history lesson of Webster’s well regarded leadership in during his time in the legislature, where he believed that one should vote with their heart, and not their wallet or ego. \nDespite Webster’s recent momentum such as the endorsement from the House Freedom Caucus, which could include up to 40 votes, and nods from two of his Central Florida Congressional Colleagues David Jolly , and Ted Yoho , Webster still has a lot of work to do to reach 218. \nOne of his biggest competitors is Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz . Why should you be rooting against this guy. \nBecause he denied, Central Florida’s other adored Republican Congressman, John Mica of his dream job. \nMica has been in Congress for over 20 years, he’s seen it all, but he wanted to be succeed House Oversight Chair Darrell Issa . He never got that chance. 48 year old Jason Chaffetz did because he “played the game” better. Keep in mind that John Mica is the most skilled lawmaker I’ve ever seen at detecting and dissecting fraud and waste. The video footage is out there. He deserved the position. He didn’t get it because of Jason Chaffetz. \nBoth Webster and Chaffetz have a long road ahead of them. The establishment choice is Wisconsin Congressman and former VP nominee Paul Ryan . Ryan, is a Webster favorite and if he did get the job, I’m sure Webster would be happy for him. That’s the way he is.
