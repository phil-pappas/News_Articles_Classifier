I am tired of the stranglehold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse.\" \nThe line landed. \n\"Look, we're laughing,\" he continued, as the crowd cheered. \"This is serious business.\" \nThe rally, headlined by Katy Perry, marked Bill Clinton's first time speaking on behalf of his wife on the campaign trail. He stood supportively alongside Clinton at her launch event on Roosevelt Island in New York back in June but only waved to the crowd, and has since then limited his participation to fundraising and advising Clinton and her team in private. \nHe kept his remarks here short, joking that he was \"well aware\" that he was a \"warm-up act,\" but he took the time to touch on many of the issues Clinton has prioritized in her campaign, including equal pay and early childhood education.

SCOTT MORGAN, REUTERS \nAnd in closing, he struck a hopeful tone. \n\"I've seen it all,\" he said. \"But I promise you, there's not a better positioned country for the future than we are if we have the right leadership, if we make the right decisions, and if we decide we're going to do it together.\" \nFrom Iowa, the Clintons will return to New York to celebrate Clinton's upcoming birthday with a star-studded fundraiser on Sunday. According to Bill Clinton's personal office, there are no other campaign events on his schedule yet. He is set to make speeches at two colleges -- Michigan State University and Ohio State University -- next month. \nCBS News Associate Producer Alexander Romano contributed to this report.
