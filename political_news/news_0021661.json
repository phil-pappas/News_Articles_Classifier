This is the first time that three main party committees have chosen for women to lead their campaigns.\nMonday’s debate will be heated, but it is not likely to be decisive. The electoral result seems foretold.\nPoland’s governing party, Civic Platform (PO), saw a 1% rise in voter support in October to 24%, against a drop in support for the rival Law and Justice (PiS) party by 2%. Nonetheless, PiS has a resounding 36% and a 12% lead. In earnest, the Civic Platform does not stand a chance.\nThe liberal-conservative Civic Platform (PO) is a member of the European People’s Party and has ruled Poland since 2007. For few days still, PO dominates the Parliament (Sejm) and the Senate. PO’s campaign is focused on warning the Poles not to surrender both the Presidency and the Prime Minister’s position to PiS. Comparisons with Hungary and the spectra of “an authoritarian Poland” abound.\nThe favorite PiS has been leading the opposition since 2007. The party was founded in 2001 by the Kaczyński twins and is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR). PiS is running on a semi anti-globalization platform, with sovereigntist overtones.\nThe left mourns the demise of the left, but the agenda it brings to the table is not very clear. Party leaderships of the coalition are fascinated by the Syriza and Podemos experiences, dropping ties and rolling-up sleeves, but the electorate is not responding. The Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) is under-performing on the polls and the alliance is not likely to enter the parliament, since the parliamentary threshold for coalitions is a whopping 8%. The party is led by Barbara Nowacka, a young woman that is promising to consolidate the Polish center-left. That consolidation maybe the only thing the Polish left can hope for.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:47:47.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
