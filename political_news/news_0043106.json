They met in private to discuss matters of governance.\nIt was the chief governing body of the day, and included noblemen, the clergy and officers of the Crown - similar to the modern-day Cabinet.\nToday, the Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council, which consists of 500 privy counsellors.\nThese include the current and all former prime ministers, past and current Cabinet ministers, leaders of the opposition and archbishops.\nThe council meets around once a month with the Queen - the last meeting was on 15 July at Buckingham Palace.\nThe Government says the council is very open, with the details of all its meetings and attendees made available to the public through the Court Circular, which is the official record of engagements carried out by the monarch.\nIn recent times, the power of the monarch within the Privy Council meeting has been largely ceremonial. \nAt the meeting, the Queen \"approves\" any new order that has passed through ministers - to enforce them as law of the land.\nThe last time a monarch refused an order was more than 300 years ago.\nThe Privy Council formally approves changes to the governance of institutions that are incorporated by a Royal Charter.\nThe University of Cambridge was the first institution to be formed through a Royal Charter in 1231 and the BBC was formed through one in 1929.\nIt is also the final court of appeal for the UK’s overseas territories, Crown dependencies and for some Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica and Barbados.\nDavid Cameron was formally sworn in as a privy counsellor three months after his election as Conservative leader in 2005.\nThe swearing-in ceremony requires the new member to kiss the Queen’s hand and take a binding oath.\nHowever, the Privy Council website also states that there is a \"solemn affirmation\" available to those who cannot take the oath.\nThe oath obliges all parties keep matters discussed at the meetings a secret - allowing the Prime Minister to share classified information with the leader of the opposition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:57:34.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
