Rubio really could not care any less.\nDuring an appearance on Fox News Friday, Rubio dismissed Trump's comments that the Florida political duo \"hate each other,\" telling host Martha MacCallum he's wrong and asking \"who cares\" what Trump thinks about the issue.\n\"He doesn't know what he's talking about. I have great admiration for Gov. Bush. We're friends,\" said Rubio, who sits fourth in the Washington Examiner's latest power rankings . \"We're running for the same office. I'm not running against him, I'm running for president.\"\n\"It doesn't change my feelings towards him as a person. You don't have to hate the person, and in the case of Gov. Bush, who I've known for a very long time, I admire him and we're friends, but we're competitors now too, and we can do that in a way that is deserving of what the American people deserve in this election cycle,\" Rubio said. \"He doesn't know what he's talking about.\"\n  'Just isn't good enough': GOP slams Obama on weak jobs \"Too many middle-class families are still struggling in this economy, and we can do a lot better,\" Boehner said.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/02/15 10:05 AM When asked what Trump is trying to accomplish with his remarks, Rubio simply asked \"who cares?\"\n\"I have no idea.

I'm focused on the future of our country.\"\nRubio's remarks come two days after Trump told a New Hampshire crowd that Rubio and Bush's friendship is \"political bulls---.\"\n\"They hate each other. Trust me, I know. They hate so much,\" Trump said. \"They hate more than anybody in this room hates their neighbor.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obamacare shorts health insurers $2.5 billion \nInsurers will get far less money than promised from the federal government this year — and a few billion dollars less than they requested — to help pay for their sickest customers.\nInsurers learned late Thursday that they'll receive just $362 million out of the $2.9 billion in requested for 2014 for the program, according to an announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThat's because a program created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act hasn't brought in nearly as much money as it needs to pay out. As insurers enrolled more older, sicker Americans under the new healthcare law, they were promised some federal money to help cover their new costs, through a program known as risk corridors.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/02/15 12:02 PM Top Story Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump stokes prejudice, paranoia \"He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia.
