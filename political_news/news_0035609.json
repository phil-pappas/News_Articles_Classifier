(Photo: Kathie Obradovich/THE REGISTER) \nI mean, things besides Donald Trump. \nThe discussion after the tragic mass shooting in Roseburg, Ore., is an example. We can’t even call it the “most recent” tragedy. There was another one at a college in Arizona on Friday morning. The predictable calls for gun control were met with responses that such events should not be “politicized.” That’s just another way of saying, “Stop talking about this.” \nThat’s ludicrous. The only way we will find a solution to this ongoing bloodbath is to talk about it, and that includes through the political process. \nThe idea that the media should hush up the name of the shooter to avoid inspiring other infamy hounds may be well-meaning but is equally hopeless. We’ve been glorifying criminals in our society for more than a century. Ever heard of Bonnie and Clyde? How about Jack the Ripper? Anyone with the itch to do something monstrous will find a role model whether we attach a name to that disturbed kid in Oregon or not. \nThen there’s the straw that gun-rights advocates grasp to avoid talking about gun control: mental illness. Good, great, let’s talk about mental illness. We seriously need to talk in our society about mental illness … hello? Anybody there? \nRight. Nobody really wants to talk about mental illness. In a society where we can discuss the state of our bowels and bikini waxes and bitter breakups all over the Internet, we continue to bury mental illness behind a concrete wall of denial and shame. \nThat’s one thing that former congressman Patrick Kennedy is hoping to change. You’ve probably heard of Kennedy: He’s the 48-year-old younger son of the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy and nephew of JFK. He’s been in the news recently for writing a new book, “A Common Struggle,” about his own and his family’s history of mental illness and substance abuse. \nKennedy was in Des Moines last week, trying to open a conversation about mental illness in the most public way possible, through the presidential campaign. \n“The elephant in everyone’s living room is the fact that a family member is suffering in some way — anxiety, depression, alcoholism, addiction, trauma,” Kennedy said in an interview after leading a roundtable discussion at Drake University. “There’s no one that’s immune, there’s no family that’s immune. And one thing that’s common in response to all of these things is silence.” \nKennedy’s political organization, the NOW Campaign, is hoping to engage presidential candidates about mental health policy. Candidates will be invited to deliver State of the Union-style addresses on the topic early next year. \nHe isn’t necessarily trying to get candidates to open up about their own or family members’ mental health issues, saying that’s still not a safe campaign topic. But he said he applauds Republican Carly Fiorina for talking about her stepdaughter’s drug-related death. Republican Jeb Bush has been open about youthful marijuana use and alcohol problems. Kennedy said he also appreciates Ohio Gov. John Kasich's and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s focus on better handling of mental illness in the justice system. Hillary Clinton, he said, has “a very detailed policy approach.” Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley have also addressed mental health on the campaign trail. \nWhile mass shootings dominate media attention, the death toll from mental illness is astronomically higher and almost always hidden. In Iowa, Kennedy said, suicide is the leading cause of death for people age 15 to 35. If that’s not enough, then add the toll from accidental overdoses and car crashes caused by drunk or drugged drivers who are often addicts. We could go even further by piling on the deaths from chronic diseases caused by alcoholism and drug abuse. \nKennedy pointed out that mental illness and addiction affect every major aspect of our government: education, health care, human services, criminal justice and corrections, national security. \nIn the book, he posits that his father’s long struggle with alcoholism stemmed from untreated post-traumatic stress disorder. He argues that rather than a shameful character flaw or embarrassing moral issue, addiction is a medical issue, no different from cancer. Even so, his brother, Ted Kennedy Jr., has publicly disputed Patrick Kennedy’s version of events. His mother, Joan Kennedy, has distanced herself from any involvement with the book. \nThe former congressman brushed aside questions about the propriety of publicizing his parents’ problems as well as his own. “That’s an old canard that somehow it’s not your place to tell their story. Well, excuse me, I’m telling my story. There’s nothing that can affect (you) more than how your parents are, because we all become our parents,” he said. \nHe added his family’s so-called secrets are available in every bookstore in America. “They’ve been written about a million times. If it’s tough for me to tell the worst-kept secrets out there, imagine what it’s like for the average family to discuss these very quote-unquote delicate issues,” he said. \nOne in four American adults experience some form of mental illness at some point in any given year. This is not about somebody else. It’s about our friends, our family and it’s about us. If gun violence is the conversation starter, then let’s take advantage of that. Ask candidates, from school board to county level to the Statehouse to the White House, what they intend to do about improving detection and treatment of mental illness. \nOnly by talking about it can we make it go away.
