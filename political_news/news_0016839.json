William “Dub” Lawrence reads trajectories. He studies impact marks at crime scenes to map out the paths of bullets. He learned the skill when he was the sheriff of Farmington, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. \nHe also studies the trajectory of law enforcement’s recent history: Cops have been militarized, causing them to treat criminals as enemy combatants, which in turn makes it more likely they will use excessive force. That is to say, kill people. The documentary Peace Officer follows this retired lawman as he investigates a number of cases involving the “imbalance of justice.” As is the case with all good cop movies — and this is a good cop movie — he has a personal stake in the matter. His son-in-law was killed in a stand-off with the very SWAT team that Lawrence himself founded. \nDirectors Scott Christopherson and Brad Barber allow the victims (and there’s no convincing anyone who sees this movie that they are not victims) or their surviving families to narrate their tales, while also letting the police tell theirs. Despite that, the cops still look bloodthirsty. Lawrence is crucial in this mix. Without this civilian lawman standing astride both worlds, the movie would plunge into despair, but he remains positive and driven. The sheriff’s aim is true, and in his small way, he is helping to restore balance to the criminal justice system. \nPeace Officer is showing on Wednesday, Oct. 14, at 7 p.m., in the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art’s lecture hall.
