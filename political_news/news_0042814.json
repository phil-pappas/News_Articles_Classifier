Tickets are required for admission to the rally. Ticket distribution is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday at these locations on the Boulder campus:\n• the end of \"Engine Alley\" near the Museum Collections building and Economics building;\n• near the Gold Biosciences building and Folsom Field on Colorado Avenue;\n• the math courtyard between the Engineering Center and Math building.\nParking information:\nbit.ly/1R08y2o\nAn enthusiastic crowd on Thursday snapped up tickets for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' rally on the University of Colorado's East Campus on Saturday.\nA few minutes after 9 a.m., when ticket distribution began, a long line stretched out from the ticket table in the courtyard between the Engineering Center and the Mathematics building.\nSeveral hundred people of all ages waited patiently along the sidewalk in the sun while campaign staffers peppered them with requests for pictures holding \"Bernie 2016\" campaign signs. Activists with petitions for an array of issues also trolled the line.\nThe free tickets — which are being distributed on a first come, first served basis — are still available at three locations on CU's campus starting at 9 a.m. Friday.\nAdvertisement Potts Field — where the rally will be hosted at 2 p.m. on Saturday — can accommodate up to 10,000 people, but it's unclear how many tickets will be made available for the event.\nSanders — who was elected as an independent, but is running against Hillary Clinton and others for the Democratic nomination for president — and his campaign initially contacted university officials last week but decided not to come when they learned about the availability of outdoor venues.\nThey later reached out to officials again a few days ago to reconsider.\nThis month, chatter on the CU campus has centered on the Republican presidential debate coming to the Coors Events Center on Oct. 28 . Students are mobilizing around the idea that just 100 tickets are being made available to the CU community. They say they want more seats in exchange for CU hosting — and paying for — the debate.\nSo far the students' calls have gone unanswered, but they're undeterred and say this issue may have generated early political activism on campus.\n\"A lot of people got really engaged after they figured out that we weren't able to go (to the debate),\" said CU sophomore Stima Walle while waiting in line. \"It's really cool. That's a positive side of it.\"\nThough Walle and her friend Cate Rose are die-hard Sanders fans, they agreed that many of their peers are still formulating their opinions about the candidates.\nThey said these early campaign stops and debates are likely to have a big impact on those undecided voters.\n\"A lot of people still don't really know,\" Rose said. \"I've talked to a lot of friends who are like 'Who's Bernie?' but I think it's definitely growing.\"\nThe promise of tickets to see Sanders even drew a few out-of-towners, such as McKenna Shanholtz, a Colorado State University junior who left Fort Collins at 7 a.m. on Thursday to make sure she got tickets.\n\"We're going to miss the (CSU football) game on Saturday for this,\" she said, \"All of my friends are talking about the game and I'm like 'I'm gonna go to Boulder.'\"\nNearby, Michaela Waisman and her husband Alon Waisman, both 36, waited in line holding their 1-year-old son.\nMichaela Waisman said she was pleasantly surprised to see so many young people waiting in line at 9 a.m. for tickets.\n\"Can you say 'Bernie? Bernie?'\" said Alon Waisman, playing with his baby's hands.\nRussian-born student Dilara Madinger, who is a U.S. citizen, said she wants to hear Sanders speak because so far, she's not impressed with him.\n\"I'm very critical about him,\" she said. \"I think he's popular among Democrats and I'm more comfortable with somebody who has more experience who is going to go in more cool-headed versus shouting.\"\nThe rally is also likely to draw members of older generations, who say they are energized by Sanders' campaign.\n\"He's the closest that I've found to someone who thinks the way I do,\" said Chris Conery, 68.\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/sarahkuta", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28491410/cu-boulder-host-republican-presidential-debate-this-fall", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28879339/outcry-from-cu-boulder-students-about-limited-seating"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:56:32.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
