It ranks the health plans on national standard-of-care measures that involve treatment and prevention of a range of conditions that have significant implications for personal health. Ten of the state's largest HMOs are compared in the report card, and Kaiser Permanente was the only one with the top rating possible for overall clinical-care measures.\nKaiser Permanente Southern California earned top scores in several report-card categories for clinical care. Kaiser Permanente Northern California did as well, earning the only 4-star rating in the state for behavioral and mental health. The 4-star ratings overall and in individual measures mean that Kaiser Permanente performs at or above the 90th percentile on clinical standards of care among health care providers nationally.\n\"These top ratings are another acknowledgement of our relentless commitment to providing affordable, high-quality health care coverage,\" said Patrick Courneya, MD , executive vice president and chief medical officer for Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan. \"We are proud of our ratings and the many physicians, nurses and care teams that help us to achieve total health for the members and communities we serve in California . We encourage consumers to review independent quality ratings like these, so that they can be better informed and even more engaged in their care.\"\nKaiser Permanente in Northern California and Southern California also lead the state in asthma and lung disease care, breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening and diabetes care.\n\"Our tens of thousands of dedicated physicians, nurses, clinicians and care teams strive to put our patients at the center of everything we do,\" said Scott Young, MD , associate executive director, The Permanente Federation, the national organization for nearly 18,000 physicians who provide care to Kaiser Permanente's members. \"And these results from OPA validate that our convenient, quality care is working to keep our patients healthier.\"\nView the full report .\nThe 2015-2016 OPA ratings follow several other recent honors received by Kaiser Permanente:\nKaiser Permanente's Medicare plans in California received a 5-star rating for 2016 , the only health plan in the state to get the top rating from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Three hundred sixty-nine plans were rated, and this was the fifth straight year Kaiser Permanente in California has received 5 stars. Kaiser Permanente Medicare plans in Northern California and Southern California were rated 5 out of 5, according to the NCQA Health Insurance Plan Ratings for 2015-16 . Only nine plans in the nation, out of nearly 400, were rated a 5.
