No matter that SEC Chair Mary Jo White isn’t affiliated with a political party, or that most of America has probably never heard of her. CREDO Action, which typically goes after members of the tea party, is calling for White’s ouster and casting her as a villain for voting with Republicans to reduce some sanctions on companies that have settled claims of rigging markets, lying to customers or other wrongdoing.\nThis campaign against a relatively obscure Washington bureaucrat who was chosen by a Democratic president shows how the anti-bank movement popularized by Occupy Wall Street and Sen. Elizabeth Warren transcends partisan politics — and could already be moving the needle in the 2016 elections. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is planning to release a Wall Street reform plan today that would make it harder for the SEC to allow companies to escape sanctions.\n“In 2016 we'll seek to hold candidates of both parties accountable for their record on Wall Street,” said Becky Bond, political director at San Francisco-based CREDO, which has also launched campaigns against some of Mark Zuckerberg’s political positions and for Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. CREDO launched its super PAC in response to the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision that allowed for unlimited corporate campaign contributions. The PAC doesn’t endorse candidates but fights to defeat those who represent “right-wing interests,” Bond said.\nWith its attack on White, whose term ends in 2019, the group is hoping to stir up populist anger against what until now has been a little-watched regulatory practice. When companies settle charges that they violated SEC rules, they apply for waivers allowing them to continue doing certain lines of business that would otherwise be prohibited. Over the objections of the SEC’s Democrats, White has voted with the SEC’s two Republicans to approve waivers for companies at least 11 times this year.\n2016\nLife in top tier tests Rubio By Daniel Strauss\nBond said the issue caught CREDO’s attention in May when Democratic SEC Commissioner Kara Stein blasted her colleagues for granting waivers to five banks that pleaded guilty to criminal charges of rigging foreign exchange markets. White voted with the Republicans to approve the waivers, which make it easier for companies to do routine market business.\n“The waiver thing just pushed us over the edge,” Bond said. “If we were upset and we just told people, they would be upset about it.”\nWarren fanned the flames in June with a letter accusing White of being too soft on banks that cited the waivers as one piece of evidence.\nCREDO is offering its supporters a phone number that connects randomly to the offices of SEC officials. Callers are given a script that reads in part: “Under Chair Mary Jo White, the SEC routinely gives these companies a waiver, allowing them to get ‘out of jail free.’”\nA spokeswoman for White declined to comment. In a speech in March, White defended the use of waivers, saying they “were never intended to be, and we should not use them as, an additional enforcement tool designed to address misconduct or as an unjustified mechanism for deterring misconduct.\"\nIn response to Warren’s letter, White listed 26 times when the SEC has not granted waivers requested by banks going back to the end of 2013. But specifics beyond those figures are sketchy. In August, SEC Democrat Luis Aguilar said “commissioners lack useful information about these unsuccessful waiver requests.” The SEC declined to provide POLITICO with a list of companies and dates for rebuffed waivers that Aguilar said exists.\nThe campaign against White is just the latest for San Francisco-based CREDO, which has recently taken on the National Rifle Association, pharmaceutical companies and Zuckerberg.\nIn April 2013, CREDO criticized ads favoring the Keystone XL pipeline on the website Zuckerberg started, FWD.us. The company’s fans also protested outside Zuckerberg’s California home in February when he hosted a fundraiser for New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie.\nClinton schedules Q&A with Hispanic business group By Eliza Collins\nCREDO, which used to be called Working Assets, funds its activities by providing mobile phone and data plans that compete with AT&T and Verizon via its network operator, Sprint Corp. Users can direct a portion of their fees toward liberal political causes. \"We are using the revenue from our customers’ mobile phone bills to keep the pressure on White,\" a CREDO spokesman said. In June, CREDO customers gave $87,503 to the Project on Government Oversight, a tax-exempt watchdog group that has criticized White and also called for Obama to replace her.\nCREDO’s super PAC, which targets tea party candidates in a handful of states, has already raised $27,240 for 2016, putting it in line with other interest-group PACs at this point in the campaign cycle. The bulk of its cash comes from donations of less than $22 per individual, the group said. CREDO raised $4.1 million in 2012.\nObservers say political pressure from Congressional Democrats and liberal groups like CREDO has already had an effect on similar requests for waivers from the Labor Department, which granted all 23 requests from 1997 as of last year, according to congressional Democrats. Three of the five banks that pleaded guilty in May — the same banks that got SEC waivers — have been tentatively denied Labor Department waivers, which they need to continue managing assets for pension funds.\n“Waivers have become a political football at the expense of shareholders,” said Bradley Bondi, who previously worked for a Republican SEC Commissioner and is now a partner at law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel. “No one could have anticipated based on past practices that the DOL and SEC would apply this additional level of scrutiny. There is a serious concern about fair notice to the companies.”\nLater this month, executives from Swiss banking giant UBS AG are scheduled to meet at the Labor Department to argue for a waiver. Citigroup is also facing scrutiny from the Labor Department over a waiver request. CREDO wants the Department to deny those waivers.\nWhoever wins the White House, “we'll be ready to challenge the people they put in charge of key financial regulatory agencies to ensure that the SEC, Treasury, FCC and other regulators represent the people, not corporate interests,” Bond said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:04:05.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
