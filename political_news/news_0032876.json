Simpson murder trial. It had it all: A former football star charged with killing his ex-wife and her friend. A slow-speed police chase seen by millions on TV that involved the defendant and a white Ford Bronco. And a defense attorney (Johnnie Cochran, Jr.) who famously said about a leather glove, \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\" And so Simpson was let go. No wonder the Los Angeles court spectacle was dubbed \"Trial of the Century.\"\nThe trial lasted almost a year and was covered in its entirety by AP Special Correspondent Linda Deutsch. She had reported many sensational trials — Charles Manson, Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan, Patty Hearst and the officers charged in the Rodney King beating — and so it wasn't a surprise that a judge made her the pool reporter. She appeared on television every day to summarize what had transpired. (After the trial ended, Simpson tracked down Deutsch while she was vacationing and called to give his side of the story. It was the first of several exclusive interviews over the ensuing years.)\nTwenty years later after the trial ended in acquittal, the AP is making a version of the story available along with photos.\nO.J. Simpson went home a free man Tuesday, spared by an unpredictable jury to pick up a life of privilege instead of a life in prison. Acquitted of murdering his ex-wife and her friend, he pledged to track down the real killers who are \"out there somewhere.\"\nIn a courtroom on the verge of exploding with emotion, a hush fell as Judge Lance Ito's clerk, Dierdre Robertson, read the two words: \"Not guilty.\"\nSimpson smiled, mouthed the words, \"Thank you,\" at the jury, then clasped his hands together. Lead attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., standing behind Simpson, slapped him on the back and laid his forehead on his shoulder. Attorney Shawn Chapman cried and clutched jury consultant Jo-Ellan Dimitrius' hand.\nTears of anguish and shouts of joy burst from the three families whose lives were torn apart by the bloody June 12, 1994, slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.\n\"Oh my God!\" exclaimed Simpson's grown daughter, Arnelle, embracing her brother Jason.\n\"We did it!\" a family member exulted to lead defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.\nEerily, the Simpson saga ended much as it had begun, with the fallen football superstar being transported in a white van to his estate while news helicopters tracked him overhead. Tuesday's televised verdicts were the most-watched event since June 17, 1994, when Simpson, in a white Bronco with his friend Al \"A.C.\" Cowlings driving, led police on a surreal slow-speed chase viewed by millions.\nCowlings was at the door to embrace Simpson when he arrived home an hour after the verdicts were read. Later, family members gathered for a champagne party on the lawn of Simpson's lush estate.\nFlorists, caterers and musicians pulled up to the house and told reporters they were there for a celebration.\nThe gaiety stood in marked contrast to the solemn mood in the district attorney's offices.\n\"Last June 13, '94 (the day he learned of his son's death), was the worst nightmare of my life. This is the second,\" Goldman's father, Fred, said at a prosecution news conference. \"This prosecution team didn't lose today. I deeply believe this country lost today. Justice was not served.\"\nAt a defense team news conference, Cochran insisted the issue of race, which he played heavily in the trial, did not overcome the facts.\n\"This verdict speaks justice,\" Cochran said. \"This was a case based upon the evidence.\"\nHe denied playing \"the race card,\" saying instead that credibility had won out.\n\"Race plays a part in everything in America,\" he said. \"But this stuff about playing a race card is preposterous.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:46:06.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
