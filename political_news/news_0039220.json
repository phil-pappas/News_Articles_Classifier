Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Misa Han Labor leader Bill Shorten has invited the government to go right ahead with proposed changes to penalty rates and promised to make it a central issue at the next federal election.\nMr Shorten accepted the challenge mounted by the new Workplace Relations Minister Michaelia Cash and the Minister for Finance Senator Mathias Cormann to ask voters on the issue of weekend and public holiday penalty rates.\n\"In recent days, the new Workplace Relations Minister, Michaelia Cash, and the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, key lieutenants of Malcolm Turnbull, have said they want to have a political argument, they want to have an election fought on penalty rates.\n\"I want to say today, we accept the challenge,\" Mr Shorten told reporters on Monday, which was a public holiday in NSW, the ACT, Queensland and South Australia.\nDigital media assistant Crystal Egan decided to take Labor Day off because she would not be getting any penalty rates. Supplied \"We accept the Liberal challenge about penalty rates being an election issue,\" he said.\nAhead of the long weekend, Ms Cash said she expected the Turnbull government to take workplace reforms to the election , including changes to penalty rates. She said penalty rates \"certainly seem to deter weekend work.\"\nMeanwhile, in Victoria small business owners said opening their business over its new long weekend was a financial failure because they were forced to pay waiters, baristas and kitchen hands over $50 an hour.\nHowever, Mr Shorten said penalty rates did not lead to unemployment.\n \"The truth of the matter is what causes unemployment in Australia is the inability of the Liberal Government in Canberra to transition Australia out of the mining boom.\n\"What is causing unemployment in this country is a lack of confidence, is a slow down in what is happening in China. What causes unemployment is a decrease in mining prices or prices of minerals,\" he said.\n\"It is really unfair to say that a 50 or 60-year-old worker, working in Myer or David Jones on a Sunday, because they are getting penalty rates, is causing unemployment in Australia.\"\nCrystal Egan, a digital media assistant, used to volunteer to work on public holidays for the lucrative penalty rates when she was a bartender.\n\"Whenever I was working casual, they would just ask if you wanted to work. I always tell them I'm available on public holidays because I prefer to work on those for the penalty rates.\"\nShe said workers with fewer family responsibilities were more likely to work on public holidays. \"It's probably more for people with less responsibility because if they had family, it would be hard.\"\nWithout penalty rates there would be no incentive to work on a public holiday, she said.\n\"I was told that I could work today but I wouldn't get any penalty rates, so even though I have a s--t load of work I have to do I'm going to lump it on my day tomorrow as opposed to working on a public holiday without getting any penalty rates.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:04:21.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
