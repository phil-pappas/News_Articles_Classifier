GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz (CHAY'-fits) of Utah says the videos won't be publicly released now — \"to ensure the safety and security of all individuals recorded.\" \nThe committee subpoenaed the videos last month. It's one of several committees investigating whether Planned Parenthood has illegally sold fetal tissue for profit. \nAbortion foes say the organization did. \nPlanned Parenthood says it's broken no laws and that videos previously released by the activists were deceptively edited. \nPlanned Parenthood is warning that the videos given to Congress also may be altered. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:40:00.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
