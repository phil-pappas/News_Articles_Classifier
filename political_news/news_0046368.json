She's meeting behind closed doors with investigators Friday. Clinton herself is scheduled to appear before the Benghazi panel next Thursday in a widely anticipated public hearing.\nThe Benghazi panel is under intense scrutiny after two House Republicans described it as partisan and aimed at hurting Clinton's presidential bid. That's a characterization the committee's chairman rejects.\nAbedin is vice chairwoman of Clinton's campaign and was a top aide when Clinton served as secretary of state and U.S. senator from New York.\nThe panel interviewed Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan last month.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
