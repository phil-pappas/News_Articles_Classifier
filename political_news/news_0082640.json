By Max Miceli Oct. 5, 2015 | 11:48 a.m. EDT + More Only a few days after a school shooting in Roseberg, Oregon, left 10 people dead, Northern Californian authorities arrested four male high school students in Tuolumne for plotting a shooting of their own.\nAccording to an AP report , the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Department said Saturday that no one was hurt because the plan was still in its beginning stages.\nRELATED\nClinton Pushing New Gun Controls After Oregon Shooting Sheriff Jim Mele said the plot was \"very detailed in nature and included the names of victims, locations and methods in which the plan was to be carried out.\"\nA few days prior to the arrest, fellow Summerville High School students reported suspicious activities to school staff, and the suspects were ultimately removed from campus Wednesday before ultimately being arrested for conspiracy to commit an assault with deadly weapons.\n\"They were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible at the campus,\" Mele told NBC news affiliate KCRA . \" [Other students' ] willingness to get involved and report what they saw prevented what well could have been another needless tragedy.\"\nAccording to ABC news affiliate KXTV , as each student was identified he was taken off campus and his parents were contacted.\nMele told KCRA the suspects admitted to their plans for a mass shooting , which was to take place during a school event . Deputies did not recover any weapons while searching the students' homes, but found written plans and took electronic devices as evidence. \"It is clear from past history, such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, as well as other recent events in Oregon, that children are willing and capable of planning and carrying out acts of violence against fellow students and teachers on school grounds,\" Tuolumne County assistant district attorney Eric Hovatter told KCRA. \"While it is easy to say 'that can never happen in Tuolumne County,' the public and local law enforcement must be vigilant, as they were here.\"\nTAGS: school shootings", "external_links": ["http://www.kcra.com/news/4-students-arrested-in-school-shooting-plot/35638052", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Police%20Arrest%204%20Teens%20in%20Mass%20Shooting%20Conspiracy", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/10/04/students-arrested-shooting-plot/73325610/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Police%20Arrest%204%20Teens%20in%20Mass%20Shooting%20Conspiracy", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/4-teens-arrested-in-alleged-shooting-plot-at-high-school/2015/10/04/b597269e-6a51-11e5-bdb6-6861f4521205_story.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Police%20Arrest%204%20Teens%20in%20Mass%20Shooting%20Conspiracy&summary=Northern%20California%20teens%20caught%20after%20fellow%20students%20reported%20suspicious%20activity.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwrho%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:31:42.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
