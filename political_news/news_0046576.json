Security Council that called for the global body to deploy international observers at the holy site after a series of clashes at the compound between Palestinian worshippers and Israeli forces.\nParis put forward the measure with the aim of maintaining the status quo at the site as it is viewed by both sides of the conflict as one of the main reasons for the latest outbreak in violence. The proposal would need to be approved by all 15 members of the executive body of the global organization in order to be put into effect.\nAccording to The Times of Israel , Patrick Maisonnave, the French ambassador to Israel, met with the foreign ministry's head of International Organizations division, Aharon Leshno-Yaar, and deputy director-general of the ministry's Europe Division, Aviv Shir-On, on Monday morning.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nachshon said the diplomats exchanged frank words and the Israeli officials expressed their opposition to the French proposal.\n\"Israel is opposed to all moves that affect its vital interests that are not coordinated with it and are drawn up without its involvement,\" the spokesman said.\nNachson said that Maisonnave told the Israeli officials that Paris was proposing ideas because of the \"continued stalemate in the peace process.\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the proposal at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, as it did not criticize Palestinian actions.\n\"Israel cannot accept the French draft at the Security Council,\" Netanyahu said, according to The Times of Israel . \"It doesn't mention Palestinian incitement, it doesn't mention Palestinian terrorism, and it calls for the internationalization of the Temple Mount.\"\nOn Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also voiced his opposition to the deployment of an international, neutral force in Jerusalem's Old City.\n\"We don't contemplate any change, but nor does Israel,\" Kerry told reporters at a news conference in Madrid. \"Israel understands the importance of that status quo. What is important is to make sure everybody understands what that means.\n\"We are not seeking some new change. We are not seeking outsiders or others to come in [to the Temple Mount]. We need to have clarity.\"\nIn the growing unrest over the site, amid other deeply-rooted political issues, knife and shooting attacks committed by Palestinians have killed eight Israelis and wounded dozens. More than 40 Palestinians, including a number of attackers, have also been killed by Israeli forces during the unrest in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nRelated Interview: Jerusalem Mayor Says Security Forces in Holy City Adapting to New Form of Attacks Nir Barkat on how Israeli forces are adapting to Palestinian knife attacks.
