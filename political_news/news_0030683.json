This stunning and free interactive show, entitled 'LightWeight' and run by Huddersfield-based Impossible Theatre, will take audience participation to new heights, creating live animations that swarm around the globe alongside movies, audio, graphic effects, text and even Tweets! Then on Saturday (10 October) a stunning band of illuminated dancing drummers will perform two shows at 7pm and 9pm entitled 'Spark!' Combining drums, dynamic choreography and beautiful lighting design the performance also involves the audience. The show gradually builds in intensity culminating in a huge climax of light, sound, smoke and movement! This weekend's stunning shows are the latest events in Blackpool Illuminations' new LightPool project, which is revolutionising the display with new creative content and shows throughout the town centre. Cllr Gillian Campbell, Deputy Leader of Blackpool Council, said: 'We've got a vast array of exciting shows which are perfect for all the family that are coming to Blackpool as part of LightPool. 'The two shows this weekend are both interactive and exciting and I hope lots of people will be able to go along and take part.' Artistic Director of LeftCoast, Michael Trainor, said: 'The shows this weekend give two contrasting experiences which we think audiences are going to love. From the serenity and ingenuity of LightWeight on Friday evening to the up tempo drumming of Spark! on Saturday this is sure to be a real highlight.' And Coastal Communities Minister Mark Francois said: 'I am delighted we have been able to support Blackpool Illuminations through a £2m grant from the Coastal Communities Fund. 'This investment will help boost the local economy and the Northern Powerhouse. We are committed to help drive investment in the north and helping our seaside communities thrive.' LightPool is funded through a £2m grant from the Coastal Communities Fund along with contributions from Blackpool Council and LeftCoast. The 'LightWeight' and 'Spark!' shows follow a fantastic start to the LightPool shows last weekend with 'Bicycle Ballet' - which saw performers wow the crowds with dance and physical theatre, comedy and striking soundtracks - all on bikes! They were followed by a series of poetry readings to mark National Poetry Day on Thursday (8 October). The next events will see Circus acts and street artists perform on Friday 16 and Saturday 17 October, while illuminated umbrella parades will lead people from the Promenade in to Birley Street on Friday 23 and Saturday 24 October. The festival of acts will finish with two special live music sessions on Friday 30 and Saturday 31 October. All the events will be free to attend, although some of the Brilliance sessions will require booking. For more details and performance times, visit www.visitblackpool.com/lightpool.
