That’s a substantial drop from the 80 percent who said they’d vote for her in April, which is the last time the Wason Center for Public Policy asked about her. \nThe numbers are consistent with other polls that show her declining as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) picks up support and Democrats anticipate the possible candidacy of Vice President Biden. Going into the Democrats’ first debate Tuesday night on CNN, Sanders takes 23 percent of the vote, as does Biden. \nQuentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport and director of the poll, said the numbers show voters are hesitating on Clinton. \n“While she continues to lead, the fact that Sanders’s campaign and Biden’s potential candidacy have cut her lead in half shows that they are looking seriously at alternatives,” he said. \nOn the crowded Republican side, billionaire real estate mogul Trump leads with 23 percent, according to the poll. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is on his heels with 17 percent, followed by Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) with 14 percent and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 13 percent. \nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush registers 9 percent in the survey. \nWhen asked how they feel about all candidates seeking the presidency in both parties, voters surveyed give Trump the highest unfavorable rating — 61 percent — and a favorable rating of 30 percent. \nBiden performs the best with a favorable rating of 46 percent, while Carson comes in second, at 44 percent. Next is Clinton who has a 39 percent favorable rating, but an unfavorable rating of 53 percent, according to the poll. \nOfficials in both parties have said Virginia is key to their eventual nominee’s path to the White House, and candidates are making regular trips to the state. Trump is planning to be in Richmond on Wednesday night for a rally. [ Hillary Clinton to rally supporters with McAuliffe in Northern Virginia ] \nClinton will hold a rally in Northern Virginia on Oct. 23 with Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close friend and chairman of her 2008 bid for the White House. That same day, Bush will attend a forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach with its founder, television evangelist Pat Robertson. \nThe poll found that Virginia voters are engaged in the presidential contest five months ahead of the state’s March 1 primary. \nNearly half of voters say they’ve given “quite a lot” of thought to the election and 84 percent are following news about the candidates at least “somewhat closely.” \nThe Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University surveyed 1,067 registered Virginia voters from Sept. 29 to Oct. 8. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Jenna Portnoy covers Virginia politics for The Washington Post. local Success!
