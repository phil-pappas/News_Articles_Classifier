He was 85.\nParr was in charge of Reagan's detail on March 30, 1981, when a young man with mental problems, John Hinckley Jr., shot the president as he left the Washington Hilton.\nReagan didn't appear to be wounded, but Parr ordered the presidential limousine to George Washington Hospital when blood appeared on Reagan's lips. As it turned out, the president had been hit and was bleeding internally. Doctors later said that any delay would have been fatal.\nIn a statement Friday, former first lady Nancy Reagan called Parr \"one of my true heroes.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
