We find out what lies ahead for the senior JD(U) leader post the Assembly polls.\nBirth Stars\nNitish Kumar has a very strong chart with a planetary exchange between the 9th House Lord Saturn and the 4th House Lord Mercury. This creates a fortunate Raja Yoga in his Chart. Adding to this, in his Chart, the exalted Venus is placed in the 10th House. Further, the placement of Mercury in his 9th House (of Fortune) makes Kumar good at logical and analytical skills. Mercury, incidentally, is also the ruling planet in Nitish Kumar’s Chart, as he is born with the Gemini Ascendant. But Mercury may also be held responsible for giving a whimsical and wavering streak to Nitish.\nThe Mahadasha\nCurrently, Nitish Kumar is passing through the Rahu Mahadasha and Jupiter Bhukti.\nThe Troubling Dots\nIn the senior leader’s Chart, Rahu is placed with the 10th House Lord Jupiter as well as the Sun. This may cause various problems for him. Adding to this, the transiting Ketu is currently moving through the 10th House in his Chart. This intensifies the whole situation in his professional life, tilting it towards a negative bent. Also, the CM of Bihar is currently passing through a mid phase of Sade Sati, which may also cause problems for him.\nGreatest Electoral Battle?\nThe strong man from Bihar, thus, will be facing a major challenge in these elections. In fact, it is likely that these polls will prove to be the toughest electoral battle of his life. Nitish Kumar may have to deal with confusion and also some discontentment within his party. Owing to the planetary afflictions, his relations with his allies will remain strained and the growing unrest within his own party and allies may not allow him to achieve the success that he desires.\nJupiter’s blessings for mass connect\nHowever, the transiting Jupiter is moving in Nitish Kumar’s favour. So he is likely to get the support of voters, particularly during the first and second phase of voting. The Nitish-led JD(U) will emerge as the most favoured party within the alliance, however it may not be able to win the expected number of seats.\nLucky Phase\nMoon will be passing through the Vishakha Nakshatra on the day of polling, in the second phase of voting for Bihar Assembly. In this phase, the balance of fortunes may somewhat tilt in favour of the Grand Alliance.\nThe Downside\nHowever, as the Assembly Polls progress in the phase-wise manner, good times may leave the Bihar CM’s side, to some extent. The polling days’ stars for phases 3, 4 and 5 may not be very favourable for him.\nThe D-Day\nOn the designated counting date, the transiting Moon will be passing through the Hasta Nakshatra in conjunction with Venus, Mars and Rahu. The transiting Sun will be in Vishakha Nakshatra on this date. All these planetary influences seem to be more favourable for the BJP and NDA.\n sunday chronicle Nitish Kumar Bihar Assembly election Also Read BJP assails 'immoral' alliance between JD(U), RJD Fitness on the go JMM holds talk with Nitish, Lalu to join secular alliance ‘Chandra’view of talent!", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/NITISH%20%286%29_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/NITISH%20%286%29_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/commentary-sunday-chronicle/article/nitish-face-his-toughest-battle-yet", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:34:08.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
