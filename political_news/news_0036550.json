The popularity of Donald Trump's current run for the Republican presidential nomination and the History Channel's miniseries, \"The Men Who Built America,\" are recent examples of this fixation, favoring a type of democracy that allows for market fundamentalism as a way for the United States to relieve all its needs and problems. Visit the Rockefeller Foundation's website and you will notice the promotion of a new investment opportunity called social impact bonds (SIBs) (also known as \"pay for success\" or \"social innovation financing\"), which, according to Lynn Stuart Parramore's critique of such schemes, are currently being hyped by proponents \"as an 'innovative' way of linking private investors, nonprofits and government to deliver social services with demonstrable outcomes\" (Parramore, 2014, p. 1). Social impact bonds are not really true bonds, but rather \"pay out in relation to a set of agreed upon metrics that are established when creating the fund\" (Kaye, 2013, p. 3). Under this model, private investors provide funding in the form of a bond to a service provider who agrees to deliver services to a targeted population. By providing the initial funding, the investor agrees to take on the financial risk that is usually taken on by the government agency. An intermediary organization oversees the development, implementation and assessment of the program. If the program is deemed a success, as defined in accordance to predetermined outcomes or benchmarks, the government agency reimburses the investor (Tran, 2014). In theory, the government agency is able to pay the investors with savings that are incurred through success of the program. For example, if a program that is designed to reduce recidivism rates is successful, then the money saved in not paying for a prison stay is passed on to the investor. As Kerwin Kaye states, \"At a time when the state has difficulty funding even those projects which already have an established record in reducing costs, social impact bonds present themselves as a risk-free way to generate additional revenue streams in order to achieve social goals\" (Kaye, 2013, p. 3). Within this language of using the free market to cure social ills lies an attempt to depoliticize the real causes of our social problems. Proponents of such models endorse the idea that the government is not equipped to fix complex social problems such as homelessness, juvenile delinquency and chronic unemployment, and that existing social services do little to remedy underlying causes of such issues. They state that these social problems impose huge costs to governments and taxpayers, and that using social impact bonds is an innovative way of \"harnessing private capital to achieve measurable gains on some of the most persistent social ills\" (Pettus, 2013). The idea is that measurable gains will be made because under the current system of \"non-competition\" social service agencies are not innovated. By tying payment to success, agencies will compete, thus, ideally, stimulating innovation (Collins, 2011). A competitive environment \"theoretically\" will lead to having \"better value for the money and more efficient service-provisions\" (Collins, 2011, p. 19). Within this framework, state agencies are viewed as being incapable of being innovated because of their \"bureaucratic and 'risk-adverse' nature, promoting instead the idea that SIBs will allow 'social entrepreneurs' to gain access to the capital they need to put their ideas into action\" (Kaye, 2013, p. 5). This is taken from the political cult. What a crock. These men are not capable of helping; they are only capable of choosing what they want to save and what they want to end. Government, the US constitution, makes all men equal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:32:06.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
