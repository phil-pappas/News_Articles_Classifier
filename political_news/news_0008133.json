He said he has also lost 4 aunts to breast cancer and acknowledges the role it plays in his family. This is Breast Cancer Awareness month, so he is allowed to wear pink gear like wrist bands and shoes while playing, but the NFL said he couldn't wear pink the rest of the year to continue to raise awareness for breast cancer. What the hell? He should just wear pink shoes anyway, and tell those creeps to go mind their own business. Nothing wrong with pink anyway. Good job, NFL.
