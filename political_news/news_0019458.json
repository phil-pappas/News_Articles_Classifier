Additional photos and more below. Courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office Earlier this week, we told you about the arrest of ten foreign nationals after law enforcers found two illegal marijuana grows on federal land along Colorado's Western Slope.\nNow, the U.S. Attorney's Office reveals that these busts were two of six grows taken down on federal or private land in just the past month-and-a-half — an average of one per week.\nTotal arrests in the assorted operations: 32.\nThe office cites a \"wave of illicit marijuana cultivation\" and stresses that the actions of the U.S. Attorney's Office, completed in conjunction with local and state agencies, are in keeping with the directives contained in what's known as the Cole memo .\nAssistant Attorney General James Cole testifying before Congress in 2013. YouTube In that August 2013 document, which we've included below, assistant attorney general James Cole confirmed that federal agencies would allow legal recreational marijuana sales in Colorado, as sanctioned by the passage of Amendment 64 the previous years. However, the feds would continue other marijuana enforcement, focused on the following five areas:\n• Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;\n• Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;\n• Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;\n• Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and\n• Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. The breakup of illegal grows on federal land hasn't resulted in an outcry from the marijuana industry. Indeed, legal ganjapreneurs no doubt cheer such operations, since they remove black market marijuana from the pipeline, thereby providing less competition for cannabis grown properly under Colorado law.\nDon't be surprised if we hear about more raids against illegal grows on federal land. In a statement, U.S. Attorney John Walsh says, “These joint federal-state law enforcement actions against large illicit marijuana grows represent a new phase in the challenges facing law enforcement after Colorado’s legalization and regulation of marijuana under state law. Illegal activity of this kind underscores the need for strong, joint law enforcement efforts by federal and state authorities to identify, cut off and destroy the efforts of drug trafficking organizations to use Colorado as a ‘source state’ for export of illegal marijuana around the country. State and local authorities deserve our appreciation and support for their efforts on the ground to team up with federal authorities on this critically important effort to keep Colorado safe.”\nLook below to see U.S. Attorney's Office photos and descriptions of each raid, including the two we noted earlier this week, followed by the Cole memo.\nRelated Stories Anti-Pot Group Prediction Coming True?: Illegal Grow Bust of 10 Foreign Nationals Courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office Pike National Forest, August 19th, in the Green Mountain Area in Jefferson County, investigation is ongoing.\nLaw Enforcement Officers from the U.S. Forest Service, Department of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the Colorado National Guard Joint Counter Drug Task Force joined together to complete an eradication of an illegal marijuana grow site in the Pike National Forest.
