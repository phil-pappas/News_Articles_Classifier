To say otherwise is barely credible.\nShare article \"The fiscal charter gives the UK government flexibility to increase spending. That's not our words but the words of Nicola Sturgeon earlier in the summer.\n\"The First Minister is contradicting herself and must be rattled after a week when her party's social justice credentials have been left in tatters after the revelations about her business spokeswoman profiteering from desperate families losing their homes.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:39:57.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
