Photo: William Wegman for Max Mara\nEven if you don't recognize the name William Wegman , you probably recognize his dogs. He's photographed them repeatedly, even dressing them in Max Mara 's classic double-breasted camel coats for the brand's 50-year anniversary. Now, just in time for fall, those photos of his Weimaraners in cashmere and wool are traveling to nine different cities. The exhibition — aptly titled \"Dogs in Coats\" — covers everywhere from San Francisco to Toronto to Waikiki, and kicked off in New York last night at Max Mara's Madison Avenue location. In attendance at the opening: Wegman himself, plus three Weimaraners (Chip, Penny, and Candy).\nMax Mara is also rereleasing 30 limited-edition versions of the 101801 coats in their original silhouette, which will come with exclusive postcards of Wegman's photos. If the coats look that sophisticated and elegant on the dogs, imagine how great they'll look styled with boots and a turtleneck. Click through the slideshow to see them worn by both Weimaraners and humans at last night's opening.\nBEGIN SLIDESHOW", "external_links": ["http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/visit-to-william-wegmans-home-studio.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:16:28.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
