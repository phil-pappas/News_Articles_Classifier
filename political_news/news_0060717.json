Unfortunately, the genetic mutations that make your gut bacteria resistant to drugs, also provide resistance to antibiotics needed to stop infections and that broad resistance to antibiotics can spread to pathogens that then become the dreaded superbugs.\nHere are the simple facts that I have discussed at length in another post:\nStatins were antibiotics that were repurposed to lower LDL, “bad cholesterol.”\nAspirin was an antibiotic that was shown to relieve pain and inflammation.\nMetformin was an antibiotic that later proved useful for treatment of diabetes.\nMany chemotherapy drugs are antibiotics developed for cancer treatment.\nDiuretics were antibiotics that indirectly reduce blood pressure.\nAntidepressants, such as Prozac, Zoloft, etc. are antibiotics.\nCommon Drugs Are Actually Antibiotics\nMost pharmaceuticals are derived from phytochemicals, a.k.a antioxidants, adapted in plants to kill microorganisms, i.e. as natural antibiotics. It is not surprising that drugs = antibiotics. What is surprising is that people assume that if antibiotics are labeled with some other activity, that they cease to be antibiotics. All drugs are also antibiotics and that is why a major side effect of most medicines is upset gut bacteria.\nOveruse of Common Drugs Produces Superbugs\nSimply put, common medicines you swallow, kill bacteria in your bowels. Some bacteria survive and are called “drug resistant.” Bacteria accumulate resistances to several different kinds of drugs and are called “multidrug resistant.” As might be expected, hospitals are the breeding grounds for multidrug resistant, mutant bacteria of all different types. Unfortunately, anyone who takes several types of medications is also a source for multidrug resistant bacteria, so nursing homes are the most frequent sources of superbugs that cause outbreaks of hospital infections.\nThe Only Way to Stop Superbugs is to Use Less Drugs\nThe bottom line is that even if doctors start to use antibiotics more rationally and antibiotic use in agriculture is eliminated, superbugs will still be a big problem, because they will be produced by excessive use of common drugs, i.e. those found on the shelves of drug stores and supermarkets, as well as prescribed by doctors.\nThe only solution to the superbug problem is to reduce pharmaceutical use by 99%.\nRead more here.", "external_links": ["http://coolinginflammation.blogspot.com/2015/08/common-medicines-make-superbugs-not.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:35:01.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
