Louie Gohmert (AP photo) Texas lawmakers demand removal of Planned Parenthood founder's bust 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nA group of conservative congressmen, including nine from Texas, is joining with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz to demand that the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., remove a bust of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger.In a letter dated Friday, the group of 24 House Republicans accused Sanger, an early contraception pioneer, of holding values \"deeply antithetical to the very values most Americans hold dear\" by advocating for the need to limit births by poor people who can't afford children.The letter comes amid a flurry of congressional investigations into the national women's health network, which has come under fire in a series of hidden camera videos alleging illegal sales of fetal tissue.Planned Parenthood officials have denied the charges, which also have prompted efforts by Cruz and other congressional Republicans to risk a government shutdown to deny the group federal funding.Sanger's bust is on display in the \"Struggle for Justice\" exhibit at the Portrait Gallery, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution.Cruz, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, released the letter on Tuesday, along with a statement saying that Sanger's bust represents \"hatred, racism and the destruction of unborn life.\"The other Texas lawmakers signing on to the removal demand are: Louie Gohmert, Brian Babin, Kevin Brady, Blake Farenthold, Kenny Marchant, Randy Neugebauer, John Ratcliffe, Randy Weber and Roger Williams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:34:06.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
