The flurry of public meetings is as much about party building as anything else. \n\"These are really energizing, engaging things,\" Murray said. \nSixty-four delegates will be chosen in April's primary election. The state Central Committee will pick the rest at a public meeting in May. \nGreg Pecoraro has helped orchestrate Maryland's Democratic delegate outreach meetings for every presidential cycle since 1992. \n\"I've got the miles on my car to prove it,\" he said. \nPecoraro said the Democratic National Committee requires the state to make sure the delegation has enough women, minorities and geographic diversity in its ranks. While the party doesn't have \"quotas\" per se, Pecoraro said, the state's party leaders have to work with candidates to make sure the delegation reflect the state. \n\"It involves a lot of work with the campaigns, saying 'Here are the goals for Maryland and how can you help us make slates that reflect that?'\" \nThis year, the outreach meetings have taken on another dimension because the Democratic National Convention will be held in Philadelphia, Murray said. A convention within driving distance for Maryland Democrats has heightened interest in attendance â€” both as delegates and as observers. \nMurray said he's already been asked about whether the state will bus people to the convention, to be held in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:37:45.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
