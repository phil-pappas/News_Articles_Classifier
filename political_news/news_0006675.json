Biden’s political future, but officials on Monday suggested that it may be time for the vice president to make a decision as more of the country’s attention turns to the 2016 presidential race. \nRumors continue to swirl that Mr. Biden will announce over the next 48 hours whether he’ll seek the White House. White House Josh Earnest wouldn’t say much about Mr. Biden’s intentions, but he did hint that now is the time to decide. \n“I think everybody understands what the stakes are. Primarily, people understand this is an intensely personal decision for anybody to make,” Mr. Earnest told reporters. “We are into the fall, and that’s when more of the country’s attention and more of the debate focuses on who the next president might be. But ultimately, this will be a decision for the vice president to make.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:35:20.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
