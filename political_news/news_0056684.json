(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) October 11 at 6:53 PM In his Oct. 7 op-ed, “ How the NRA can help ,” Jeffrey Zalles proposed having the National Rifle Association license ammunition buyers, putting serial numbers on ammunition and recording every sale to keep ammunition out of the hands of criminals. Licensing is an inherently governmental function that can’t be contracted out. Licensing and related background checks would require a massive infrastructure across the nation. It would require a massive central database storing personal information. How much would this cost, and who would pay?\nMost of the estimated one-third of Americans who own guns would oppose licensing, so this proposal will not become law. Without licensing, the proposals to add serial numbers to ammunition and record licenses and serial numbers at retail points-of-sale are moot.\nEven if implemented, Mr. Zalles’s ideas would not stop criminals from using guns. Criminals would steal ammunition or buy it on the inevitable black market. This is not the silver bullet to end violence.\nEdward Wyse , Springfield", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/one-three-americans-own-guns-culture-factor-study-finds-n384031"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:08:51.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
