The NDC said by holding an event to discuss the views of various political parties on the register, the IEA was trying to usurp the powers of the Electoral Commission (EC). \nIn a statement, the party said the EC would be the only constitutionally mandated institution to collate views about the current voter’s register. \nHowever, the CPP Youth Organiser said the excuses being put forward by the ruling party is only a smokescreen. \n“The NDC didn’t just run away from the IEA debate, they are running away from virtually every debate. When you have a political party that is no longer interested in listening to the people; in voicing the concerns of the people, it is because they know they have a voters’ register they can manipulate,” he asserted. \nHe adds that comments by President John Mahama and other members of the party is further proof of NDC’s complacency. \n“You have a President who goes about and tells the people who voted for him that he is a dead goat. The only reason why the President would muster courage say this to the people of Ghana would be because we have a voters’ register that is not credible and irrespective of what the people think, the voters’ register is under the full manipulation of one political party, the NDC,” Ernesto Yeboah said. \nThe CPP Youth Organiser insists a new voter's register must be compiled. \nMeanwhile, the IEA says the NDC lost an opportunity to present its views to Ghanaians on the controversial debate on the electoral register by opting out of the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:19:25.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
