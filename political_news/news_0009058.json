My wife and I are raising our children here because it represents the best of what New York has to offer - diversity, cultural vibrancy and a rich history. My neighbors have a passion and energy that is unmatched. We need to bring their important voices to Washington – and I pledge to do all I can to make sure everyone in this community can achieve their dreams .\"\nClyde's 20-year career in public service includes work for Presidents Clinton and Obama, the development of successful public-private sector partnerships nationally and within the district, and extensive knowledge of federal programs that affect urban communities. He was a candidate for this seat in 2012, garnering strong endorsements from the NY Times and Daily News .\nFollowing the 2008 election, Clyde served as the National Political Director of the Democratic National Committee, where he and his wife, Mona Sutphen (who served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff to President Obama), were instrumental in furthering President Obama's national agenda.\nClyde moved to Harlem and served as Domestic Policy Advisor at the Clinton Foundation, where he designed and implemented Harlem-based and national programs focused on economic empowerment and education. His signature partnership- the Harlem Small Business Initiative – successfully fostered and expanded small businesses in Harlem. This program has since been replicated and expanded nationally. During the Clinton Administration, he also served in the White House and as Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAs Clyde explained, \"We need effective leadership and fresh ideas to tackle the issues facing residents across our community – affordable housing, expanding education and training opportunities, improved access to healthcare, and innovation to address persistent public safety issues. I can hit the ground running on Day One to deliver results for this District .\"\nOver the past few months, Clyde has traveled the entire district, talking to residents in Washington Heights , East Harlem, Central Harlem, Inwood , Kingsbridge, Norwood and Bedford Park about their hopes, fears, and biggest challenges. Time and again, he heard that residents are hungry for new leadership – less talk and more effective action – and a real desire to turn the page on the corruption and mismanagement of the past.\n\" People are fed up with a political machine that has failed to deliver for the residents of this community . For too long, politicians representing Upper Manhattan and the Bronx have put their own interests over the people they represent – letting problems fester for decades. We need real leadership to deliver real results,\" said Clyde.\nFor this community to be able to meet the challenges of the future, we need leaders that will expand the political process - not politicians who try to crowd out voices to retain power.\nAs Clyde stated, \"For me, this race is about working with residents across this district to develop new, comprehensive solutions to our problems - housing, education, public safety, health care. Some of my opponents see this seat as their birthright or a prize for years of ineffective governing. Not me. I want to share my vision for the future, listen to the ideas and challenges facing people here, and earn the trust of voters in the 13 th district. \"\nFor additional inquires, please contact Ty Steinhauser at ty@clyde2016.com\nContact:\nTy Steinhauser\n917-232-8681\nClyde Williams for Congress 2016\nty@clyde2016.com\nClyde2016.com\n releases/clyde-williams-formally-jumps-into-race-for-ny-13-congressional-seat-300161897.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clyde-williams-formally-jumps-into-race-for-ny-13-congressional-seat-300161897.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC31644&Transmission_Id=201510191015PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC31644&DateId=20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:41:52.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
