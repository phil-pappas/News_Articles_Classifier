Republicans say they're aiming for a supermajority of 74. That would remove a Democratic check on tax and spending bills, which require 60 percent of votes to pass. Arnold won office representing Prentiss and Alcorn counties in 2011. Now Democrat Lauren Childers, daughter of former U.S. Rep. Travis Childers, is challenging Arnold. After the primaries, 41 Republicans and 39 Democrats are unopposed. Republicans have incumbents in many more contested races, and all GOP incumbents have raised more money than their Democratic challengers.
