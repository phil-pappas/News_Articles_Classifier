The Nkwanta South District has been without a Chief Executive for close to a year now after the death of the late DCE Peter Kenyenso. The late DCE was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman on November 4, 2014 in front of his official residence at Nkwanta. \nPer the local Government Act, the regional minister acts as DCE in the case of a vacancy at any District under his/her jurisdiction. Volta regional Minister Helen Adjoa Ntosso has been in charge of the district for the past 11months. \nThe newly inducted assemblymen and women of the District are of the view that the appointment of a new District Chief Executive is long overdue. \n''We are pleading with the government to do everything possible to help us get a new DCE as soon as possible. It is the DCE that champions developmental projects in the district. In our case, we don't have one; and our developments are at a standstill'', said Prince Fiagadzi, one of the assembly members. \nThe Assembly members have pledged to approve who so ever the President shall nominate, regardless of where the nominee hails from. \n''We, the assembly members, are ready to approve the nominee whether he comes from the district or not.'' -said Prince Fiagadzi.
