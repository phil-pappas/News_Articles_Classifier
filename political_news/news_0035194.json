Three days later, APUS released an official statement and denied that they received official legal notice about the lawsuit. In the meantime, APUS proved that APUS products were never removed from Google Play and APUS announced that it would collect evidence about rumors and slander that Cheetah propagated on the Internet.\nOn July 6 , APUS announced the lawsuit against Cheetah Mobile in Beijing for unfair competition, asking Cheetah Mobile to cease any slander aimed at inducing users to uninstall APUS products and to act in a legally responsible manner.\nNow, 5 months later, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has vindicated APUS's position and quash Cheetah's service and ruled that Cheetah's lawsuit cannot go forward until Cheetah follows the proper, legal procedures for service of process. To put the record straight, APUS makes the following statements for friends and users who have paid close attention to the case.\nAPUS has never meant to talk much about the lawsuit.
