ADVERTISEMENT Posted: Thursday, September 24, 2015 6:00 pm In Bristol, Jeb Bush raises money for Virginia Senate Republicans By ROBERT SORRELL Bristol Herald Courier Richmond Times-Dispatch \nBRISTOL, Va. — Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, in Virginia to raise funds for GOP state Senate candidates, spoke to a few dozen people Thursday at the Birthplace of Country Music Museum. \nThe former Florida governor spoke on a variety of topics, including the economy. \nOn coal, Bush said, “I think we need to roll back the aggressive EPA for starters, not just as it relates to coal but water and air.” \nHe also said, “There’s a need to protect the environment, but we also need to protect the economic interests of communities and people trying to make a living.” \nBush also discussed the visit of Pope Francis to America. \n“The pope is a religious leader that I admire greatly, and I’m excited that he’s coming for the first time to our country and have a dialogue with us,” Bush said. \nTicket prices for the Java with Jeb fundraiser ranged from $2,500 for four people with a private photo opportunity and special recognition to $150 per individual, according to the invitation. \nBush has made two appearances in Richmond this year, including one last month in which he picked up the endorsement of former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. \nFormer Virginia Attorney General Jerry W. Kilgore, who had been named state finance director for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s Virginia bid, endorsed Bush on Tuesday, a day after Walker dropped out. \nBefore going to the museum, Bush dropped by the Blackbird Bakery. \nRepublicans hold 21 seats in the state Senate to Democrats’ 19. All 40 seats will be on the ballot Nov. 3. \nVirginia Republicans will vote their presidential preference March 1 when Virginia is among the Southern states voting in the Super Tuesday primary. \nBush has been working to build ties to Virginia Republicans. In March, he contributed $10,000 to the Republican Party of Virginia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:30:55.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
