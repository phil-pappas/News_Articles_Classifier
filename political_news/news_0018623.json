In Kodok, World Vision specifically targets children under five with a program to reduce the rates of malnutrition.\nIn addition, with the support of the Government of Canada , World Vision is helping in to:\nProvide access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities Raise awareness about proper hygiene in communities Prevent, identify and treat severe and moderate acute malnutrition among children and under-5 and pregnant & lactating women\nQuote: S\n\"In Melut, a town that was almost completely razed and deserted in May, people are beginning to return despite a continuously strong military presence. We know that the most critical needs are food and water and we have been doing our best to meet these needs,\" said Perry Mansfield , National Director, World Vision South Sudan.\n\"It's not only the conflict affected areas that we are concerned about. People we meet across the country are reporting less rain and late rain. Some say that their harvest will only last a few months. Even the Equatorian states, where food is usually abundant, South Sudanese are reporting alarmingly low harvests,\" said Mansfield.\n\"The harvest in South Sudan will be lean this year and we don't know how long it will last. We have projects across a number of states that try to help people increase their crop yields so that they aren't dependent on food aid, but the weather and the economic situation are huge setbacks for farmers who are trying to grow enough to feed their families,\" says Mansfield.\n\"The sorghum will last three, maybe four months. After that, I don't know what I will do,\" says Awel Adang , a mother to six children living in Twic county in the Northeast of South Sudan . Last year the conflict had prevented her from planting. This year, although she had planted a sorghum crop, the rain came late and wasn't enough.\nWorld Vision's Food Assistance Programs in South Sudan\nWorld Vision is one of the largest partners of the World Food Program operating in areas of the country where there are acute food shortages. Their food assistance programs include general and targeting food distribution and voucher programs. In parts of the country not in conflict, World Vision operates long term development programs that help farmers the amount of food that they produce, particularly in Warrap and Western Equatoria States.\nWorld Vision is a Christian relief, development and advocacy organization dedicated to working with children, families and communities to overcome poverty and injustice.
