(Yuri Kochetkov/AP) By Jackson Diehl Deputy editorial page editor October 11 at 6:57 PM Follow @JacksonDiehl Western officials who pronounce themselves puzzled about Vladi­mir Putin’s intentions in Syria are missing some big clues. There is a clear model for the campaign Russia is pursuing on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a legacy that is Putin’s pride: Chechnya.\nThe Muslim republic in the North Caucasus and the decade-long war that Putin launched there in September 1999 have mostly been forgotten by the outside world since the dictator installed there by Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov, consolidated control in the late 2000s.

The country’s nationalist president, Aslan Maskhadov, had won a democratic election, defeating an Islamist opponent by 59 to 23 percent. His predecessor, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was so secularized that he was unaware how many times a day Muslims pray.\nRussia killed them both, along with every other moderate Chechen leader it could find, both at home and abroad. One was murdered in Vienna; another in Dubai. When Western leaders pressed Putin to negotiate with Maskhadov and other secular moderates, he invariably responded angrily. “Would you invite Osama bin Laden to the White House . . . and let him dictate what he wants?” he demanded of", "external_links": ["http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2013/04/islam-caucasus-and-boston", "https://www.facebook.com/jackson.diehl", "https://twitter.com/@JacksonDiehl"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:10:38.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
