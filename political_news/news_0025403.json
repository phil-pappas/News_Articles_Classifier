Some parts of Christchurch dropped during the Canterbury Earthquakes and some of these areas are now more vulnerable to flooding. As well as addressing this increase in flood risk a tidal barrier would also help protect the city from sea level rise for now but not forever. \nA pre-feasibility study was commissioned to help the Council and Crown funding partners understand if a tidal barrier was technically feasible and to provide a ballpark idea of the cost. The study found a tidal barrier was technically possible, but would cost up to $350 million to build, have major impact on the estuary environment and not remove the need for other additional defences against flooding. \nCommittee Chairman Phil Clearwater says, \"Overall, stakeholders did not strongly support the tidal barrier project and the committee believed a better approach was to look at the full range of alternative solutions as part of a city-wide flood management strategy. We need to act responsibly by considering the best interests of the whole city. The tidal barrier is not a 'silver bullet' for solving flooding issues.\" \nThe Council is expected to make a decision at its next meeting on Thursday 29 October 2015. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
