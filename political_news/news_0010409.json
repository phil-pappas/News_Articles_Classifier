Although the idea was his, it is considered an EPA invention.\nA government employee has a right to obtain an “Employee Rights Determination” to settle the issue of ownership of his or her invention. The factors are the employee’s assigned duties and responsibilities and the extent of the employee’s use of government resources (e.g., equipment, supplies, personnel, time). Breton requested a rights determination. As the EPA’s patent counsel at the time, I decided work on ROVER was within his employment agreement and that he had used significant EPA resources such that ownership remained with the government.\nBreton appealed to the Commerce Department, which affirmed the EPA’s ownership. Breton then filed suit in federal court in the District of Columbia. The court upheld the Commerce decision.\nThe EPA maintains an interest in the invention and licensed it exclusively to two companies in 2004 (Horiba, Ltd. and Sensors Inc.) and, as is typical with government inventions, the license became non-exclusive five years later. So it is now available on a royalty basis to any firm. The problem is that the EPA has not developed regulations to require on-the-road, real-time testing. Further, the EPA’s apparent lack of interest in Volkswagen diesels can be ascribed to the fact that their share of the market is minuscule.\nAlan M.
