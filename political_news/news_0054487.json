Hawkins knows former Common Councilors Lance Denno and Pat Hogan, as well as former Deputy City Auditor Lawrence Bott are taking a bit of a political risk. \n\"The fact that these guys are coming out, putting their conscience and the interest of the citizens of Syracuse in their view before party loyalty means a lot. This has consequences. We sometimes say go green, not machine. There is a political machine here, and there are consequences if you buck it.” \nThat doesn't seem to bother former councilor Hogan, who says their identity as Syracusans supercedes any party loyalty. \n\"We need somebody who actually does the job as city auditor, especially with the fiscal challenges facing the city everyday. We need somebody with energy, and who will dig in and do the job. This is a very important office that has served as a check on many administrations.\" \nLawrence Bott has served in the city budget office and as deputy auditor under five mayoral administrations, from Lee Alexander to Stephanie Miner’s first term. He says Hawkins represents a distinctly independent voice. \n\"I think he has the most enthusiasm, competence, and integrity for the job. He can bring objectivity to it. He's clearly interested in doing a good job. Overall, he represents not a change in government, but better government.\" Howie Hawkins and Pat Hogan   \nHawkins hopes that message resonates with voters. He thinks the office of auditor is virtually free of political labels, which could help him at the polls. \n\"Everybody is interested, whether they're republican, democrat, or green, in efficiency of government and analyzing the consequences of the policies we adopt. So, this is not so much an office that's affected by the difference in philosophies of greens, democrats, and republicans.\" \nHawkins says voters tell him on the campaign trail that they stick with their party when voting for president, but split their ticket when it comes to local offices. \nPRIORITY AUDITS \nHawkins held his press conference in Clinton Square to illustrate quality differences in audits by current auditor Masterpole and his predecessor Phil Latessa.
