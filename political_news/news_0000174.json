He repeatedly makes stuff up when he does his attack dance at progressive policies and the like, but that's not what has him in hot water with his brethren. What has he done to anger his peers, you say? \nHe's broken senatorial protocol and acted like a jerk to fellow politicians. He can cost the government 24 billion dollars and that's OK, but how dare he be rude? \nTPM: \nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) tore into Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Tuesday during an interview on Brian Kilmeade's Fox News radio show, arguing that Cruz's attacks on his colleagues make him an ineffective legislator. \nKilmeade asked Paul if he felt Cruz was snubbed when his fellow Republican senators denied him a roll call vote Monday night on a measure that would have defunded Planned Parenthood. The Senate instead advanced a temporary funding resolution that includes funding for Planned Parenthood. \n\"Ted has chosen to make this really personal and call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence, he can’t get anything done legislatively,\" Paul told Kilmeade . \"He’s pretty much done for and stifled, and it's really because of personal relationships, or lack of personal relationships, and it is a problem.\" \nPaul told Kilmeade that while he opposes federal funding for Planned Parenthood, he uses a different approach than Cruz, referencing the Texas senator's July speech in which he called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) a \"liar.\" \nI know Rand is running against Ted for the presidency, but he's not the only one attacking Cruz for being an a-hole to his own party. \nI do hope they keep icing him out because it will cause more agita between the conservative talking heads, who are battling for supremacy in the GOP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:58:44.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
