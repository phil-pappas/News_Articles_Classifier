Palestinian men walk past the Dome of the Rock \nKerry said Netanyahu had agreed to “an excellent suggestion by King Abdullah”— custodian of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem —“to provide 24-hour video coverage of all sites” in the compound, which is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. \n“This will provide comprehensive visibility and transparency and that could really be a game changer in discouraging anybody from disturbing the sanctity of the holy site,” he said. \nThe Israeli prime minister said in his statement that he welcomed increased coordination with the Jordanian Waqf which administers Al-Aqsa “including to ensure that visitors and worshippers demonstrate restraint and respect for the sanctity of the area.” \n“We support the call for the immediate restoration of calm, and for all the appropriate steps to be taken to ensure that violence ceases, that provocative actions are avoided, and that the situation returns to normalcy in a way that promotes the prospects for peace,” said Netanyahu. \nThe latest wave of violence erupted over the status of the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, a site sacred to both Jews and Muslims that has long been a crucible for tensions fuelling the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In response, the terrorist was shot by the security force at the scene and killed,” a police statement said. \nPolice said the alleged attacker arrived from the Palestinian side of the Al-Jalama checkpoint between the northern West Bank and Israel. \nOn Friday, more than 80 people were wounded in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip during a “day of rage” called by Palestinian movements. \n‘Lack of hope’ AFP/File / Mohammed AbedPalestinian protesters run for cover from tear gas during clashes with Israeli security forces near the border at the Erez crossing in the northern Gaza strip on October 23, 2015 \nSince the start of this month, 52 Palestinians and one Israeli Arab have died in clashes or while carrying out attacks. \nEight Israelis have been killed in attacks. One Israeli Jew and one Eritrean have been killed after being mistaken for attackers. \nKerry, his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon — members of the Middle East peacemaking Quartet — appealed for “maximum restraint” after talks on Friday in Vienna. AFP / Jack GuezAn Israeli activist holds a banner during a rally demanding fresh Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the killing of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in Tel Aviv on October 24, 2015 \nIn Tel Aviv, thousands of Israelis rallied to urge new peace talks with the Palestinians, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish rightwing extremist. \nThe demonstrators chanted “Jews and Arabs don’t want to hate each other” and “Israel, Palestine, two states for two peoples”. \nDaniel Dojon told AFP he came “because the situation is crazy. I am not talking about safety but the lack of (political) progress, the lack of hope.” \nThe recent unrest is led by a new generation of young Palestinians frustrated with life under Israeli occupation and a stalemate in peace efforts, who no longer see their leaders as capable of improving their lot. \nThe most recent attempt to resolve the conflict collapsed in April 2014 amid bitter recriminations on both sides.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:01:52.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
