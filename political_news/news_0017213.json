Photo: Josh Robenstone\nMore footy clubs push back against betting advertising The constant onslaught of gambling ads should be reined in by tougher federal laws, Victoria's Gaming Minister says.\nSelf-regulation of sports odds in live broadcasts failed to quell community concern and a recently announced review of online gambling laws should be expanded to include gambling advertising rules, Gaming and Liquor Regulation Minister Jane Garrett said.\nIn September, then social services minister Scott Morrison announced a review of online gambling laws to consider how they could be strengthened to tackle illegal overseas online bookmakers.\nAdvertisement It has been estimated offshore wagering is a $1 billion illegal business in Australia.\nIn recent years, criticism of betting advertising has come from all political corners, including former Victorian Liberal premier and ex-Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett , the Greens and independent senator Nick Xenophon.\n\"We need to start a national conversation now, particularly around its impact on kids and young people who are bombarded through sports betting advertising,\" Ms Garrett told The Age .\nThis week, she wrote to Social Services Minister Christian Porter and Communications Minister Mitch Fifield, urging them to expand the online gambling review to include advertising.\n\"Recent research suggests that sports betting advertising may have negative economic and social impacts on vulnerable groups such as young people and problem gamblers, and it contributes to the normalisation of gambling as part of sport,\" she said.\n\"Given many wagering services providers operate nationally, there is scope for the Australian and state and territory governments to work collaboratively to improve the effectiveness of gambling advertising regulation.\n\"This could include the development of measures to control or minimise harm associated with gambling advertising.\"\nDeakin University public health academic Samantha Thomas said gambling advertising was shaping children's attitudes so that there was a blurred line between sport and gambling.\n\"When we talk to kids in the community, they tell us that the places they see gambling advertising is on the TV and at sporting stadiums,\" Dr Thomas said. \"They are two environments where the government could very quickly act to ensure kids are not exposed to gambling ads.\"\nAs gambling advertisers used the full gamut of promotional tools, including social media, Ms Garrett said the review must be expanded to find out if the Australian Communications and Media Authority had adequate powers and resources to regulate the sector.\nA spokesman for federal social services minister Christian Porter said the government \"always prefers self-regulation over government regulations. But we will legislate to control gambling advertising if self-imposed industry regulations prove ineffective\".", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/kennett-wants-betting-advertising-banned-20140820-106b1h.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/more-footy-clubs-join-push-back-against-sports-betting-promotion-20151011-gk6bce.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:26:24.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
