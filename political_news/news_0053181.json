Sadly, the people of the state are not seeing through their political games,\" he said.\nEarlier, Urban Development Minister Azam Khan had released a letter he wrote to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon seeking time for audience so that he can petition the UN with regard to the rise in communal unrest in the country, mostly after the Narendra Modi government took over.\nHe alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) planned to convert India into a Hindu country and had let loose volunteers to take on the Muslim population.\nKhan also slammed Modi for not speaking on the Dadri lynching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:14:11.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
