In practice, doctors and unskilled labor were paid approximately the same, removing the incentive to spend years in college to become a doctor. The Democrats and their Occupy Wall Street denizens said, it is obscene for a doctor to make a profit, they don't deserve it. These same socialists advocated quite loudly a living wage of $15-25 per hour for minimum wage unskilled workers. It is only \"fair\" and \"social justice\" to pay someone enough money where they can live comfortably while expending no effort to educate themselves for a career that would enable them to earn a deserved living wage. Read more at The Socialist Left Wants to Make Things Right - Freedom Outpost There is never a shortage of new converts to socialism or socialist wannabes. Take for instance the socialist reading groups spreading around the country among Millennials. Michael Savage called the Millennials \"the new Red Brigades.\" Influenced by the magazine named after the Haitian rebel slave Jacobin, the reading groups (Millennials and Occupy Wall Street \"veterans\") are focused on organized labor even though union membership has dropped to 11 percent in this country. Jacobin is a popular magazine among \"a disaffected white bro socialist demographics.\" Because the economy is so bad and these Millennials are finding that employment is hard to find especially when they have pursued unmarketable majors such as Studies of , Human Rights, Social Justice, Sustainable Development, and other worthless degrees, they are easy prey to community organizers who want to put a shiny new coat on socialism in the 21st century, repackage it, and sell it to a bunch of spoiled brats who have never experienced shortages of anything in their lives but were subjected to constant indoctrination in schools about the utopian marvels of socialism and communism. And the indoctrination of the last 40 years is finally bearing fruit. They should have asked the people who risked death fleeing hellholes of socialism in order to come to this country where private enterprise gave them the opportunity to grow out of poverty and become successful if they were willing to work hard. Unfortunately, many new immigrants, legal and illegal, want to establish in this country the exact third world poverty and crime they've escaped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:43.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
