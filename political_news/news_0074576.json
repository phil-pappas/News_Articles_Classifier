Thanks to you, our polling shows that we hold a resounding 57-35 lead with just more than three weeks until election day — the largest gap we’ve achieved at this point in any of our previous campaigns. To date, my campaign has spent $378,362 on media compared to my opponent’s $630,201, which includes money from his out-of-state allies. 10/9/15 Posted October 9, 2015 - 7:26 pm YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
