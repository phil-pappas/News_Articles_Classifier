It is the only one of its kind in New Zealand. \n\"The additional beds have been added to deal with an ageing prison population and will allow more men to receive the care and support they need,\" Mr Lotu-Iiga says. \n\"Reflecting the general population, the prison population is also ageing. Corrections is aware that extra resources are needed to provide for these men. \n\"Prisoners generally have poorer health than the rest of the population and their bodies are often a lot older than their actual years due to lifestyle choices and neglect\". \nMr Lotu-Iiga acknowledged the collaboration between Corrections, the Ministry of Health and Hutt Valley District Health Board in establishing the unit. \n\"The unit is an excellent example of agencies working together to deliver an effective service,\" he said. \nAs at the end of September this year, there were 188 prisoners aged over 70, compared with 51 in 2011. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:27.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
