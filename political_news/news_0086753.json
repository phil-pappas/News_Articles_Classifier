Heritage events, food festivals and other events are regularly held at the plaza during the summer months. \nBeginning next month, the plaza will host its second “Winter Wonderland” festivities, which includes a 70-by-90-foot ice skating rink near the unused basin. Years ago, when the water in the reflecting pool froze over it was used for ice skating. \nElena Rogliano, a spokeswoman for Westchester County Executive Rob Astorin, said if repairs are completed, the county could potentially use the pool as a skating rink again – either by natural freezing of the surface or by using compressors to freeze the ice. \nDesign and construction are estimated to take 13 months if the county Legislature approves the spending. \nA proposal to bond for the cost is set to be discussed in legislative committees and would need approval there before it is sent to the entire Board of Legislators for a vote. 29 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RtvM1Z TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:42:31.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
