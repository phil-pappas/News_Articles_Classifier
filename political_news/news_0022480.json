We have moved away from that. Some people came to Parliament with professorial qualifications but failed and this must not be encouraged,' he stated. \n'Mr Bedzrah is a Star in Ghana's Parliament' Mr Bagbin asserted. \nHe therefore asked delegates in the Ho-West Constituency to retain Mr Bedzrah as the Party's Parliamentary Candidate for the 2016 general elections. \n'I am a witness to the success of Ho-West and I think if you got it right, maintain it by retaining Bedzrah in Parliament.' \nMr Bedzrah enumerated projects he initiated and supported in the Constituency and said he was ready to continue serving the Constituency. \nParty executives and other Members of Parliament took turns to urge the people to retain Mr Bedzrah.
