Seven snapper per person per day at a minimum size of 30cm. \n“We’re reminding divers to count and check the size of scallops on the bottom and re-check back on the boat. Divers can take a bag limit of 20 scallops for themselves, and further bag limit for two safety people on board. \n“We’ll also be checking that no one is fishing in the rahui area at Deepwater Cove. \n“Police will checking vessel and diver safety measures and that all vessels are generally fit for purpose.” \nOther MPI staff and honorary fishery officers will be doing land-based patrols at fishing hotspots across Northland. \nMr Rusdsdale said it is every fishers’ obligation to check the rules and stick to them. \n“Check the rules before you go fishing and catch a feed, not a fine. \n“If you stick to the rules, there’ll be enough fish for everyone and our fish stocks will remain sustainable and protected.” \nMPI encourages people to report any suspicious fishing activity to 0800 4 POACHER (0800 476 224).
