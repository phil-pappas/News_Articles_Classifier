Envoys from seven countries - Argentina, Brazil, Panama, Pakistan, Slovakia, Norway and Spain - attended the forum along with representatives of international organisations, such as the United Nations. More than 50 people attended in total. The forum lasted about 40 minutes and took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They were briefed about why the CDC was set up and told about the progress of its work during the first two weeks, which Norachit said was in line with Article 35 of the interim charter and the five-point framework of the National Council for Peace and Order. The diplomats and officials were also given documents during the briefing so they could gain a better understanding of the process and see the situation accurately. Norachit explained to the visitors that Thailand would stick with its road map despite the fact that the draft written by the Borwornsak Uwanno committee was rejected. Asked if the envoys had inquired how the CDC would proceed if the latest draft round was rejected, Norachit said \"no\". The spokesman said the only question asked during the forum was when the charter would be ready for people to see. He had replied that the first draft would be publicised in January. After that, the CDC would gather comments and might revisit the draft accordingly, he added. The spokesman also said no further meeting with international organisations has not been scheduled, but would be arranged when appropriate. 476 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:42:49.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
