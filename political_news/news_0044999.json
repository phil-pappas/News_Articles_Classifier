Allstate reminds residents that being prepared for a hurricane often means taking easy steps that can go a long way in protecting families and minimizing property damage.\nIf you have time, conduct a home inventory of your property. It's helpful to keep track of model numbers and stores where items were purchased. Keep your inventory, including photos and videos, in a safe place away from your home. You may consider using a free app called Digital Locker for homeowners or Commercial Locker , if you're a small business owner, to quickly build your inventory. You don't have to be an Allstate customer to use the apps. Develop an evacuation plan that includes identification of safe areas, escape routes, meeting locations and plans for pets. Prepare an Emergency Supply Kit including a three-day supply of water, non-perishable food, radio and batteries, flashlight and a first-aid kit. Gather medications or get prescriptions refilled. Gather important documents such as insurance policies, birth certificates and identification. Make sure to place them in a waterproof container. On the outside, remove any diseased and damaged limbs from trees to keep them from blowing around during a storm and causing property or automobile damage. Purchase materials such as plywood that can be used to reinforce your windows, doors and garage doors. Remember, policyholders may have multiple insurance policies (car, boat, home, wind, flood) with a variety of insurance carriers so it is important that you gather all insurance information so you can report claims to the appropriate carrier. Regarding flood insurance, most property policies do not cover flood damage. Flood insurance is offered through the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program and policies are sold and managed by private insurance companies like Allstate. Keep in mind that coverage does not take effect until 30 days after purchase.
