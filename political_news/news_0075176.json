Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., for skipping key interviews held by the Select Committee on Benghazi, even though ranking Democrats involved in the investigation have missed many of the same meetings.\nThe South Carolina congressman and head of the Benghazi probe has \"skipped interviews with top intelligence officials and attack survivors,\" the Huffington Post reported Friday. \"[I]f you look at the witness interviews he's attended, and not attended, there is a clear theme: Gowdy is mostly there for the people directly connected to Clinton.\"\nFor certain media figures, including MSNBC's Chris Hayes, the report is \" extremely damning .\"\nThe special committee has been tasked with investigating the events surrounding the deadly Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya. As such, the committee is looking hard at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's involvement in the attack. Gowdy's team rejects the idea that he's only participating when people close to Clinton testify, and says the Republican lawmaker has attended several of the interviews.\n  Paul announces bill to 'Cut, Cap and Balance' the budget By 2021, the senator hopes the bill will balance the U.S. budget.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/17/15 12:40 PM But a \"House Democratic aide familiar with the committee's process\" said he has attended only 10 of the 53 interviews, the Huffington Post reported.\nGowdy reportedly attended interviews featuring Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff when she was secretary of State, Jake Sullivan, Clinton's former deputy chief of staff, and longtime aide and advisor Sidney Blumenthal.\nBut he apparently skipped interviews that included, \"three of the four diplomatic security agents who survived the terrorist attack … [and] CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell [and] former Defense Intelligence Agency Director Michael Flynn,\" the Huffington Post reported.\nGowdy's selective attendance, \"would seem to suggest where his priorities lie,\" the anonymous aide told the online news group.\nHowever, though the report suggested he only cares when aides to the former secretary of state testify, it's worth noting Gowdy skipped Friday's interview involving Clinton's longtime aide, personal assistant and confidant Huma Abedin. It's also worth noting that Democratic lawmakers on the committee are just as guilty of skipping the interviews. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the investigation, has apparently missed almost all of the witness meetings.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Westboro Baptist Church to protest Kim Davis The anti-gay marriage group is calling the Kentucky county clerk a 'fake Christian' and a 'hypocrite.'\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/17/15 11:24 AM The Huffington Post explained the likely reason for why Cummings and Gowdy have reportedly attended so few interviews: They meetings are \"staff-led, said the aide, so when members do come, they are typically passive observers.\"\nBut there could be another reason for Cummings' repeated absences. Democratic lawmakers, including the Maryland congressman, have long criticized the committee as little more than a political witch hunt meant to hurt Clinton's presidential campaign.\nThis claim has been boosted by two Republicans, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Richard Hanna, R-N.Y., saying recently that the committee is indeed political. However, neither McCarthy nor Hanna is in any way involved in the investigation. They have seen none of the committee's work and they haven't spoken with any of the witnesses.\nClinton is scheduled to testify before the committee on Oct. 22.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner GOP zeroes in on sanctuary cities Toomey highlighted the bill for \"Kate's Law,\" named for Kate Steinle who was killed by an illegal immigrant.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/17/15 11:12 AM Top Story John Kerry: Climate change aggravated the Syrian conflict   the drought and food shortage.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/17/15 10:52 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:13:43.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
