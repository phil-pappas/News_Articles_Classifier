(The Associated Press) Comments \nKLAMATH FALLS â€” U.S. Rep. Greg Walden said he is close to drafting a bill in the House that will focus on resolving the water issues for the Klamath Basin. \nIt will likely include the removal of the four dams that sit on the Klamath River and have been a source of dispute among parties who have not signed on to the water agreement. \nWalden has been adamant about not removing the dams, but has softened that stance in the last few years. \nIn an interview with the Herald and News, Walden, a Republican from Hood River, said, \"Personally, I'm not a dam removal support guy. But the facts that have been agreed to (in the pact) require (dam removal) and there are really no alternatives unless you want to blow the whole agreement apart and give up on water certainty for agriculture and all the other components that go with the agreement.\" \nThe agreement is called the Klamath Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act. It was hammered out by irrigators, the Klamath Tribes, environmental groups, state and local officials as a compromise to provide consistent water to farmers and ranchers, as well as keep enough water in Upper Klamath Lake and the Klamath River for protection of endangered fish species. \nSenate Bill 133 was introduced in January in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, but has yet to move forward. It must pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president before it can become law. SB 133 was about to be heard in committee prior to the August recess, but more pressing energy matters took the stage. \nNow, Walden plans to sponsor a similar bill in the House, but he was not ready to talk specifics. \n\"We've been working pretty aggressively in the last year reviewing all the issues surrounding the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement; the liability, sediment issues, dam removal, the whole thing,\" he said. \"And, we've been working closely with the Tribes, the water users in the lower basin, PacifiCorp (the dam owners) and the state and governor's office. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes.\" \nOnce drafted, Walden said he wants to confer with the agreement parties before releasing it in the House. \nOnce drafted, it will have to go before the House Natural Resources committee which includes California Republican congressmen Doug LaMalfa and Tom McClintock. In September at the Tulelake fair, LaMalfa said he remains adamantly opposed to dam removal. Three of the four dams are in his district. \n\"I don't know if LaMalfa will support my bill or not. I respect him and he's a good man, but we may wind up in different places on this,\" Walden said. \n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:51:12.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
