(AP) - Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper has kicked off his bid to become North Carolina governor and unseat Republican incumbent Pat McCrory. \nCooper formally announced his bid Monday evening to a crowd of party luminaries, interest group leaders and friends and family in Nash County, where he grew up and began his law practice. \nCooper has been talking about planning for a bid for governor since 2013 and has been critical of policies pushed by the Republican-led General Assembly and McCrory. \nCooper told supporters that people in charge in Raleigh are leading North Carolina down the wrong path. He says that North Carolina can lead the South again. \nKen Spaulding of Durham already has announced he's seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Their primary would be March 15.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/12/north-carolina-attorney-general-kicks-off-run-for-governor/73842822/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:06:22.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
