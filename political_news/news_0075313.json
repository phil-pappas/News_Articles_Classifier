Only 40 percent of GOP voters believe it should definitely be legal; the other 20 percent say they’re not sure. \nPPP director Tom Jensen says he asked the question to determine how GOP voters were reacting to comments made about Islam by leading presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Jensen says judging from the numbers, those comments are unlikely to have hurt them, at least among their current supporters. (Indeed a majority of Trump supporters, 52 percent, say they believe Islam should be illegal.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:03:12.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
