It will not offer health insurance plans on Kynect when open enrollment for 2016 coverage starts on Nov. 1. \nShortly after the company's announcement, Gov. Steve Beshear said Kentuckians in need of health care coverage can find other choices and possibly lower prices by shopping on Kynect during the 2016 open enrollment period. It begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. \nBeshear said seven companies will offer insurance plans to individuals and families on Kynect during the enrollment period. That total is up from three in 2014 and five this year. \n\"This is the largest number of carriers in the individual market in Kentucky since the late 1990s,\" he said. \nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who opposes the federal health insurance law that allowed Beshear to create Kynect, said the shutdown of Kentucky Health Cooperative is the latest example of the law's failures. \n\"Barely a week goes by that we don't see another harmful consequence of this poorly conceived, badly executed law,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"Despite repeated Obama administration bailout attempts, this is the latest in a string of broken promises with real consequences for the people of Kentucky who may now be losing the health insurance they had and liked twice within the past three years because of Obamacare's failures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:19:39.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
