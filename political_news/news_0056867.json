Support for Vice President Joe Biden among Democrats dropped 6 percentage points to 13 percent from 10 days ago.\nAnalysts widely hailed Clinton, 67, as turning in a nimble performance at the debate last Tuesday, easing fears among some Democrats that the controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of state was torpedoing her bid to represent the party in the November 2016 election.\nClinton's showing in the Oct. 13 debate in Las Vegas that brought together five declared Democratic candidates also fired a warning shot at Biden, 72, who is considering a late presidential run.\nThirty-six percent of voters said Clinton did the best job in the debate aired on CNN, regardless of which candidate they support, while 26 percent named Sanders as the winner.\nAmong Democrats, Clinton's debate win was more pronounced. Fifty-two percent of 865 Democrats who watched the event believed she did the best job, compared with 29 percent who thought Sanders was the top performer.\nThe precision of Reuters/Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points for all respondents and plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for all Democrats.\nIt also has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all respondents who watched the debate, and plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for Democrats who watched the debate.\n(Reporting by Alistair Bell; Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:29:32.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
