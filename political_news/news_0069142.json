I’m not advocating a military confrontation with Russia. … Putin is well on the way to enforcing his will,” said Peters.\nHe said that Obama’s airstrikes against ISIS made some difference, but likened them to a “kindergarten version of warfare where everyone gets a prize.”\n“For Obama ‘win’ is a dirty word. For Putin, it’s all or nothing, there’s no compromise. There’s no ‘every child gets a prize.’ There’s a winner and there’s a loser.”\nPeters noted that long ago, Obama was a community organizer and those communities in Chicago are a “mess right now.” He said Obama has tried to “organize the international community” with similarly bad results.\nFox News: US halts rebel training as Russia escalates Syria presence:\nThe Kelly File: Gen.
