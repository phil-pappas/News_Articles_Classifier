The former portfolio managers were both convicted in December 2012. \nThe appeals court said prosecutors failed to present enough evidence the men willfully engaged in insider trading or conspired to break the law. It ruled that the government must show a person receiving a tip knew that an insider disclosed confidential information and that the tipster passed the information expecting a personal benefit. \nIn legal briefs filed with the court, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said leaving the appeals court ruling in place would \"hurt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts and impair the government's ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.\" \nBoth men have denied insider trading. Their lawyers argued that they believed they were making trades based on legitimate research. \nU.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan told reporters on a conference call Monday that the Supreme Court's decision means \"that there's a category of conduct that arguably will go unpunished going forward.\" \n\"If you have a CEO who has access to material, non-published information about earnings or anything else of a very sensitive nature and decides he wants to tip a relative or a buddy or a crony, knowing that person is going to trade on it to the tune and profit of millions of dollars, we would have to think long and hard, given Newman, whether to prosecute a person like that,\" Bharara said. \nHe said new laws or regulations could give the government, insiders and the public more clarity on the issue. \nIn a statement, Chiasson's attorney Gregory Morvillo said his client is \"deeply gratified by this complete vindication.\" But Morvillo added that dozens of Chiasson's colleagues lost their jobs \"at his thriving fund which became the collateral damage of this ill-conceived prosecution.\" \nNearly $62 million of the profits came as a result of tips from a Dell employee to a former Dell worker who spread the information among friends, some of whom worked at five investment houses, including three hedge funds. \nWhen the men were arrested in 2012, prosecutors said the Dell trades represented the largest insider trading transaction ever prosecuted in Manhattan. \nThe case is United States v. Newman, 15-137. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Larry Neumeister contributed to this report. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
