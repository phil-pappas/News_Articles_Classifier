Federal law gives the commission authority to regulate wholesale markets, while retail sales are governed by states. \nThe issue appeared to divide the justices along political lines, with conservatives wary the commission had gone too far and liberals more willing to side with the government. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy, often a swing vote, appeared concerned that by offering financial incentives to factories, retailers and other large electricity users to reduce power consumption, the energy commission was indirectly manipulating retail rates. \n\"It may not be the intention, but it's the mechanism,\" Kennedy said. \nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli told the justices the energy commission has the power to protect consumers from \"price spikes\" and avoid \"blackouts and brownouts\" on the nation's electric grid. He said any impact on retail sales is incidental. \nJustice Antonin Scalia insisted the effect was more direct. \n\"I like deregulated markets, but the problem is do you have the authority to do it,\" Scalia told Verrilli. \nThe demand response program works by paying electric customers to lower their energy use during times of greatest demand, such as on extremely hot summer days. Cutting back power use reduces the need for electric companies to turn on extra power plants, a move that can also increase power costs. \nThe rule has won praise from environmental groups that say it helps lower electricity prices by reducing the need to build expensive and air-polluting power plants. \nMost traditional utility companies, which stand to lose millions of dollars if the rule stays in place, oppose it on grounds that it is too generous and tramples state rights over retail sales. \nArguing for a group of utilities and power suppliers, former solicitor general Paul Clement said the program impermissibly targets retail customers. \n\"If FERC gets to do this on the wholesale markets ... what is being sold is an option to buy electricity at a subsidized retail rate,\" Clement said. \nJustice Stephen Breyer suggested a host of other energy commission regulations also have an indirect effect on retail markets, but not enough to make them invalid. \nThe demand response program saved customers in the mid-Atlantic region nearly $12 billion in 2013, according to PJM Interconnection, which manages the wholesale power supply for all or part of 13 states. \nThe regulation itself has remained in effect while the Supreme Court decides whether it's valid. \nOnly eight justices heard arguments over the rule. Justice Samuel Alito is taking no part in hearing or deciding the case. His most recent financial disclosure indicates he owns stock in Johnson Controls, Inc., which has a subsidiary, EnergyConnect, Inc., that is part of a group defending the commission's regulation. \nA four-to-four split would leave in place the lower court opinion striking it down. \nA ruling is expected by late June. \n___ \nFollow Sam Hananel on Twitter at http://twitter.com/SamHananelAP Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:22:49.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
