He faces up to life in prison if convicted.\nDistrict Judge George Gallagher’s ruling came after a Thursday telephone conference call with the attorneys. He offered no written explanation behind his order. He did extend the deadline to Oct. 30 to file any motions to quash the indictments.\n“This is a victory, pure and simple,” defense attorney Bill Mateja said in a written statement Friday. “Not only is it a victory for General Paxton, it is a victory for transparency in the grand jury process. Despite the special prosecutors describing our request as desperate, the court easily saw through that hyperbole.”\nSpecial prosecutors in the case had argued against releasing the information. They said the defense’s requests were improper and did not meet the standard for relevance.\n“Had Mr. Paxton’s defense team followed the rules regarding pre-trial discovery in criminal cases, we would not have been compelled to file our motion to quash his subpoenas,” special prosecutor Brian Wice said in a written statement. He said the prosectuors “welcome the release of information revealing that absolutely nothing improper occurred in the selection and empanelment of any of the four Collin County grand juries they sought to challenge.”\nThe defense sought transcripts detailing the process of selecting the grand jury that indicted him as well as the three other grand juries seated this year. In filings, the attorneys stated they had information to suggest “the grand jury array may have been empaneled in a manner inconsistent with law.”\nThe records will determine whether there were any irregularities in the selection process, Paxton’s side contends.\n“The court’s ruling demonstrates that these subpoenas were justified and proper,” Mateja said. “We have every right to consider the circumstances in which the grand jury was picked in this case.”\nGallagher’s ruling also allows to defense to get records related to a personnel action involving a deputy district clerk. This request, though not detailed in court records, is believed to be related to a clerk who released grand jurors’ names by email to some media outlets in violation of a court order requiring the names to remain confidential.\nOn Twitter:\n @vlwigg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/vlwigg"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:03:04.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
