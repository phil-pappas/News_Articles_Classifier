However, its critics, including Labour and the SNP, argue that it will create two class of MPs and could restrict Scottish MPs voting on issues that have an indirect financial consequence on Scotland.\nPromoted stories The proposed changes by the Conservative administration mean that while Scottish MPs would be banned from voting on a key scrutiny stage of an England-only Bill, the final vote would include all UK Members.\nEarlier this week, Chris Grayling, the Commons Leader overseeing Evel, dismissed the idea of a pilot yet said that, after a year, there would be a “proper stock-take” to see how the policy was doing. But he also made clear the Conservative Government had no intention of dropping it.\nWith the issue of finance a key one and what the committee says are the “less than satisfactory arrangements for the House to consider changes in block grants to the devolved institutions arising from the Barnett Formula”, it says its members will examine the House’s procedures for approving the Government’s spending plans.\nCharles Walker, the committee chairman, said the MPs’ review found elements of the Evel proposals “over-engineered and potentially burdensome” and its recommendations would seek to streamline the process.\n“Clearly, the proposals represent a substantial change to the House’s procedures and they ought to be piloted on statutory instruments and a small number of Bills before they are fully implemented.”\nBut the committee’s SNP members Patrick Grady, representing Glasgow North, and Patricia Gibson, North Ayrshire and Arran, voted against the report.\nTheir leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, said it showed the “utter confusion and total inadequacy of what the UK Government is proposing on Evel. The Tories have got themselves into a first class muddle and are trying to force this through – with too many flaws - too quickly”.\nHe added: “Evel puts forward an absurd solution to the UK’s current constitutional inequalities and it is clear that the proposals need to go right back to the drawing board so that they can be examined properly.”\nIan Murray for Labour branded the UK Government reforms “an incomprehensible mess”.\nShare article The Shadow Scottish Secretary added: “David Cameron's proposals will weaken our democracy, weaken Scotland's voice in Parliament and for the first time create two classes of MPs.\n“It could lead to the perverse situation where some unelected members of the House of Lords will be more powerful than elected MPs. Labour will put forward our own proposals that will simplify this process but not threaten the way the UK's democracy works.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-19T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:57:09.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
