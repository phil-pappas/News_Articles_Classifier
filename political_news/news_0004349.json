Its name reflects the revised wording of the referendum question. Voters will be asked whether they want the UK to stay in the EU or leave. More Osborne pinches more Labour policies \nVote Leave has support from politicians from the Conservative party, Labour, the UK Independence party and the Greens, as well as Lord Trimble, the former UIster Unionist party leader. \nIt has also announced the backing of more than 20 prominent business people including Joe Foster, founder of Reebok, Christopher Foyle, chairman of the Foyles bookshops, and John Caudwell, founder of Phones4U. \nPeter Cruddas, the former Tory party co-treasurer and founder of the online trading company CMC Markets, is one of its three treasurers from across the political spectrum. The others are John Mills, founder of JML and a Labour donor, and Stuart Wheeler, the Ukip donor who set up IG Index. “If we vote to leave, then the £350m we send to Brussels every week can be spent on our priorities like the NHS,” said Mr Mills. \nVote Leave is being run by several seasoned campaigners, including the group’s chief executive Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful No2AV campaign against electoral reform and subsequently headed the anti-EU lobby group Business for Britain. \nChris Hirst, European and UK group chief executive at Havas, the advertising and public relations group, said of the campaign’s name: “The branding is clever. While yes/no have binary notions of sentiment, Vote Leave carries an explicit sense of empowerment.” A meaningful message will always resonate more with an audience . . . Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Scottish referendum \n- Chris Hirst, Havas \nHe added: “A meaningful message will always resonate more with an audience . . . Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Scottish referendum.” \nBenedict Pringle, author of the blog Political Advertising, said the name was not as “interesting” as Better Together, the umbrella unionist group during the Scottish independence vote. \n“It’s a pretty straight bat — not too wacky,” he said. “But with most brand names, what really matters is what you put behind it. It’s about the people who act as brand champions.” \nThe group is to unveil an ICM poll finding that 53 per cent of respondents would vote to leave the bloc if David Cameron fails to negotiate a deal that ends the supremacy of EU law in the UK. \nVote Leave is one of two groups competing for a formal endorsement from the Electoral Commission to be the official “Out” group. Such recognition would allow up to £7m of expenditure including £600,000 of public grants. Under the referendum rules, only one group on each side can be designated as the official campaign.
