Most of the rest of the world is baffled by our refusal to reform,\" he told The Huffington Post UK. \nToday parliament will debate the legalisation of cannabis after over 200,000 people signed an online petition calling for MPs to address the issue. \nFlynn said because the drug was illegal people took it in a harmful way by mixing it with tobacco and smoking it. \"If we had a legal market people would know what the drug is, the strength and purity of it. And they could take it in other ways.\" \nTo mark the debate, the Lib Dems have announced the creation of a independent panel of experts to establish how a legalised market for cannabis could work in the United Kingdom. The panel includes former government drug adviser professor David Nutt. \nSEE ALSO: Legalising Cannabis In Britain, Like Uruguay, 'Would Save Millions' \nAhead of the debate, Lib Dem Health spokesman Norman Lamb said: \"I share people’s concerns about the health impacts of any drug – legal or illegal. \n\"But we can better manage that harm by taking the money that’s currently spent on policing the illegal cannabis market and spending it on public health education and restrictions at the point of sale. That’s the approach we’ve taken with cigarettes and it’s led to dramatic reductions in smoking in recent years. \n\"With successful legal cannabis markets emerging in different parts of the world, the onus is now on the supporters of prohibition to explain why we shouldn’t do the same things here in the UK. \n\"We must end the hypocrisy of senior politicians admitting to using cannabis in younger years - and describing it as 'youthful indiscretions' - whilst condemning tens of thousands of their less fortunate fellow countrymen and women to criminal records for precisely the same thing, blighting their careers.\" \nFlynn said he was \"delighted\" at the Lib Dem position. \"They have had a very good record on this, they have been very courageous and it has possibly cost them votes,\" he said. Close What It's Like Inside A Legal Weed Shop of   The photo at the top of this story is a little misleading -- that was during a party on 4/19, when there was a line out the door for $10 grams and gigantic joints whose price tags were cut to $4.20. THIS is how many of the state's bud cafes look on the outside. It's a little unnerving when you first arrive. Green Lady Marijuana, for instance, shares its building with a tire shop, and it's all next to a state patrol office. It's not seedy inside, by any means, but walking in for the first time makes some new customers feel a little guilty -- like walking into a porn shop on a main street. \"It was definitely weird the first time, heck, I can't even tell my daughter I was here,\" said one 53-year-old customer, who only gave her name as Donna. \"I feel more at ease than when I used to get marijuana illegally, but there's still that little adrenaline rush when you walk out of a store with a bag of pot cookies and a joint.\" This is where they vet customers. Employee Jasmine Hargrove, 25, told The Huffington Post that it would be a problem to let everyone else in at once. \"We like to give a more personal experience with your bud-tender -- some people are just now learning what they want,\" she said. \"Plus there is security, because we do deal with a very in-demand product and we deal with a lot of cash.\" You show a security guard your ID -- you have to be 21 to buy weed in Washington state -- and you sit in this waiting room for about 5 minutes. That's when you learn that people from all walks are buying sticky icky. Everyone from your high school friends to the suit-and-tie business man is in that waiting room. There are truffles and cookies, chocolates and popcorn. But no Funyuns, man. Not YET. There's a minor catch to the whole ordeal -- the price. You're likely paying a premium at $15-20 a gram, but customers said they'd rather have it readily available and legal than pay a few bucks less. Would you go into a legal weed shop in your area?  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:56:58.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
