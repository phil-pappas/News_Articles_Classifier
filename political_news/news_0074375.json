(Photo: NBC Charlotte) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPINEVILLE, N.C. -- Pineville town leaders are set to hear public comment Tuesday night about a proposed ordinance that would clearly define pit bulls as \"dangerous or vicious\" dogs. \nIt's a topic that's stirred up controversy among pit bull owners and supporters like Blaire Earhart. \n\"They're not born vicious, they're made vicious by certain people,\" Earhart said. \nShe's worked with dogs for over a decade, and has a pit bull of her own. \n\"They get a bad wrap; people think they're vicious, they're mean-- my pit bull would probably just kiss you to death.\" \nEarhart lives in Fort Mill, but plans to drive to Pineville for Tuesday night's hearing, just to show her support. Many other pit bull advocates shared the same sentiments on a Facebook page called \"South of the Bully.\" \nThe reason for the discussion, according to Pineville's town manager, is an increase in calls to animal control. \nThere have been 46 calls so far in 2015. Eleven of them regarding dog bites or aggressive action. When we asked if those calls were pit bull-related, the town manager didn't give a clear answer. \nThe ordinance up for discussion would require pit bulls to be kept inside, unless the owner's yard has a 6-foot fence around it. \n\"It could cost at least a thousand dollars to have a 6-foot fence put up,\" Earhart said. \"And a lot of people can't afford that. Dogs like to run, they should be able to be outside if they want to be outside.\" \nIt would also mean the dogs couldn't be chained up in front or side yards, and owners would need to display a \"beware of dog\" sign. \nEarhart and other advocates worry if this gets passed in Pineville, it won't be long before neighboring towns follow suit. \n\"I would want to see the whole thing thrown out. I'm completely against it,\" she said. \nTown leaders say Tuesday night's hearing is all about getting public input, and they're open to hearing different viewpoints before making a final decision.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/13/controversy-surrounds-pinevilles-proposed-pitbull-regulations/73887748/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:40:27.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
