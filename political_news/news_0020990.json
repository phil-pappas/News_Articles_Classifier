She didn't want to be a secretary, so she avoided typing classes on purpose. Sorry, stupid example, but the things she told me about growing up in the 1950s and 1960s seem so foreign and crazy now. Scary that it really wasn't that long ago, either. I was nine when my mother chained herself to her banks doors because they refused to allow her to open a savings account in just her name. It was the banks 'policy' that married men could have accounts in just their names, but married women had to have their husbands name on the account.
