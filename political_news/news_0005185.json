They're also looking at rewarding prisoners with shorter sentences if they complete certain programs to cut the number of repeat offenders. \nObama says 500,000 people were behind bars in America 30 years ago. Now, there are 2.2 million. \nHe says many of the people in prison belong there but that the U.S. is also locking up more nonviolent offenders than ever before. \nDuring his travel, Obama says he'll meet with police chiefs, a community battling drug abuse and former prisoners.
