An anonymous reader writes: Wikileaks has released the finalized Intellectual Property text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which international negotiators agreed upon a few days ago. Unfortunately, it contains many of the consumer-hostile provisions that so many organizations spoke out against beforehand. This includes the extension of the copyright term to life plus 70 years , and a ban on the circumvention of DRM. The EFF says, \"If you dig deeper, you'll notice that all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding. That paragraph on the public domain, for example, used to be much stronger in the first leaked draft, with specific obligations to identify, preserve and promote access to public domain material. All of that has now been lost in favor of a feeble, feel-good platitude that imposes no concrete obligations on the TPP parties whatsoever.\" The EFF walks us through all the other awful provisions as well â€” it's quite a lengthy analysis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:00:42.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
