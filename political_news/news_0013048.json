A similar process would be used where matters covered only England and Wales - with Welsh MPs included.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/79698000/jpg/_79698358_79690633.jpg", "http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmproced/410/41002.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:22:31.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
