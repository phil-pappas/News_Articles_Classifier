Dick Ackerman, R-Fullerton, left, wheel an cappuccino machine into the Governor's office at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, who in the past has delivered freshly brewed coffee to his meetings with the governor, announced yesterday that he would withhold the services of his coffee maker after his \"girlie men\" comment over the weekend.
