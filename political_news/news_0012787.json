He also said Pakistan has made it clear to India that there can be no progress on bilateral ties while ignoring Kashmir issue,\" the spokesman claimed. \nSharif also said that the National Security Advisor level talks between the two countries could not take place as \"India was not ready to talk Kashmir issue\". \n\"We want good relations with all our neighbours including India but New Delhi's unrealistic approach has been a big impediment,\" the spokesman quoted the Pakistan Prime Minister having said in the letter. \nThe spokesman said Geelani has in principle accepted the invitation to visit Pakistan. He, however, did not give specific date of travel. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:15:14.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
