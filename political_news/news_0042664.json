Biden on Thursday clung to President Obama’s record on everything from health care to the auto industry bailout, boasting that he single-handedly “administered” the administration’s $800 billion stimulus package and even calling it the most “competently run program” in American history. \nIn a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Mr. Biden made clear that the centerpiece to his would-be presidential campaign will be this administration’s record. The vice president said the administration’s stimulus package — passed in the early days of Mr. Obama’s and Mr. Biden ’s tenure, at a time when the economy was in chaos — is proof he’s capable of handling massive federal programs efficiently. \n“The whole recovery act cost more than $800 billion. We were vilified for it, all the waste and fraud it was going to cause. Outside groups, including the Congressional Budget Office, analyzed that there is less than .02 percent waste or fraud in my administering that act,” Mr. Biden said. “There was none. It was the most competently run program in the history of the United States with the amount of money involved — and it mattered.” \nThe vice president still is mulling whether to seek the White House in 2016. If he jumps into the race, it would be the third time in his 40-year political career that he’s sought the presidency. \nHe has said that he’s confident he could run an effective campaign but isn’t sure he has the emotional energy or will to run, following the death of his son, Beau, earlier this year. \nIn laying the groundwork for a potential run, Mr. Biden also has been courting progressives. He praised Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat and a hero to liberals. \n“I’m a fan,” Mr. Biden said. “She is, I think, one of the most articulate people in the United States Congress, the United States Senate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:58:36.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
