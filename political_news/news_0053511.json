(Photo: John Partipilo / The Tennessean) \nIn a small boardroom inside Music City Center Friday afternoon, three dozen members of Megan Barry’s mayoral transition team met to complete five weeks of work. \nThey handed the mayor a 22-page report that details recommendations they identified for the new Nashville mayor as she prepares to tackle challenges ahead, including her three campaign pillars of affordable housing, transit and public education. There are also suggestions on restructuring her mayor’s office — a few of which she has already started implementing. \nIdentified reshuffling includes the installment of not only a new transportation director, which she discussed routinely on the campaign trail, but also a director to oversee infrastructure. \nThe latter job, the mayor’s office confirmed to The Tennessean last week, has been filled by Mark Sturtevant, former chief development officer for the Metro Transit Authority, who served as project manager for Music City Center and The Amp bus rapid transit project, the latter of which eventually stalled. \nIn addition the report suggests an expert in the mayor’s office to work specifically on affordable housing; a chief diversity officer (an idea Barry talked about on the campaign trail) to oversee the workforce diversity of Metro government; and a new position in the Mayor’s Office of Economic and Community Development focused on Nashville's creative economy. \nBarry, sitting on one end of a long table alongside most of the 42 members who make up her transition team, thanked the panel she assigned for its efforts. She then vowed to get moving on them, while acknowledging that some issues — criminal justice and public safety, for example — aren’t addressed in the report. \n“I think these recommendations are incredible,” Barry said. “I look forward to implementing them. There’s some really good stuff here on the pieces that I tasked you to look at. \n“There are pieces, I know, that are not comprehensive here, but boy, this is a great place to start.” \nStory continues below report \nBarry’s transition team, assembled quickly after her election on Sept. 10, was chaired by attorney and former mayoral candidate Charles Robert Bone. He took the lead in compiling the report, which fleshes out parts of the vision that Barry articulated as a candidate. \n“Your mission to us was to make sure there was as seamless a transition from Mayor Dean’s administration to yours,” Bone told Barry on Friday. “I think by evidence of how well these (meetings) have gone over the last month that has absolutely happened.” \nThe report is divided into six parts: access and affordability; diversity and organizational structure; economic and workforce development; education; transportation and infrastructure; and mayor’s office organization. \nHere are highlights in each category: \nAccess and Affordability Appoint an expert in the mayor’s office who is directly responsible for affordable housing to ensure Nashville has an ample support of housing for the middle class and poor. Pursue a countywide inclusionary zoning policy that has public support. Inclusionary zoning requires that a certain percentage of new residential development be priced affordably. The Metro Planning Department is drafting proposed rules and regulations following action by the Metro Council last summer. Increase Metro’s commitment to the Barnes Fund for Affordable Housing, which offers incentives to developers willing to pursue affordable housing. Consider a task force on affordable housing; undertake an organizational review that focuses on how the city reduces poverty and provides services and opportunities to those living in poverty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:00:29.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
