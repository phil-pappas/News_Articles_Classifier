We need to conduct ourselves in a disciplined manner that will protect and promote the integrity and unity of the Party,” Akufo-Addo Said. \nThe decision to suspend the party chairman infinitely was taken on Friday at an emergency National Executive Committee meeting at the party’s headquarters at Asylum Down in Accra. \nThe party’s Council of Elders in a 7-page letter, in September, to the NPP’s Disciplinary Committee, ordered that steps be taken to suspend Mr. Paul Afoko from the position of Chairman of the largest opposition party. \nAfter several invitations to Mr. Afoko to appear before the Disciplinary Committee were not honoured, the Committee decided to recommend Mr Afoko's suspension. \nThe party’s First Vice Chairman Freddy Blay convened and chaired the NEC meeting. \nMeanwhile, lawyers for the Mr Afoko says the party chairman's suspension is a sham, and have hinted they would challenge the NEC decision in court. \nAkufo-Addo says in the statement that although he had hoped for amicable settlement of internal party matters, he respects the decision because “the appropriate organs of the party have acted.” \nRead Nana Akufo-Addo’s statement below. \nLast Friday in Accra, the National Executive Committee of the New Patriotic Party unanimously adopted the recommendation of the National Disciplinary Committee for the indefinite suspension of the National Chairman of the Party. According to a release by the Party, “by the decision of the NEC, Mr. Paul Afoko is suspended indefinitely from the position of National Chairman of the NPP.” \nI profoundly regret that matters have come to this. Such a development has been rather rare in the history of our party. I had hoped that internal discussions and a spirit of cooperation would have enabled the Party to avoid such an eventuality. \nHowever, the appropriate organs of the Party have acted. I am, therefore, calling on all loyal members of the Party to respect the decision of NEC and the Constitution of the Party, which provides channels for redressing grievances. We need to conduct ourselves in a disciplined manner that will protect and promote the integrity and unity of the Party. \nThe NPP requires a united and committed front for the task ahead. We need to stay focused and organise ourselves to prosecute a successful campaign in 2016 to relieve the Ghanaian people from their sufferings and hardships. Ghanaians are looking up to us. \nGod bless the NPP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:12:46.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
