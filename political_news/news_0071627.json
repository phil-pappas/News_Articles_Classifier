Daniel Webster, R-Fla.\n\"It is clear that our constituents will simply not accept a continuation of the status quo, and that the viability of the Republican Party depends on whether we start listening to our voters and fighting to keep our promises,\" the group said in a statement.\n\"We accordingly believe that, under the present circumstances and without significant changes to Conference leadership and process, Rep.
