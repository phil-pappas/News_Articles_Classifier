More Latin American revolutionary tide on turn \nAugusto Nardes, the judge who led the investigation into irregularities in last year’s federal budget told the FT that the probe would now also examine this year’s accounts. \nMr Nardes, a judge at the TCU , the national accounts tribunal that scrutinises the budget of Brazil’s federal government, presided over a historic ruling by the body this month to reject its 2014 accounts — the first time it has done so since it was founded in the 1930s. The opposition hopes to use the decision as the basis for an impeachment process against the president. \nMr Nardes said the TCU had received a new case from public prosecutors alleging that in the first half of this year the government had continued using the same practices that led it to reject last year’s accounts. These included artificially reducing the budget deficit by using state bank loans to pay for social welfare programmes. \n“This has to stop, because continuing to use the money from the banks without authorisation from Congress [to pay budgetary expenses] is against the law,” he said. \nIf confirmed, the new allegations could be used to reinforce the opposition’s case for Ms Rousseff’s impeachment, analysts say. \nBrazil’s economy is facing its deepest recession since the 1930s, with the end of the commodities supercycle and a growing political and fiscal crisis worsened by a corruption scandal at state-owned oil company Petrobras . \nMs Rousseff is under fire for allegedly using so-called accounting tricks, or pedaladas , to disguise the true state of the government’s finances last year. ©AFP Augusto Nardes hears evidence in a court session considering Brazil's 2014 accounts \nIn rejecting the government’s accounts, the TCU identified R$106bn ($27bn) in expenses by Ms Rousseff’s administration last year that were not properly accounted for. \nAfter winning re-election in October last year following a campaign asserting the economy was in good shape, the president embarked on a fiscal austerity programme to try to rebalance Brazil’s sinking public finances. \nThe opposition alleges that Ms Rousseff broke Brazil’s fiscal responsibility law by hiding liabilities for social programmes on the books of state banks rather than funding them directly from the budget, and wants to use this as grounds to impeach her. \nMs Rousseff has argued that previous governments used the same accounting methods. “The same practices, that today are called pedaladas , were done by all governments prior to me,” she said last week. \nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, her predecessor and mentor, last week lent a populist note to the debate when he was reported in local media as saying Ms Rousseff only engaged in the accounting practices to safeguard important social welfare programmes such as Bolsa Família, a monthly stipend for millions of poor families. \nMs Rousseff’s government had sought an injunction against the participation of Mr Nardes in this month’s decision on the 2014 accounts in an attempt to derail the process. The Supreme Court turned down the application and the TCU voted unanimously to reject the accounts. \nIt is now up to Congress to vote on whether to use the TCU decision as a basis to impeach Ms Rousseff. The president’s ruling PT party last week moved to head off this possibility by launching a campaign to oust Eduardo Cunha, the house speaker, who has the power to start the impeachment process and is aligned with the opposition.
