The Observer Research Foundation Mumbai, along with Nehru Centre and Penguin Books India, is organising a function to launch the book 'Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider's Account of Pakistan's Foreign Policy' by Kasuri, in Mumbai on October 12 at the Hall of Culture, Nehru Centre, Worli.\n\"Our purpose in organising this function is to make our own humble contribution to the much-needed normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan. Kasuri's widely appreciated book shows his strong commitment to peaceful and cooperative ties between our two countries,\" ORF Chairman Sudheendra Kulkarni said. \"The launch of the book will be accompanied by a panel discussion, in which the speakers are: A G Noorani, eminent jurist, historian and author; Naseeruddin Shah, renowned film and theatre personality; and Dileep Padgaonkar, eminent journalist and columnist,\" Kulkarni, who will moderate the talk, said.\nDuring his stay in Mumbai between October 11 and 14, Kasuri, besides attending the book launch function, will also visit Mani Bhavan and Jinnah House if possible, he said. Kasuri will also meet veteran movie star Dilip Kumar at his residence.\nIn a letter to Fadnavis, Kulkarni asked the state government to provide adequate and fool-proof security to Kasuri during his stay here.\nSecurity for Kasuri has become all the more necessary in view of the condemnable episode a few days ago when a concert in Mumbai by Ghulam Ali, the famous ghazal maestro from Pakistan, was called off because of the Shiv Sena's threat to the organisers of the event, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:32:25.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
