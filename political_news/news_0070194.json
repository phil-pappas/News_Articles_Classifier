Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer are among the Federal Open Market Committee's more dovish members, who are stressing patience with respect to interest rates.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 8, 2015 | 4:35 p.m. EDT + More All but one member of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep interest rates at near-zero levels in September, kicking the liftoff can down the road to either October, December or sometime next year, according to minutes from last month's FOMC meeting, which were released Thursday.\nThe lone holdout was Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker, who had previously spoken out against his colleagues' decision to delay interest rate normalization.\nRELATED\nIs the U.S. Due for Another Recession? \"I dissented because I believe that an increase in our interest rate target is needed, given current economic conditions and the medium-term outlook,\" Lacker said in a statement released shortly after the FOMC decided last month not to raise U.S. interest rates for the first time since 2006. \"Such exceptionally low real interest rates are unlikely to be appropriate for an economy with persistently strong consumption growth and tightening labor markets.\"\nDespite Lacker's dissent, the nine other voting members of the FOMC were sufficiently spooked by international uncertainty, market softening and disappointingly low inflation.\n\"The committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information confirming that the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolstering members' confidence that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent over the medium term,\" the minutes said.\n\"Many\" members of the committee said they expect their economic confidence to be restored by incoming data before the end of the year, according to the minutes. Most FOMC participants simply didn't think September was the right time to make a move, but still expect liftoff will come before 2016.\nFewer FOMC participants favored a 2015 rate hike in September than in June. However, \"several members\" expressed concern over \"downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation,\" the minutes said. And only 13 of the 17 members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and Federal Reserve bank presidents said 2015 was the right year for a rate hike in September, according to the Fed's so-called dot plot released last month. Fifteen members of that group said the same in June, only a few months ago, showing that seemingly deteriorating economic conditions have pushed two more members away from a 2015 rate hike.\nInflation is an obvious deterrent to a rate liftoff, considering longer-term price stability is a fundamental priority for the Fed as part of its dual mandate. Most officials expect inflation to eventually return to the Fed's 2 percent objective at some point in the next several months, and many have said they'd be prepared to move on interest rates as long as there's evidence that inflation is on the right track.\nSo far, though, there doesn't seem to be much evidence that's the case. Some speculate it could be years until prices stabilize.\nRELATED\nFederal Reserve Stands Pat on Interest Rates as an Anxious World Waits \"Most FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the committee's 2 percent target by the end of 2017. My own forecast is less sanguine,\" Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said recently at a Marquette University Business Leaders Forum in Milwaukee. Evans said he expects core inflation \"to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues, and reach just below 2 percent only by the end of 2018.\"\nEvans is among a pool of Fed officials who have doubts about the current health of the domestic and global economies. Their numbers could potentially grow when the FOMC meets at the end of October, considering the only major jobs report released between the September and October meetings was overwhelmingly disappointing.\nThe U.S. economy tacked on only 142,000 jobs last month, well shy of the 200,000-addition threshold analysts were hoping for. And August's initially underwhelming 173,000 new positions were revised down even further to 136,000. So the predominantly sterling labor market Fed officials have often cited as evidence of strong economic growth trembled over the last two months, seemingly reinforcing the Fed's decision to hold off on a rate hike. And many now think an October liftoff is almost certainly out of the question.\n\"From the Fed's perspective – I imagine they are thinking one word: 'Phew! Thank goodness we bypassed September,'\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a research note Friday. \"With two consecutive months of significant headline weakness, in our opinion, October is very much off the table.\"\nRELATED\nParticipation Rate Lowest in Decades in Disastrous Jobs Report International volatility has also stayed the Fed's hand. China was explicitly mentioned six times in the minutes, which is uncommonly frequent. But gross domestic product contractions in Brazil, Japan, Canada and Taiwan were also cited as contributors to international economic confusion.\nWith the FOMC minutes offering few surprises and painting a relatively solid picture of the U.S. economy, markets shot up Thursday afternoon. But stocks haven't responded particularly well to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding interest rates, which complicates the Fed's job as they try to normalize America's monetary policy while minimizing external harm.\n\"I think market participants want to have sort of a univariate version of how the world works. If 'X' happens, then 'Y' follows. But the fact is, 'X' isn't one thing. It's many, many different things,\" William Dudley, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president and vice chairman of the FOMC, said last month in an interview with The Wall Street Journal . \"What's happening to the dollar, what's happening to international developments, what's happening to commodity prices – all affect the economic outlook, as do domestic economic developments.\"\nTAGS: Federal Reserve interest rates economy", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/pro/centralbanking/livevideo/dudley_breakfast", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Fed%20Minutes%20Show%20Lone%20Hawk%20Battling%20Doves%20Over%20Interest%20Rates", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Fed%20Minutes%20Show%20Lone%20Hawk%20Battling%20Doves%20Over%20Interest%20Rates&summary=Fed%20officials%20are%20hardly%20unanimous%20in%20their%20economic%20assessments%2C%20meeting%20minutes%20from%20the%20Federal%20Open%20Market%20Committee%20show.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Fed%20Minutes%20Show%20Lone%20Hawk%20Battling%20Doves%20Over%20Interest%20Rates", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0n2k%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20150917.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:45:58.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
