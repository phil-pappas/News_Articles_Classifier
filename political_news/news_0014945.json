The Conservatives' election manifesto promised to hold a referendum (a nationwide vote) on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. They won the election so it's all systems go.\nWhat is a referendum? A referendum is basically a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part, normally giving a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of all votes cast is considered to have won.\nWhat is the European Union? The European Union is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries . It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a \"single market\" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, its own parliament and it now sets the rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment , transport , consumer rights and even things like mobile phone charges .\nWhen will the EU referendum happen? The one thing we know for sure is that Prime Minister David Cameron has said it will happen by the end of 2017. The most likely times of the year for referendums are generally May or September, and some people think it should be held as soon as possible. There had been suggestions that it could be held in May 2016, to coincide with elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London , rather than waiting for 2017 - but the government has ruled that out. Here is a full rundown of the likely dates and key events .\nWhy not just hold the referendum now? When David Cameron announced in January 2013 his pledge to hold a referendum , a key element was that he would seek to make changes to the way the European Union works - or at least the rules covering the UK as a European Union member. Only once this renegotiation of British membership had been completed would he put the new arrangement to the public vote.\nWhat about political opposition to a referendum? During the election the Lib Dems and Labour both said they did not want a referendum unless there were plans to transfer more powers from the UK to the EU. Labour has since dropped its opposition, so the Conservatives are expected to get their Referendum Bill passed easily. The House of Lords could delay it, but as the referendum was promised in the Conservative election manifesto (a manifesto is a document setting out what a party would do if they won the election) it is not likely to reject the bill once MPs back it.\nWhat will the referendum question be? The question is always crucial in any referendum. The 2013 suggestion from the Conservatives was: \"Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. Yes or no \". Some people thought this phrasing leaned too far towards the status quo - the current state of affairs - and the Electoral Commission, which has to approve the question, said it was not clear enough and proposed: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" The final decision will be made by MPs but Downing Street has accepted the amended wording.\nRead more: Does the wording of a referendum question matter?\nWho will be able to vote? British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens over 18 who are resident in the UK, along with UK nationals who have lived overseas for less than 15 years. Members of the House of Lords and Commonwealth citizens in Gibraltar will also be eligible, unlike in a general election. Citizens from EU countries - apart from Ireland, Malta and Cyprus - will not get a vote.\nWhat reforms is David Cameron hoping to make? Mr Cameron is not revealing the full details of what he wants from the other EU leaders ahead of negotiations - but he is expected to demand an opt-out from one of its core principles of forging an \"ever-closer union\" between member states. He will also try to get restrictions on welfare benefits - in particular, tax credits - for migrants and more powers to block or opt out of new EU laws.\nRead more: Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe\nWhy is a referendum being held? Britain had a referendum in 1975 shortly after it had joined the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called. The country voted to stay in then but there have been growing calls, from the public and politicians, for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years, with many more countries joining and the organisation extending its control over more aspects of daily lives. David Cameron initially resisted these calls but in 2013 he changed his mind.\nWho wants the UK to leave the EU? About 40% of the British public, according to the latest opinion polls . The UK Independence Party, which won the last European elections, and received nearly four million votes, 13% of those cast, in May's general election, campaigns for Britain's exit from the EU. A fair number of Conservative MPs - and several Labour ones - are also in favour of leaving. There are two main campaign groups. Read more about them.\nWhy do they want the UK to leave? They believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say imposes too many rules on business and charges billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also want Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to work. One of the main principles of EU membership is \"free movement\", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. They also object to the idea of \"ever closer union\" and the belief that the ultimate goal is to create a \"United States of Europe\".\nWho wants the UK to stay in the EU? David Cameron wants Britain to stay in the EU, once he has got some powers back from it. He has so far refused to say whether he would start calling for Britain to leave if he does not get what he wants from the other EU leaders. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in. The latest YouGov opinion poll suggests 38% of the British public agree with them.\nWhy do they want the UK to stay? They believe Britain gets a big boost from EU membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argue, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also believe Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving.\nSo would Britain be better in or out? It depends which way you look at it - or what you believe is important. Leaving the EU would be a big step - arguably far more important than who wins the next general election - but would it set the nation free or condemn it to economic ruin? Here is a rundown of the arguments for and against.\nWhat about businesses? Big business - with a few exceptions - tends to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. BT chairman Sir Mike Rake, who until earlier this year was CBI president, says there are \"no credible alternatives\" to staying in the EU. But others disagree, such as Lord Bamford, chairman of JCB, who says an EU exit would allow the UK to negotiate trade deals as our country \"rather than being one of 28 nations\". Many small- and medium-sized firms would welcome a cut in red tape and what they see as petty regulations, but a lot hangs on what deal Mr Cameron renegotiates. The British Chambers of Commerce says 55% of members back staying in a reformed EU.\nFind out more:\nBusiness for Britain wants big changes to the UK's relations with the EU and says the UK should be prepared to vote to leave if the changes are not achieved\nBusiness for New Europe is a coalition of business leaders who support the UK's membership of the EU and \"oppose withdrawal to the margins\".\nWhat are the rules likely to be for campaigning? The Electoral Commission will be in charge of making sure it's a fair contest. There will be official campaigns on both sides, selected by the Commission, which will have to abide by strict spending limits. Anyone wanting to launch their own campaign will have to register with the Commission if they plan to spend more than £10,000. They must be UK-based. The Commission says MPs should decide what kinds of organisations should be allowed to take part. Business groups, trade unions and pressure groups are all likely to want to have their say. There will also be rules to prevent organisations trying to get round the spending limits through multiple registrations. Political parties, and individual MPs, will also be allowed to campaign for the result they want to see. However, the government has been forced to back down over plans to suspend the rules preventing ministers using public money to publicise information backing either side of the argument. In the face of criticism from Eurosceptic MPs, Downing Street said it would abide by existing \"purdah\" rules in place since 2000 with certain exemptions.\nAnyone who runs an unregistered campaign will be limited to spending less than £10,000. The idea is to prevent wealthy foreigners, companies or governments trying to influence the outcome. The Electoral Commission has published preliminary guidelines.\nSo who is going to be leading the rival sides in the campaign? That is yet to be decided and will partly depend on what Mr Cameron achieves in his renegotiation of the terms of the UK's membership of the EU. He says he is confident he can get what he wants, in which case he would be expected to lead the \"staying in\" side. The highest profile supporter of leaving the EU is UKIP leader Nigel Farage, but he has said that although he wants to play a leading role in the campaign it would be better for someone with no \"political baggage\" such as a figure from the world of sport or entertainment to lead it. Former Labour minister Alan Johnson is to lead Labour's own campaign to stay in the EU but has said he will not share a platform with David Cameron.\nThat all sounds interesting - but I want to find out more...
