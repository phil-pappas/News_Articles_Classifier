The longtime academic turned financial-crisis-fireman lets loose on the Wall Street executives he was forced to essentially bail out as he tried to keep the world economy back from the brink of collapse.\n“I kept my emotions in check and tried to view the situation analytically, as a problem to be solved. But once I fully understood how irresponsible (or clueless) AIG’s executives had been, I seethed,” Bernanke wrote about dealing with the downfall of the American International Group, which eventually received almost $185 billion in various forms of federal aid.\nThe book “The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath,” which was obtained by the Associated Press , is a 600-page reflection on the 2007-2009 crisis that suddenly thrust economic leaders around the world into an all-out panic mode, cobbling together solutions to prop up many of the world's largest financial institutions.\nBernanke described the failed attempts to save investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 as a “terrible, surreal moment.”\n“We were staring into the abyss,” he said about the negotiations.\nHe also notes that the taxpayer bailouts were widely unpopular, but according to the AP, the book becomes somewhat of a defense of the practice and the economic rehabilitation program.\nBut Bernanke shares some lighter moments too.\nHe said when things got tough, he looked at a Quote: from Abraham Lincoln that the Fed’s parking-garage manager had given to him. “If I were to try to read, much less answer all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business,” it started.\nIn 2012, when then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry was campaigning for president, he called the Fed’s practices “almost treasonous.” Perry said if Bernanke continued to print more money “we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas.”\nBernanke made it a point to travel to Texas after Perry’s predictions where he was happy to report people did not treat him “ugly.”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.seattletimes.com/business/in-memoir-bernanke-recalls-lehmans-surreal-failure/"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:40:39.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
