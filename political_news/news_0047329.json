The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has also allowed for similar claims.\nTherabron's lead product candidate, CG100, is currently being developed for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidities (CRM) in preterm infants. The Company also has activities underway to support its goal of submitting a second IND in 2016 to investigate CG100 in patients being treated in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) where pathogen infections such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus can sometimes lead toward respiratory failure.\n\"We continue to pursue a robust intellectual property strategy and this patent allowance provides additional protections for our Recombinant Secretoglobin Platform program, which is currently supported by a growing list of potential regulatory and patent related exclusivities,\" said Dr. Thomas F. Miller , Therabron President and Chief Operating Officer. \"While we remain focused on completing enrollment of our phase 2 study in preterm infants at risk for CRM by the end of this year, this new exclusivity will support and protect our next program in the PICU.\"\nAbout Therabron Therapeutics, Inc.\nTherabron Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, founded in 2007 and located in Rockville , MD. Therabron is focused on the development of protein therapeutics to address respiratory disease. The company's product candidates aim to restore the natural immune balance in the lungs of respiratory patients through the administration of synthetic human CC10 proteins. The family of CC10 proteins, also known as secretoglobins, have the potential to change the course of acute and chronic respiratory diseases, representing large markets into which few truly novel drugs have been introduced. Therabron's product candidates have the potential to be first-in-class, disease-modifying, breakthrough biologic therapeutics.
