The party's state committee plans to meet Saturday in Salina to select the new leader. \nKinch said during an interview this week that he would focus as chairman on fundraising, recruiting candidates and picking up seats in the Legislature. The 76-year-old Kinch is a former party vice chairman and Democratic National Committee member. \nFormer Chairman Larry Meeker resigned in August after less than six months on the job. Meeker upset other Democrats by talking about rebranding the state party and distancing it from national Democrats.
