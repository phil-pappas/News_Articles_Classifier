Bobby Jindal's administration from terminating the organization's Medicaid contract, which allows it to collect payment for treating thousands of patients in New Orleans.\nThe Houston-based organization, which also operates a clinic in Baton Rouge, filed its second request for an injunction Wednesday (Oct. 7). The filing asks a judge to deny the Jindal administration's decision to terminate the contract rather than seek an administrative appeal.\nThe Jindal administration has filed two notices of termination to Planned Parenthood; the most recent accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking administrative rules and was subject to an appeal that could have been pursued without involving the courts.\nBut when Planned Parenthood headed to court last month to appeal the first notice of termination, it noted its patients do not have a right to an administrative appeal. Three unnamed patients were named as plaintiffs in that injunction, just as they are in this latest filing.\nThe organization notes its Medicaid contracts expire on Oct. 17 and Oct. 18, \"immediately disqualifying (Planned Parenthood) from providing basic and preventive health care services to over 5,200 Louisiana women and men,\" according to Planned Parenthood's filing. It goes on to say the Jindal administration's \"actions will cause significant and irreparable harm to (Planned Parenthood) and to its Medicaid patients, including (the unnamed patients) who will lose their provider of choice.\"\nThe Jindal administration began looking for ways to terminate Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding after a series of videos were released depicting Planned Parenthood Federation of America representatives discussing fetal body parts and their use in medical research. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast does not perform abortions in Louisiana and has said it does not have a fetal body part donation program in Texas.\nEven so, Jindal has been harshly critical of the organization and has discussed his efforts to take public money away the organization while on the campaign trail in Iowa. His administration, through the Department of Health and Hospitals, has said it has grounds to terminate the organization's contract as the result of a settlement in Texas that required the nonprofit to repay money it collected for services it didn't perform.\nThe organization didn't admit wrongdoing in that case. Louisiana does not consider it a violation of state rules if a Medicaid provider agrees to settle a similar case without admitting liability.\nPlanned Parenthood says in its court filing the second termination \"is baseless and unsupported as a matter of fact and law,\" and does not relate to Planned Parenthood's \"competence to provide services in Louisiana's Medicaid program.\"\nThe injunction goes on to accuse Jindal of running a \"campaign against abortion and to punish abortion providers, even though the only services (Planned Parenthood) provides in Louisiana are family planning and other preventative health services.\" While that is true, Planned Parenthood opponents have pointed out that the organization has plans to build an abortion clinic in New Orleans.\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for the state health department said, \"We are still reviewing the filing, however, the department's position on Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast has not changed. We will continue to pursue the termination of their Medicaid provider status.\"\n. . . . . . Kevin Litten is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
