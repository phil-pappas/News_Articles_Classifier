(Photo: DC/files) Mumbai: Opposition Congress on Saturday asked Maharashtra's BJP government to refrain from bringing politics in welfare schemes over its move to rename the Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana after Sena supremo (late) Bal Thackeray.\nIn a letter to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, state unit Congress president Ashok Chavan has suggested that the government should focus on improving the quality and scope of the Yojana so that the maximum number of citizens get healthcare facilities.\n\"Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee scheme was a flagship programme of the Congress regime to provide healthcare to economically backward people. In the last few years, the scheme has benefitted large sections of the society. Renaming the scheme by making minor changes would be inappropriate,\" Chavan said.\nThe former chief minister stated that there were many complaints about the implementation of the scheme in the last one year.\nHe said another ambitious scheme titled \"108 Ambulance Service\" is also not being carried out properly.\n\"Instead of indulging in politics over changing names, the government can do well to ensure that welfare projects are implemented properly and there are no complaints,\" Chavan added.\nMeanwhile, Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam also wrote to Fadnavis expressing opposition to the proposal to rename the Yojana.\n\"Rajivji was a popular leader and former PM. Sentiments of majority of people are attached to his name and hence the scheme was named after him. The BJP-Sena government can start a new welfare programme and name it after Bal Thackeray and\nCongress will not oppose it,\" he said.\n Maharashtra govt Health scheme Bal Thackeray nation Also Read Karnataka: Denotification back to haunt BS Yeddyurappa, 4 FIRs filed Raising subsidised Parliament canteen food issue a 'conspiracy': Samajwadi Party MP Tamil Nadu: Man returns from Guinea, kept under observation for Ebola Govt says optimistic on GST target, blames Congress for roadblocks", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151017/nation-politics/article/congress-slams-maharashtra-govt-over-renaming-health-scheme", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Devendra%20Fadnavis_0_1_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Devendra%20Fadnavis_0_1_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:26:47.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
