Graham Tidy Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Senator Arthur Sinodinos has effectively criticised the former Abbott government's tax policies, saying the change to Malcolm Turnbull would allow a 'breakthrough' on tax reform and how it is funded.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey was slammed for flagging personal incomes tax cuts without explaining how the federal government would cover the cost, considering their pledge to move the budget back to surplus.\nSenator Sinodinos dismissed Mr Abbott's claims that \"nothing had changed\" under the new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, saying the tone of government and their policies had and will change.\n\"In terms of policies that will change, the very fact we are now talking about how we have more degrees of freedom for what we do on the tax front, potentially gives us a better opportunity to find the money we need to fund real tax reform, for me that is a breakthrough,\" he said.\nSenator Sinodinos said the new government was in a better position than Mr Abbott's government to persuade the public of the need for tax reform.\n\"We have to be in a position to persuade [the public] it is in their interest and you can't do that if you don't have sources of revenue to help fund potential tax cuts,\" he said.\nOn Thursday, Mr Turnbull convened a three hour summit of business, industry, unions and community groups, who gave the government the green light to target tax concessions, including those on superannuation, as part of a reform package it will take to the next federal election.\nMr Sinodinos also said Mr Abbott should stay in politics if he felt he had not fulfilled his potential.\n \"If you still have a contribution, feel you still got a contribution to make to politics, by all means do so,\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:11:05.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
