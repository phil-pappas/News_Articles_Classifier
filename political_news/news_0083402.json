At the same time we have mental health services and regional police offices closing down because they can’t get funding, taxpayers’ cash is being made available for floral arrangements. \n\"The Government surely needs to rethink its priorities,\" Kris Faafoi says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
