However a more comprehensive focus on the links between suicide, deprivation and family violence/childhood abuse is also called for. \n\"At the moment it seems we are not joining all the dots. If we act collectively - that is agencies working alongside communities - on the red flags, then we should be able to make more of an impact on those awful statistics. \n\"It might be a cliché, but fewer people die on our roads than die by suicide. If any one of those deaths can be prevented, then that’s one less devastated family,\" Jacinda Ardern says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:31:45.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
