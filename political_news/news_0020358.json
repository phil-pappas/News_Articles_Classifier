(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register) Buy Photo \nTed Cruz knows how to play to a conservative crowd. \nThe Texas Republican, often referred to as a firebrand or insurgent in the U.S. Senate, has filled his stump speeches with jokes geared for those on the right side of the political spectrum. \nRepeated again and again at his campaign stops, Cruz takes shots at the president and the press, the seemingly upside-down nature of Washington, D.C., and even riffs on current events. \nIt almost always pays off, rewarding Cruz with a bout of laughter from the audience. \nWhile they may vary slightly from stop to stop, Cruz tends to keep his jokes, like his stump speech, largely the same. Cruz has potential in Iowa, but others stand in the way \nHere are some of Cruz's most common jokes from the campaign trail, as they were heard at a Fort Dodge stop Monday: \n1. \"I spent most of last week in Washington, D.C., so it is great to be back in America.\" Context : A classic opening line for Cruz, it's an easy way to welcome the crowd at his town halls while playing off of the alleged other-worldliness of the nation's capital. \n2. \"There are 365 days in a year, four years in a presidential term, four years in a second term. By the end of eight years, there are going to be a whole lot of newspaper reporters and editors and journalists who have checked themselves into therapy.\" Context : Before delivering this line, Cruz has laid out his five-point plan for his first day in office. That plan includes \"ripping to shreds\" the Iranian nuclear deal, ordering the investigation and prosecution of Planned Parenthood, and more. \n3. \"The press is constantly asking folks, ‘well, who do you want to be Speaker of the House?’ ... You know, if they keep pressing for a name, all right, fine, I’ll give you a name for the next speaker of the house: How about (radio host) Mark Levin? ... Can you imagine Mark Levin as speaker going to Mitch McConnell, going ‘Mitch, we’re not gonna do it! We’re just not!’ Now that would be some strong leadership.\" Context : This is a more recent addition to Cruz's repertoire, referencing the problems the U.S. House is having finding someone to replace John Boehner as speaker. Cruz accompanies the end of this line with an full-throated impression of the conservative talk radio host, usually yelling at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \n4. \"There are 90,000 employees at the IRS. We need to padlock the building and put all 90,000 on our southern border. Now, to my friends in the media, I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek. But if you think about it, imagine you traveled thousands of miles in the blazing sun, you’re swimming across the Rio Grande and the first thing you see is 90,000 IRS agents. You’d turn around and go home, too.\" Context : A classic from the start of Cruz's campaign, this joke fits in with the senator's talk of abolishing the IRS and his plans to secure the nation's border with Mexico. \n5. \"The day before, the press conference at The White House, was a little awkward. Every time the reporters addressed a question to ‘Your Holiness,’ Obama would answer. The next day President Xi of China was in Washington to meet with President Obama. News outlets across the globe reported on this momentous meeting between the world’s most powerful communist and the president of China.\" Context : Also a more recent addition, Cruz starts out this line by talking about the Pope's visit to D.C.
