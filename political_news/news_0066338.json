How much? More than 95 per cent of those surveyed indicated they were \"very satisfied\" with the care they received. Just one per cent were \"neither satisfied nor unsatisfied\" with the experience.\nCanadians also love pharmacy flu vaccinations due to the speed and convenience. Ninety per cent of survey respondents walked in without an appointment and 88 per cent reported waiting less than 10 minutes for their vaccination. Seventy-one per cent of respondents said they chose the pharmacy because of its convenient location.\n\"The success of the pharmacy flu vaccination program has important public health impacts that result in more Canadians being protected against this under-estimated disease,\" said Denise Carpenter , President and Chief Executive officer of Neighbourhood Pharmacies. \"That means fewer people suffering, reduced healthcare costs resulting from hospitalizations and reduced economic losses from time away from work, including deaths.\"\nSlightly more than half of those who received a flu vaccination at a neighbourhood pharmacy this last season were new to the experience. While 20 per cent of those surveyed didn't get a flu vaccination last season, even more – 29 per cent – switched to neighbourhood pharmacy from another kind of vaccination provider, such as public health clinic, workplace clinic or doctor's office.\nLooking ahead to the next flu season, more than 80 per cent said they planned to return to the same pharmacy, while only five per cent of respondents indicated they plan to go back to their previous provider. Approximately 10 per cent indicated they are uncertain as to their choice of flu vaccine provider.\nAbout Neighbourhood Pharmacies\nThe Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada (Neighbourhood Pharmacies) is the voice and advocate for the business of pharmacy in Canada , representing the owners and operators of Canada's leading drug store brands and serving Canadians through chain, banner and franchised neighbourhood pharmacies, as well as grocery chains and mass merchandisers with pharmacies.\nAbout our research\nThe Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada Pharmacy Influenza Vaccination Survey was conducted by MPI Research from November 2014 to February 2015. Seventy-three pharmacies in British Columbia , Alberta and Ontario participated, by giving the paper-based survey to patients who had just received a flu shot in the pharmacy. Patients completed the survey by hand, and placed their response into a sealed envelope. No patient identifying information was collected. In total, 1,610 valid surveys were returned to MPI Research.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C7359&Transmission_Id=201510150600CANADANWWEB______C7359&DateId=20151015", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:36:29.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
