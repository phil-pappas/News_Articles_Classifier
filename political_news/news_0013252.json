The program, MedStartUp , builds on several years of trans-Atlantic cooperation between the two organizations to strengthen commercial partnerships that bridge the traditional silos between government, industry and academia; defray the growing complexity and cost burden of R&D; and promote cross-border trade, jobs and economic growth. The program will be sponsored by Medidata, a leading global provider of cloud-based solutions for clinical research in life sciences.\n\"The new partnership with Business France advances the Foundation's mission – to improve the state of human health,\" said Bruno Cohen , Chairman of the Galien Foundation. \"Our organizations are aligned in recognizing the importance of life science innovation, and MedStartUp will generate meaningful global business opportunities, bringing together talent from the two major research centers of excellence in biopharmaceuticals – the US and Europe .\"\nMedStartUp will involve more than 250 executives and researchers from the US, France and other countries, and will take place on October 27-28 at the Alexandria Center for Life Sciences in New York . The program's mission is to foster innovative research partnerships among pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device manufacturers, vaccines producers, academic research institutes, and healthcare organizations, including e-health vendors. A focal point of the initiative is the active participation of more than 50 innovative startups based in France who are seeking US partners to share research and support global commercial development of their lead product candidates.\nIn addition to one-on-one meetings among participating companies, on October 27 th , the Galien Foundation will also host a panel of corporate venture capital experts from Pfizer, Orbimed Advisors and the Accelerator Corporation to discuss current best practices in financing successful life science startups. Joel Marcus , CEO and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which develops and operates a global network of life science incubator facilities, including one in New York , will moderate the session. The program will convene in conjunction with The Annual Galien Forum, a full-day symposium, held under the patronage of four Nobel laureates.\nMedStartUp will be followed by the development of a number of collaborative R&D projects based on the investor meetings, which will be presented for review in June 2016 in front of a distinguished selection committee of eight industry CEOs and R&D leaders. Chaired by Roche board director and former Wyeth Pharmaceuticals CEO Bernard Poussot , the group will nominate nine candidates in four award categories:\nBest breakthrough therapy collaboration/partnership with an academic institution Best innovative clinical trial design Best use of patient-centered health engagement technology Best collaboration/partnership in a breakthrough therapy or diagnosis geared towards developing countries Following six months of strategic and logistical support for project implementation provided by Business France, the MedStartUp Awards will be presented at the Prix Galien US Annual Gala in October 2016 .\n\"In a highly competitive world, the early identification of strategic partners has become critical to commercial success in biopharmaceuticals. MedStartUp represents a unique combination of private enterprise and government advocacy that will deliver the energy, focus and resources we need to confront the rising global burden of disease,\" said Awards Jury Chair Bernard Poussot . \"I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues from the US and Europe to identify opportunities from this research and showcase what government and industry can do together, not only in accelerating the pace of innovation but recommending ways to improve regulatory, infrastructure and financial incentives for greater collaboration.\"\nBryan Spielman , Executive Vice President of Medidata, sponsor of the MedStartUp program, added: \"The complexity of 21 st century biology-from translational research to precision medicine to integrated healthcare-underlies its critical dependence on new, innovative technologies.
