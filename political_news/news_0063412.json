Zimbabwe's police and the National Prosecuting Authority had cleared Palmer of wrongdoing, she said.\nThrough an adviser, Palmer declined comment.\nPalmer was identified as the man who killed Cecil in a bow hunt. Cecil, a resident of Hwange National park in western Zimbabwe, was well-known to tourists and researchers for his distinctive black mane.\nMuchinguri-Kashiri had said in July that Zimbabwean police and prosecutors would work to get Palmer returned to Zimbabwe to face poaching charges.\nOn Monday, she told reporters in Harare that Palmer can now safely return to Zimbabwe as a \"tourist\" because he had not broken this wildlife-rich southern African country's hunting laws.\n\"He is free to come, not for hunting, but as a tourist,\" Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri told reporters. \"It turned out that Palmer came to Zimbabwe because all the papers were in order.\"\nPalmer was the subject of extradition talk in Zimbabwe and a target of protests in the United States, particularly in Minnesota, where he has a dental practice, after he was identified as the man who killed Cecil the lion in a bow hunt. Cecil roamed in Hwange National Park in western Zimbabwe.\nMessages left Monday with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which was handling a U.S. investigation into Palmer, were not immediately returned.\nTheo Bronkhorst, a Zimbabwean professional hunter who was a guide for Palmer, returned to court last week on charges of allowing an illegal hunt. His lawyer Perpetua Dube argued that the charges are too vague and should be dropped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:50:21.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
