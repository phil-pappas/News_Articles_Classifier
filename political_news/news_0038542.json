Siriporn Puttachat, 63, Nai Pee's niece, said the family, including his son Kolit Polchan, will collect Nai Pee's handwritten notes, his books, his poems and his belongings to display in a museum at Wat Mahadhat Woraviharn, where his ashes are being kept for annual merit making. The temple abbot plans to build the new museum early next year and would spare some space to display Nai Pee's exhibition. He said the younger generations could learn more about Thai political history. Nai Pee was known as one of the intellectual leaders of the politically turbulent 1970s, when a large number of students fled to the jungle and joined the communism doctrine. His poetry is well known through a melodic song called Duen Pen (Full Moon), through which his thoughts of home are conveyed in beautifully poetic words. The family is also thinking of contributing his items to the October 14 Monument at Kokwoa intersection to educate the public about his life and work, Siriporn said. 791 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:11:39.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
