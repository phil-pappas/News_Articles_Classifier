The full City Council is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the proposal. Construction could begin as early as the spring and the museum could be operating by 2019 or 2020.\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks has sued the park district, arguing the museum will violate the public trust because it will be built on reclaimed land that was once Lake Michigan. It also asserts the museum is not in residents' best interests.\nLucas chose to build in Chicago over San Francisco.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:51:29.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
