David Vitter now tells an investigative blogger that the politician fathered a child with her, but statements by Wendy Ellis in some legal documents cast doubt on some of her claim. More \nSean Illing , who now writes for Salon.com, published the article Thursday as the Oct. 24 primary election nears. In the race for governor, Republican Sen. David Vitter and Democrat state Rep. John Bel Edwards lead in a field of nine candidates. \n\"While it's unlikely that Louisiana becomes a blue state anytime soon, there are some compelling indicators that the political winds are shifting,\" Illing writes. \nLink: Read full column here \nIlling draws on some of the national issues the GOP has recently faced, like demographic shifts and an \"ungovernable congressional caucus.\" His article suggests that the Republican base lies in southern states like Louisiana, but is being challenged by Democratic candidates like Edwards. \nA recent survey by Public Policy Polling finds that while Vitter is still favored to make the runoff for governor, he trails Edwards 50 to 38. The polling firm suggests that Vitter's numbers have waned over the last year due to increasing unpopularity. \nLINK: Read full report from PPP \n\"These numbers make it clear that the landscape around the Louisiana gubernatorial race has changed dramatically,\" PPP said in a news release. \nIlling interviewed political commentator James Carville about the race for governor. Carville said Vitter and incumbent Gov. Bobby Jindal may be at fault for the changing political atmosphere in Louisiana. \n\"You have a horrifically unpopular incumbent governor (Bobby Jindal) and the likely Republican survivor (Vitter) is one of the most flawed candidates in American politics,\" Carville tells Illing. \nRead: Vitter's accuser claims pregnancy; Some claims contradicted by legal documents \nThe two looked at another race with a similar pattern: the campaign for Louisiana secretary of state, which pits incumbent Tom Schedler against Democratic candidate Chris Tyson. \nWhile there is little polling data, the numbers that do exist suggest a close race between the two. Carville said the national GOP's image has resulted in the competitive races. While he believes Tyson may not win the election, he said it's another good indication of the shifting political climate in the state. \n\"It'll be interesting to watch because it's a good barometer of what's possible in this political climate. The deck couldn't be stacked more in the Democrats' favor,\" Carville says. \nIlling ends his article with a comparison to Jindal and the national Republican Party. \n\"We have a lame-deck Republican governor who personifies the worst pathologies of contemporary conservatism -- the religious demagoguery, the fiscal recklessness, the obstructionism. In so many ways, Jindal exemplifies the new GOP -- and it's fitting that his failures are creating more favorable conditions for red state Democrats like Tyson and Edwards.\" \nYou can read the entire article and more from Illing online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:55.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
