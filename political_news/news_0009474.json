At least 50 percent of Americans -- including, needless to say, plenty of the folks Occupy Wall Street called the 99 percent -- love capitalism. And very, very few Americans -- only 3 percent -- think well of socialism. \nAmericans generally view socialists more negatively than Muslims and atheists, Cillizza wrote. \nSo if you've been impressed by Sanders' surge in the Iowa and New Hampshire Democratic presidential polls and have jumped on his bandwagon, enjoy it while it lasts, Cillizza wrote. He added: \n\"The simple political fact is that if Sanders did ever manage to win the Democratic presidential nomination -- a long shot but far from a no shot at this point -- Republicans would simply clip Sanders's answer to Todd above and put it in a 30-second TV ad. That would, almost certainly, be the end of Sanders's viability in a general election.\" \nUnless, if you accept President's Obama's analysis of the race, Trump is his opponent. \n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:48:35.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
