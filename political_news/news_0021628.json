So the Electoral Commission should listen,” he said. \nSince the NPP began this campaign for a new voters' register, some leading voices have weighed into the matter. The Ghana Catholics Bishop Conference says it favours a new register if evidence presented by the NPP is found to be true. \nAdding to the call, Former President Rawlings said \"there is a lot of stress , there is a lot of nervousness in the air. It is going to be a test on all of Ghanaians and the only way we can really contain and prevent things from getting out of hands is to ensure that the electoral register is as credible as possible.\" \nA stateswoman, Dr. Joyce Aryee aslo believes, a new voters' register will clear the controversy and cure any credibility concerns. \nmore soon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:33:58.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
