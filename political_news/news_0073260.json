Steve Fincher, a fierce advocate of export subsidies, is planning to take extraordinary measures to revive the Export-Import Bank, now in liquidation. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a candidate for House Speaker, will oppose Fincher's efforts, according to a spokesman.\nFincher's tactic, according to The Hill's Kevin Cirilli , is a \"discharge petition,\" by which any member can bring a bill to the House floor if he has the signatures of 218 members, a majority of the House.\nMcCarthy \"strongly opposes any effort to circumvent the committee process,\" McCarthy's office tells me. Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling wants Ex-Im to stay dead and has said he won't pass a reauthorization out of his committee.\nWill he try to stop Republican members from signing Fincher's petition? \"McCarthy strongly discourages participation in the discharge petition,\" the spokesman said.\n  That time the White House operator didn't believe it was Hillary Clinton wrote that she wanted to call then-Rep. Watson, but was fighting with the White House operator.\nBy David Brown â€¢ 09/30/15 4:30 PM Timothy P.
