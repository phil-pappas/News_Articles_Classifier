Maggie Hassan on Tuesday lashed out at U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, a day after she announced she is running for the Senate seat held by her Republican opponent. “(U.S. Sen.) Ted Cruz and Sen. Ayotte both want to defund Planned Parenthood,” Hassan said after an appearance at Alpha Loft in downtown Portsmouth. “They just would go about it a different way. Their positions are just the same.” Hassan went on to say Ayotte has been “against allowing women to make their own health-care decisions well before this most recent debate came up.” Ayotte voted in August to direct funding away from Planned Parenthood. However, Ayotte publicly criticized Cruz's efforts, saying she opposed his method to defund Planned Parenthood because it risked a government shutdown. Hassan’s comments about Ayotte’s stance on Planned Parenthood echoed a similar theme she stressed about why she decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat. Hassan contended that while New Hampshire has made progress on a number of issues important to the middle class — like growing the economy and freezing in-state tuition at the University of New Hampshire — they have not been supported by Ayotte. “When you look at Washington they’re not responding to those needs at all,” Hassan said Tuesday. “When I look at Sen. Ayotte’s voting record, she voted to cut Pell grants, (which are) so critical to middle class families, she’s (voted) to turn Medicare into a voucher system, (which is) so critical to our seniors, and she voted to defund Planned Parenthood at a time when women need access to affordable primary and preventative care.” She noted women need access to Planned Parenthood “to plan their futures and support their families.” “What I look at is the votes that have actually been taken and what a difference it would be if we had a response from Washington that voted the other way because that would really help middle class families. That’s why I’m running,” Hassan said. Ayotte's campaign released a statement in response to Hassan's comments on Tuesday afternoon. “Kelly’s long record of supporting women and families is clear. She cares deeply about ensuring all women have access to health services, which is why she’s worked to expand access to over the counter contraceptives, led efforts to protect access to mammograms, and voted to fund community health centers that provide key health services for New Hampshire women,\" her campaign spokesperson Chloe Rockow said Tuesday. Jennifer Horn, director of the state Republican Party, released a statement about Hassan. \"After years of failing to lead on the pressing issues facing New Hampshire, Gov. Hassan is trying to distract voters with the same tired attacks used by Washington Democrats,\" Horn said. \"The governor’s tax and spend policies have failed to keep and grow jobs in New Hampshire. She has failed to respond adequately to the growing heroin epidemic and she brought partisan gridlock to Concord with her needless and harmful budget veto. She should give up relying on desperate political attacks and start doing what’s right for the people of New Hampshire.” Asked if she would reach out to Ayotte to talk about setting a voluntary campaign spending limit in what is expected to be a high-profile national race, Hassan said, “I certainly am willing to discuss that. I have a record of wanting to make sure that campaigns are open and financing is fair, but it can’t just be one sided. “If she’s interested in doing that, it’s certainly something we can discuss,” Hassan said. Hassan decided to run, she said, because she is tired of seeing Washington dominated by special interests while the middle class has been neglected. “I see (Washington) has really aligned itself with special interests and against the middle class and one of the examples of that is you see a lot of this outside spending,” Hassan said of money from outside the state expected to pour into the Senate campaign. “But I also know that as I talk to the people of New Hampshire they stay focused on how we can move the state forward and get the kind of response that we want.” Hassan stressed she’s “comfortable” she’ll have the resources she needs “to make my case to the voters.” Asked about Ayotte’s decision in 2013 to vote against the The Manchin-Toomey proposal, which would have expanded background checks for gun buyers, requiring them for sales made at gun shows and online — Hassan said she would have voted for what she described as a “bipartisan background check bill.” The vote came in the wake of the December 2013 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where a lone gunman with a history of mental illness killed 20 first-graders and six adults. Hassan noted she supports “the Second Amendment right to responsibly own firearms, but we always need to be balancing that with public safety.” She pointed out she’s worked in New Hampshire to try to make sure “our background system gets information about people with serious mental illnesses.” Hassan called her choice to run for the U.S. Senate seat a “very difficult decision,” but said she’s been “very pleased about the response I’ve gotten across the state.”“I think it’s really important that we get the response from Washington that we need to support the middle class and to stop the special interests,” she said. She said potential gubernatorial candidates, such as Portsmouth City Councilor Stefany Shaheen, will continue the work she’s begun to grow the economy while “holding the line against a sales and income tax.” Hassan also stressed if elected to the Senate she will protect the “hard-earned” Social Security and Medicare benefits of state residents. Hassan said she believes the federal government can save money by allowing Medicare to negotiate on pharmaceutical prices like the VA and private insurance companies do. Visiting a nonprofit Hassan toured Alpha Loft in Portsmouth Tuesday with company Chief Executive Officer Mark Kaplan. The nonprofit works to help start-up companies get established, according to Joshua Cyr, the company’s director of education and acceleration. “Our mission is to support the founders of startups, specifically startups of high growth innovation businesses in New Hampshire,” Cyr said Tuesday morning. The company has offices in Manchester, Durham and Portsmouth, he said. “One of our big partners and sponsors is the state of New Hampshire, so we do quite a bit of work with various departments there,” he said.
