A forecast model shows the probability of hurricane-force winds hitting the U.S. mainland.\nBy Max Miceli Oct. 1, 2015 | 1:32 p.m. EDT + More Hurricane Joaquin is gaining steam and was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday. And while Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas could see rainfall of historic proportions in the coming days, it's still uncertain whether or not the hurricane itself will hit the U.S. directly.\nJoaquin rolled through the Bahamas on Thursday and has packed sustained winds of around 120 mph. The National Hurricane Center said the storm's hurricane-caliber winds persisted up to 35 miles outside the eye of the storm.\nJUST IN: 11aET Update: #Joaquin a strong CAT 3 w/ winds of 125mph, track shifted slightly east http://t.co/zEnvZX8SUg pic.twitter.com/Aw8fTlCYxH\n— The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) October 1, 2015\nAn AccuWeather.com forecast reported that Joaquin should strengthen enough to elicit an upgrade to Category 4 by the end of the day Thursday. While the storm isn't expected to hit Florida, the state could see life-threatening tides.\nJoaquin could, however, further worsen weather conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, where a separate storm system is expected to bring flooding and around 18 inches of rain to some areas already. The governors of New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency to prepare for the possibility.\n\"The forecast of up to 10 inches of rain in areas across Virginia could result in floods, power outages and a serious threat to life and property,\" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. \"As we continue to track the path of Hurricane Joaquin, I have instructed the secretary of public safety and homeland security to make every preparation for a major event Thursday and Friday.\"\nSignificant #flooding expected for the East U.S., no matter if #Joaquin makes landfall or not: http://t.co/jcZVCbOsad pic.twitter.com/wX2jbdrDE1\n— The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) October 1, 2015\nBut while the East Coast still may get thoroughly soaked, Weather.com's Hurricane Central forecasts that the eye of Joaquin won't make contact with U.S. soil . The National Weather Service's Hurricane Center also forecasts that hurricane winds shouldn't reach the U.S. in the next several days outside of grazing North Carolina's Outer Banks.\nAnd despite the potentially ominous weather headed this way, social media has featured some Joaquin-related fun, like the meme below:\n#HurricaneJoaquin could possibly impact our area.
