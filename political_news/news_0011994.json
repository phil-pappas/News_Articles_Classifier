And he says Donald Trump isn't ready to be commander-in-chief. Videos \nThe Florida senator who is emerging as an establishment favorite for the Republican 2016 nomination criticized both Clinton and Trump in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Jamie Gangel. \nHe ripped Trump for not addressing important issues \"in a serious way.\" \n\"To this point in the campaign, he has not proven an understanding of these issues or the preparation necessary to be the commander-in-chief of the most powerful military force in the world,\" Rubio said. \nHe also said Clinton winning the Democratic nomination over rivals Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is a foregone conclusion. \n\"Well, she'll be the Democratic nominee, someone who comes from a political dynasty and that, in and of itself, is going to bring fundraising capabilities and so forth,\" Rubio said. \nHe lambasted her performance in a Thursday hearing in front of the House Benghazi committee, where Republicans discussed an email in which Clinton told her family right after the 2012 attacks resulting in the deaths of four Americans that they were the work of terrorists and not a reaction to an anti-Islam video. Clinton has said the discrepancy was due to fast-moving intelligence assessments in a chaotic period. \n\"She lied about Benghazi,\" Rubio said. \"I think it's just a little bit more insight into her unwillingness oftentimes to speak truth, in this case for political reasons.\" \nIn the interview, Rubio also demonstrated his love for 1990s-era hip-hop -- particularly West Coast rappers like Tupac Shakur. \nHe said lately he's a fan of electronic dance music, as well as artists who have crossed traditional lines of genre. \n\"In many ways it's real genius and it's a 21st-century ability to take music and use it in a way that motivates people. Some of it is blended with other sounds that are sampled from recordings that others have had in the past, and you see traditional artists being brought in and their voices used in an electronic sound track,\" he said. \nAs for his favorite movies, Rubio -- \"like any guy in America,\" he admitted -- said he loves both Godfathers I and II. \"And No. 3, I can do without.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:09:12.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
