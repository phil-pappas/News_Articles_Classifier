This entails making men into something less than men. Your tax dollars are spent in an attempt to accomplish this through “gender transformative programming” :\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is spending nearly $1 million on a study that seeks to change gender norms to prevent sexual assault, teaching young men to resist “rigid masculinity.”\nThe project seeks to produce “healthy masculinities” in young black males in Pittsburgh, using a curriculum called “Manhood 2.0.” The curriculum involves “identifying examples of policing gender and sexuality” and teaches young men that masculinity is not about physical strength.\nElizabeth Miller, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh who is leading the study, said it is her “dream project.” Miller provided a fact sheet on her study, which details its goals of “gender norms change.”\nThe ostensible goal of this social engineering project is to protect women from the baleful effects of male masculinity. You can’t expect the pointy-headed masterminds to admit that even a country that tolerates Barack Obama as president is not wimpy enough to suit them.\nTransforming us into a nation that deserves its government.
