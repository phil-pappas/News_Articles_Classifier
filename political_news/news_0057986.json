According to the Centers for Disease Control , 12 million women and men across the U.S. experience physical violence each year by a current or former intimate partner. While shocking, this statistic does not take into account psychological violence, which continues to grow in impact among adults as well as teens.\nThe Hotline's goal is to eradicate these statistics and provide life-saving resources to the millions of people affected by domestic abuse. With a number of groundbreaking activities planned for October, the organization plans to make significant strides in educating the public about domestic violence this month. \"We can stop domestic violence through education and prevention work; however, resources are limited, and we need everyone's help to do it,\" said Katie Ray-Jones , Chief Executive Officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. \"Partnering with other organizations in creative ways and leveraging resources can make a huge difference.\"\nPartnerships: While The Hotline is a long-established and respected organization, partnering with major corporations, passionate advocates and other nonprofits will help the organization reach a much broader audience. This month, The Hotline will work with both existing and new partners. Initiatives include:\nVerizon Purple Accessories Campaign : For many years, Verizon has been committed to bringing attention to domestic violence and supporting survivors through its HopeLine program. Throughout October, Verizon will offer an exclusive line of purple accessories, and will donate a portion of each sale, up to $100,000 to The Hotline. Verizon's gift will allow The Hotline to expand the services we provide to help even more victims and survivors, as well as their concerned loved ones.

This campaign challenges the public to step up and Pass the Peace by raising money and awareness for domestic and dating violence prevention. You can participate by uploading a video of yourself passing a ball, which represents the idea of \"passing the peace.\" Along with a video, participants can make a $12 or more donation to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and challenge friends to do the same. Pass the Peace apparel will also be available for purchase at www.whynotyoufdn.org and all sales will go toward funding The Hotline. To donate, visit www.support.thehotline.org/passthepeace or text \"PassthePeace\" to 41444.\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions : The Hotline will partner with ARS for a joint webinar at 2 p.m. CT on Oct. 27 . The webinar, entitled \"A Deeper Conversation: The Intersection of Firearms and Domestic Violence,\" will take a look at how the presence of a firearm in an abusive relationship intensifies the fear of abuse victims. It will also explore what can be done to provide greater protections to domestic violence victims and survivors. To register, visit https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1799271983386035714 .\nEmpowered: Women, HIV & Intimate Partner Violence : This campaign from Greater Than AIDS is designed to increase understanding concerning intersection of HIV/AIDS and domestic violence. Produced by Kaiser Family Foundation in partnership with the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Planned Parenthood, Positive Women's Network, The Well Project and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, the campaign is anchored by a video featuring Tonya Lewis Lee-lawyer and women's health advocate-in conversation with women with HIV who have experienced abuse. A community tool kit is available free to support organizations serving women. Materials will be available for viewing at http://empowered.greaterthan.org . Beyond these milestone partnerships, The Hotline will increase awareness about domestic violence through its blog and social media channels all month long. While incredible strides have been made since the first National Domestic Violence Awareness Month was recognized 28 years ago in 1987, the nation has a long way to go in eradicating this issue that affects more than 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men in the U.S. today. You can help make this happen by participating in The Hotline's partnership activities this month, as well as educating yourself and those around you about domestic violence or making a donation at http://www.thehotline.org/get-involved/donate/ .\nSupporting Resources\nBecome a fan of The Hotline on Facebook Follow The Hotline on Twitter Visit http://www.loveisrespect.org/ for information and support surrounding abusive dating relationships About The National Domestic Violence Hotline\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is a non-profit organization established in 1996 as a component of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).
