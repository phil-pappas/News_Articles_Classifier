A worker pours treatment fluid into a retention pond at the bottom of the Gold King Mine on Aug. 13, eight days after EPA contractors accidentally triggered a spill at the mine that turned nearby waterways yellow.\nBy Alan Neuhauser Oct. 22, 2015 | 5:55 p.m. EDT + More The Environmental Protection Agency is directly at fault for the August mine spill in Colorado that it had been working to prevent, according to a government report released Thursday.\nThe blowout from the abandoned Gold King Mine, five miles north of Silverton, spewed 3 million gallons of acid mine water and heavy metals into Colorado and Utah rivers, turning the waterways a sickly yellow-orange.\nSee Photos\nPhotos: Mine Waste Spill Pollutes Animas River While EPA officials called the Aug. 5 accident \"likely inevitable\" in the weeks after the spill, the review by the Interior Department found it was both \"preventable\" and also \"emblematic\" of agencies' inconsistent and deeply flawed approaches to reopening shuttered mines.\nMost critically, the EPA contractors working at the site chose not to bore a hole to physically check the amount of water inside the mine before digging – a step that previously had been taken to successfully reopen another mine in 2011.\n\"Had it been done, the plan to open the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred,\" said the review, which was requested by the EPA and performed by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation.\nWhat's more, such an incident could easily happen again, the authors said. \"The conditions and actions that led to the Gold King Mine incident are not isolated or unique, and in fact are surprisingly prevalent.\"\n[ READ: Countries Pledge to Slow Emissions to \"Relative Crawl,\" But It's Not Enough ]\nStandards for reopening and remediating flooded mines \"are inconsistent from one agency to another,\" the investigators found. There are few \"written requirements that government agencies are required to follow,\" suggesting \"little appreciation for the engineering complexity of some abandoned mine projects that often require, but do not receive, a significant level of expertise.\"\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy apologized for the spill after it occurred.\nThe review does not assign blame to specific workers or officials. It also sheds little light on the internal communications and decision-making that led up to the blowout – a chain of events that provoked \"serious reservations\" from one of the report's peer reviewers, an official with the Army Corps of Engineers.\n[ ALSO: Oil Firms Urge Climate Action, U.S. Companies Stay Silent ]\nFor example, a change in field coordinators overseeing work at the site created some \"urgency to start digging\" without waiting for technical input – a decision that goes unexplained in the review.\nThe report authors maintain they were \"hired to perform a technical evaluation of the causes of the incident\" and were \"not asked to look into internal communications\" or to \"perform an investigation into a 'finding of fault.'\"\nThe Navajo Nation reportedly plans to sue the EPA for the spill. Attorneys in the area are also soliciting clients.\nTAGS: EPA Department of the Interior mining environment Army Corps of Engineers", "external_links": ["http://www.stern-lawgroup.com/Gold-King-Mine-Spill.aspx", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/252361-navajo-nation-preps-lawsuit-against-epa-over-mine-spill", "http://www.newsweek.com/epa-lucky-no-one-was-killed-mine-spill-blowout-internal-review-finds-366146", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2475483/technical-evaluation-of-the-gold-king-mine.pdf", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=EPA%20to%20Blame%20for%20%27Preventable%27%20Gold%20King%20Mine%20Spill%2C%20Interior%20Dept.%20Finds", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=EPA%20to%20Blame%20for%20%27Preventable%27%20Gold%20King%20Mine%20Spill%2C%20Interior%20Dept.%20Finds&summary=The%20accident%20is%20%27emblematic%27%20of%20a%20lackadaisical%20approach%20to%20remediating%20shuttered%20mines%2C%20a%20review%20finds.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg9o2%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=EPA%20to%20Blame%20for%20%27Preventable%27%20Gold%20King%20Mine%20Spill%2C%20Interior%20Dept.%20Finds"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:33:32.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
