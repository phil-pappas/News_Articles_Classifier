With ‘XXX’ sjhowing in certain areas where details were yet to be added, it’s clear the piece was meant to remain in draft mode. But somebody with a fat finger hit the wrong button. Before the story could be removed, the Republican National Committee grabbed and sent the copy to those on its ‘War Room’ mailing list.” \nThe Washington Post ultimately pulled the piece and inserted this message: “This file was inadvertently published.” \nHowever, the RNC was able to grab the entire story. \nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Biden, who has been publicly grieving since the death of his eldest son on May 30, began telling associates on XX of his intention to launch a late-breaking campaign that will pit him against a pair of Democrats who have been well ahead of his decision-making process, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders.” \nThe story then said Biden could make a formal announcement in the coming days, just in time for an October 24 appearance in Iowa. Ed Henry with Fox News, meanwhile, tweeted several times Monday of sources who confirmed to him Biden would announce his presidential run within the next few days, perhaps at the October 24 Iowa event. \nThe Washington Post piece continued: “The vice president remains far behind Clinton in national polling, and trails Sanders in some surveys. He has virtually no campaign infrastructure. His inner circle of advisers helped him make the decision without the benefit of any of their own polling, focus groups or other standard practices of modern campaigns. As of last week, Biden’s team had not even opened a bank account for campaign donations, said two party strategists who offered advice during the decision-making process. By contrast, Clinton’s campaign has already raised $75 million, and has paid staff members in dozens of states. Over the three-month fundraising period that ended Sept. 30, Sanders pulled in $26 million, a large portion of it in small donations from liberal activists donating over the Internet, many of whom seem poised to continue pouring money into his bid. More than 50 donors with a history of raising big money have pledged to support Biden’s bid via the Draft Biden super PAC. Some insiders have suggested that the vice president’s team could amass $30 million over the next four months, which might be enough to be competitive in the first four contests.” \nThe writer then refers to the failed Wesley Clark press for the presidency in 2004, due largely to lack of preparation, and pointed to modern day political insiders worrying the same could happen to Biden. \n“But the 2016 contest has defied many standard expectations, and Biden’s team is placing a big bet that he can capture this moment and ride the wave to the Oval Office,” the Washington Post piece continued. \nThe story also quoted Ted Kaufman, one of Biden’s longest-serving political advisers, telling supporters a 2016 campaign would focus on restoring “the ability of the middle class to get ahead” and would be “an optimistic campaign, a campaign from the heart,” the story stated. \nWho do you love?

Then, Biden told a Washington Post reported the voters wanted a candidate who oozed authenticity and “can smell it when it’s not real.” \nAnd wife Jill Biden chimed in: “I would hope that Joe would never be a politician like Hillary Clinton.” \nBiden chided her, the Washington Post reported: “Stop that,” he said. \nAnd her response: “He thinks with his head and his heart.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:05:26.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
