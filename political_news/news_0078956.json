The exuberance, energies and the zeal we have exhibited as youth send strong signal to the outside world that we are ready to battle for power in 2016.' \nHe criticized Mahama administration and the NDC for mismanaging Ghana's economy, saying 'their incompetence and mismanagement have led to massive youth unemployment. \nMr Nartey said the reintroduction of the cash and carry system in the health sector, the continuous depreciation of the Ghana currency, excessive borrowing, non-payment of common funds to the district assemblies among others, indicate that the NDC government had failed woefully to improve the lives of Ghanaians. \nHe said Ghana was on the path to oblivion due to bad governance, stressing the need for the electorate to vote for Nana Akufo-Addo to save the country by implementing better policies and programmes to bring hope to the people once again. \nThe spokesperson stated that his group, which is made up of over 200 students, would be visiting the hinterlands to encourage the people about the need for them to vote for Nana Akufo-Addo and the NPP in 2016. \nHard work is the surest way of ensuring victory for the NPP in 2016, he said, noting that his group, formed in July 2015, would kick-start their campaign for 2016 next weekend. \n'We will stop on the day that Nana Akufo-Addo will be sworn in as president of Ghana.' \nFROM I.F.
