The embassy said the German-Palestinian protest would be a call “to support the ongoing murder attacks on Israeli civilians.”\nThe protest conforms to “the education of hate that official Palestinian authorities have carried out over the years, as well as raising children with violence and murder,” it added.\nThe Palestinian community of Germany denies Israel’s right to exist, the embassy said. The advertisement for the protest shows a Palestinian keffiyeh covering the entire State of Israel on a map.\nRaif Hussein, the head of the local Palestinian community, said, “We support a violent-free resistance against the occupation.”\nThe Israeli government, he added, is “fascist.”\nOn the Palestinian community’s flier advertising the protest, a man is drawn tossing a stone. Hussein said the knife attacks on Israelis are “acts of desperation.”\nAccording to the Tagesspiegel , there is a tone of violence on the Facebook page of the Palestinian community. One user, for example, posted a picture of a Palestinian using a meat cleaver to attack an Israeli soldier.\nA user’s commentary to the picture on the Facebook page reads: “God help us against the children of Zion.”\nGermany’s media are silent about the conditions in the Palestinian territories because the “media is owned by the Zionists,\" according to the community's Facebook page.\nThe police are reviewing the approval for the pro-Palestinian demonstration in front of the German Chancellery building in Berlin. Pro-Israeli activists have called for a counter demonstration.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:54:02.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
