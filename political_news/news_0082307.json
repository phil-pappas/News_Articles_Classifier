The conservative war on reality is getting real juice from the Republican primary. Over a dozen major candidates are jockeying for attention from primary voters, which means youre going to see stranger and stranger pandering to right-wing elements that prefer their fantasy world to empirical reality. . . . 1. Ben Carson denies that astrophysicists understand physics. In a 2012 speech to his fellow Seventh-Day Adventists, Ben Carson sneered at the Big Bang theory, describing it as highfalutin scientists and theyre saying it was this gigantic explosion and everything came into perfect order. . . . 2.

False claims that vaccines cause autism were originally associated with liberals, but in recent years, that belief has been drifting more toward its natural home on the anti-science right. . . . 3. Climate change. Some Republican candidates for president avoid denying outright that climate change is happening, but every single one of them downplays it or lies about the policy solutions that have been proposed. Other candidates stake ground on the argument that climate change is a hoax being perpetuated by scientists for reasons unknown. That group includes Donald Trump, Rick Santorum, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson. . . .
