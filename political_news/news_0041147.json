Posted on \nCNBC reports : For more than half a decade, the GOP has blasted President Barack Obama's signature health-care reform legislation, and the law remains deeply unpopular with the party's base. But experts say a Republican president would have to clear a very high bar in getting Congress to kill the Affordable Care Act outright, even though GOP candidates have called for doing that.
