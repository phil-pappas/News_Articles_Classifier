All times local.\n___\n10:00 a.m.\nTurkey has warned the European Union that 3 million more refugees could flee fighting in Syria as the EU struggles to manage its biggest migration emergency in decades.\nAround 2 million refugees from Syria are currently in Turkey, and tens of thousands of others have entered the EU via Greece this year, overwhelming coast guards and reception facilities.\nEU Council President Donald Tusk told lawmakers Tuesday that \"according to Turkish estimates, another 3 million potential refugees may come from Aleppo and its neighborhood.\"\nTusk said that \"today millions of potential refugees and migrants are dreaming about Europe.\"\nHe warned that \"the world around us does not intend to help Europe\" and that some of the EU's neighbors \"look with satisfaction at our troubles.\"\n___\n10:00 a.m.\nAustrian Chancellor Werner Faymann is heading to the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos with Greece's prime minister to view first-hand the impact of the refugee crisis and tour the facilities set up to handle the new arrivals, which number in the hundreds and sometimes thousands every day.\nFaymann and Greece's Alexis Tsipras are due on Lesbos around mid-day Monday and are to tour the reception center set up to register and process the arriving refugees and migrants.\nAbout 400,000 people have arrived in Greece so far this year, most in small overcrowded boats from the nearby Turkish coast.
