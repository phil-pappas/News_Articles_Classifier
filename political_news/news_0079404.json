The former Rhode Island governor made the announcement Friday morning at a women's forum held by the Democratic National Committee. \n\"After much thought I have decided to end my campaign for president today,” Chafee said in prepared remarks at a women’s forum held by the Democratic National Committee. “I would like to take this opportunity one last time to advocate for a chance be given to peace.”Chafee delivered a widely panned debate performance earlier this month and has struggled to raise money and generate enthusiasm in a field that has been dominated by Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, the Vermont independent senator.
