(Kevin Clark/The Washington Post) October 14 at 5:21 PM Regarding the Oct. 12 Metro article “ Reaching a breaking point over Metro’s woes ”:\nI just love Metro’s announcement “thank you for your patience.” After hearing that ad nauseam several times a week for the past few years, I’ve decided to throw in my farecard. I am now going to ride solo in my car, adding to the area’s pollution and road congestion. Because I am a bit of a tree-hugger, this will be hard for me, but I, along with thousands of others, have reached a breaking point.\nI could be more patient if paying for a farecard and parking were optional, I didn’t have someone I had to answer to as to why I am late to work (despite leaving my house 30 minutes earlier than I used to), I didn’t have children, pets and elderly parents to take care of after work, and I didn’t have a life outside of a frequently broken-down, smelly, crowded, stalled, late or single-tracking train.\nCome on, Metro. Get back to being the on-time and reliable mode of transportation you used to be.\nEileen Ruske , Vienna", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:22:43.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
