REUTERS/Scott Morgan - RTS3MA4 REUTERS \n\nOn Kevin McCarthy's withdrawal from the House speaker race: \nJeb Bush: \"I'm surprised\" \n\"I'm surprised. I think Kevin McCarthy was a good person, a good man, I'm surprised that he dropped out.\"\n\"I just hope that they stay focused on making sure that people know they're trying to solve problems for people. You know, Washington seems so removed everyday life. They talk about things - they talk in language, all the acronyms and stuff that doesn't make any sense. They just don't seem to be relevant to people right now.\" -- at a campaign event in Indianola, Iowa \n\n\nJohn Kasich on immigration: \"Are we going to ship them to the border and yell, 'Get out of our country?'\" \n\"[W]e should have a guest worker program and the people who were here who have abided by the law should be able to have a path to legalization. It is not practical to think we are going to go take 10, 11, 12 million people and what are we going to do? How are we going to get them? Are we going to ship them to the border and yell, 'Get out of our country?' It's not practical. And, by the way, these folks who are here, many of them are creating a wonderful, stronger America. So I think it can pass. I actually think this can pass. In this campaign, we should stop talking about pie in the sky and starting talking about real solutions. I've been a reformer my entire lifetime, but I know how to land a plane and get it done. -- interviewed on \"CBS This Morning\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:52:22.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
