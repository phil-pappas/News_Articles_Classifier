In Australia they will also have the support of their families. \n\"Greg Barnsâ€™ comments raise series questions around the advice the Prime Minister is giving these detainees. \n\"Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he will speed up the appeal process, but it is far more important that proper consideration is given to individual circumstances at the time visas are revoked. \n\"Christmas Island detainees will meet with Kelvin Davis during his visit on Friday. \n\"John Key must stop giving misleading advice and ensure they have the support they need if they are eventually deported,\" says Andrew Little. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:05:52.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
