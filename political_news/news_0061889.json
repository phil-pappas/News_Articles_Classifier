(AP) - The campaign to get North Carolina voters to permit the state to borrow $2 billion for new government and university buildings, water infrastructure upgrades and other projects has essentially already gotten underway. \nGov. Pat McCrory signed legislation Wednesday that authorizes a March 15 statewide referendum and lists how the proceeds would be spent if a majority of ballots say yes to borrowing. \nRepublican and Democratic legislative leaders joined the governor at the ceremony on North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus and support passing the referendum. McCrory also says a bipartisan group of notable North Carolina politicians and business leaders are committed to educating the public about the benefits of the debt to improve state infrastructure. \nThe referendum will mark the first statewide bond question on the ballot since 2000.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/local/regional/2015/10/21/1st-north-carolina-bond-question-since-2000-going-to-voters/74335716/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:43:57.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
