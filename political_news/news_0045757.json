Garfield. He represented the far northeastern corner of Ohio, part of the Western Reserve allotted to Connecticut in the 1780s and then ceded to Ohio in 1800 and settled by New England Yankees who became staunch supporters of temperance, women's rights, abolition of slavery and the Republican party. Garfield's district was one of the most heavily Republican in post-Civil War America and he was first elected to the House in the midst of that conflict, in which he had been promoted to general. He became one of the party's leaders in the House, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and, after Republicans lost their majority in 1874, the equivalent of House minority leader. He was elected president in 1880, the only serving member of the House to have won a presidential election, but was shot by a crazed office seeker and died in September 1881, weeks short of his 50 th birthday.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ Garfield's career is only one of many recalled by Michael Zak on his Grand Old Partisan website , and in his book Back to Basics on the history of the Republican party. Much of American history has been written by partisan Democrats, who lionize their party's ancient champions even when those men's views are quite different from (and repugnant to) both Democrats and Republicans today. Andrew Jackson, a believer in free markets and a foe of crony capitalists, is portrayed as an earlier version of today's Democrats who take something like the opposite stands. Zak presents a useful antidote, a different view of party politics, from an admitted Republican partisan.\n  Politico suggests Trey Gowdy responsible for State Department screw-up \"Gowdy appears to accidentally release CIA source's name Citing 'human error,'\" reads the Politico headline.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/19/15 8:49 PM Top Story Rubio: Time for GOP to 'turn the page' on Bushes \"We  \nBy Al Weaver • 10/19/15 5:02 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:25:51.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
