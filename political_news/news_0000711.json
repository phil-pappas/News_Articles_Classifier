The development of the scar tissue is called fibrosis. As the lung tissue becomes scarred and grows thicker, the lungs lose their ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. As a result, the brain and other organs don't receive enough oxygen. In some cases, doctors can determine the cause of the fibrosis, but in many cases, there is no known cause. When the cause of the fibrosis is unknown (and certain pathologic or radiographic criteria are met), the disease is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF. There is no cure for IPF. Presently, there are two FDA-approved treatments for IPF in the U.S.\nAbout PFF Summit 2015: From Bench to Bedside\nPFF Summit 2015: From Bench to Bedside is the PFF's third biennial international health care conference on pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The goal of the Summit is to foster a collaborative environment to improve education and awareness of PF and to identify new approaches to treat, and ultimately cure, this devastating disease. The Summit will feature an innovative continuing medical education (CME) program for health professionals as well as provide sessions for PF patients and caregivers that address their growing educational needs.
