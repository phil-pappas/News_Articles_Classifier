Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told the 38th annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute gathering on Thursday (October 8) that the rhetoric coming from the leading Republican presidential candidate is offensive and must be stopped. \"It's a problem when a leading Republican candidate for president says that immigrants from Mexico are rapists and drug dealers. It's a problem when candidates use offensive terms like anchor babies, or even talk about changing the constitution to take citizenship away from those who were born here. We need people who will stand up to this ugly rhetoric and extreme thinking. Who will say with our words and with our actions, basta, enough, end this,\" Clinton said. Clinton's remarks refer to the leading Republican candidate Donald Trump's controversial comments about immigrants and the Latino community in the United States.
