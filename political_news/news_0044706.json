(ALGERINA PERNA / Baltimore Sun) John Fritze Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun One public housing family in Baltimore earned $82K over income cap. \nSixty-four families who live in public housing in Baltimore earn more money than is permitted by the program's income eligibility requirements, new data from a federal inspector general's audit shows. \nThe families, who represent less than 1 percent of public housing units maintained by the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, earned a combined $798,563 over the income limits, according to an analysis of the data by The Baltimore Sun. \nIncome caps for public housing vary by city and family size. For example, in Baltimore, a family of four can earn no more than $44,200 to qualify for housing. \nThe inspector general for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which reviewed eligibility for 2014, found that some families in Baltimore were only a few hundred dollars over the limit. Others substantially exceeded it â€” in one case by more than $82,000. \nThe average amount of the overage was about $12,500, according to the analysis. \nThe data stem from an audit released by the inspector general in July. It estimated the federal government would spend $104 million a year on families earning more that the income caps, money \"that otherwise could have been used to house low-income families.\" The audit recommended the agency take steps to move the families to private housing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:33:14.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
