Martin O'Malley, in response to a question on Twitter, gave the only answer he could when @PFTCommenter asked O'Malley about the Ravens quarterback. \n\"Joe Flacco is definitely an #elite #quarterback,\" O'Malley wrote . \nJust last month, Flacco was endorsed by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . \n\"I think Joe Flacco is actually a very elite quarterback,\" Trump said . \"He won a Super Bowl. He did it, really to a certain extent, with that great arm of his. I would say absolutely he is an elite quarterback.\" \nFor a quarterback who often plays in the shadow of the likes of Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and many others, Flacco sure frequently finds his name coming out of the mouth of politicans on a national stage. \nLast December, President Barack Obama accidentally referred to actor James Franco as \"James Flacco\" while talking about threats and hacks that led to one of Franco's films, \"The Interview,\" to be removed from theaters. \nAs Baltimore Sun reporter Jon Meoli noted then, the Internet immediately asked if \"James Flacco\" was elite . \nWith the Ravens' top two receivers likely to be sidelined by injury for this weekend's game against the Cleveland Browns at M&T Bank Stadium, Flacco might need to prove O'Malley and Trump right for the Ravens to improve to 2-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:14:05.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
