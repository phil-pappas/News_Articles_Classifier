A final decision eliminating Tualatin's downtown from light rail, as well as one choosing between light rail and bus rapid transit to serve the heavily traveled corridor, is expected in February. \nThe committee's recommendation leaves open the possibility that Tualatin could be served by bus rapid transit. A light rail stop at Bridgeport Village, which is in Tualatin's city limits, also remains on the table. \nThe actions come as Metro and its municipal partners shoot for an April goal of finalizing a package that prioritizes federal, state and local funding for the Southwest Corridor. \nWhile numerous snags could lie ahead, it's expected that either light rail or bus rapid transit could be running on the region's newest transit route by 2026. \nMore key decisions will be made in coming months, such as whether an expensive tunnel serving Portland Community College's Sylvania campus will be included in the plan, or whether some other option will be recommended. \nCollege officials said either light rail or bus rapid transit to the Sylvania campus is critical to the success of future expansion plans. They submitted a letter that included four maps depicting the campus and how different transit options currently under consideration might affect student and faculty commuters. \nA best-case outcome would allow PCC to take advantage of freed-up parking areas to use in future building expansions, officials said. \nA dissenting voice came from John Charles, president of the Cascade Policy Institute . He questioned the need to build a tunnel or spend money on other options serving only a small percentage of campus commuters. \nNoting that many buses arriving on campus already are far less than full, Charles added, \"I'm trying to understand what a quarter of a billion dollars would add to the mix? What problem are you trying to solve?\" \nTriMet projections include transit system modeling showing that, by 2035, a traditional bus will be need to run along the Southwest Corridor from Portland to Tigard every 2.5 minutes to accommodate demand. \nTualatin Mayor Lou Ogden responded to those projections by saying, \"You can't move that volume of people through traditional means. That's really the purpose of high capacity.\" \nThe committee already has made several decisions to narrow planning. Those include removing tunnels beneath Marquam Hill and Hillsdale in Southwest Portland in favor of continuing to study routes that would use Southwest Barbur Boulevard or Southwest Naito Parkway in South Portland. \nIn addition, it has eliminated these options: running light rail or bus rapid transit on Highway 99W in Tigard; and, directly serving Portland's South Waterfront, Washington Square or Sherwood with high-capacity transit. \nThe public gets its next chance to weigh in at an Oct. 19 public forum from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Tigard Public Works Building, 8777 Southwest Burnham St., Tigard. \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:48:35.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
