The environment can be sustained by collective stewardship as our material needs are securely met by a fair distribution and sharing of resources, and our psychological needs are met through an ethos fostering cooperation rather than acquisition and competition. We call such a system democratic socialism. Wow, what a statement. Lets have fun with this steaming turd! Quote: A sustainable economy requires a system in which production is democratically planned and controlled by well-informed people. Democratically planned by well informed people. A test before you can vote? They mean the workers who decide on how the business that was stolen and gave to them now runs. Quote: our material needs are securely met by a fair distribution and sharing of resources, and our psychological needs are met through an ethos fostering cooperation rather than acquisition and competition. We call such a system democratic socialism . To each according their need. Strict Marxism. Work hard, get ahead, give away what you made so you do not have more than anyone else. Competition is dumb. No winners and losers. Just winners. Everyone is a winner. Fair and equal. No, nothing Marxist here at all nope not one bit. Quote: Popular struggles have achieved partial socialization on many levels. Local public enterprises like sanitation were won by “sewer socialist” mayors; generations of labor organizing lifted millions from poverty to comfort. We share public parks designed by 19thC. Christian socialist and abolitionist Frederic Law Olmsted. Many benefit from islands of direct democracy like food coops and worker managed businesses. National programs from Social Security and Medicare to EPA and OSHA improve our lives, as do such international agreements as the Ozone Treaty and Universal Declaration of Human Rights. All these embody the principle of production for common need, not private profit. Look government programs is the same as socialism! See I told you. Well, were going to leave out the part about seizing property and businesses but hey errr yeah its the same thing right! Quote: System change can only be achieved by uniting movements for social justice, peace, and human rights as well as environmental justice and stewardship. So we work toward racial and gender equality, civil rights and liberties, labor organizing, universal health care, quality education and child care for all, free higher education, livable communities, full employment at living wages to abolish poverty, and the progressive redistribution of wealth. Dont worry, once we spend all of the uber riches funds, we will move on down to the kind of rich and spend all their money, then once that is gone we will just keep on moving down. So, sit back and relax. We got your earnings spent already. But hey the trade off is, at the work place you probably get to vote on when your coffee break time is! Quote: Green Jobs: replacing transportation, building and electric generation systems to use renewable energy can create millions of domestic jobs. Those should be living wage, union jobs hiring and training disadvantaged workers. Publicly owned or cooperative utilities would be more accountable, affordable and sustainable. Of course were going to nationalize all the industry first. Quote: Fair trade: we need rules for the world economy that reverse the priorities of so-called “free trade” agreements which privilege the property rights of corporations, investors and speculators over human rights and nature. Environmental health, economic justice, sustainable development and political democracy should prevail over commercial values wherever they conflict. Now the leftards wake up about NAFTA. Better late than never I guess. Quote: Uprooting environmental racism: the worst hazards are imposed on minority and low-income communities. Workers of color are typically given the dirtiest jobs; vulnerable people are denied a voice in decisions that affect their health and survival. Toxic production will end only when all communities have the power to defend themselves against becoming dumping grounds. The race card. It can be played at anytime for any reason. Absolutely no proof or statistic to prove that minorities face toxic jobs more than anyone else. In short this is unfounded hyperbole bullshit, whose main reason was an excuse to sling a race card. Quote: Reproductive choice and family planning: women have a right to control their fertility, in both developed and developing countries; education of girls is also vital. Unmet demand for birth control is about equal to net global population growth. We should be giving out free condoms in every school and hospital. So, I somewhat agree. I don't agree we should offer free birth control pills. Just because I don't want to buy you something doesn't mean I don't want you to have it. I just want you to pay for it yourself. I support free condoms, not free birth control pills. Quote: Healthy workplace environments: pollutants typically originate in factories where workers are often exposed to high levels of toxic substances, serving as human guinea pigs. Workers are fighting for the right to know and decide what hazards they are exposed to, and the right to refuse unsafe work. When polluting plants are shut, workers must be guaranteed a fair livelihood. Wait! I have heard how great socialism is and how government programs are great socialist programs. So, with OSHA and the EPA and all these great government entities you mean that there are human guinea pigs working in toxic factories in the United States? But, how can that be with your government programs in place? But it gets better than that. Workers must be guaranteed a fair livelihood, after we shut down there place of employment. So, there you have it. Thanks for supporting us. Now don't worry. Someone will pay you to not work now. Quote: Reducing the working week and year: more free time would facilitate full employment and reduce stress. As Juliet Schor points out, people are happier in societies where wealth and income are more equal and productivity gains are taken as leisure time for recreation and social interaction rather than throughput of disposable stuff. Products should be designed for durability, not planned obsolescence. In Bill McKibben’s words, “we need not more belongings, but more belonging.” Anyone who can read this must realize what it says. It says were not really going to allow private ownership of stuff, but hey we will let you spend more time with your family and friends. I mean you cant own and buy things like before but...look at the family time!! Quote: Democratic local and regional planning: we can use public visioning and participatory budgeting to invest in existing communities, instead of subsidizing developers to destroy communities and landscapes by suburban sprawl. We can increase public parks and community gardens, use intensive recycling, and require strict energy standards for new buildings. Programs enabling households to install efficiency retrofits and solar systems and “pay as you save” on utility bills would speed renewable deployment. Cool! So does that mean your going to get the fed and the state out of what I do on my own property? Oh, well back when I use to be able to own property. So does that also mean your not going to triple my electric bill? Instead your going to give me free solar and wind power! Yayyy. Quote: Expanding and improving public transit: transit-oriented development and walkable neighborhoods can reduce energy use and enhance safety and fair access to jobs and recreation. Because providing your own transportation is so unfair if someone else isn't able to do the same. Quote: Diverse forms of economic democracy: organize worker and consumer cooperatives, credit unions, community-supported agriculture and cohousing. Local and state public enterprises can serve common needs accountably, for example public broadband internet, public banks and loan funds, land trusts and green banks to finance the initial costs of renewable energy. I have no problem with any of this. As long as its done as a free choice. So, are you going to guarantee peoples choice on rather or not to participate in this or organize this? Probably not huh Quote: Impoving public education: guarantee quality education for everyone from universal pre-K and afterschool programs to graduate school and lifetime continuing education. Science education should highlight the challenges of this century, applying the progressive principle of learning by doing. Students can learn biology by growing food, and learn physics and chemistry by making renewable energy and recycling systems. Yayyy more charter schools then. They seem to work rather well!! Quote: Grass roots campaigns to stop hazardous technologies: fighting pipelines, hydrofracking and other fossil fuel infrastructure, toxic dumps, incinerators and nuclear plants can all be starting points for coalitions to demand systemic alternatives. \"Not In My Back Yard\" attitudes can be reactionary and divisive when opposing socially progressive facilities like drug treatment centers, but are the beginning of democratic accountability when resisting what shouldn't be in anyone's backyard. Or, as we shall see further on. No one will actually have a back yard. You know, that common stewardship thing. Quote: Divestiture campaigns against fossil fuel corporations: switch investments to renewable energy. Energy corporations claim as assets trillions of dollars in coal, oil and gas reserves which if burned would push the atmosphere past the point of no return. We must avoid runaway positive feedbacks inexorably melting the icecaps and inundating coasts for miles inland, but causing catastrophic floods, droughts and crop failures long before. Investments?? How very capitalist of the author! Anyway, this point is getting beat to death. Everyone gets it by now. No private ownership, no private transportation. And your going to use the peoples earnings to invest in stuff for the good of the people instead of actually paying the people. Well, I mean paying them in family time. Not like letting them own stuff. Anyway moving on. Quote: Permanently protecting vital ecosystems as commons: the natural world should be accessible for public enjoyment by all, but not for commercial exploitation. Private enterprise has already cut down 97% of the old growth forest in the United States--practice sustainable forestry there. Private enterprise? Oh, people owning their own stuff like houses and such. And lets not forget about those crops that are going to fail from global warming. You know the crops that should have never been planted in the first place because of the forest an stuff. Well, I mean you could farm the desert. Quote: Reversing subsidies to corporate agribusiness and junk food: use extension programs to promote sustainable agriculture. End food deserts and the hustling of junk food to children, to improve the health of people and the planet. Don't take this as being told what you can and cant eat. Nope, don't read into that narrative at all. Quote: Public financing of political campaigns: concentrated private wealth should not buy elections, drowning out the voice of the 99% in making public policy. Instead enable leadership of, by and for the people to set the agenda, as part of a broader progressive movement to expand voting rights and democracy. Enable leadership, of, by and for the people to set the agenda, as part of a broader progressive movement to expand voting rights and democracy. In other words, silence the opposition and call it fair. Quote: When we work in local protest and organizing movements, we strive to unite diverse communities, to promote a global perspective and democratic participation, and an understanding of the need for systemic change. The next decade may be the last chance to turn the ship of state around before it hits an iceberg calved off from a melting polar glacier. Martin Luther King warned, “Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words ‘too late.’” As long as your willing to sacrifice earnings, private ownership and trust government leadership to set the agenda without any political opposition then this is a wonderful thing!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:41:21.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
