Lynne McCormack, director of Providence’s Department of Art, Culture + Tourism, announced in an email Wednesday that Thursday will be her last day on the job. McCormack will be the national program director for Creative Placemaking at LISC. LISC, or the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, connects local organizations and community leaders “with resources to revitalize neighborhoods and improve quality of life,” according to its website. “I’m grateful to have been on this ride with you and even more importantly, for your love and support over the years,” she wrote to a long list of people, many of whom she thanked personally in her letter. McCormack began working for the city in 1998, as the program manager for the city's Parks Department, according to her LinkedIn profile. She became the director of Art, Culture + Tourism in 2006. Under her leadership, the Art, Culture + Tourism department, along with FirstWorks, put together the Providence International Arts Festival, which was held earlier this year. McCormack celebrated the people contributing to the arts in Providence in her poetic email. “We are a collective of performers, artists, curators, government officials, non-profit leaders, thinkers and doers,” she wrote. “Together we have breathed in the dust of the past, and exhaled our souls into the city.” Barnaby Evans, the executive artistic director for WaterFire, in a reply to her email wrote, “Providence is a national model for how the arts can bring vitality and soul and joy to an entire city. Thank you for making this possible.” ckozma@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:41:19.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
