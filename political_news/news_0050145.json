Trey Gowdy of South Carolina - offered to conduct a private swearing-in - before the hearing began - out of respect for Clinton.\nSpokesman Jamal Ware says the hearing is \"not about politics\" but about the four Americans who died in the attacks.\n___\n12:15 p.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton says it's clear the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, wasn't provided with all the requested security.\nThe former secretary of state says neither Ambassador Chris Stevens - who died in the 2012 attacks - nor the diplomatic mission got everything that was asked for.\nClinton tells a House committee that was the finding of earlier congressional investigations and an independent review board conducting its own investigation of the attacks.\nBut Clinton also says even critics of the level of security in Benghazi have said the type of attack that took place would have been difficult to repel.\nStill, Republican Rep. Martha Roby of Alabama says the review board found that security was \"grossly inadequate\"\nClinton says the board uncovered deficiencies within the State Department - and the Obama administration has tried to make fixes.\n___\n11:30 a.m.\nRep. Susan Brooks is using a collection of emails as a way to suggest that the Obama administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton lost interest in Libya in the months before to deadly attacks in Benghazi in September 2012.\nAt a House committee hearing on Benghazi, the Indiana Republican is brandishing two piles of printed emails that she says show messages related to Benghazi and Libya.\nBrooks says he pile from 2011 has 795 emails, and the pile from 2012 has 67 emails.\nHere's what Brooks is telling Clinton: \"I can only conclude by your own records a lack of interest in Libya in 2012.\"\nClinton denies there was any diminished interest in Libya. She says most of her work wasn't done by email, but in personal meetings and briefings, secure telephone calls, diplomatic cables and other types of communication.\nClinton says she didn't even have a computer on her desk.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is pleading with the Republican-led House Benghazi committee to put - in her words - \"national security ahead of politics and ideology.\"\nThe former secretary of state says that after deadly attacks against Americans abroad during the Reagan, Bush and Bill Clinton administrations, leaders from both parties in Congress and the executive branch came together to figure out what went wrong and how to respond.\nClinton says that what's happened after the Sept. 11 attacks, after the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998 and after attacks against Americans in Lebanon when Ronald Reagan was president.\nShe's telling committee members that \"Congress has to be our partner as it has been after previous tragedies.\"\nThe committee is examining the deadly 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed.\n___\n10:50 a.m.\nThe top Democrat on the House Benghazi committee is offering a vigorous defense of Hillary Rodham Clinton and unleashing a scathing critique of the Republican-led panel.\nRep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland cites comments by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy - the California Republican who credited the committee with driving down Clinton's presidential poll numbers.\nClinton is the front-runner for her party's nomination in 2016.\nCummings is mocking the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, for saying it was hard to conduct the inquiry in such a partisan atmosphere.\nCummings wants to know why Gowdy was telling fellow Republicans to \"shut up when they are telling the truth\" - and not when they made what Cummings calls \"baseless claims\" against Clinton.\nCummings says it's time to end the \"fishing expedition\" by the committee against Clinton.\n___\n10:40 a.m.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is telling a House committee there were \"no delays in decision-making\" immediately after the deadly 2012 attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.\nClinton is the star witness in the GOP-led investigation.\nShe's also says that in the U.S. response, there were \"no denials of support from Washington\" or from the U.S. military.\nShe's calling for transparency in the investigation - which critics say is focused on hampering Clinton's run for the White House in 2016. She's the Democratic front-runner.\nFour Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the attacks.\nThe committee chairman - GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina - accuses Clinton and the Obama administration of withholding information, including Clinton's emails, about what happened in Washington following the attacks.\n___\n10:15 a.m.\nThe chairman of the House committee investigating the deadly attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 is telling former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the investigation is not about her.\nThat is the message in Rep. Trey Gowdy's opening statement at a public hearing where Clinton - the Democratic front-runner for president in 2016 - is testifying.\nThe South Carolina Republican says the investigation is focusing on the four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the attacks.\nGowdy say the committee is looking for the truth about the diplomatic compound's request for more security, equipment and personnel - and what was being discussed in Washington while the Americans were under attack.\nAfter months of buildup, Clinton is taking center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led investigation.\n___\n9:50 a.m.\nHundreds of people are gathering outside the Longworth House Office Building before the highly anticipated public hearing where Hillary Rodham Clinton is to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\nNews photographers are packing the well of a hearing room normally used by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. It's the largest hearing room on the House side of the Capitol.\nClinton - the Democratic front-runner for president in 2016 - is the sole witness at the hearing.\nIt's the fourth hearing since the committee was formed in May 2014.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:16:59.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
