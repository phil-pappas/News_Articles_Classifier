Trial had been scheduled to begin Monday in Des Moines. \nThe three former top officials in Paul's campaign for the Republican nomination were indicted by a federal grand jury and pleaded not guilty in August. \nThey're charged with conspiring to pay former state Sen. Kent Sorenson $73,000 in campaign funds in exchange for his defection from Michele Bachmann's campaign. Prosecutors say they lied about the payments on federal disclosure forms to hide them from the public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:28:23.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
