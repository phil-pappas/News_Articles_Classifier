There's nothing like two adverse Iowa polls to restore his caustic belly fire , is there?\nAlthough it's, so far, not as bad as it could have been:\n“I like Ben, but he cannot do with trade like I do,” the New York real estate mogul told CNN's Jake Tapper, in an interview slated to air in full on Sunday at 9 a.m. on the network's State of the Union program. “He can't do with a lot of things like I do, so we'll just have to see what happens.”\nOn trade deals, eh, maybe; I think he's conflating individual business deals with international treaty negotiations way too much, but it's true that neither has ever been Gentle Ben's bailiwick. But it's that last part that is the vintage Trump putdown, essentially saying, “I'm better than you at everything, including having a longer, bigger penis.”\nTrump followed up on that in very short order:\n“I've done really well with the evangelicals and with the Tea Party and everything and I just don't understand the number, but I accept the number,” Trump told Tapper. “It means I have to work a little bit harder in Iowa.”\nI understand the number; it means Trump is not doing nearly as well anymore with evangelicals and, in Iowa anyway, even TPers, for reasons that his standard “ATTACK!” tactic will only make worse, especially if he can't resist devolving into below-the-belt shots.\nLike, for example this one:\nTrump also attacked Carson during a rally at his Trump National Doral Miami resort, reports CNN, poking fun at his quiet personality and questioning his competence.\n“Donald Trump falls to second place behind Ben Carson,” Trump told the crowd, reading a headline.”We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.”\nMaybe this is just Trump being Trump, and maybe this is him giving up on Iowa and playing to primary voters in other States who are more likely to like that crap. Which may not be a bad strategy since winning the Hawkeye State isn't any kind of nomination bellwether. But the risk it runs is that Dr. C's momentum keeps building and overflows into New Hampshire and those other early States. Doubling down on a strategy that has worked but is producing diminishing returns might constitute the beginning of the end for the Trump campaign.\nBut as limited a performer as The Donald is, he's pretty much confined to, as it were, “dancing with the one that brung him” to this “dance”. Time will tell if he's playing with fire.\nExit thought: Doesn't that last jab have racist undertones being aimed at a black man?
