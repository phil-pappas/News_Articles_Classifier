Bush was speaking to donors about his brother’s campaign recently where he let his feelings be known for former adviser and current Texas Senator Ted Cruz. \n“I just don’t like the guy,” Bush said during the speech, according to a report from Politico.com. \nAccording to the Politico report , Bush spoke of other GOP presidential hopefuls in pleasant terms “until he got to Cruz.” Politico said one donor in the room paraphrased the president’s comments saying, “He said he found it ‘opportunistic’ that Cruz was sucking up to Trump and just expecting all of his support to come to him in the end.” \nCruz has made no friends on Capitol Hill since arriving as part of the tea party wave in 2010. The first-term senator has accused Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of lying on the Senate floor and Cruz hasn’t been able to stop any of the policies he said he would when he was elected. \nOn the campaign trail, he’s appeared with Trump at events and espouses some of the same policies as the notorious billionaire. Cruz has also been highly critical of George W. Bush’s policies when he was in office. \nA spokesman for the former president told Politico that Bush doesn’t “view Senator Cruz as Governor Bush’s most serious rival” for the nomination. \nCruz released a statement on the comments from the former president that said, “I have great respect for George W. Bush and was proud to work on his 2000 campaign and in his administration. It’s no surprise that President Bush is supporting his brother and attacking the candidate he believes pose a threat to his campaign. I have no intention of reciprocating.” Read or Share this story: http://kvue.tv/1LIII34 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:43:38.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
