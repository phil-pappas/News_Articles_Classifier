But time is certainly changing our opinions and treatment toward – and our lives with – our furry companions. “A dog is a family member” is a good way to describe the evolution taking place. Focusing on “It’s just a dog” suggests that dogs are creatures with no ability to think; they just follow humans around for food and shelter. Consequently, dogs must have no feelings. No joy, no anger, no love, no loss. We are lucky to live in a time in which such viewpoints are changing, and huge kudos must be given to early dog trainers and animal behaviorists for realizing that the “dogs have no feelings” argument is clearly wrong. Over the past several decades, studies have been conducted to determine how dogs think, learn, and feel, and their results have been amazing. In the 1980s, veterinarian and animal behaviorist Ian Dunbar worked extensively with puppies under the age of six months, and initiated off-leash training with great success. His pioneering studies on the social lives and hierarchies of dogs are used today in training and behavior work. Karen Pryor was a marine-mammal trainer who brought her operant skills and positive, reward-based methods to the dog-training world. Pryor introduced dog trainers to clicker-training in the early 1990s, and showed how positive methods of training are highly effective, and far more enjoyable, for both dog and owner. These are just two individuals among many who advanced the understanding of dog behavior into the science of dog training. We have learned that dogs do think. (Sorry to disappoint those who think they just love you for the food.) They can even think analytically – dogs are very good at solving problems – and can be quite independent in their thinking. Any observant person also knows they can count; just take out three treats, give the dog two treats, and try to get away with it. Such knowledge has helped dog training evolve into a practice that employs more positive methods, with methods that reward correct behavior now more commonplace. The days of physical force, punishment, and other harsh techniques of this sort are fading away, and positive, pleasing, reward-based methods build a bond between you and your dog. The study of animal behavior has grown into an extensive field. Dogs can have issues such as anxiety, fear, aggression, et cetera, and the behavior-modification techniques that have emerged from these studies have, in many case, saved dogs' lives. Dogs are also individual beings, whether they're Golden Retrievers, Border Collies, or Teacup Poodles. Each dog is different and each dog within its breed will be different, exhibiting its own separate personality, likes, and dislikes. Plus, every breed has genetic tendencies. For example, the Golden Retriever is bred to retrieve; the Border Collie to herd. But while genetics offers a base, not every Border Collie will herd, and we all know that many of our Golden Retriever friends love the sofa. (Retrieve what?) So that misguided statement “It's just a dog” simply does not fit these magnificent animals. Dogs think, love, cry, mourn, play – all the fascinating emotions we see our dogs display every day. They are loyal and interesting friends that bring so much to our lives. We humans should consider ourselves lucky that so many thousands of years ago, dogs decided we were okay to hang with.
