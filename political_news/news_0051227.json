The trust of the people is a precious thing. It does not come easy,\" he said.\n\"You must continue to strive to deserve that trust. You must continue to engage Singaporeans honestly and openly. You must continue to speak frankly with them on the tough issues and lead with humility,\" he added at his first Cabinet swearing-in ceremony since he became President in 2011.\nEven as he welcomed the new Cabinet, he also took stock of the good progress Singapore had made in the last term of government.\nThe Government has worked hard to improve the lives of Singaporeans and has renewed its commitment to a more caring and inclusive society, said Dr Tan as he listed a raft of measures being undertaken - from economic restructuring to the introduction of lifelong medical insurance MediShield Life.\nDr Tan also noted that \"we have remained cohesive in spite of a more diverse populace\".\nFault lines such as race and religion can divide, and external forces can tug at the nation too - terrorism and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria remain a deep concern, he said.\n\"But despite our differences, we remain united,\" he said, adding that Singapore stayed true to the convictions of its first president, Mr Yusof Ishak, who saw the country's variety of race, language, religion and culture as a strength.\nBut a long road lies ahead, said Dr Tan.\nThe world economy has hit a rough patch, and Singapore grapples with an ageing population and sits in a volatile region that grows ever more uncertain.\nIn the Sept 11 General Election, he noted that Singaporeans sent a clear signal that they wanted to stay together in the face of regional and global uncertainties, and to work with the Government for a better future.\n\"Singaporeans are a good-hearted and strong-spirited people. They will stand together in the hardest of times,\" he said.\n\"And as they have shown over the past 50 years, they are capable of responding to exceptional leadership to accomplish remarkable things.\"\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on October 02, 2015, with the headline 'Work hard to deserve people's trust: President'.
