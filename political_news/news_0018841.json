What a hypocrite she is. \n\"Her attack comes after the Government took half a billion dollars out of Housing NZ and has cut the number of state houses by more than 1000. \n\"The most common reason I hear about people turning down their houses is their appalling condition which is hardly surprising when cold, damp, mouldy houses are killing children like Emma-Lita Bourne. \n\"There are thousands of hard up Kiwi families desperate to get a state house but cannot get a foot in the door under National’s policy,\" Phil Twyford says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:06:50.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
