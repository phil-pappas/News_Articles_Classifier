Jones is police custody and is said to have opened fire following an altercation in a parking lot.\nOne person is dead and three others are wounded following an early-morning shooting at Northern Arizona University, according to officials at the Flagstaff campus.\nA statement from the University reports that the shooter is in custody and that the three injured victims are being treated at a Flagstaff hospital.\nThe first call to the police about gunfire outside Mountain View Hall occurred at 1:20 a.m., and the dormitory was temporarily put on lockdown.\nRelated Stories Mass Shootings Are Contagious, ASU Professor Says ASU Students Lobby to Allow Guns on Campus Tweets from NAU show that by 3 a.m., the situation was stabilized and that the shooter was apprehended.\nNo details have been released so far about the identity of the victims, but concerned parents are encouraged to call 928-523-0007. Additionally, a Family Assistance Center has been set up in the ballroom of 1899 Bar & Grill, 307 West Dupont Avenue in Flagstaff.\nThe shooting — the 295th so far this year nationwide in which four or more people have been shot — comes just eight days after 26-year-old Christopher Harper-Mercer opened fire on Umpqua Community College killing nine and injuring nine others. Harper-Mercer committed suicide during a subsequent shootout with police.\nThe incident reignited a national debate about gun control and mental health services in the country.\nEarlier this year, Arizona State University professor Sherry Towers published a study showing that mass shootings are contagious. According to Towers' research, within 13 days of a shooting with four or more victims, there is a heightened probability of another shooting occurring — about 20 percent to 30 percent of mass killings happen during these so-called infectious periods.\nNAU officials are expected to give a live press conference sometime Friday morning. New Times will post new information as it becomes available.\nFollow live updates with the hashtags #NAUAlert and #ArizonaShooting .\n#NAUAlert : Details confirmed 4 victims, 1 fatality, 3 wounded. Shooter is in custody. Situation is stabilized.
