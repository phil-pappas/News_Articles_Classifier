(AP) - Kentucky's race for attorney general has featured rhetorical attacks worthy of a courtroom drama, pitting a venerable political brand name against an up-and-coming state lawmaker. The candidates, both in their 30s, have been quick to bad-mouth each other's qualifications. \nLooming as a wild card is two-term Gov. Steve Beshear, who has a personal stake in the outcome. \nRELATED: AG candidates wrangle over Davis case \nBeshear's son, Andy, a prominent trial attorney, is the Democratic nominee. His Republican opponent is freshman state Sen. Whitney Westerfield, who serves as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. \nThe race to become Kentucky's chief law-enforcement officer has turned into a multi-million-dollar slugfest that has the candidates hurling conflict-of-interest accusations at each other.
