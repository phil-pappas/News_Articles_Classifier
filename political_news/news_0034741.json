The agreement announced on Saturday would bring the shortfall to $700 million. The MTA is expected to make up the rest through dedicated revenue streams and possible program reductions, according to the statement.\nThe plan, which still requires approval by the MTA board, will pay for the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure and to buy new subway carriages, commuter rail cars and buses to alleviate transportation congestion and delays. The money will also go to repairs for track systems, signals, support structures, bridges and tunnels.\nSome of the damage dates back to Superstorm Sandy, which crippled the system in October 2012.\nA representative of the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for mass transit riders that earlier criticized officials for failing to close the funding gap, was not immediately available for comment.\n(Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Von Ahn)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:11:13.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
