The contributors were largely investments groups which would own and operate the 10 commercial marijuana growing sites around the state which would be permitted if the issue passes. \n\nThe vast majority of donations came from nine investment groups, accounting for $11,966,000 in 78 separate donations. DGF LLC, owned by Frank “Bo” Wood, an investor in the Clermont County farm and head of Secret Communications, a Cincinnati investment firm, was the largest single donor at $2.35 million, according to the campaign finance report. \n\nResponsibleOhio also had 237 individual contributors who gave a total of $7,695 in amounts ranging from $2 to $200. \n\nResponsibleOhio previously filed reports showing it raised nearly $3.5 million and spent $3.4 million, much of it on the signature-collection effort to get the issue on the ballot. Ian James, ResponsibleOhio’s executive director, is the co-owner The Strategy Network, the company in charge of gathering signatures of registered voters. \n\nThe amendment would legalize use of recreational marijuana by Ohioans 21 and older and medical marijuana by anyone with a medical condition certified by a physician. There would be up to 1,159 marijuana shops allowed around the state, plus medical marijuana dispensaries. \n\nMarijuana sales would be taxed at the wholesale and retail level, with revenue channeled mostly to cities, counties and townships. \n\nOhioans Against Marijuana Monopolies, the broad coalition opposing Issue 3, has not yet filed a campaign report. \n\nDispatch reporter Randy Ludlow contributed to this report. \n\najohnson@dispatch.com \n\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:28:29.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
