Republican Bryce Reeves (Spotsylvania) won by 0.5 percent of the vote, making possible his party’s domination of Virginia’s Senate. Republicans squeaked by in significant local elections and extended their influence in setting county supervisor and school board district boundaries.\nIs it any wonder reform opponents and their backers now make the laws that affect Virginians the most? They ignore The Post’s editorials and are most powerful at the ballot box when many don’t bother to vote. The next time the editorial board reminds Virginia readers that redistricting reform is overdue, it should point out this is an excellent reason to vote in the next state and local elections.\nMarc Greidinger , Springfield", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:54:55.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
