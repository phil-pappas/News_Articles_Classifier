PHOTO | ROBERT NGUGI | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Investigations indicate that the hasty retreat largely springs from muted complaints in the URP wing of government. Despite publicly terming Mr Kuria’s step as bold, most politicians from Rift Valley region where the DP comes from are said to be questioning his sincerity. Information we obtained also shows that the DP’s defence team is studying how much premium (if any) is coming from the rhetoric, with concerns that the venom being unleashed in the rallies could work against Mr Ruto. Another purpose it has served is to silence URP members who last month accused President Kenyatta’s TNA of doing little to help their party leader mount a legal-diplomatic war against the ICC. Advertisement More by this Author \nIn an intriguing twist to the International Criminal Court standoff with the opposition, State House now wants Jubilee politicians to exercise caution in the ongoing debate on criminal charges that Deputy President William Ruto is battling. \nThis is informed by fears that the campaign against the court could boomerang on Jubilee, and possibly polarise the country, the Sunday Nation has learnt. \nThe message was sent out quietly last week by elderly politicians from Nairobi and Mount Kenya region, with one of the politicians confiding to us that while State House had prior information of Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria’s plan of “owning-up” to the role he might have played in the cases, the matter appears to have assumed a life of its own. \nInvestigations indicate that the hasty retreat largely springs from muted complaints in the URP wing of government. Despite publicly terming Mr Kuria’s step as bold, most politicians from Rift Valley region where the DP comes from are said to be questioning his sincerity. Some of them see the offer as coming too late in the day. \nIf State House has its way, we are likely to see a reduction in the prayer rallies, or even a complete stop. Jubilee politicians are not known to disregard directives from State House. \nInformation we obtained also shows that the DP’s defence team is studying how much premium (if any) is coming from the rhetoric, with concerns that the venom being unleashed in the rallies could work against Mr Ruto. \nThe ICC prosecutor has in the past said she keenly follows public discussions on the cases, so the concerns by the DP’s lawyers could be well grounded. \nKeen to make a statement to the court, the DP last week distanced himself from the prayers, saying he could speak for himself and did not need Jubilee MPs to do it for him. He has not attended any of the rallies in what is believed to be advice from his lawyers. \nAlthough shying away from being quoted on the new tactic, multiple sources said President Uhuru Kenyatta increasingly feels that Mr Kuria’s revelation is doubled-edged, with the potential to work for Mr Ruto, like is intended, and at the same time rattle Jubilee. \nState House spokesman Manoah Esipisu declined to comment on the development, or to respond to messages sent to his mobile phone, perhaps pointing to the dicey nature of the topic. \nThe thinking at the epicentre of power is that Mr Kuria’s “revelation” has served the purpose and, given that he has offered to testify in favour of the DP, the matter should now be canvassed before the courts and other international forums. \nAnother purpose it has served is to silence URP members who last month accused President Kenyatta’s TNA of doing little to help their party leader mount a legal-diplomatic war against the ICC. \nProf Macharia Munene, a political analyst from the United States International University, says the rallies have helped Jubilee politicians let off steam on the ICC matter. “Whether it does add value to the DP’s case at the ICC is a completely different matter. But you must acknowledge the value of venting out,” he says. \nAnother substitute to the rallies, the Sunday Nation gathered, is the stepping up of a diplomatic charm offensive at the African Union and the Assembly of State Parties to make a case for the DP, something that is ongoing. The latest was an expression of interest by the AU to be enjoined in the case as a friend of the court. \nThose close to Mr Kenyatta say he has taken a conscious decision not to comment on ICC matters in public but instead focus his energies on helping his deputy win the cases. \nWhichever approach he adopts, Mr Kenyatta finds himself between the hammer and the anvil: he must be seen to be doing his best to salvage the man who was instrumental in making him president; and he must appear to be obeying the Rome Statute which created the ICC and which Kenya is a signatory to. \nThe debate has so far proved muddy, with Cord leader Raila Odinga dragging President Uhuru Kenyatta’s name into the centre of the ICC plot, accusing him of hypocrisy and directly linking him to the woes of his deputy. \nIn the process, Mr Odinga has created an awkward situation for the Head of State. \n“Mr Moses Kuria was an employee and a political assistant to Mr Uhuru Kenyatta when he arranged the procuring of witnesses to fix Deputy President William Ruto,” Mr Odinga said last week, sentiments partly believed to have informed the latest move by State House. \nIf a short message that has been doing the rounds in Central Kenya and among TNA MPs in Nairobi is anything to go by, then President Kenyatta is seriously concerned over the “fixing” debate. “H.E. is of the view that we stop further talk on ICC. \nThis is to kindly request you to desist from making further sentiments which are likely to be misinterpreted or taken as admission of fixing DP Ruto. You will receive further directions,” reads the text. shown to us by one of the MPs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:54:11.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
