The rest of the illegal crossings by the citizens of Ukraine were in large part linked to smuggling. Ukrainians, Georgians, Moldovans and other citizens of the CIS countries accounted for 47 percent of the illegal crossings. The remaining 53 percent of the detections involved nationals from outside the region, especially citizens of Vietnam and Afghanistan. Detections of illegal crossings between border crossing points in the April-June period increased 82 percent from the previous quarter and 74 percent from the same three-month period of 2014. Larger numbers of Vietnamese and Afghan migrants accounted for the increase, while the number of Syrian nationals fell from the first three months of the year. distributed by This content was issued by Frontex - European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders on the 2015-10-08 and was sent to noodls by the official representative of the issuer.
