Dick Durbin and three other Democratic senators quietly visited Greece over the weekend to view the humanitarian crisis up close. Alongside Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Durbin visited with refugees on the streets of the island of Lesbos and in processing centers, praising cash-strapped Greece and Turkey for their work caring for those fleeing the Syrian civil war.\nBut Durbin returned from his trip more resolute than ever that the United States should step up, announcing he’d support a bipartisan supplemental spending bill aimed at helping Syrian refugees and criticizing the U.S. for taking in just 2,000 Syrians.\n“You have to understand how desperate people would be to send a 15-year-old boy and his 8-year-old sister, alone,” the Illinois Democrat told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday. “We can do better. And I think we should, after careful vetting.”\nDurbin wants the United States to accept 100,000 Syrians displaced by the war among the Syrian government, moderate rebels and the Islamic State, the same number that a spending bill written by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) aims to help. However, the No. 2 Democrat has not put a timetable on how quickly the U.S. should accept those refugees.\nSome countries cracking down too hard on Islamists, State Dept. says By Nahal Toosi\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration has raised its refugee cap with the goal of accepting 10,000 Syrians next year. But that’s not good enough for many Democrats in Congress, and Durbin unfavorably compared the current resettlement operation to the U.S.' efforts over the years to take in hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews, Vietnamese, Cubans and Somalis when those countries faced similar humanitarian crises.\n“The United States must continue to meet its moral obligation when it comes to refugees,” Durbin said. “The United States can be helpful. I would support a supplemental for that purpose.”\nThe window for passing such legislation may be imminent, with budget negotiations ongoing and a spending bill needed by Dec. 11. The Leahy-Graham bill would spend about $1 billion on Syrian resettlement.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/graham-and-leahy-introduce-bipartisan-emergency-funding-bill-to-strengthen-us-response-to-the-syrian-refugee-crisis"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:43:59.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
