And it really isn't so much about that question as it is about — it sets up a classification, or a class of people, who can now sue. You see what I mean? So what happens is, it sets up a whole industry for people who want to sue,\" he added. \"So if you happen to be gay and you get fired, now you have a reason you can sue them. But it's almost impossible sometimes. People don't put up a sign and say, 'I'm firing you because you're gay.' It's something that's very much disputed. And so I don't know that we need to keep adding to different classifications to say the government needs to be involved in the hiring and firing.\"\nHe explained that although there are still big questions that need to be answered regarding the rights of employers and employees, society is moving quickly towards greater acceptance of the LGBT community. So rather than rely on the government to intercede on behalf of one group, evolving cultural norms could very well answer the question of anti-LGBT discrimination, Paul seemed to suggest.\n\"I think society is rapidly changing. If you are gay, there are plenty of places that will hire you. I would say the vast majority of corporations already privately have manuals, or work manuals, that say that they don't discriminate in any way,\" he said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump: 'Maybe Dems told CNN to go easy on their candidates' It's 'very possible' the DNC asked CNN to give the Dems an easier time than they gave the Republicans.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/14/15 8:49 PM These concluding remarks, however, caught the ear of a few reporters, some of whom mischaracterized them later on social media by excluding the context of Paul's full response.\n\"Rand Paul, asked whether employers [should] be able to fire LGBT workers, says, \"If you are gay, there are plenty of places that will hire you,\" the Los Angeles Times' Seema Mehta tweeted, reducing the entirety of Paul's answer into something where he seemingly shrugged at the idea of discrimination.\nHer tweet appeared before video or transcripts of the Drake University event were made available online. But the absence of the full context didn't stop reporters from weighing in on what Paul supposedly said.\nFellow L.A. Times colleague Matt Pearce responded to Mehta's tweet by commenting, \"Imagine replacing 'gay' with almost any other description of a person.\"\nMSNBC's Benjy Sarlin was incredulous.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump: moderators 'attack' me, ask Dems questions \"That's why we have freedom of speech folks,\" brushing off a small group of hecklers.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/14/15 8:59 PM \"So the Rand Paul solution to LGBT worker protections appears to be applying 'Don't Ask Don't Tell' to the entire economy,\" he said . \"Look, straight people, just never mention your spouse at work ever and no one will have any problems. Leave your home life at home.\"\nTime magazine's Phil Elliott did a better job than Mehta of reporting on the context of Paul's response, but he also mischaracterized the senator's remarks by focusing on the line about members of the LGBT community being hired easily.\nOut of all the quotes tweeted by Elliott, he led off with this: \"Asked about anti-discrimination policies for LGBT workers, Rand Paul says if people kept their home life at home, it wouldn't be an issue.\" He immediately followed with a tweet that read, \"Rand Paul on LGBT workers losing their jobs: 'If you are gay, there are plenty of places that will hire you.'\"\nElliott tweeted additional quotes later, but he apparently thought it was important to report first on Paul's hiring comment.\nUnfortunately for the Kentucky senator, the narrative that he supposedly shrugged off discrimination in the workplace doesn't look like it will go away, even after footage of the event was made available online.\nThe Hill followed Mehta's lead and published a story titled, \"Paul: LGBT people should keep their private lives out of the workplace.\"\nAnd the narrative had spread outside media circles. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's social media team saw an opportunity to boost her standing in the LGBT community, and they acted accordingly:\nThe feeling when a GOP candidate says it&#39;s acceptable to be fired for being gay. https://t.co/cF9mw5k8fq pic.twitter.com/cYFvcW27mQ — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 14, 2015 \nBut not everyone in media felt the same about Paul's answer. The Huffington Post's Sam Stein, for example, conceded after he had watched the video that the senator's comments were not as nearly as scandalous as initially claimed.\n\"Rand Paul's answer on LGBT protections in the workplace was much more thoughtful than what I [re-tweeted],\" Stein said.\n\nTop Story Iran ayatollah's new missile: Lawmakers demanding action \"This   action,\" Rep.
