The theme this year is CARE Matters, with the goals of increasing awareness of the rights of individuals receiving long-term care services and encouraging residents, family members, advocates, and providers to support these rights, thereby protecting a vulnerable population.\n\"Our staff is dedicated to treating residents with the dignity and respect they deserve,\" said Ruscavage. \"We encourage veterans or their families to contact us to find out how we can help them meet their long-term care needs.\"\nThe six homes serve more than 1,500 eligible veterans. They include the Delaware Valley Veterans' Home in Philadelphia , the Gino J. Merli Veterans' Center in Scranton , the Hollidaysburg Veterans' Home in Hollidaysburg , the Pennsylvania Soldiers' and Sailors' Home in Erie , the Southeastern Veterans' Center in Spring City , and the Southwestern Veterans' Center in Pittsburgh .\nThe grievance form, information about veterans' home eligibility and volunteer opportunities can be found at State Veterans Homes System .
