The man was a major shareholder of a digital broadcasting company in Hong Kong, and the company at the time had various license applications that were discussed and approved by Mr Tsang's cabinet.\nThe second charge relates to his nomination of an architect under the city's honors and awards system, but failed to disclose that he had hired the architect to engage in interior-design work for the Shenzhen flat. Both charges carry a maximum jail sentence of seven years. Mr Tsang has been released on bail but will appear in court later Monday afternoon.\nIn 2012, Mr Tsang apologised for his acts, which also included joy rides on private yachts and luxury aircraft owned by other tycoons, saying he didn't meet expectations of the public of a leader.\n\"We learn from our mistakes,\" he said in March 2012. \"We learn to become more sensitive [to public expectations].\" He also said at the time he would abandon the penthouse flat in Shenzhen.\nOn Monday, Mr Tsang said in a statement that he had fully assisted with the ICAC investigations over the past three years. \"My conscience is clear. I have every confidence that the court will exonerate me after its proceedings.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:12:58.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
