Paul Ryan still saying he won't run for speaker, Republicans are beginning to consider a \"Plan C.\" In the absence of a frontrunner, the field of alternatives is growing rapidly, though it’s not clear that any of the would-be contenders could rally the 218 votes needed to take the speaker’s gavel.\nMore than a half-dozen GOP lawmakers are considering running to lead the fractious Republican Conference if Ryan doesn't step up. Texas Rep. Mike Conaway and Tennessee Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Diane Black have all been approached about jumping into the race. Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, California Rep. Darrell Issa and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole are considering making a play for the speaker's gavel as well.\nAnd Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz and Florida Rep. Daniel Webster are continuing their bids to become the next speaker.\nThe House Republican Conference has been in chaos since Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly dropped out of the race for speaker Thursday morning. GOP leaders quickly turned to Ryan, a party favorite and the 2012 vice presidential candidate, as the one lawmaker who could unify the conference. Despite the frantic lobbying campaign to get Ryan to run, the Wisconsin Republican is not a candidate for speaker yet.\n\"Chairman Ryan appreciates the support he's getting from his colleagues but is still not running for Speaker,\" said Brendan Buck, Ryan's communications director Friday morning.\nNow, the GOP Conference remains in a kind of limbo. Republicans left a Friday morning meeting with no clear leadership path forward. Speaker John Boehner, who has been urging Ryan to get into the race, has still not set a new date for the leadership election. The Ohio Republican is set to leave Congress at the end of the month, but has said he will stay until the next speaker is chosen.\nSome lawmakers believe Boehner should have let the leadership elections continue after McCarthy stepped aside.\n\"Part of me believes that if we'd stayed in the room yesterday for six or seven hours, we could have found somebody that we could have supported with 218 votes,\" Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said. \"That person is out there.\"\nMulvaney suggested Webster \"is getting a lot more support than he had yesterday... A lot of folks are recognizing the value in having an institutionalist.\"\nSo far, there hasn't been a major public surge of support for either Webster or Chaffetz, the only official candidates for speaker, to lead the House.\nWhile many Republicans said they still hope Ryan will run, lawmakers are beginning to have quiet conversations within state and regional delegations about how to move forward if he decides to remain the Ways and Means Committee chairman.\n\"There are family conversations going on that I've got to finish up before I can say anything like that,\" said Conaway, when asked if he would run for speaker.\nThe Texas Republican said that there is a leadership vacuum when legislative maneuvers that are opposed by the majority of the GOP, like a discharge petition for renewing the Export-Import Bank, are successful. With its 25 members, the Texas delegation could be a powerful voting bloc in a leadership race if they stick together.\nConaway is hardly alone in considering a bid. Blackburn, who ran for conference chair in 2007 and lost, is also looking at a run.\n“I’ve had lots of my colleagues contact me yesterday evening and this morning and I’ve promised I would listen to them,\" Blackburn said. \"It’s good to hear them out. I’ve promised to listen to them and that’s at this point all I do. We’re eventually going to come around to the right person who can lead our caucus.”\nWestmoreland, former National Republican Congressional Committee deputy chairman, is also taking a look at the race.\n“I think my name’s been in the hat….but still have to go home and talk to the wife. As soon as we all sit down and talk about it at my house [I’ll announce],\" Westmoreland said.\nAt the same time, others continued to float Minnesota Rep. John Kline for the job.\nKline, who is retiring at the end of this Congress, repeatedly ducked questions about whether he would serve as a \"caretaker\" speaker. The Minnesota Republican made clear that he'd rather see Ryan in the speaker's chair than preside over the House himself.\n\"I think we need to find someone else who will unify our conference and protect the institution,\" Kline told reporters on Friday. \"I hope that person is Paul Ryan.\"\nLauren French contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:47:05.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
