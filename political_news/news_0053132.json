Power Play, the $1 add-on option to Powerball, will also include a 10X multiplier anytime the advertised annuity Powerball jackpot is $150 million or less to encourage game interest at lower jackpot levels. \n“We really think Powerball players in Virginia will like these changes — and also what’s not changing,” said Paula Otto, executive director of the Virginia Lottery, noting that profits from Powerball tickets bought in Virginia will continue to go to K-12 education. \nPowerball drawings are held at 10:59 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays. \nThe Powerball jackpot climbed to an estimated $310 million for Wednesday’s drawing, and a ticket sold in Michigan hit the jackpot. The jackpot for Saturday’s drawing is $40 million. \nA Virginia Beach man recently claimed a Powerball ticket worth $2 million. \nVirginia’s biggest Powerball prize was claimed on Valentine’s Day in 2013. Dave and Nancy Honeywell of Fredericksburg claimed a $217 million prize. \nacain@timesdispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:30:40.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
