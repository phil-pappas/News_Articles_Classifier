The primetime affair will be held in the city's Milwaukee Theater.\nThe Wisconsin faceoff is the fourth presidential debate sanctioned by the Republican National Committee. The host network has yet to announce the participation criteria. Previous criteria depended upon national polls.\nThe news comes on the eve of the Democratic party's first presidential debate.\nRepublicans have four more debates scheduled before the Iowa caucuses in February. That includes a meeting later this month in Colorado.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
