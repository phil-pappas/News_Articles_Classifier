This is not confined to Sharia law or Muslim religion. These parallel laws which discriminate against women have existed and may still exist in other religions.\" \nLord Green of Deddington, chairman of MigrationWatch, said Britain was entirely different to Muslim countries, adding: \"Those who come must accept that.\" \nThe independent crossbench peer said: \"We must be prepared to insist that there can be only one law. \n\"We must get away from what I call the Rotherham complex where the authorities were so afraid of offending a minority community that they turned a blind eye to the appalling abuse of young mainly British girls.\" \nLord Faulks, the justice minister, highlighted a government review of the operation of Sharia Councils but said that new laws were not needed as there are already protections in common law and existing legislation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:39:21.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
