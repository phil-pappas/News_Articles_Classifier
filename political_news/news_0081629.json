The StellarXplorers program builds on the success of AFA's CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program, the nation's premier cyber defense competition and the StellarXplorers Proof of Concept Demonstration completed in April 2015.\nThe previous pilot competition confirmed the excitement and engagement generated through the five Colorado high school teams that participated. The 2016 pilot will host 36-40 teams selected to demonstrate full national deployment of the program and the ability to deliver an inspirational educational experience for the three qualification rounds from the students' home location. In mid-April, the top teams will travel all expenses paid to Colorado Springs, CO , for the live finals competition in conjunction with the Space Foundation's 32 nd Space Symposium.\n\"The Air Force Association has a strong history of developing highly successful programs that largely impact the decisions young people make in regard to STEM careers and education - StellarXplorers has potential to do just that,\" said General Larry Spencer , AFA President.\n\"We are very grateful to our sponsors for their support,\" said Dick Bundy , AFA's Vice Chairman of the Board for Aerospace Education. \"The Air Force Research Laboratory's STEM Outreach Office has provided significant funding to get this program off and running. Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), OrbitalATK and the Space Foundation have provided outstanding support and we couldn't be more appreciative of their contributions.\"\nFor more information on team registration or sponsorship information, click here .\nThe Air Force Association is a non-profit, independent, professional military and aerospace education association. Our mission is to promote a dominant United States Air Force and a strong national defense, and to honor Airmen and our Air Force Heritage.\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, LinkedIn, and YouTube\n releases/air-force-associations-stellarxplorers-program-begins-second-test-phase-for-national-competition-300153425.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC18620&Transmission_Id=201510021222PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC18620&DateId=20151002", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/air-force-associations-stellarxplorers-program-begins-second-test-phase-for-national-competition-300153425.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.stellarxplorers.org/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:35:01.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
