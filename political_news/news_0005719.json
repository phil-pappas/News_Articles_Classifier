Together, at the annual Walk for Hope , they'll cheer, support, honor and commemorate mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, aunts and friends who have fought, or even will fight, women's cancers.\nThe 19 th annual signature event – a 5K/2K walk through the heart of City of Hope's campus – will be hosted by actress and author Alison Sweeney , a longtime supporter and Fitness Ambassador for City of Hope. Sweeney is also part of the ARM & HAMMER™ Truly Radiant™ campaign, benefitting City of Hope.\nThe fundraising walk for women's cancers is unique in that it's held in the same location where breakthrough research is conducted and where lifesaving treatment is delivered. A highlight of the event is the opportunity to wave, cheer and salute cancer patients watching from City of Hope Helford Clinical Research Hospital.\nCity of Hope's Walk for Hope, presented by Staples, raises funds for research into breast and other women's cancers and is the cornerstone of the institution's national Walk for Hope series. That series has now raised more than $37 million for City of Hope's Women's Cancers Program and is the only walk series that benefits research, treatment and education programs for all cancers affecting women.\n\"At City of Hope, our research creates new cancer treatments that benefit women everywhere. The supporters of that research quite clearly save lives,\" said Joanne Mortimer, M.D. , director of City of Hope's Women's Cancers Program. \"We are grateful for the funding raised through Walk for Hope, which enables us to provide a continuum of care - from research to risk assessment, prevention, treatment, education and survivorship.\"\nWomen's cancers will affect one in three women in her lifetime. One of those women is cancer survivor Allisa Miller , diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 29. Miller went to City of Hope for a second opinion and found reassurance and comfort as soon as she walked through the doors. Two years later, Miller is now cancer-free.\n\"I have triumphed over cancer. I could not have done it without my friends and family, my faith and the caregivers at City of Hope,\" said Miller. \"I needed a strong team behind me, and clearly City of Hope was that team.\"\nWith an expected 10,000 participants this year, Walk for Hope will celebrate the collaboration between researchers, patients and the community to end women's cancers.\nThe event itself will feature an expo area, a live music performance, a special ceremony with a survivors' moment, giveaways, an interactive photo booth and food trucks. Event-day festivities begin at 8 a.m. , opening ceremony begins at 9:45 a.m. and the Walk begins at 10 a.m. Online registration closes on Saturday, Nov. 7 .
