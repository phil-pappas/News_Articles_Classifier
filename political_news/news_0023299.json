Sabato of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\nTonight’s televised matchup will be the first time former secretary of state and current primary front-runner Hillary Clinton faces U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee.\nBut even CNN’s debate rules beckon Biden, who is still pondering whether he’ll throw his hat in. If he declares his candidacy today, he can take the stage in Las Vegas. There’s an extra podium waiting for him.\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a friend and former Senate colleague across the aisle from Biden, said he thinks the vice president will say yes to another presidential bid — and soon.\n“I feel the race is pretty wide-open,” Graham, a GOP presidential candidate, told the Herald during a campaign stop in Manchester, N.H., yesterday. “Hillary hasn’t closed the deal. The inevitability of her campaign hasn’t materialized and he’s been wanting to be president for a long time.”\nGraham added that he thinks the decision will come quickly for the vice president, who was polling at 16 percent in this weekend’s CBS News Democratic primary poll, trailing both Clinton and Sanders, though not yet being a declared candidate.\n“He has to make a quick decision and put together an organization,” Graham said, adding that he wasn’t sure whether Biden would be in for tonight’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas. “We are not too far away from voting, so he needs to make a decision in the next couple of days to a week.”\nIf he does, it could be most damaging to Clinton, who maintains a lead over Sanders in Iowa, South Carolina and Nevada polls, but trails him in New Hampshire.\nBiden’s pending decision “has got to bother her, because almost every survey I have seen shows that Biden takes more from her than from Sanders,” Sabato said.\nIf Biden does show up — either in person or in name only — Clinton, who debated Biden multiple times in the 2008 race, will be prepared, Democratic strategist Peter Fenn said.\n“My guess is it will be a short answer rather than a long one,” Fenn said. “It will probably be: ‘I welcome him to the debate.’ That’s it — boom,” Fenn said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:08:03.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
