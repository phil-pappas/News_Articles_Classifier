Francisco Sanchez , a spokesman for Harris County's emergency management division, says residents heeded warnings this time around.\nAt least 2,500 vehicles were stranded around Houston after Memorial Day storms dumped heavy rains and damaged thousands of homes.\nPatricia and another storm system have soaked parts of Texas with a foot of rain since Friday. No deaths have been confirmed or major damage reported.\nOfficials say the rain quenched parched ground that was able to soak up the water. The downpours were also less intense this time.\n8:15 a.m.\nForecasters say relentless storms that dumped more than a foot of rain in some parts of Texas are moving on and that dangerous flood warnings are coming to an end.\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Scott Overpeck said Sunday that soaking showers around Houston should begin clearing this afternoon.\nNo deaths or major destruction have been reported since heavy rains started drenching Texas on Friday.\nRemnants of Hurricane Patricia and a separate storm system combined to create the biggest deluge in Texas since torrential rains in May washed away homes and killed dozens. But Overpeck said a hot and dry summer allowed the ground to soak up more water this time.\nWeekend flooding did cause the derailment of a train and backed up traffic on a busy Texas interstate for 12 miles.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:28:11.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
