He told Neat FM's morning show 'GhanaMonTie' Wednesday that: “Rise and build tour is not what will get the party united.” \n“If you start such a tour without principal players in the NPP then where are you heading towards?” he asked. \n“What my party needs at the moment is a very strong, united front and not Rise and Build whatever tour! A united front is key to success! If we're not united, we should forget 2016, and truly, we're not united! Anyone who will tell you the party is united is not telling you the truth,” Dr Nyaho-Tamakloe said. \nBut addressing supporters in the Ashanti Region, where Mr Akufo-Addo is currently touring, Otiko Djaba said though Dr Nyaho-Tamakloe enjoys being called a senior party member, he is doing little to help the efforts of the team in winning power in 2016. \nShe has asked supporters of the NPP to ignore Dr Nyaho-Tamakloe’s criticism and rather focus on rallying efforts towards victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:20:01.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
