Image caption David Mundell said the bill delivered the Smith Commission recommendations \nMr Mundell has now said he wants it to happen in the next 18 months in order to give Holyrood \"more power and responsibility\". \nSuch a move could make taxation a major issue in next year's Holyrood election campaign. \nMr Mundell is to tell the Conservative party conference later: \"The final date for the transfer will be agreed between both of Scotland's governments as part of the Fiscal Framework negotiations, which are on-going. But we think 2017 is an achievable and desirable time for these new powers to take effect. \n\"It would mean that the Scottish Government elected next year would have to include plans for these new powers in its first budget. \n\"So when people in Scotland go to the polls next year, the parties will need to present their plans for income tax. And they'll need to be honest about what they will mean for Scottish taxpayers.\" \nA spokesman for Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said: \"The Tories just need to get on with the job of delivering more powers for Scotland, and a deal which meets the spirit and letter of the Smith Commission recommendations. \n\"What is currently proposed fails that test, as it limits Scottish ministers' ability to use the new powers and retains vetoes for UK ministers. \n\"We still need to reach agreement on a fiscal framework that gives the Scottish government flexibility to use the new powers effectively, to boost the economy and create jobs - and we have made it crystal clear that we will not support any proposed deal which risks leaving Scotland worse off.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:50:45.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
