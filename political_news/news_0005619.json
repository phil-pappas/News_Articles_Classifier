The funds will be used to build organizational capacity, allowing the nonprofit to develop future housing projects for low- to moderate-income families.\nThough established as a 501(c)3 in 2005, Regional Housing Solutions, a community housing development organization, is newly active under the leadership of a new board of directors, as well as a new CEO, Mark Whitmer and COO Karen Phillips.\n\"Regional Housing Solutions was activated to be able to serve a broader, 10-county area of northwest Arkansas ,\" said Ms. Phillips, who also serves on FHLB Dallas' Affordable Housing Advisory Council. \"There is a significant unmet need in this region of the state that we learned about from the many phone calls of people in need.\"\nU.S. Census figures showed the poverty level in Arkansas nearly four percentage points higher than the national average - 19.2 percent in Arkansas versus 15.4 percent overall. The data comes from 2013, the most recent numbers available.\n\" Arvest Bank is proud to team up with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and Regional Housing Solutions to support affordable housing in Western and Northwest Arkansas . We understand how homeownership improves the community and the natural pride people feel when they own their own piece of the American Dream,\" said JP Sexton, mortgage loan manager for the Arvest Fort Smith and River Valley Region. \"We look forward to the great things happening in our community and to the future success of Regional Housing Solutions in their efforts.\"\nPresented annually, PGP awards provide grants up to $12,000 to community-based organizations (CBOs), like Regional Housing Solutions. The funds may be used for research, organizational capacity-building, grant- and funding-application assistance, or contractual services. The structure of the PGP allows FHLB Dallas member institutions, such as Arvest Bank , to make a contribution to a CBO, which FHLB Dallas will match. The member's contribution may range from $500 up to $4,000 and is matched at a 3:1 ratio. In 2015, FHLB Dallas awarded $225,000 in PGP funds to support 25 organizations.
