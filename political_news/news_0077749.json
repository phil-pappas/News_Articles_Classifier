Other Stories \nWATCH VIDEO HERE. \nFriday afternoon, he appeared at the DMACC campus in Ankeny to talk about health care. \nAbout 400 people showed up to hear the retired pediatric neurosurgeon talk about his career in medicine and his plans for health care reform in the U.S. \nHe talked about health savings accounts and said they would give everyone more flexibility. \n\"A health savings account in which you have control of your own health care. Nobody else has control just like you have control of your own savings account,\" said Carson. \nCarson also spoke about increasing mental health services for veterans, including providing help transitioning back into society a year before they leave the military.

BEN CARSON: I JUST LOVED ANYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH MEDICINE. I WOULD GLADLY GET A SHOT JUST TO SMELL THE ALCOHOL SWABS. [LAUGHTER] MARK: BEN CARSON TOLD THE CROWD HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIZED. BEFORE SELLING HIS IDEA OF HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS HE SAYS WOULD GIVE AMERICANS FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE, JUST AS PEOPLE CONTROL THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. DR. CARSON: GIVING EVERYBODY THE AVAILABILITY OF A HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE DAY THEY ARE BORN UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE. AT WHICH TIME, THEY CAN PASS IT ON TO THEIR FAMILY. MARK: HE SAYS THESE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WOULD ALSO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION OF SHIFTING MONEY WITHIN THEIR FAMILY. DR. CARSON: IF MOM IS $500 SHORT, DAD CAN GIVE TO HER OUT OF HIS OR AUNT OR UNCLE OR COUSIN -- ANYBODY WITHIN THE FAMILY. I JUST LIKE HIS HONESTY, SINCERITY, AND CALMNESS. I REALLY ENJOY THE FACT HE'S NOT FROM THE POLITICAL ARENA, THAT HE'S FROM THE HEALTH CARE ARENA. MARK: HIS CAMPAIGN ALSO ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL MEDICAL COALITION, AN ADVISORY BOARD OF SORTS CONSISTING OF 32 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY -- INCLUDING DR. CHRISTINA TAYLOR FROM THE IOWA CLINIC. TAYLOR, WHO ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND REPRESENTATIVE ROB TAYLOR ARE STATE CO-CHAIRS FOR CARSON AMERICA, SAYS THE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT IDEA WOULD WORK. DR. TAYLOR: WHAT IT DOES IS EMPOWER PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISIONS OF HEALTH CARE. WHICH IS THE WAY MEDICINE WAS , YOU KNOW GENERATIONS AGO, AND , WE NEED TO BRING THAT BACK. MARK: CARSON ALSO SPOKE ABOUT VETERAN'S HEALTH CARE. HE WANTS VETS ENROLLED IN A SUPPORT SYSTEM THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE MILITARY CAREER. HE ALSO WANTS THEIR HEALTH CARE TO BE SUBSIDIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT. AND HE WANTS VETS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO ANY MEDICAL FACILITY IN THE U.S. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE VA HOSPITALS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:08:29.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
