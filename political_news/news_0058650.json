Photo: Kristina Torres / ktorres@ajc.com Officials said early voting eases congestion on Election Day and is more convenient for voters. More importantly, they said it allows time for a voter to correct any problem that may occur at the polls, including questions about registration.\nVoters can go online to check their registration status and find early-voting locations in their county via the secretary of state’s voter Web page or by contact their local elections office..\nEarly voting across Georgia began Monday and runs through Oct. 30.", "external_links": ["http://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/14/78/ee/voter-sticker-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:09:47.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
