Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attacks, endured a grueling interrogation by GOP lawmakers at the 11-hour hearing.\nEarlier Friday, Pelosi said Democrats \"may decide that now, defending the truth, their job is done, they're going to move on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:27:31.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
