Chief in Its Sights By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW OCT. 18, 2015 Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — If the House Republicans’ Benghazi investigation craters after former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s testimony this week, the chamber’s right-wing caucus has a sequel in mind: attempting the second impeachment of an executive branch appointee in 226 years. The target is John Koskinen, the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. The specifics of any supposed impeachable offenses are vague. Mr. Koskinen, 76, is a respected, successful business and government executive who, at the behest of the White House, took on the job of cleaning up the beleaguered tax agency in December 2013, after offenses had been committed. Since 1789, the House has impeached 19 officials: two presidents, 15 judges, a senator in the 18th century. The only executive branch appointee impeached was William Belknap, President Ulysses S. Grant’s war secretary. Now, the 40-member Freedom Caucus, which played a role in the resignation of John A. Boehner, speaker of the House, wants to try again. The House Oversight Committee, where proceedings would start, is stacked with right-wing Republicans. The accusations stem from 2013, when the I.R.S.’s tax-exempt division was found to have disproportionately targeted conservative groups for scrutiny. Although Mr. Koskinen was brought in after the damage had been done, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and his Freedom Caucus followers say Mr. Koskinen has tried to cover up some wrongdoing. Some accuse him of lying. The tax agency is unpopular and makes an appealing political target. Democrats say the allegations against Mr. Koskinen are unfounded: “It is despicable character assassination,” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Oversight Committee. “They are manufacturing a phony issue for ideological reasons.” The specific charges seem specious: There may have been miscommunication, but there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Koskinen. Former Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 2011 until this year and now a senior policy adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that while, to him, Mr. Koskinen “has been a disappointment” in terms of reforming the troubled agency, “impeaching the I.R.S. commissioner is not a tactic that will be successful.” The alleged pre-Koskinen abuses by the I.R.S. tax-exempt division have been the subject of three inquiries: First, a nine-month investigation by the Treasury’s inspector general, a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush. The second was conducted by the Government Accountability Office and the third in a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee report. All were critical of I.R.S. mismanagement, but none found any evidence of illegal activities or political directions from on high. A New York Times investigation of the I.R.S.’s Cincinnati operations described an understaffed, bureaucratic, poorly led office that rarely discussed politics but searched for political phrases in applications to flag groups that might not qualify for exemptions. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, which allowed torrents of special interest money into campaigns, also encouraged groups to declare themselves principally social welfare organizations that dabble in politics. That designation made them eligible for favorable tax treatment with minimal disclosure requirements. Under pressure from Republicans, the I.R.S. is pulling back from a push for stricter regulation of these groups. A partisan impeachment probably would seem a foolish distraction from the real issues of jobs, health care, debt and terrorism. It could backfire in the same way as the impeachment of President Bill Clinton 17 years ago and the politically motivated government shutdowns did and the fizzling Benghazi inquest is most likely to. The fight within the House Republican caucus reflects less an ideological split than the manifestation of a seemingly apocalyptic view from the right-wing minority that the political system has to be destroyed before it can be reformed. That belief justifies actions such as impeachment. More than a few Republicans fear their colleagues would be making a huge mistake.
