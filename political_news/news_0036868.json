(\"eBay\") has agreed to pay $1.2 million to settle claims concerning the fees paid by eBay sellers in connection with certain listings with the \"Buy It Now\" option. eBay denies liability and there has been no finding of liability in the suit.\nPlaintiff Luis Rosado filed the class action lawsuit entitled Luis Rosado v. eBay Inc. , Case No. 5:12-CV-04005 (EJD). Plaintiff alleges that sellers did not get the full value of their Buy It Now listings when a prospective buyer clicked on the Buy It Now option, thereby ending the listing, but subsequently failed to pay for the listed item.\nThe Court has preliminarily approved the settlement and a final approval hearing is set for February 25, 2016 . If approved, the settlement will provide class members who submit claims with check payments of $5 , $10 or $15 , depending on the nature of the Buy It Now listings that they placed during the class period of July 30, 2008 to September 10 , 2015. Class members who submit claims and have active eBay accounts may also be eligible for additional credits, depending on the number of claims that are filed.\nFurther information regarding the allegations in the lawsuit, the terms of settlement, and class members' options can be found on the settlement website, www.ebaybuyitnowclassaction.com or by calling 1-844-528-0186.\n releases/the-ebay-buy-it-now-class-action-settles-for-12-million--if-you-were-an-ebay-seller-from-july-30-2008-to-september-10-2015-your-rights-may-be-affected-300155749.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF21601&Transmission_Id=201510091913PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF21601&DateId=20151009", "http://www.ebaybuyitnowclassaction.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-ebay-buy-it-now-class-action-settles-for-12-million--if-you-were-an-ebay-seller-from-july-30-2008-to-september-10-2015-your-rights-may-be-affected-300155749.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:22:09.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
