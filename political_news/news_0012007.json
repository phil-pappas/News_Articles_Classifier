The MÄori Party is holding its AGM at Te Åhaaki Marae in Huntly this weekend where the party will review its first year since the General Election 2014 and plan for the future. \nAs a support partner in Government, the MÄori Party is driving a development agenda focused on whÄnau wellbeing, housing and better use and retention of MÄori land. \nMÄori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says, \"We are the only political party in this country focused on supporting MÄori-driven strategies in housing, education, family violence and the revival of our language. \n\"Like most kaupapa MÄori organisations, we punch well above our weight.\" \nThis year’s budget saw gains for WhÄnau Ora with an additional $49.8 million allocated to fund Navigators, $2.1 million for the rangatahi MÄori suicide prevention fund, $12.8 million to support a Ture Whenua Network and $63.34 million committed to the MÄori Housing Network. \nThe MÄori Party is particularly proud of their continued advocacy around whÄnau poverty which resulted in an increase to benefit levels for beneficiaries with tamariki in this year’s Budget. \nMÄori Party Co-leader Marama Fox says most commentators were surprised that a National-led Government would spend $790-million to lift core benefit rates for whÄnau. \n\"We were instrumental in securing that benefit increase and we will continue to advocate for whÄnau enduring hardship in this country. As the only non-Ministerial MP on the Ministerial Committee on Poverty, I’ll continue to keep the pressure on this Government to reduce poverty.\" \nMrs Fox, who came into Parliament as the party’s first List MP at the last General Election, says the MÄori Party MPs have used their two votes and their role as a support partner in Government to maximum effect. \n\"We’ve been criticised by some for supporting a National-led Government but we’re at the table so we can continue to build on the gains we’ve already made for our people. The Relationship Agreement we have with National means we can lobby National directly on issues that are important to our voters like housing, reducing family violence and protecting our environment. \n\"We also have the freedom to vote for opposition-led bills like the Paid Parental Leave Bill and the Minimum Wage Bill which were proposed by Labour,\" she says. \nAs the Minister for MÄori Development, Te Ururoa Flavell is leading two major legislative reforms on the laws governing MÄori land and the MÄori Language (Te Reo MÄori) Bill. \nMr Flavell says the biggest challenge for the party going forward is to secure more MÄori Party MPs at the next General Election. \n\"We know there’s a lot of support for what we’re doing in Parliament, from both MÄori and non-MÄori, so our challenge is to translate that support in to votes.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:01:07.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
