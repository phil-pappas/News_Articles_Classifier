Western European countries are reeling from the presence of a hostile immigrant population that refuses to assimilate and respect the values and culture of the countries they are settling in. Crime is out of control and the ever present danger of ISIS terrorists exists. The very social fabric of places like France is being ripped apart.\nAlso consider the fact that aside from the refugee camps that are situated in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, the Arab world is not offering to accept any of their own Arab/Muslim brethren. They insist that the West bear the burden. Does that make sense? It is great to be compassionate, but not when it entails suicide.\nThe refugee camps should remain in the Middle East. The West can provide support and aid. But when the day comes that places like Syria, Iraq and Libya are (hopefully) freed from ISIS control, these people should return and help rebuild their own countries. The West simply cannot absorb them.", "external_links": ["http://eaglerising.com/24433/all-of-europe-turns-out-to-protest-against-the-muslim-invaders/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Fousesquawk/~4/p2xk1k-wjcQ"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:35:11.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
