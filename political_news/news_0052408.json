The case returned to the court after justices ruled in 2013 that the school must show that taking race into consideration is both essential and narrowly applied. An appeals court upheld the practice since then and an appeal of that decision brought it back to the Supreme Court. \nAccording to USAToday.com , Texas accepts the top seven to eight percent of students from every high school that ranks them and that makes up 75 percent of the freshman class. The class ends up being about four percent black and 15 percent Hispanic due to much of the state being racially segregated. Texas will then fill out the class based on other factors, including race. \nAbigail Fisher filed the suit against UT, but later went to Louisiana State University. USAToday.com reported the case is not moot because Fisher paid $100 for application and housing fees in 2008. \nIf the Supreme Court rules against Texas, it could open the door for a much larger assault on affirmative action. \nAnother case that puts Texas at the center of the Supreme Court is Evenwel vs. Abbott. The suit will allow the Supreme Court to define the principle of one person, one vote. \nUnder the Constitution, states use total population figures to create Congressional districts. Texas follows this mandate, but the challengers said that diminishes the value of their votes and gives districts with large numbers of non-voters extra clout. \nA victory for the plaintiffs would likely benefit rural and white voters and possibly hurt urban residents and minorities, according to USAToday.com . \nFinally, the Supreme Court may also take up the case of Texas' abortion restrictions put in place in the last few years. The restrictions in question force doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges to a hospital nearby and impose clinic requirements that would shut down all but 10 clinics in the entire state and could force some who want the procedure to have to drive hundreds of miles. \nThe state law was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but other appellate courts have struck down similar laws. Typically, the Supreme Court steps in when there is a discrepancy in the rulings from the numerous federal courts of appeals across the country. The Supreme Court will make a final ruling on the matter to give clarity to lower courts.
