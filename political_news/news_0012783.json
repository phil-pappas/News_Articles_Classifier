(AP Photo/File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 11, 2015 | 10:58 p.m. EDT + More TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) â€” The estate of Jimi Hendrix is suing a Tucson man for a guitar once owned by the legendary guitarist.\nThe Arizona Daily Star in Tucson reported (http://bit.ly/1OuM1M5) Sunday that Experience Hendrix LLC, the company that runs Hendrix's estate, wants a Pima County Superior Court judge to order the guitar returned.\nAccording to the Oct. 2, complaint, the estate says Harvey Moltz, owner of Rainbow Guitars, is not the rightful owner of the Acoustic Black Widow guitar.\nEstate attorney Ed McPherson says the guitar is valued between $750,000 and $1 million. The lawsuit is also seeking damages.\nMoltz says he purchased the guitar in June 2014 from someone who bought it from Sheldon Reynolds, ex-husband of Hendrix's adopted sister, Janie Hendrix.\nMcPherson says Reynolds, a former member of Earth, Wind, and Fire, stole it.\n\"The guitar is priceless to our family,\" Janie said in an email. She is the CEO of Experience Hendrix. \"It is one of the few guitars that came home after Jimi passed away. We just want our guitar returned safely and back where it belongs.\"\nTucson-based lawyer Todd Jackson is representing Moltz.\n\"My client purchased the guitar in good faith from a private seller, without knowledge of competing claims of ownership,\" he said.\n___\nInformation from: Arizona Daily Star, http://www.tucson.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
