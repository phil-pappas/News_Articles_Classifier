I am delighted that despite fierce competition from other fundraisers my bid was accepted and I look forward to meeting Tony Blair.\"\nOther prizes included tickets for Celtic Park and Ibrox and a Stark Trek uniform signed by Labour supporter Patrick Stewart.\nShare article A Rubix Cube and a bottle of champagne signed by former leader Ed Miliband were also on offer.\n“It’s probably flat,” one party member said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:09.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
