One victim of the recent violence, Eitam Simon Henkin, was an American citizen.\nEarlier in the week, State Department spokesman John Kirby strongly condemned the violence and called for all perpetrators to be \"swiftly brought to justice.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T23:22:41.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
