The pro-EU campaign needed to be led by someone who was not a politician and who had “operated” in Europe, he added. \nLord Rose said company bosses had felt some confusion because of previous advice from the government to ‘back off’ on the topic. Now, though, it was time to speak out. \nWhatever his pro-EU credentials, Lord Rose’s 40-year career at many of the UK’s best-known retailers makes him British business aristocracy. His most visible moment in the public eye was during his leadership of M&S from 2004 to 2011, when he fought off a putative takeover approach from Sir Philip Green, the colourful head of the Arcadia retail group. There were well-publicised spats between the two during the process, the most infamous of which involved Green confronting Rose as he left his car outside M&S headquarters and attacking him verbally. \nLord Rose first joined M&S in 1971 but his career has also involved stints at Burton Group, Argos and Booker. He chairs Ocado and was knighted in 2008 for services to the retail industry. He received his life peerage six years later. \nPro-EU group ready to take on Brexit lobby \nStuart Rose heads host of big-name politicians and supporters \nRead more \nHis personal background sheds some light on his commitment to Europe. His paternal grandparents were White Russian émigrés who fled to China after the 1917 revolution. Their son, Lord Rose’s father, who changed the family’s original name from Bryantzeff, was unofficially adopted by an English Quaker spinster, while Lord Rose’s mother’s side is English, Scottish and Greek. \nAs a youngster, Lord Rose lived in a caravan in Warwickshire until his father was posted with the Civil Service to Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Lord Rose went to school in Dar es Salaam until the family returned to the UK. \nHis multicultural background and high-powered business career should stand him in good stead as the UK prepares for a referendum on EU membership. And anyone who can stand up to Sir Philip Green is unlikely to flinch at even the worst the eurosceptics will throw at him. \n“I’m as sceptical and cynical as the next man, and probably a bit more than the next man,” he said. “We’ve now got at least 12 months to marshal our arguments, put our case, but I’ll be satisfied if we can look at ourselves in the mirror and say we put all the arguments [for remaining in the EU] together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:10:26.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
