Oakland — When leaving home and traveling to an unknown land, there often are myriad reasons why. Freedom. Opportunity. Even survival. \nFor Sandy Khabbazeh, it was all of the above. Leaving her home in Aleppo, Syria, and her parents and older brother was by no means an easy decision, but it had to be made.\n\"I would consider myself a strong person because I had a lot of difficulty when I got here,\" said Khabbazeh at a panel discussion on the Syrian refugee crisis, held at Ponds Reformed Church on Oct. 6.\nThe panel discussion was organized so area residents could hear firsthand the dangers and difficulties of being a refugee. Its goals were to elicit their feelings about the crisis and ascertain what they and the government could do to help the refugees. \nKhabbazeh is one of the estimated 9.5 million Syrians who have been displaced by the civil war that broke out in 2011. As many as 6.5 million remain internally displaced. Arriving in 2014 on a student visa, Khabbazeh is being hosted by Rev. Nathan S. Busker of Pond’s Church, who moderated the discussion.\n\"It was about a year ago this month that Sandy knocked on the side door here, where our offices are located, and asked just to come in and pray,\" recounted Busker. \"From that moment, we began to befriend Sandy and get to know her. In January, she moved in with my family and she’s been there since.\"\nUpon hearing Khabbazeh and Busker’s story, religious leaders such as Minister Nolan Psalma of Upper Ridgewood Community Church, Imam Mahmoud Hamza of the Muslim Society of Ridgewood and Imam Mohammad Moutaz Charaf of the Elzahara Education Foundation in Midland Park expressed solidarity across religious lines and hoped to help housing refugees through their respective clergies just as Busker has. \nThe church leaders looked to panelist Robert Pettet, district director for Rep. Scott Garrett (R-5th District), for answers on ways they and their clergies could help, citing the government roadblocks often faced in the sponsorship process.\n\"If there are folks that come here and are brought here in more than one sponsorship where there’s a group of individuals, it’s not the government’s responsibility, is it?\" said Pettet. \"It’s ours. Because we are the people.\"\nWhile most agreed with personal accountability, no direct answers on the individual sponsorship procedure were offered. Pettet acknowledged his own lack of preparation and emphasized community accountability for the issue. Residents and church leaders pressed the issue, reiterating that their churches are already willing to help.\n\"I agree with that 100 percent, but if the government doesn’t allow refugees to come, we cannot help,\" said Psalma. \nFor panelist Joseph Hakim, chairman of the International Christian Union, U.S. intervention is essential. Hakim, who was born in Lebanon, acknowledged the need to protect refugees but expressed a fear of what the influx of refugees would bring.\n\"I’m afraid if [immigrants are] going to be coming to America for their hidden agenda, I have a problem with that,\" Hakim said. \"If they want to come to America with the understanding that we’re all coming to America for a better future and a better life, and learn from the Americans what they can leave us with, towards the future, then immigration is the right thing to do.\"\nMichael Karsan of Oakland echoed his sentiment, fearing that the migration of refugees coupled with those from Mexico could threaten the nation’s identity.\n\"We haven’t even got a language anymore…You’ve got millions of people coming here and they’re looking to shortcut the system. We don’t know who they are.\"\nBut most of the some 30 people in attendance asked the same question: What can we do to help? With Ponds Church owning an adjacent property, normally used to house families that have fallen on hard times, and the Ridgewood and Midland Park churches having their own facilities, some resources exist to aid the refugees. All, then, that remains is the question of getting started. \n\"The ability for me to say, ‘OK, we can probably get Congress to act on this next week and we can have this immediately,’ Id be a fool to promise,\" Pettet said. \"I can’t. I don’t know. I don’t know the dynamics of what’s moving. I don’t know the dynamics of certain security concerns and processing concerns. What I can say is that if there are folks that are with us now that have immigration problems and it falls right into the purview of what we are doing currently as an office, we get to work right away on it. We can move on that.\"\nWhile Busker acknowledged that answers from the federal government have not been clear, he said that progress had been made and residents and churches are taking it upon themselves to move forward.\n\"The whole purpose of the gathering was to see if there were other people that were equally frustrated and concerned,\" said Busker. \"So what’s been happening is I’ve been receiving emails from the Ridgewood contingent that we’re going to get together and we’re going to identify what are the next steps now.\"\nFor Khabbazeh, the discussion ended on a hopeful note. \n\"She was able to meet some of the leaders from Ridgewood,\" said Busker. \"They’ve emailed and texted her with both their support. There are people outside our church that care about her, her family and what’s happening.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:52:02.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
