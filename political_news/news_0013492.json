He's really getting down the Fox News lingo when it comes to African Americans and conservatives. This display by him is a sick testament that some people will say anything to make themselves a star and to put a little more cash in their pockets when it comes to racial politics. As you would expect, the conservative response to the Black Lives Matters movement is to retort that liberals have enslaved the black community and \"All Lives Matter.\" Clarke really did some practicing and sounds more like Ann Coulter every day. \nDAVID CLARKE: Sean, it was a pathetic display. It was plantation politics in its finest hour. The continued enslavement of black people emotionally by the Democrat Party [sic] with this destructive liberal ideology. And they know it. They're whoring for votes. They know that's what they're doing. The liberal ideology has been very destructive for the black community for the last 50 or 60 years. Poverty is now generational, it's a lifestyle. The unemployment is obscene. They have to send their kids to failing public schools, drug and alcohol addiction, neighborhoods that are crumbling all under Democrat control. They need to get off their knees and stop this stuff and take a real message to the American people, and especially the black community, that what they have done, they deserve an apology for from the Democrat Party [sic]. \n[...] \nJUAN WILLIAMS: There is a real issue of excessive use of police force in the country. \nCLARKE: No there isn't. \nWILLIAMS: Black Lives Matter has come in response to that issue. \nCLARKE: No there isn't.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:52:09.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
