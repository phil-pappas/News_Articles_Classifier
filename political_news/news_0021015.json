He added that it gets House Republicans “out of our comfort zone” because many have opposed tax increases.\nThe House plan comes as a response to calls from Senate GOP and Democratic leaders who had been pushing for the convening of a House-Senate conference committee to hash out differences after road funding talks including Gov. Rick Snyder broke down a week ago.\nSenate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof challenged House Republican and Democratic leaders Tuesday to schedule a conference committee meeting on a $1.2 billion road funding deal he said was close to being clinched a week ago.\nThat initially was met with some resistance from Cotter’s office.\nRoad funding talks broke off last week when Snyder said negotiations reached an impasse on the issue of tax reductions, which would be attached to a comprehensive package that would include a fuel tax hike and a shift in state spending priorities. Senate and House Republican and Democratic leaders had been meeting with the GOP governor in road funding talks during the summer and fall.\n“The leaders reached an agreement and met to finalize the details last week, but progress stalled,” said Meekhof, R-West Olive. “At this point, we are too close to a resolution to leave this deal on the table.”\nSnyder and legislative leaders recently discussed an unspecified $800 million increase in fuel taxes and vehicle fees and a shift of $400 million from other spending.\nMeekhof had said he wanted the conference committee to meet and develop a compromise bill for votes by the House and Senate.\n“Our citizens demand results and our state needs better roads. Rather than place blame and assign fault, I want to see the House take action in conference committee,” the Senate leader said in a statement. “The House is in the position to move this process forward, and I encourage leadership to convene the committee as soon as possible.”\nHe was backed by Sen. Jim Ananich of Flint, the Democratic leader, but their appeal for a House-Senate conference committee didn’t appear to sit well with Cotter.\n“Senate Majority Leader Meekhof abruptly left the last quadrant meeting early because Rep. (Tim) Greimel (House Democratic leader) changed his mind on an income tax cut, so he should know there is no deal,” D’Assandro said. “Speaker Cotter has been working with the governor on the issue since then, and he remains hopeful we can find reliable support for a permanent road funding solution.”\nGHeinlein@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:56.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
