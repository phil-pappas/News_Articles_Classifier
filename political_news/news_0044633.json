Kerry is due to travel to Europe this weekend on a previously scheduled trip. \nOfficials familiar with the planning said Kerry would like to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the Jordanian capital of Amman. No three-way meeting is envisioned and Kerry would not likely visit Israel or the Palestinian territories, although he might also stop in Saudi Arabia, according to the officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the planning publicly. \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Kerry wants to make the trip to reinforce U.S. calls on both sides to condemn violence and combat incitement. \n\"We continue to urge all sides to take affirmative steps to restore calm and prevent actions that would further escalate tensions in the region,\" he said. \nIn recent weeks, eight Israelis have died in a string of stabbings, shootings and the stoning of a car, while 31 Palestinians have been killed — 14 of them identified by Israel as attackers, the rest killed in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli forces.
