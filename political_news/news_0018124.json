The guests include government representatives from 30 countries, officials from 20 international financial and donor organisations and envoys from 300 Chinese mega-companies.\nThe event is unusual. Unusually, for a developing middle-income country, the event is not being organized by UNDP, it is not sponsored by the EU, and Russia does not feature prominently on the agenda. In sum, this is a huge event by any standard in an East Partnership (EaP) country. But, it has little to do with Georgia being an EaP country. It has to do with a project that has been called “China’s Marshall Plan .”\nChina has earmarked $300 bn USD for the materialization of the “One Belt, One Road” vision, of which $40 billion USD is the capital for the newly founded Asian Infrastructural Investment Bank, joined by Britain, Germany, Italy, France, Poland and, of course, Georgia.\nThe first Tbilisi Silk Road Forum aspires to become a platform for the meeting of private and public stakeholders, facilitating regional and pluri-lateral cooperation. With AIIB being a co-host, multilateral may not be the right term to use, as this is not a European project. The annual high level meeting will initially focus on business-to-business networking in sectors such as transport, energy, and trade.\nThe Tbilisi Silk Road Forum was a joint effort by the Georgian and Chinese governments and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote the sharing of ideas, experiences and expertise along the revived Silk Road and beyond.\nLast year China became the first foreign investor in Georgia, as it is a country that may be envisaged as an interconnector of three fast speed train routes to Europe. This infrastructural investment, it is hoped, will hone regional interdependence, with multiplier effects for an economy thus far regarded as being on the margins of Europe, Central Asia, and the Caspian. Infrastructural investment could place the country in the middle.\nThe Silk Road\nOn November 18, 2014, in Yiwu City, in China’s Zhejiang province, a train carrying 82 containers weighing more than 1,000 tons left a massive warehouse complex heading for Madrid. It arrived on December 9. Today, it takes nine days from China to Tbilisi, 16 to Warsaw, 21 to Madrid. In addition to the Yiwu-Madrid connection, we now have a Chongqing(Sichuan)-Duisburg connection and a Zhengzhou (Henan)-Hamburg connection. European trade has in this sense been disrupted.\nInvestment is now leading to incremental development. At this point in time, a railway container costs $7,000 compared to $2,000 for a sea container. Reducing cost will take more innovation, more investment, more scale.\nWith each major infrastructural investment, cost is reduced and scale is added. By November 2016, the construction of a 178 km, $600 million Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway will be fully completed. Once operational, a multifold increase in trade volumes between Turkey, Europe, and Central Asia is expected. At the same time, the case for trade with China will be better. The peak capacity of this corridor will be 17 million metric tonnes of cargo. Initially, the operators of the line expect one million passengers and 6.5 million metric tonnes of cargo.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tbilisisilkroad.ge/en/home/", "http://www.ciis.org.cn/english/2015-06/11/content_7982914.htm", "http://www.tbilisisilkroad.ge/"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:51:14.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
