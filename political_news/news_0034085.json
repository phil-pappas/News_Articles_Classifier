We host four pillar events annually and many smaller scale events throughout the year as well. Our events attract thousands of people and help us to grow our clients' brand awareness and revenue as well as our own business. So, in short, we are big believers in incorporating events into the marketing mix and we have a few tricks up our sleves for for getting the most out of event marketing. Here are some of our top tips: \n1. Create or use an event hashtag on Twitter and Facebook: It's important to use an event hashtag to share information and network with attendees before, during and after an event. Hashtags are a way to form a connection with attendees and to promote your brand's presence at an event. You can use the hashtag to drive traffic to your booth, or to setup meetings at an event. If you're hosting your own event, it's also a good way to boost attendence numbers and for attendees to form connections prior to the event, which will allow for a sense of community online and at the event. \n2. Consider introducing Snapchat: Snapchat is a great marketing tool for the right brands. Skip to no. 3, if you don't think this social medium is in line with your brand. Otherwise, let's talk about this marketing tool. Here at Streetwise, we recently launched a Snapchat account for BostInno. We are using Snapchat to showcase our events to give a glimpse into our fun side, drive attendance and increase sponsorship opportunities. We will also be using Snapchat when we are attending external events to increase networking opportunities while in attendance at events. Snapchat allows us to connect with viewers in an entirely different way from our other social media. \n3. Use lead capture tools: Unfortunately, many people forget business cards when attending an event, so it's important to have a lead capture strategy. Many larger scale events offer lead capture tools that can scan badges and produce a downloadable file at the end of an event for easy follow up. If an event your attending offers this service, consider taking advantage. If not, consider creating simple cards that attendees can fill out when they stop by your booth, or have an Excel file that you can easily complete on their behalf when they stop by. If you're spending money to attend or exhibit at an event, you don't want to miss out on quality leads! \n4. Be prepared to demo: Many event attendees are on the hunt for new products or services, so make sure whomever you send to represent the brand at an event is knowledgeable and comfortable demoing your product offering. In a world where sales meetings are increasingly done over the phone or Internet, you won't want to miss an opportunity to demo your product live to a potential customer. \n5. Have one sheets or handouts with you: When it's not possible to get a prospect to listen to an entire demo or product pitch, one sheets or handouts are the next best thing. Sometimes event attendees are in a rush or in the research gathering phases of the sales process, so having a short handout about your product and a relevant case study will be the best thing to provide. Make sure you include contact info so when the prospect is ready, he or she can easily contact you. \n6. Provide branded and relevant giveaways: Providing giveaways is essential to attracting audience at an event, but making sure they're branded and relevant to your brand is crucial to keeping audience interested and ensuring they understand your value proposition after they've gone. Giveaways should represent your brand and be useful to your target audience. Here's an example: if your company sells beauty products, a branded compact mirror would be a relevant and useful giveaway. The most important tip of all is to focus on your follow up. \n7. Focus on follow up: The most important tip of all is to focus on your follow up. Event attendees will meet many people during an event and even if you follow all of the tips above, it's possible prospects still may forget you and your product offering. You should make it a priority to follow up within a day with your top prospects with a personalized and tailored message. Ensuring follow up occurs promptly is essential to keeping prospects on the hook and minimizing the time to close. \nInterested in attending or sponsoring one of our upcoming events ?
