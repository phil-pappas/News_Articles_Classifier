(AP) - Portland's three previous mayors have endorsed state Treasurer Ted Wheeler in his bid to unseat incumbent Mayor Charlie Hales in next year's election. \nWheeler's campaign on Wednesday announced the support from Vera Katz, Tom Potter and Sam Adams. The three served as mayors from 1993 until the beginning of 2013. \nWheeler announced last month he would run for mayor of Oregon's largest city. Term limits prevent him from seeking another four years as treasurer. \nKatz's endorsement represents a switch from the 2012 election, when she backed Hales in his race against Eileen Brady and Jefferson Smith. Now she's going with Wheeler, saying he can make progress on the issues that matter. \nThe Hales campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:59:43.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
