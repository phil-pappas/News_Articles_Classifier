That it is about the people of Scotland, not about being in the institution of a Union. “\nHe added that events in the last year had made the case stronger.\n“We got to say to people in Scotland ‘you are better off being in the Union. Because had you voted last year for independence with oil prices plummeted you would find yourself in quite a pickle...’\n“You have got to tell Scots why it is good for them.
