It’s a great combination, unless you’re a fan of Hillary Clinton. For example, whenever she talks to the media, she says something stupid. And whenever she says something stupid, it’s everybody’s fault but hers.\nWhich brings us to this spectacle in New Hampshire over the weekend:\nKeep in mind that this is how Hillary Clinton treats her fans . Fortunately for her, the only people who are less popular than her are the ones assigned to follow her around. She figures they have no choice but to put up with it, and she’s right.\nIf you think this looks bad to the rest of us, just wait until you hear how it sounds!\nOr you could’ve put actual leashes on them. You could’ve fed them treats every time they asked a question she could answer without embarrassing herself. That would’ve worked, because they just want to please her. They just want her praise.\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill got in a good joke about the whole thing :\n“While the GOP may want to spin a good yarn on this, let’s not get tied up in knots.”\nGet it? Because ropes. LOL.\nI’m not sure why Hillary is putting up with the indignities of a political campaign at all. She could sit at home for the next 16 months without losing anybody who plans to vote for her regardless. Making public appearances and talking to people can only alienate the “moderates,” i.e. people who actually care about her record and her character and all that other boring stuff.\nUnfortunately for Hillary Clinton, she can only be herself.\n(Hat tip: Twitchy )\nTags: Hillary Clinton , Treacher Share TOP Hide Comments Show comments Loading, please wait...
