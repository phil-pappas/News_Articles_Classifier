By 8 a.m. - two hours before the start of the House hearing - a crowd already is waiting to get into the room where Volkswagen's top U.S. executive awaits tough question from lawmakers in the aftermath of the emissions-rigging scandal that's hit the world's largest automaker.\nA House Energy and Commerce subcommittee is set to hear from Volkswagen of America CEO Michael Horn and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency.\nLawmakers are investigating after Volkswagen admitted it installed on-board computer software designed to cheat on government emissions tests in nearly 500,000 of its four-cylinder \"clean diesel\" cars, starting with the 2009 model year.\nAccording to an advance copy of Horn's prepared remarks, VW plans to withdraw applications seeking U.S. emissions certifications for its 2016 model Jettas, Golfs, Passats and Beetles with diesel engines. That's raising questions about whether a \"defeat device\" similar to that in earlier models is also in the new cars.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
