They are illegal.\"\nShe added: \"All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax.\"\nThe year-long investigation found that \"most of the profits of Starbucks' coffee roasting company are shifted abroad, where they are also not taxed, and Fiat's financing company only paid taxes on underestimated profits\".\nPromoted stories The Commission is now investigating similar tax practices in all of the 28 nations, including the UK.\nCatherine Bearder MEP and chair of the Liberal Democrat EU referendum campaign, said: \"This is a game-changer in the fight against corporate tax avoidance.\n\"By working together across Europe, we can clamp down on tax-dodging and get a fairer deal for British taxpayers and businesses.\"\nThe ruling comes after more recent evidence of potential tax avoidance by multinationals emerged, with figures last week showing Facebook paid less than £5,000 in UK corporation tax in 2014.\nThis came despite the online giant making global profits of 2.9 billion US dollars (£1.9 billion) on revenue of 12.5 billion US dollars (£8.1 billion) in 2014. UK revenues were £105 million.\nAccounts for taxi-hailing service Uber also showed yesterday it paid no corporation tax in the UK last year despite making an £866,302 profit.\nThe annual statement for Uber London Limited revealed it incurred a total tax bill of £22,134, but this was listed as a \"deferred tax\", which can be rolled over from previous years and into future tax periods, meaning the company technically paid no corporation tax in 2014.\nStarbucks claimed there were \"significant errors\" in the decision.\nIt added: \"We plan to appeal since we followed the Dutch and OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) rules available to anyone.\"\nThe group insisted it paid a global tax rate of around 33%, which it said was \"well above the 18.5% average rate paid by other large US companies\".\nFiat Chrysler also denied receiving any illegal state aid and said a deal it reached with Luxembourg was aimed only at clarifying pricing rules and \"did not result in any state aid\".\nThe European Commission said the fight against tax avoidance was one of its top priorities, and in June it unveiled a raft of measures to help tackle the issue.\nMarc Sanders, partner at Taxand Netherlands, said the EU rules will \"rock the corporate world to its very core\".\nShare article He added: \"Whilst multinationals were lured to EU states with offers of low tax rates as an incentive, little did they know that, despite having agreement at the highest national level, this would come back and bite a decade later.\"\nmfl", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:34:20.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
