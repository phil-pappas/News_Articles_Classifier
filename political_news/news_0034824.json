Gov. Reeves JACKSON – Members of the Mississippi Hospitality and Restaurant Association today endorsed the re-election of Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves citing his work to support small businesses around the state. The MHRA represents more than 1,400 owners and operators of hotels and restaurants across the state. “Our members are simply small business owners who work to give back to their community, and Tate understands the invaluable role they play in creating jobs and growing local economies, ” said Bill Latham, of Jackson area restaurants Table 100, Babalu, and 5 Guys Burgers and Fries. “He also recognizes the role my colleagues play in promoting tourism and welcoming visitors to our beautiful state. MHRA is proud to endorse Tate’s continued service to our state as lieutenant governor.” Lt. Gov. Reeves has fought against burdensome regulations that would increase costs for Mississippians and risk harming job growth. “Employees and owners of restaurants and hotels are often a major employer in Mississippi towns and offer the first impression of Magnolia State hospitality to visitors,” Lt. Gov. Reeves said. “I will protect their ability to invest and grow their businesses and add jobs to our economy. I appreciate the support of the MHRA.” 10/20/15 Posted October 20, 2015 - 9:10 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
