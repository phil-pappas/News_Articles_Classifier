The full House is slated to vote for the speaker on Oct. 29.\nCurrent House Speaker John Boehner announced last month that he will step down and leave office on Oct. 31.\nNow that McCarthy, currently No. 2 in the House, is out of the running, the GOP vote is postponed:\n\nToday's leadership election has been postponed until a later date.\nâ€” House Republicans (@HouseGOP) October 8, 2015 Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, told CBS News' Alicia Amling that McCarthy stood up in Thursday's GOP conference meeting and took himself out of race, saying he wanted unified conference. \nAs part of the House GOP's leadership team, McCarthy always had a strike against him with anti-establishment conservatives. However, he came under further scrutiny recently when he suggested in a televised interview that the House Republicans' Benghazi investigation is politically-motivated . McCarthy on Wednesday acknowledged that his comments about the Benghazi investigation were a mistake, but he insisted he could effectively serve as the most public face of the House GOP.\nTwo other conservatives -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida -- were challenging McCarthy for the GOP speaker nomination, and Thursday's vote clearly would have divided the House GOP. \nA bloc of about 40 conservatives -- known as the House Freedom Caucus -- announced Wednesday they would stick together and vote for Webster as Boehner's replacement. With 247 Republicans in the House, McCarthy didn't need the House Freedom Caucus' support to win the GOP nomination for speaker. However, he would have needed the support of at least some anti-establishment members for the full House of Representatives vote on October 29. That meant conservatives would have spent the next month pressuring McCarthy to move to the right .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:01:28.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
