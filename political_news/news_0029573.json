(AP) â€” Albuquerque police say a 4-year-old has been shot in a road-rage incident on the city's west side.\nPolice spokeswoman Celina Espinoza confirmed the child was transported to an area hospital. She says police are searching for a suspect.\nThe victim's condition was not immediately known.\nOfficer Simon Drobik says the shooting late Tuesday afternoon prompted authorities to shut down westbound traffic on a section of Interstate 40 as police investigate.\nThe shooting comes after a road rage shooting last month in which police say a man shot another driver in self-defense. The Sept. 9 shooting that wounded 34-year-old Jacoby Johnson was being reviewed by the District Attorney's Office.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
