It's just for show, to show that we are a democracy, and we have elections, and blah blah blah any nonsense,\" said Ahmed Mostafa, 25, who works in a lab.\nAhmed Ibrahim, a 34-year-old accountant, had a similar view.\n\"The youth in Egypt, our ambition in 2011, we were going to build the country—but then suddenly it was stolen from us,\" he said. \"Ninety-nine percent of my friends are not going to vote.\"\nSecurity was tight in a country facing an Islamist militant insurgency, in addition to widespread poverty, high unemployment and an energy crisis.\nOn paper, the new parliament will have wide ranging powers. It can reject the president's choice for prime minister or even impeach the president.\nBut with Muslim Brotherhood leaders and youth activists behind bars, critics doubt it can provide checks and balances.\n\"The election is a farce. I don't think anyone in Egypt is taking it seriously,\" Muslim Brotherhood official Wafaa Hefny told Reuters.\nFew analysts expect turnout to exceed a third of the electorate.\nCHALLENGES\nSisi secured support from other opposition groups for ousting Mursi by promising a prompt parliamentary vote. The elections, repeatedly postponed, are now taking place over two rounds on October 18-19 and November 22-23.\nThis week, voters cast their ballots in 14 regions including Egypt's second city of Alexandria on the Mediterranean coast.\nCritics say an electoral system that puts the emphasis on individuals is a throwback to Mubarak-era politics, which favored candidates with wealth and connections.\n\"Being a member of parliament for many is a chance to be close to government. It's like joining the government club,\" said Khaled Dawoud, who recently resigned as spokesman for the Destour Party and Democratic Current electoral alliance.\nThe unicameral parliament will comprise 568 elected members—448 elected on an individual basis and 120 through winner-takes-all lists in four districts, with quotas for women, Christians and youth. The president may also appoint a further five percent. Final results expected in December.\n\"For the Love of Egypt,\" an alliance of loyalist parties and politicians, is running for all 120 list seats and is expected to do well.\nAn alliance of socialist opposition parties that had been due to contest eventually pulled out, leaving the field dominated by Sisi loyalists.\nThe Islamist Nour Party, which came second in the last election, will take part. However, it has lost much support among Islamists since endorsing Mursi's overthrow.\nSpeculation is already rife that the constitution will be amended to curb parliament's powers.\n\"There's no one running who is worth my vote—everyone who enters the elections just wants something out of it for their personal interest,\" said Tamer Mohamed, 35, who owns a motorcycle shop. \"Nobody wants to do anything for people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:12:17.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
