(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nOne of Vice President Joe Biden's top political advisers says he'll make a decision soon about whether to run for president. \nFormer Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman is one of Biden's closest aides. He's telling former Biden staffers in a letter that Biden will need help from all of them if he runs. \nThe emailed letter was sent to former staffers Thursday and obtained by The Associated Press. \nKaufman says he doesn't know if Biden will run. He says Biden's top consideration is his family's welfare. \nKaufman says if Biden runs, it will be because of his \"burning conviction\" that the U.S. must fundamentally change the balance in the economy. He says Biden would run to help the middle class restore its ability to get ahead.
