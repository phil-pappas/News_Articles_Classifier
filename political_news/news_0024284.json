Ann Chaffee (maiden name Maurer) and Tom Maurer are celebrating the 100 th Anniversary of Maurer's Sanitary Cleaners with customers, employees, family and friends. To commemorate this historic occasion Maurer's will be celebrating with an open house on Friday, October 9, 2015 from 11:00am to 3:00pm at the main location on 2815 E. Saginaw Street. Everyone is invited!\nAnn Chaffee is a 3 rd generation family member who started working, at the age of five, with her father Joseph Maurer and Uncle Tom Maurer at the family business. \"We are all very excited to be celebrating 100 years of being in business and serving the community. We have been in the Lansing area and watched the community grow and prosper. There have been many Maurer family members who have worked here across the years and we feel that our employees and customers are all part of the family,\" said Ann Chaffee .\nThe business started in 1915 as Sanitary Cleaners at 605 East Michigan Ave. Joseph Maurer , Ann's grandfather, bought the business in 1931. The headquarters location moved from East Michigan Ave. to 2815 E. Saginaw St., Lansing, Michigan in 1946 when Saginaw Street was a two lane dirt road. Then, in the 1950's, because of another cleaner in the area using the same name Sanitary Cleaners, the business changed the name to Maurer's Sanitary Cleaners. Today Maurer's has five locations throughout Lansing , Haslett and Dewitt . One interesting fact is, in the main location, there is a large safe that was used to store customers' furs in the 1940's â€“ 1960's.\nCurrently Maurer's has 22 full and part time employees and has provided many jobs over the years. The staff are the key to Maurer's success and they treat every customer like family. Ann Chaffee and her father Joseph Maurer have both been President of the Michigan drycleaning association called the Michigan Institute of Laundering & Drycleaning (MILD).\nMarcy Dwyer , MILD Executive Director, said, \"Maurer's has been a very active in the cleaning industry and has hosted seminars for MILD to share information with fellow cleaners across the state. Many of their employees have completed advance skill training to learn the latest industry knowledge on providing a professional finish to all types of fabrics. Maurer's is one of the elite drycleaning businesses in Michigan bringing the highest skill level to their customers in producing a professional finish to garments. They are the nicest people and everyone on their staff greets you with a smile. I find it a pleasure every time I visit Maurer's!\"\nThe business has seen many changes in the past 100 years with advances in technology, world wars, shortages, clothing trends, government regulations and the work force. Through recessions and prosperous times, Maurer's has survived and thrived during all the changes and is happy to be celebrating their 100 year anniversary with family, employees, customers and friends.\n* * * * * * * *\nMaurer's Sanitary Cleaners is a full service cleaner that specializes in garment care, draperies, has a recycling program and handles fire and water damage restorations.\n* * * * * * * *\nMILD is a non-profit association that provides educational information, owner savings programs, business skills to businesses in the cleaning industry.\nContact: Ann Chaffee , 517-484-5491\n releases/maurers-sanitary-cleaners-celebrates-100-years-in-business-300156662.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maurers-sanitary-cleaners-celebrates-100-years-in-business-300156662.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC23558&Transmission_Id=201510081038PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC23558&DateId=20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:52:45.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
