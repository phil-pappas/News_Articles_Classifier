The two suspects hit the elderly man in the head several times with an unknown object. \nA 13-year-old female and 13-year-old male, who reside in Brooklyn, were arrested and charged with assault and harassment, police said. \nDetectives from the Hate Crimes Task Force worked diligently in obtaining several surveillance videos, while interviewing several people that lead them to the two arrests, the official said. \nThe two teens who are close friends, told investigators they were playing some game when they came across the Jewish man and hit him, but bias was not the motive in the assault, the official added. \nThe attack on Herman came one week following a 25-year-old Jewish man, who was assaulted in the head with a Snapple glass bottle, and an Orthodox Jewish man was assaulted in a paintball attack â€” the fifth of its kind. No arrests were made in any of these cases. \nPolice are still offering a $2,500 reward for any information that will lead to the arrest of the individuals behind the paintball assaults, as well as a $2,500 reward for any information that may lead to the arrest of the individual glass bottle attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:56:22.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
