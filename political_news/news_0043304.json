We need action now,” raged Scunthorpe's Labour MP Nic Dakin.\nTory backbencher Martin Vickers told him the latest sackings were a “hammer blow” for the local areas.\nMore than 5,000 steel jobs have been lost in the past few weeks and the Mirror yesterday launched a Save Our Steel campaign demanding support for the industry.\nWe are calling for business rates and energy prices to be slashed for steel plants, a Government commitment to use British steel for major projects and urgent action to stop China dumping cheap steel on international markets.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nIn the Commons today, Mr Javid drew gasps from angry Labour MPs as he insisted the Government was \"doing everything in its power\" to support the industry.\nUnder mounting pressure, he would try to increase the number of public projects which use British steel.\n“We will drive up the number of public procurement contracts won by UK steel manufacturers and their partners,” the top Tory said.\nHe all but admitted other EU countries have been more effective at supporting their own industries.\nAnd he vowed to travel to Brussels next week to try to speed up the EU response to the crisis.\n\"We will consider what lessons can be learned from other countries in the EU and beyond,” Mr Javid said.\nSlapped down: Even Tories turned on Business Secretary Sajid Javid\n\"We will look at what Government can do to cut production costs.

Stop this carnage, or give way to somebody who can make a difference\"\nYorkshire MP Angela Smith told Mr Javid his response was “woefully inadequate”.\nAnd the SNP's Marion Fellows, who has seen hundreds of job losses in her Motherwell constituency today, said it was “disgraceful” Mr Javid did not even mention Scotland in his response to Labour's urgent question.\nEven Speaker John Bercow slammed the Business Secretary as “discourteous and incompetent” for not coming to the House unprompted to make a proper statement to MPs.\nVideo loading\nSpeaking afterwards, Labour's shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said: “This is the third time in just over a week the Government has been dragged to the House of Commons.\n\"They are really making no announcements of help for the steel industry in the UK as it faces this desperate situation.\n“They seem to be sat there doing absolutely nothing while out homegrown steel industry is lost.”\n4 things the Government must do\nAn immediate cut in business rates for the steel industry and a fairer system of valuation.
