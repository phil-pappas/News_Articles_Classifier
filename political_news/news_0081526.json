If anyone knows where he is at, tell him we are looking for him. The money would pay for his expenses including his ticket, hotel room, flights and a little spending money.”\nThe page also notes that if Bartman can’t be located, all proceeds raised will be donated to the Alzheimer’s Association.\nOne donor, who pledged $25, wrote “Steve deserves free season tickets to Wrigley for life. Go Cubs Go!”\n“It wasn’t your fault, Steve. I would have tried to catch the foul ball had I been in your position. Hope to see you at the game!” wrote another.\nBut not every donation had the Cubs’ best interests in mind.\n“I’m a Pirates fan so this couldn’t hurt our chances…,” said Steven Conley, who contributed $5.\nIn total, 75 donations have been made.\nIf the season ended today, the wild-card game would be played in Pittsburgh. Chicago currently trails the Pirates by two games with three to play.\nThe Cubs would need to sweep their three-game series with Milwaukee and have Pittsburgh lose two of three to Cincinnati in order for the game to be played at Wrigley.\nAccording to a 2013 report from the New York Times , Bartman hasn’t returned to Wrigley since the incident.\nWatch “The Steve Bartman” incident:", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/thechicagosuntimes&width=61&height=20&colorscheme=light&layout=button_count&show_faces=false", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/vq8G81oOHhY", "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/sports/baseball/10-years-later-a-cubs-fan-remains-invisible.html", "https://www.gofundme.com/ws56s2f8", "http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:56:34.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
