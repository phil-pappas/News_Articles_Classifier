President Obama’s war on coal will destroy jobs and raise our utility bills. His executive order on amnesty will weaken Mississippi’s economy with increased social costs. Attorneys General across the country are joining together and fighting back to protect their states and citizens. My opponent has been absent from the fight, but as Attorney General I will step up to the plate and take the fight back to them,” said Republican Attorney General candidate Mike Hurst. In the ad, Hurst says, “Hello, I'm Mike Hurst and I'm running for Attorney General. The regulations coming from DC and the Obama Administration are killing jobs and raising our taxes. We need an Attorney General who will step up to the plate and take the fight back to them. I want to be that Attorney General for you. To support our campaign, please go to HurstForAG.com and together we can make Mississippi a better place to raise our families.” Posted October 13, 2015 - 6:11 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
