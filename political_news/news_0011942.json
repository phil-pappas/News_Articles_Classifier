It has been employed during the Russia-Georgia war of 2008 , and during the recent conflict in Ukraine . This metaphor has been used for describing conflicts raging in the independent states of the former USSR, but recent events in the Middle East are beginning to resonate with the Cold War, as well.\nWhile history does not repeat itself and does not determine the future, it does provide clarity for current events and helps to situate them within a greater historical context.\nIn the 1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt forged an alliance with Nikita Khrushchev of the USSR, allowing the Soviet Union to project its power into the heart of the Arab Middle East. The agreement between Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin to deploy Russian forces to Syria essentially serves as a replay from the Cold War game book.\nSyria war dominates UN summit\nThe Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), or the\"Baghdad Pact\" was formed in 1955, modelled after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The alliance included Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, which served as a northern tier of states to contain Soviet influence in the Middle East .\nThe Soviet invitation\nThe USSR perceived this alliance as a threat, and in a statement on April 16, 1955, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared:\n\"Striving for the development of peaceful cooperation among all countries, the Soviet government is prepared to support and develop cooperation with the countries of the Near and Middle East, in the interests of strengthening peace in this area.\"\nAlso read: State of the world: In search of leadership\nIn 1955, Nasser would accept the Soviets' invitation.\nNasser, the leader of Egypt after a military coup in 1952, had adopted a policy of \"positive neutralism\", seeking to maximise Egypt's position by playing off both the US and USSR to finance the Aswan High Dam, for example. Egypt was also an active player in the Non-Aligned Movement , consisting of states such as Indonesia, India, and Yugoslavia, which sought to avoid aligning with either superpower during the Cold War.\nToday, the Russian arms shipments to Syria, along with the Russian advisers and military forces to accompany them, has similarly allowed Putin to leapfrog onto the Mediterranean.\nHowever, the formation of the CENTO, in Nasser's view, was an attempt to undermine the Egyptian leader's pan-Arabist project , which sought to unify the Arabs against the ambitions of the UK and US in the region. Combined with the US' refusal to finance the Aswan Dam , Nasser lurched towards the Soviet Union. In 1955, the same year as the formation of CENTO, the Soviets authorised a shipment of arms to Egypt.\nSoviet arms would require its advisers to come to Egypt to train them on how to use and maintain the weapons, giving the USSR a foothold in the region. Nasser had allowed Khrushchev and the USSR to leapfrog over the northern tier states of CENTO, giving it a presence in the Mediterranean.\nA win-win deal\nIt was a win-win deal for Egypt and the USSR. Today, the Russian arms shipments to Syria, along with the Russian advisers and military forces to accompany them, has similarly allowed Putin to leapfrog onto the Mediterranean.\nIn a statement to the Egyptian National Assembly in May 1967, Nasser declared: \"I wish to tell you today that the Soviet Union is a friendly power and stands by us as a friend. In all our dealings with the Soviet Union â€¦ it has not made a single request of us. The USSR has never interfered with our policy or internal affairs ... When I also asked for all kinds of arms, they gave them to us.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.cria-online.org/11_4.html", "http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/russia-seeks-syrian-foothold-mideast-6067", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/paullaudicina/2014/05/15/ukraine-cold-war-redux-or-new-global-challenge/", "http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/central-treaty-organization-cento-a-mutual-defense-and-economic-cooperation-pact-among-persia-turkey-and-pakistan-wi", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/19/new-cold-war-back-to-bad-old-days-russia-west-putin-ukraine", "http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/03/04/welcome-to-cold-war-ii/", "http://www.mideastweb.org/nasser29may67.htm", "http://www.economist.com/node/7218678", "http://www.research-projects.uzh.ch/p9194.htm", "https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1955Soviet-baghdad1.asp", "https://books.google.com/books?id=83uaAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=nasser"], "published": "2015-10-01T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:23:56.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
