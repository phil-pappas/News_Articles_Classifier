John Katko wrote an amendment to the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act that could help speed the delivery of federal money to pay for rebuilding the elevated portion of I-81 through downtown Syracuse.\nThe House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure unanimously passed Katko's amendment along with the bipartisan bill, sending the package to the full House for final approval.\nThe federal government generally provides up to 80 percent of the costs of rebuilding interstate highways.\nKatko, R-Camillus, made sure through his amendment that the project will have the attention of federal transportation officials who provide the aid to the state of New York.\nThe highway bill also will help streamline permitting and study requirements for projects such as I-81, helping to speed their completion, Katko said.\nKatko has advocated for Congress to pass a long-term highway bill, instead of another short-term extension, in order to allow state and local government to make long-term plans and investments.\n\"Local projects, especially the I-81 rebuild, require funding stability,\" Katko said in a statement. \"This fiscally-responsible proposal delivers that stability so that Central New York can plan for the long term.\"\nThe bill approved Thursday by the committee includes existing funding formulas that benefit Northeast states such as New York, and gives states new flexibility to use federal money on bridges that are not part of the National Highway System, Katko said.\nCentral New York's other congressman, U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna, also succeeded in including three amendments in the highway bill.\nHanna, a Republican from Oneida County, wrote one amendment that allows states to increase truck weight limits for milk shipments, providing more speed and efficiency in transporting a perishable product. The legislation was backed by the National Milk Producers Federation.\nHanna's 22nd District includes Madison County and the eastern half of Oswego County.\nContact Mark Weiner anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 571-970-3751", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/MarkWeinerDC", "https://twitter.com/MarkWeinerDC", "http://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hr_3763_ih.pdf", "http://transportation.house.gov/strr-act/"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:31:51.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
