There is a division in the police department. They are feeling the pressure. They need a city council and mayor to say we will hold you accountable.” \nRoberts: “I would say we have to do better. I am heartened to hear there is conversation with NAACP, Mecklenburg Ministries. I also know we are planning to have dash cameras expire. I am in favor of keeping both (dash cameras and body cameras).” 7:44 p.m.: When did you buck your own party? \nPeacock said he bucked the Republican party during his Congressional race, when he opposed Amendment One, which would have prohibited gay marriage. \nRoberts said she was the only Democrat to vote to re-do the Mecklenburg’s 2011 property revaluation. 7:37 p.m.: What would you say to areas of the city where you don’t have support? \nPeacock said the streetcar is dividing the city. \nRoberts addressed heavily Republican Ballantyne. “I will not support Ballantyne becoming a separate town,” she said. “I remember a time when I was a county commissioner, I went to a group in south Charlotte that are real estate investors. I thought ‘Oh goodness, I will have a hard time here.’ But I explained the choices the county had, and the value (to the county) that we are adding.” 7:34 p.m.: How does it feel to know that Bob Rucho has more actual power over city than you? \nEdwin Peacock said “leadership is about influence.” He said it starts with a strong relationship with delegation. \nJennifer Roberts said she will work to be a regional mayor. “I want to re-activate the regional alliance of mayors that Anthony Foxx started. I want to have good relationships with regional delegations.” 7:30 p.m.: Why do you want to be mayor? \nJennifer Roberts said she wants to run to bring opportunity to all corners of the city. Said she wants Charlotte to be a place where her children will want to live. Mayor is a recruiter, an advocate. \n“I look forward to serving,” she said. \nEdwin Peacock said he wants to make a positive change on Charlotteans lives.
