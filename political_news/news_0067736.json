Conservative advocacy group Cornerstone Action is co-hosting the event. Speakers at the event, including the presidential candidates, will discuss ways for voters to fight back against the federal government. Topics up for discussion include the Common Core education standards, U.S. monetary policy and New Hampshire politics. \nNeither Cruz, a Texas senator, nor Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, have spent much time campaigning in New Hampshire as they seek the GOP nomination.
