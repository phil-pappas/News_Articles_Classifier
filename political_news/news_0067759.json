The decision, posted on AAP website, said the party's Political Committee Affairs (PAC) had dissolved \"all bodies in Maharashtra.\"\n\n\"Yes I have resigned. I don't oppose the decision (of dissolution of Maharashtra unit). But the undemocratic way it was dissolved, me and entire fleet of volunteers were shocked,\" a dejected Ware told PTI today.\n\n\"Moreover, senior leaders levelled serious allegations and said that party had become dysfunctional, but the truth is that now AAP was getting noticed among farmers and other people in the state,\" he said.\n\nThe leader, however, said he was not quitting AAP and added that he would work as per directives of the party.\n\nAfter Ware's resignation, Mayank Gandhi is the only national executive member left from Maharashtra.\n\nParty sources had earlier said the (dissolution) move followed the state unit's reluctance to act against Gandhi, the organisation's best known face in Maharashtra, who had taken on Kejriwal through his blogs when the Delhi Chief Minister was locked in a bitter feud with now expelled AAP leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan. They said the leadership had still \"not forgotten\" it.\n\nThe dissolution of Maharashtra unit of AAP had also triggered a sharp reaction from Gandhi, who had lashed out at party leadership saying Kejriwal was \"hell-bent on destroying\" the organisation. He had also alleged that party members were involved in playing \"gutter politics.\"\n\nHowever, AAP's national spokesperson Preeti Sharma Menon had hit back at Gandhi terming him a \"dictator\", who was allegedly destroying the volunteers' base in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to Ware's resignation, AAP's senior leader and state executive committee's former member Ravi Srivastava today termed it \"unfortunate\" saying, \"I hope the central leadership would soon take corrective measures.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:14:26.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
