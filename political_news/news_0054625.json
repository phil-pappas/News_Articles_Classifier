Pettura, Lifes2good's new line of veterinarian-formulated supplements for dogs launching today, found only 25%* of canines are receiving a vitamin supplement. This is a surprise considering pet owners know the importance of a vitamin-rich diet and 60%* say they regularly take health supplements for themselves. So why is man's best friend being denied the important vitamins needed to improve their health?\nPettura found pet owners are not adding a supplement to their dog's nutrition because they are not sure it would help (25% 1) and some think the dog food supplies all of their nutrients (24% 1 ). But the truth is, pets can benefit from supplements the same way that people do. With the introduction of Pettura, the brand is changing the way pet owners think about giving a daily supplement to their furry friends.\nDr. Jeffrey Lee , DVM and Veterinary Consultant at Harbor UCLA Medical Center said, \"I recommend supplements to pet owners because they are a valuable component of a comprehensive care program for animals. Throughout a dog's lifespan vitamins are needed for different reasons, from overall growth as a puppy and receiving an adequate amount of vitamins as a senior. Pettura had this in mind when it specially formulated its no-pill concept that dogs will actually ingest easily. Within two weeks, there is 100 percent guarantee that you'll notice a positive difference in your pet.\"\nPet owners will love the ease and accuracy of using Pettura's innovative liquid formula with a pre-measured pump. There is no difficult pill to split or need for tricks to administer, simply add it to pet food or a delicious treat and it works fast. Making it easy to offer any dog the daily essential vitamins to improve their health and help extend their happy, active life.\nWith a passion for providing health-conscious pet parents with premium nutritional supplements for their dogs, Pettura offers the same standards as vitamins taken by people. It's made with pharma-grade ingredients in a human pharmaceutical facility and tested to human standards. Owners can have peace of mind knowing that the scientifically formulated, drug-free solution is helping to keep their dogs looking and feeling healthier.\nPettura is suitable for all sizes and breeds of dogs, and comes in five different easy-to-dose formulations to meet your pet's needs, including:\nCalming ( $29.99 )– In 15 minutes, lessen the level of stress and anxiety that dogs experience in certain situations with a combination of valerian, chamomile and L-Tryptophan. Multi-Vitamin ($29.99) – Full of antioxidants such as vitamin E, green tea extract and vitamin C, this supports general health and wellness, boosts vitality and a healthy immune system function. Healthy Joints ($29.99) – Boosts flexibility and mobility for healthy joints and reduces discomfort with a formula that will have aging dogs acting like a puppy again. Oral Health ($29.99) – Reduces tartar build and freshens breath without brushing dogs' teeth. It is formulated to flow naturally throughout the dog's mouth after it has been applied. Skin and Coat ($29.99) – Promotes a healthy exterior to keep skin nourished and coat shiny with a combination of biotin, zinc and fish oil. \"People understand that eating right and getting enough vitamins are essential to a proper diet regimen, but there is a disconnect when it comes to our pets. Supplements can be very beneficial to maintaining a pet's general health and wellness during their lifetime. By launching our line, we hope more people start making supplements part of their dog's daily routine - just like they do for themselves,\" said Stevie Jones , Brand Marketing Manager at Pettura. \"We are even making it convenient for shoppers by stocking Pettura in the vitamin aisle at CVS. This way pet owners will think of their four-legged friend the next time they reach for their own supplements.\"\nPettura is made in the U.S. and is available at select CVS stores nationwide in the vitamin aisle.
