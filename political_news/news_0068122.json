Quote: Fighting wars costs money and so does bribing the citizenry to ensure you dont get some kind of Arab Spring-type uprising. When you endeavor to artificially suppress the price of the export that is the source for your wealth and international prestige (all in an epic attempt to bankrupt the competition and secure geopolitical ancillary benefits) you dont do yourself any favors from a financial perspective and now, the Saudis are staring down a massive budget deficit and a current account thats in the red for the first time in ages. So while things may look on the up and up from an FX reserve perspective (even as the cushion is at its lowest level since 2013) and while the kingdom has plenty of capacity to borrow with a debt-to-GDP ratio of just a little over 2%, things are about to get ugly very quickly going forward and if Riyadh decides to plunge headlong into Syrias civil war, it will only get worse. Note that while debt levels are likely to stay low relative to a world where countries like Japan are borrowing so much that the number of decimal places won't even fit into a title, going from basically 0% to ~16% of GDP in the space of just 24 months isn't exactly a good sign:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:37:12.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
