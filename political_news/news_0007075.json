Recorded conversation on the point of dog bite and wrist slit reflect different versions\". \nRegarding the injuries on Lipika and her allegation of wrist sliting, the judge said \"I have gone through the police file also and find no medical evidence in support of the incident of alleged wrist slit of night intervening May 27-28, 2015. There is only MLC dated June 11, which only mentions about old cut marks but no external injury.\" \nLipika has alleged that the AAP leader had unleashed his pet on her during pregnancy and even slit her wrist with a kitchen knife. \nBased on these allegation, police had booked Bharti for attempt to murder charges under section 307 of IPC and other charges. Police had also examined Bharti's pet to ascertain the allegation after taking it into custody. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:01:28.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
