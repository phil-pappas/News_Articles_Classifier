And, each year medical experts encourage Canadians to protect themselves by getting a flu vaccination. According to a new national poll, that message is still not sinking in – 54 per cent admit they are unlikely to get the flu shot this year. So pharmacists are working to set the record straight and encourage the public to make it a priority.\nSince the evidence clearly shows the benefits of flu vaccination, what is keeping Canadians from committing each year? Last year's flu season saw questions arise over how effective the vaccine was; could that be the culprit? Not according to the poll – in fact, four in five Canadians (83 per cent) say the limited effectiveness of last year's flu vaccine won't affect their immunization decision this year.\nOne major stumbling block is that many Canadians seem to be confused about how important flu vaccination is – 81 per cent think washing your hands is the best way to protect against the flu, while only 47 per cent thought getting the flu vaccination offered the best protection. Almost half (47 per cent) mistakenly believe there is no need to get the flu shot every year.\n\"The flu vaccine is hands down the best source of protection currently available,\" says Dr. Vivien Brown , family physician and representative to Immunize Canada, a national coalition which raises awareness about the benefits of immunization. \"And with the flu vaccination now conveniently offered from pharmacists across many parts of Canada , it's easier than ever to make flu immunization an annual routine.\"\nBattle of the Sexes\nThe research found that men and women see things differently when it comes to the flu and vaccination. Women are more concerned with getting the flu than men – 48 vs. 37 per cent. And yet, 33 per cent of women say they have never received a flu shot, compared to 28 per cent of men. What's more, 50 per cent of women mistakenly believe there is no need to get the flu shot every year, while only 44 per cent of men have that misconception.\nFear of Missing Out\nFlu can cause very serious health consequences. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada , flu cases result in approximately 12,200 hospitalizations and, on average, 3,500 deaths in Canada each year. i\nIn addition to the serious health risks, the flu is also a major nuisance for many and provides a significant disruption in our daily lives. Fever and other symptoms can usually last up to 7 to 10 days, but the cough and weakness may last 1 to 2 weeks longer. ii The poll found that the following are the top three things Canadians hope they don't miss out on due to the flu: family holiday dinners (49%), social events (47%), and work (46%).\n\"No one wants to be stuck sick in bed and missing out on things like family holiday celebrations or even important work deadlines,\" says Bhavika Prajapati, Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacist. \"Pharmacists are trained medical professionals and in most provinces we offer flu vaccination during all open hours and without an appointment.\"\nPharmacist, Bhavika Prajapati, recommends the following three preventative measures to help keep families healthy this flu season:\nStrengthen your immune system: Maintain a healthy and active lifestyle and don't forget to stay hydrated. Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently, and for at least 10 seconds using warm water. Get vaccinated: 70 – 90 per cent of flu cases can be averted through vaccination. iii About Flu Vaccination\nPharmacists are now able to administer the flu vaccine in all provinces in Canada except for Québec*. And new this year, Ontarians aged five to 17 now have an additional option to the flu injection for their immunization since FluMist®, a nasal spray, will now be available at pharmacies across the province.\nInfluenza activity normally occurs from November to March or April. Fall is the best time to get the flu vaccine as it takes up to two weeks to build immunity after a flu shot and protection will last roughly six months.\nAccording to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, everyone should get the flu vaccine, but it is especially important for individuals such as: those 65 years of age and older; healthy children 6 months to 5 years of age; healthy pregnant women, at any stage of pregnancy; and children and adults with chronic medical conditions. iv\nAbout Shoppers Drug Mart Corporation\nShoppers Drug Mart Corporation is one of the most recognized and trusted names in Canadian retailing.
