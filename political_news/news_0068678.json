No drugs. No weapons. No fighting. And no stopping by without an appointment.\nThose rules will be enforced at all times if Orange County’s proposed year-round homeless shelter in Anaheim becomes a reality. That’s according to documents recently released by county officials that detail how the shelter, which is to include a service center aimed at helping people find permanent housing and employment, will be designed and operated.\nOrange County residents have until Oct. 30 to review and comment on the new information, which is contained in several reports totaling more than 1,000 pages and is available online at ocplanning.net/planning/land/projects/emergency_temporary_shelter . The shelter has drawn criticism and concern from residents of the neighborhoods that surround the industrial area where the shelter would be located.\nThe Board of Supervisors in June authorized the purchase of a warehouse in an Anaheim industrial area near the 91 freeway for $4.2 million, but supervisors haven’t approved the opening of a shelter there.\nThe requested feedback is to focus on one of the new reports: a document that declares the Kraemer site appropriate for a shelter, based on a traffic and noise analysis and an environmental report, which are publicly available for review. Supervisors are expected to schedule a vote to consider formally adopting the declaration after the 30-day feedback period ends.\nTodd Spitzer, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, in a statement called the feedback “an important step in the process as my colleagues and I move toward a final decision.”\nResidents and business owners near the proposed location, a 24,000-square-foot warehouse on 1.87 acres at 1000 N. Kraemer Place, are rallying to reject the proposal.\n“It would be a challenge for them to pull off what they’re attempting,” said Chris Vance, who owns a piano store next door to the Kraemer warehouse. “I don't know of any that are operating the way they plan to operate this one.”\nCounty spokeswoman Jean Pasco said the appointment-only requirement “is consistent with many other successful Orange County shelter practices.”\nThe requirement would help the County to move toward the use of a regional coordinated shelter entry system mandated by the federal Housing and Urban Development agency, which calls for one “door” for the homeless to access many resources. Coordinated entry also helps get the homeless clients connected to appropriate resources and ensures that the most chronic, vulnerable individuals get prioritized for shelter, housing and other resources.\nThe appointment rule aims to prevent loitering and other activities that could harm the neighborhood, according to the report.\nIncluded with the reports is a 221-page document from Mercy House that explains how the shelter would operate and details its approximately $2.6 million annual budget. Mercy House has not been selected to operate the shelter; Pasco said the county will request proposals for operators if the land is purchased.\nThe shelter is to include 200 beds, and the average length of stay is projected to be 30 days with a maximum of six months. New arrivals would be assigned an “employment and housing navigator,” according to the plans, and are to complete a program focusing on housing, job and life skills before they access the multi-service center. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks would be served, and a shuttle would take people to and from the shelter for jobs and appointments. Residents who miss their shuttle rides could lose their shelter beds.\nThree to five security officers with non-lethal weapons like mace and batons would monitor the building at all times, and shelter staff would patrol a one-mile radius once a week “to collect litter, promote cleanliness, engage with neighbors, and enhance safety and cleanliness of the immediate vicinity,” the report says.\nSecurity also would monitor the pick-up and drop-off locations, and all guests would be screened by a metal detector, fingerprinted and photographed. Security would have an office that's also open to Anaheim and Fullerton police, as well as the Orange County Sheriff's Department and Probation Department. Discipline would be based on a tiered infraction system that ranks offenses and could ultimately lead to the offender losing his or her shelter bed.\nNo registered sex offenders would be allowed inside the shelter, nor will felons with active warrants.\nContact the writer: mcuniff@ocregister.com or 949-492-5122.
