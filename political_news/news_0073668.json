That's not our territory,\" Trump said.\nTrump took questions from a dozen voters Monday in a basement room at the Atkinson Resort & Country Club. Trump explained his positions on everything from the war with ISIS and how he would handle Russia to illegal immigration and the economy.\nAttendees -- a mix of Trump supporters and undecided voters -- appeared to approve of most of Trump's answers. Two voters pressed Trump further with follow-up questions, telling him that he had not answered their questions which asked about his specific plans to deal with undocumented immigrants and the economy.\nOn illegal immigration, Trump didn't explain exactly how he would deport the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the U.S., simply pointing to his managerial skills.\nAnother voter pressed him on whether voters should simply believe that he will revive the economy based on his last name, or whether he has any specific plans to address economic challenges.\n\"I think they should,\" Trump said of voters electing him based on his name, adding that he would renegotiate trade deals involving the U.S. and bring jobs back.\n\"But how?\" the 21-year-old college student and entrepreneur asked again.\nTrump didn't get more specific beyond explaining that he plans to lower taxes and renegotiate trade deals.\nInstead, Trump stressed the importance of \"flexibility in dealmaking\" and said there was no need for multi-point plans.\n\"It doesn't work that way because point two gets loused up and you have to go to a different point two,\" Trump said. \"It doesn't mean anything.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150701115834-donald-trump-close-up-2015-medium-plus-169.jpg",
