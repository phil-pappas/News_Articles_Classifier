National Hispanic Heritage Month ends on Thursday this week. The annual commemoration, beginning every September 15 , can often treat Hispanics as a single, undifferentiated population. But the roughly 55-million Hispanic residents in America hail from a great variety of nations and cultures in the Caribbean , or south of the Rio Grande River. It's well known the greatest number come from Mexico - over 33 million. But nearly 5 million are of Puerto Rican origin, and another 1.9 million trace their roots to Cuba . About the same number are from El Salvador . Colombia and Guatemala are claimed by over 1 million residents each. The Hispanic nation with the fewest U.S. immigrants is Paraguay , with just over 22,500.
