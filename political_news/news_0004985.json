Open day and night, always staffed with smiling, capable police officers, ‘the nick’ was seen as a place of refuge and assistance in a dangerous world. The building was, by tradition, a major part of the town centre scene, along with the imposing stone or brick Post Office and the smart and bustling commercial hotel. \nYet the Post Office has long since been relocated to the inside of a newsagent or a supermarket; the commercial hotel is now as likely to be a hastily erected budget hotel on a trading estate on the edge of town while the police station, if it is still there at all, has been dramatically downgraded. Sgt Dixon or his Westcountry equivalents are now as likely to be out and about in patrol cars as waiting behind the counter for those in need to come knocking on the door. But that process of scaling back or shutting down police stations is about to get a good deal more intense. It is hard to over-state the degree to which Devon and Cornwall police and crime commissioner Tony Hogg is having to slash budgets. Quite clearly, keeping buildings open on the basis of nostalgia and a ‘just in case’ approach cannot be justified. \nHis plan, however, is a bold one. Dramatically altering the status of 34 police stations across Devon and Cornwall, with many to close altogether, risks alienating the police from the people they serve in those communities. At its most extreme it could put those in need in unnecessary danger and increase crime. On the other hand who, nowadays, reports a crime or seeks assistance from a police officer face-to-face across the police station counter? Most of us now use the telephone, the internet and email for all our official transactions – and quite a lot of unofficial ones too. \nWhile many will be up in arms over the loss of police stations, a significant proportion are in love, not with the actuality of having officers sitting waiting for folk to call, but with the idea that there is somewhere to go and someone to talk to in authority, if the worst happens. Our betting is Mr Hogg would not be doing this if he didn’t have to. But it may turn out to be the least of all evils, as the cuts bite, even if it means there’s no one left under the blue lamp to say ‘Evenin’ all’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:00:10.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
