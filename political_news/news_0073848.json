The High Court also struck down the Rule 9 and 10 of Reservation Rules 2005.\nThe rule 9 provides percentage of reservation to various categories for the promotion and Rule 10 provides roaster points for reserved category while making promotions. The High Court also struck down Rule 34 of reservation 2005 which obligates the government to consider reserved categories also while making temporary/ stop-gap/ officiating promotions.\nThe court said the reservation made in terms of Section 6 of Reservation Act and Rules 9, 10 and 34 of the Reservation Rules is invidious and unconstitutional.\nTerming the judgement historic and landmark, Riyaz Jan, who had filed one of the petitions before becoming advocate general, said the court has accepted his contentions and declared the provisions unconstitutional.\n\"I had filed the petition before becoming the advocate general. But I could not argue it later. My colleagues argued it and eventually court accepted the legal position and termed the two provisions as unconstitutional.
