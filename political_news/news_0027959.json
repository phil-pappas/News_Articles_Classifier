Following a smooth rollout, Denver also became the first success story as well as a valuable resource for other cities attempting to prepare for the administrative, legal, safety and business implications of marijuana legalization.\nAt the symposium, Kilroy will present Denver's collaborative approach toward marijuana management, including how the city manages marijuana-related revenue and expenditures, cross-departmental resource allocation, streamlined inspection processes and the considerable task of coordinating the city's work on marijuana across multiple agencies and among various interested parties.\nAdditional speakers will cover a range of regulatory and policy topics including safety, the permitting process, environmental health aspects, inspections, youth prevention, and public safety, among others.\nAs more states face the prospect of legalized recreational marijuana, Denver officials have invited state and local government representatives from around Colorado , across the country and from as far as Amsterdam to participate in the forum.\nAndrew Freedman , Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's Director of Marijuana Coordination, as well as Lewsi Koski, the director of Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement Division, will provide a statewide perspective to the symposium. Representatives from the State of Colorado's Department of Public Health & Environment also will participate. Author Shawn Micallef will give the keynote address on Nov. 5 .\nFor more information on the Marijuana Management Symposium in Denver , visit DMMS2015.com .\nCity and County of Denver\nOffice of Marijuana Policy\nDan Rowland , Communications Advisor\nDan.Rowland@DenverGov.Org\nO: 720.865.2686\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denver-hosting-worlds-first-comprehensive-symposium-on-marijuana-management-300163937.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC34659&Transmission_Id=201510211233PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC34659&DateId=20151021", "http://www.dmms2015.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/denver-hosting-worlds-first-comprehensive-symposium-on-marijuana-management-300163937.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:38:09.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
