(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) October 19 at 5:19 PM Regarding Evan DeFilippis and Devin Hughes’s Oct. 16 op-ed, “ Gun safety’s middle ground ”:\nBackground checks for gun purchases are fine, but they miss the point somewhat.

Trying to stop guns is like trying to stop drugs; it has not worked.\nPerhaps the president should look at the mind-set of a person who pulls the trigger. Unfortunately, we are bombarded by movies and video games that show guns, violence, death and explosions.
