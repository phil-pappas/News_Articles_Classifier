The comedian initially offered a simple endorsement but Labour wanted to show that Mr Miliband had worked to win him over.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:09:51.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
