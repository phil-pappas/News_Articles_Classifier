(AP) - Pennsylvania's attorney general told her staff Wednesday that some 98 percent of her job won't be affected by the looming suspension of her law license that goes into effect as she fights her own criminal charges, her spokesman said.\nAttorney General Kathleen Kane briefed her staff about the suspension that takes full effect on Thursday, said spokesman Chuck Ardo, but she has not produced a written memo outlining her conclusions.\n\"It's her position that virtually all legal decisions are made before they reach her desk, and that her decisions are primarily administrative or somehow supervisory,\" Ardo told reporters. \"But none of her decisions would require her to act as an attorney.\"\nShe told top aides that the chain of command would remain as it has been, and other lawyers, including top deputy Bruce Beemer, will step in to handle matters that require a licensed lawyer. Ardo said Kane did not delineate what those will be.\n\"I think amongst this roomful of lawyers, there was a fundamental understanding of what that was,\" Ardo said.\nHe characterized the tone of the staff meeting as cordial but said some disagreed with Kane's position.\n\"I think there were lawyers in the room who believed her role would need to be much more limited than she believes it needs to be,\" Ardo said.\nKane, a first-term Democrat, was charged in August by a suburban Philadelphia prosecutor with leaking secret grand jury material to a newspaper reporter and lying to cover it up. Prosecutors added additional counts earlier this month, based on allegations she lied about whether she had ever signed a secrecy oath\nThe Supreme Court issued a 5-0 opinion on Sept. 21 to put her license on temporary, indefinite suspension, but delayed implementation for 30 days. The high court said its order did not remove her from office.\nArdo said Kane will continue to make decisions that are considered to be of a policy nature, and said her name will still appear on civil lawsuits and other court documents.\nHe said Kane will give her staff a letter describing how the suspension affects office operations.\n\"She has not written that memo yet,\" Ardo said. \"She intends to do that. She's been a little bit busy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:44:10.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
