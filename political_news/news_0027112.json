Based on her previous policy she ought to be hauled before a sharia court and be thrown in jail. Clearly her statement might incite Muslims to violence — the very policy she cited when banning me from entering the UK.\nHome Secretary Theresa May issued a stark warning that high levels of immigration are unsustainable and make it “impossible to build a cohesive society” in Britain.\nThat cow owes me an apology.\n‘Mass migration threatens Britain’s social cohesion’ – Home Secretary (VIDEO), RT, October 7, 2015\nHome Secretary Theresa May issued a stark warning that high levels of immigration are unsustainable and make it “impossible to build a cohesive society” in Britain.\nMay used her speech at Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on Tuesday to argue that mass migration on the scale seen over the past decade is not in the “national interest.”\nShe claimed that mass migration leads to the undercutting of wages for low-paid workers and joblessness for thousands of others.\nThe Home Secretary, who is considered a potential successor to Prime Minister David Cameron, addressed the issue of migration weeks after a report found that migration to Britain increased by 24 percent in 2014.\nThe number of migrants entering the UK rose by 108,000 to 558,000, according to a report published by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) last month.\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics (ONS), net migration to the UK was 330,000 in the year to March, far surpassing the government’s goal of reducing migration to below 100,000.", "external_links": ["http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/theresa-may1.jpeg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Moi5aFQlBvI", "http://pamelageller.com//https://www.rt.com/uk/317760-migration-threatens-social-cohesion/"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:30:31.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
