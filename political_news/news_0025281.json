He is running as an independent.\n“The parties have ruined this country,” Drake said in an interview. “The Republicans are as bad as the Democrats. All they do is play games with our money.”\nThe nation needs to return to the Judeo-Christian principles on which it was founded, said Drake, who serves as pastor for the First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park.\n“We need to get a pastor back in charge,” he said. “Politicians used to be right men. Now they are wrong men.”\nOne of his goals would be to do away with the U.S. welfare system and instead institute “Church-fare” – churches, not the taxpayers, should be helping the less fortunate.\n“We’ve been doing that at our church for 28 years,” the pastor said.\nDrake’s running mate is Apostle Blossom, chairwoman of the Congressional Women of Sovereign Authority.\nIn 2008, Drake was a candidate for vice president with the American Independent Party as a running mate with Alan Keyes, and he ran for president as a write-in candidate in 2012.\n“The third time is a charm,” Drake said.\nIn 2009, Drake sent out an email saying that his prayers may have been answered with the death of John Murtha, the Pennsylvania Congressman who fiercely opposed the Iraq war.\n\"Maybe God took him out,\" Drake wrote. \"Maybe God Answered our IMPRECATORY prayer that we prayed every 30 days.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:13:24.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
