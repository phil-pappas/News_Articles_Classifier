(Edmund D. Fountain/For The Washington Post) October 23 at 4:57 PM Regarding the Oct. 21 Metro article “ Boy’s record won’t include threat ”:\nThe child in question, an 8-year-old, was said to have made a “homicidal threat” when he said he wanted to kill a classmate who had stomped on his foot. I have looked in vain for anyone having offered a different view of this incident.\nWhat do you call a boy who stomps on the foot of a smaller or weaker child and says something such as “What are you going to do about it?” If a label doesn’t come to mind, try “bully.” Has anyone at the elementary school or in Montgomery County Public Schools recognized that the greater problem may lie in the aggressor child?\nI’m closing in on 88, but back in the 1940s, I was bullied. I said, “I’ll get you,” but in my mind were thoughts similar to those attributed to the boy being persecuted by his school.\nFor the record, years later, my bully and I ended up working for the same organization. When he came up to me later saying how great it was that two of us from the same school ended up together, I reminded him of his actions years earlier. I was superior to him in grade but never his supervisor, so I never affected his career, but the look in his eyes when I said I remembered his actions years earlier has remained with me forever, even though his name no longer does.\nPete Bermel , Great Falls", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:24:10.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
