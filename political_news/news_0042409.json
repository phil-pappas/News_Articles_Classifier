You won't find that in Australia.\"\nHe said in Australia if a worker held out a piece of paper and there were six drops of rain on it, the workers went back into the shed.\n\"I'm not suggesting you would ever work when it's unsafe,\" Mr Fazzino said.\nIn the US, if workers turned up on site and it was washed out, they were paid for one hour. In Australia, they are paid for 12 hours.\nDiscussion needed \"It's those type of practices I think we need to have a discussion around productivity,\" he said.\n Mr Fazzino famously decided to build fertiliser and explosives maker Incitec's $US850 million ($1.2 billion) ammonia plant in Louisiana instead of Australia.\nHe said there was a \"step change\" in labour productivity because of the critical mass of skilled workers in Louisiana, and workplace practices.\nLabour costs made about half the cost of building an ammonia plant in the US, but it would blow out to about 75 per cent in Australia.\nOn the global ammonia cost curve, the US is in the bottom third at about $US130 a tonne. Australia is in the most expensive third at about $US275 a tonne.\nMr Fazzino also said the increased productivity was not coming at the expense of workplace safety.\n\"The productivity is not coming from short cuts,\" he said.\nBHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, who spent four years in Chicago working for British Petroleum, also hailed US workplace practices.\nPraise for US practices Mr Mackenzie praised the \"flexibility and dynamism\" of American labour during a business address in Washington last month.\nHe said during his time at BP the company was shut down a plant, demolished it, and redeployed staff within two months.\nBy contrast, senior Australian business leaders were becoming increasingly vocal about the need to reform tax and workplace laws.\nLast month Robert Millner, who chairs investment group Washington H. Soul Pattinson, said p ayroll tax should be axed and the GST increased, as he attacked exorbitant penalty rates .\nBrickworks managing director Lindsay Partridge attacked the rostered-day-off as the single-biggest impediment to productivity in the construction industry.\n\"We had a situation last month where there was a public holiday and four RDOs, so one week in a month was lost to construction. How can anybody make a living in a business that works three weeks in a month?\" Mr Partridge said at the Brickworks full-year result last month.\nBeleaguered steel makers Arrium and BlueScope have also been struggled to implement workplace changes despite their business being under considerable pressure.\nArrium had to fight its unions through the Fair Work Commission to abolish the rostered day off and change shift times at a plant in Western Australia.\nThe company is slashing jobs and costs to deal with its debt problems and depressed iron ore and steel prices.\nBlueScope, which also has a heavily unionised workforce, has had a long fight to change work practices at a plate mill at its Port Kembla steelworks .\nThe struggle came as BlueScope contemplated mothballing the remaining Port Kembla blast furnace and importing commodity steel, to stem losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:02:54.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
