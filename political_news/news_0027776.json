Dirk Kupar , Randy Obermeyer and Linda Caffee have been added to board via a unanimous vote.\nMr. Obermeyer is a fleet executive who has worked for Batesville Logistics for over five years and has been an advocate of the Trucker Buddy program for all Batesville drivers. As a percentage, Batesville has more drivers in the program than any other fleet.\n\"I'm excited to serve on the board because Truck Buddy International is an outstanding organization that positively affects the lives of schoolchildren throughout our entire nation. The enthusiastic letters, thank you cards and other communications that my Batesville Logistics Inc. drivers get from their pen pals are priceless to say the least. You can envision the thoughts going through these young people's minds as they attempt to look through the eyes of our truckers during their travels across the nation. I look forward to helping the organization continue its tradition in developing our young children's passion for geography and trucking.\" – Randy Obermeyer\nMr. Kupar is President of TruckRight, a Canadian company that is a fast way to recruit, onboard, train and – most importantly – retain truck drivers. Their proprietary automated compliance system maintains driver file compliance intuitively for the carrier and driver's needs.\n\"I am honored that my nomination was accepted by the board of Trucker Buddy International. During my time on the board, I plan to help spread the news about the great work that the Trucker Buddy drivers are doing promoting the trucking industry. Is there a better place than with our children's educators and their students? I think not. As a Boy Scout, I received the Chief Scout Award (Eagle Scout in the USA ), so the Boy Scout's transportation merit badge is of special interest to me. I will do my best to put the concept in front of Scouts Canada. I believe we all share a responsibility to promote our industry; sitting on the side lines waiting for someone else do it just won't cut it. Each Trucker Buddy driver is an example to us all, the great work they do representing themselves, their companies and the industry as a whole. Again, I am honored and humbled to play a small part in this wonderful organization.\" – Kirk Kupar\nMs. Caffee is an owner-operator leased to Landstar Express. She and her husband, Bob, are team drivers and are very involved in the trucking industry as a Trucker Buddy Ambassador, Team RunSmart drivers and working with other trucking-related organizations, including Women in Trucking, Trucking Solutions Group and the St. Christopher's Fund.\n\"I am excited about being elected to the Board of Directors for Trucker Buddy International. A goal of mine is to work on ways to provide guidance to current and future teachers to utilize the information that truck drivers can provide to them; math ideas, geography and even art work. It is exciting to be part of a program that helps shape the future leaders of our country about trucks and the drivers behind the wheel.\" – Linda Caffee\n\"Trucker Buddy is very fortunate to be able to add three effective and experienced professionals like Linda, Dirk and Randy. They bring to the table years of problem solving and working directly with our volunteers, the over the road drivers. I'm excited to partner with them to continue to use their leadership skills to improve the Trucker Buddy program.\" – Randy Schwartzenburg , Executive Director.\nFor pictures and more information please visit page: New Board Members\nTrucker Buddy International\nTrucker Buddy International, an independent, non-profit 501(c) (3) organization, often called the number one trucking image campaign in North America, has helped educate schoolchildren and introduce educators to the trucking industry. This gives them the world through the eyes of a professional truck driver. The Trucker Buddy program helps to educate and mentor schoolchildren via a pen pal relationship between professional truck drivers and children in grades K-8 as supervised by their teachers.\nAfter an extensive screening process, the professional truck drivers are matched with a class and as directed by the teacher, drivers share news about their travels with their class. Students write letters and send pictures to their drivers. Students' skills in reading, writing, geography, mathematics, social studies and history are enhanced and learning is made fun.\nSince 1992, Trucker Buddy International has helped educate more than a million schoolchildren and introduced them to caring, compassionate men and women, professional truck drivers. The ongoing success of the program is due to driver volunteers, participating teachers and the contributions of sponsors. There is no cost to the drivers or teachers to participate in the program. The Trucker Buddy program is funded entirely by sponsorships and donations.
