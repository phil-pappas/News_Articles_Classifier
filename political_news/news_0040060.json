The rock missed and as police then began attempting to arrest the teen he resisted arrest and struggled with the police.\nHe now faces charges of aggravated attempted assault of a police officer and interfering with a police officer on duty. Prosecutors on Thursday issued a request that he be kept in custody until the end of proceedings against him.\nThe Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court on Thursday also indicted a 31-year-old Arab resident of the Old City named Mu’awiya Hiri for throwing stones at police officers from the roof of his house on a number of occasions in September.\nIn September, State Attorney Shai Nitzan ordered all prosecutors to seek stiffer penalties for rock throwing, even by minors. He also directed prosecutors to ask courts to remand defendants until the end of their trials.\nAlso in September, the security cabinet unanimously approved a series of measures to counter rock-throwing, including loosening the rules of engagement to allow security forces to use live fire against rock-throwers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:26:23.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
