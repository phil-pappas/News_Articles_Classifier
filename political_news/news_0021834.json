Lisa Owen asks Trade Minister Tim Groser what exactly we’ve signed up to and what it means for healthcare, exports and our ability to make our own laws. \nThen, as Helen Kelly prepares to step down as president of the Council of Trade Unions next week, we talk to her about the future of unions, fighting for the underdog in the 21st century, and her own battle with cancer. \nAnd for more than 40 years, the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter has been a key player in Southland’s economy. Reporter Torben Akel heads south to see if there’s a Plan B for the region. \nWe’ll discuss all this and more with our panel: political scientist Jon Johansson, New Zealand Herald columnist Fran O’Sullivan, and blogger and First Union advisor Morgan Godfery. \nThe Nation on TV3, 9.30am Saturdays and 10am Sundays, and 7pm Saturdays on Radio Live. Proudly brought to you by New Zealand on Air’s Platinum Fund. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
