Jose Luis Magana/AP Donald Trump has been hearing quite a few \"cease and desist\" orders from the rock world. Neil Young, R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe and now Aerosmith's Steven Tyler have all ordered Trump to stop using their music. \nLast month, R.E.M. founding member Mike Mills slammed Trump's use of the group's classic \"It's the End of the World As We Know It\" at a campaign event, demanding that he \"cease and desist\" using the song. \n\"Personally, I think the Orange Clown will do anything for attention. I hate giving it to him,\" Mills tweeted in an additional angry tirade. \n\"Go f--- yourselves, the lot of you â€” you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men,\" R.E.M. lead man Michael Stipe said in a separate statement. \"Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.\" \nIn June, rocker Neil Young also called out Trump for using his \"Rockin' In the Free World\" hit without permission during the magnate's campaign kickoff event. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:28:09.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
