The Auckland Development Committee voted to join the group Thursday morning. \n“It’s time for Auckland to commit on an international stage to taking serious steps to combat climate change” Leroy Beckett, Generation Zero Spokesperson. “We are pleased the councillors on the development committee voted in the best interests of the city today. \n“Joining the C40 is the next logical step in Auckland leading the way on climate change reduction in New Zealand. Ahead of the international climate summit in Paris in December this is a clear sign that the city is committed to emissions reduction.” \nThe 75 C40 cities, including Melbourne, Sydney, New York, Shanghai and London, are home to 550 million people, representing a ¼ of the global economy and have taken 8000 measures to tackle climate change. \n“The C40 isn’t just for show, the cities involved recognise the unique position cities are in to take desperately needed action on climate change at a time when nation states are dragging their feet.” \nAuckland was asked to join the C40 after a meeting with Mayor Brown at the World Cities Summit last year. \nThe membership proposal prepared by Auckland Council shows all the requirements for joining the C40 are achievable and most are already committed to in existing plans, particularly in the Low Carbon Auckland Action Plan. \n“Joining the C40 allows Auckland access to international networks, case studies and best practice that will help us achieve the goals we already have in place” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:02:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
