It was not immediately clear if state law regulates how much physicians may prescribe legal opioids. \nIn addition to Schuh's bill, the County Council is also considering a measure that would limit where medical marijuana operations would go instead of imposing an outright prohibition. That bill, introduced by three council members, was hardly discussed at the work session after officials spent nearly two hours debating Schuh's bill. Council members have expressed that it is unlikely the administration bill would pass. \nA public hearing on both bills will be held at the council's biweekly meeting Monday. \nDespite technically being bills that would change planning and zoning laws, the conversation Tuesday largely was a wider debate on legalization — and its impact on patients, federal employees, law enforcement authorities and what officials have said would be a nominal effect on economic development. \nPlanning and Zoning Officer Larry Tom called on the council to implement some form of zoning provisions on medical marijuana operations and suggested it could do so by allowing the businesses to operate either under conditional or special exception uses, in which a project's qualifications are determined by county planning officials. \nWhile Tom said he was not opposed to the administration's ban, he reiterated a position taken by County Attorney Nancy Duden that the council must adopt regulations on where medical marijuana operations take place because of the way state and county laws are written. \n\"You need to put controls on all aspects of the cannabis process,\" Tom said. \nWhile other administration officials have expressed support for the legislation, they also said the bill was a way to take a wait-and-see approach to how other counties in Maryland implement state law. \nCouncil members also asked how the county would navigate implementing medicinal pot when marijuana is still considered illegal under federal law. While federal authorities have cracked down on dispensary operations in California and Colorado in recent years, states that have legalized medicinal and recreational marijuana have been able to operate. \nCouncil members also asked whether the county could change the types and amount allowed under state law. \nShort of lobbying the General Assembly, Duden said, the county could not alter how much medicinal pot is allowed under state law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:48:15.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
