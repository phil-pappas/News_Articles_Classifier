Photo: AP\nSince the war in Syria began, our leaders have been telling us how complicated it is and since Russian bombing began some maintain that its actions have only added to the complication.\nBut if you're an outsider it's a damn sight easier to understand the Russian position on Syria than it is to understand the US one.\nThe Russian position is quite simple. It's backing the Syrian government and together they're fighting the extremist Sunni Islamic State.\nIf forces are attacking the Syrian government then they are pro-IS.\nAdvertisement So, having joined the conflict, the Russians are not only bombing IS territory, they are also bombing an alliance of rebels that reportedly includes the al-Qaeda aligned Jabhat al-Nusra and other groups like Tajamu Ala'Azza and Liwa Suqour al-Jabal which seek to topple the Syrian government.\nThe US position is that it is against IS.\nBut here's where the difficulty arises – the US supports forces that devote much of their time to attacking the Syrian government, rather than IS.\nTajamu Ala'Azza and Liwa Suqour al-Jabal, for example, have received CIA training and been supplied with anti-tank rockets which they have used to attack Syrian government armour over the past year.\nOn top of that, according to reports in The Washington Post , the US Central Command has confirmed that in late September US-trained Syrian fighters in the New Syrian Force gave at least a quarter of their US-provided equipment to al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra.\nFrom a Syrian government point of view the US-backed \"moderates\" are in alliance with the extremists and as much the enemy as IS itself.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin put his position clearly in his recent address to the United Nations. He said tens of thousands of militants were fighting under the IS banner. They included former Iraqi servicemen who were thrown out into the street after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and many recruits from Libya.\nHis most telling point was that these radicals were being joined by the members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition who were supported, armed and trained by Western countries and then defected to IS.\nIn addition to getting weapons in Syria as an indirect gift from the US, IS has managed to restock in Iraq from weapons abandoned by forces supported by the US.\nIn last year's collapse of Mosul, for example, Iraqi government forces lost weapons and munitions. Speaking on Iraqi TV the Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said recently: \"We lost 2300 Humvees in Mosul alone.\"\nPutin also reminded the West that IS did not just come from nowhere. It was also initially forged as a tool against \"undesirable secular regimes\".\nIt's not politically correct to mention it these days but Saddam Hussein's Iraq and President Bashar al-Assad's Syria were secular states. There were 1.5 million Christians in Iraq before the 2003 US invasion. Today it's estimated only 300,000 remain.\nAssad, from the minority Alawite branch of Shiite Islam, led a relatively secular government that protected the religious freedom of Christians, Druze and Yazidis.\nThe West does not have to like his government to decide that for the time being it should ally with it. During World War II Winston Churchill had no illusions about the nature of the Soviet Union but accepted the Soviets as allies and recognised their sacrifices and their primary role in winning the war in Europe.\nBut a US decision to join the Russians and the Syrian government in fighting IS risks getting other US allies offside.\nSunni Saudi Arabia has long been a provider of military and financial assistance to Islamic extremists and is strongly opposed to the Alawite Assad Syrian government.\nTurkey, also a Sunni country, is opposed to the Assad regime and has allowed fighters and arms shipments to pass through its territory to join the anti-Assad campaign, including fighters intending to join IS.\nTurkey gives every appearance of being more concerned about demands for a Kurdish state in its east than it is about IS.\nDespite the Kurds having proved to be the most effective force combatting IS, Turkey, while purporting to join the fight against IS, has taken the opportunity to bomb Kurdish positions in Syria.\nWith aircraft from Russia, Syria, the US, Turkey, Canada and Australia now engaged in operations over Syria and with no co-ordination, there is real danger of a clash.\nThe US condemned a Russian aircraft's violation of Turkish airspace last week.\nBut US and Australian aircraft fly over Syria without Syrian government approval, relying on the questionable legal justification of collective self-defence of Iraq.\nThe US also condemns the Russian bombing, saying the Russians have hit civilian targets.\nThis criticism lost much of its impact last week when US air strikes in Afghanistan hit a Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital, killing 12 staff members and 10 patients and demonstrating that civilians will always suffer in air attacks.\nThe challenge for the US is finding any Sunni group it can trust to seriously make a commitment to take on IS.\nThe sooner it comes to an accommodation with the Russians the better.\nIn addition to co-ordinating their air activities, both the US and Russia could work to slow the flow of fighters, funds and weapons – the US working to stem the flow from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Gulf states and Russia seeking to restrain Iran.\nFor decades now it seems the US has required a Middle Eastern demon. At various times the demon has been Libya's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, Iraq's Saddam and in the last year or two, Syria's Assad.\nThere are hints that the US administration is coming to accept that if there is to be any resolution to this crisis, it must deal with Assad.\nIt's about time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:18:04.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
