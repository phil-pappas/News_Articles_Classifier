Related Content Ethics complaints against Baldwin over firing dismissed \nThe videos were made in 2009 and 2013 when Schimel was Waukesha County district attorney. Democrats allege the videos show him making inappropriate comments and have sued to force their release. The state Justice Department maintains the videos would reveal prosecutors' strategies and violate victim privacy. \nThe 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled earlier this month that Schimel must release the videos. Online court records, however, indicate the court granted a DOJ request to stay the ruling on Wednesday. The agency asked the Supreme Court to take the case the same day. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
