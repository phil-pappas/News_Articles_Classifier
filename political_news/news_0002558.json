Ultimately, the goal of the AMU strategy is to ensure the continued effectiveness of antibiotics while providing continued confidence to consumers.\"\nAs farming practices continue to evolve, chicken farmers play a leading role in researching antimicrobial alternatives, through supporting cutting-edge research and innovation. The industry-wide AMU strategy was developed in tandem with all industry stakeholders. This includes the Animal Nutrition Association of Canada , the Canadian Hatchery Federation, the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers, the Canadian Poultry and Egg Processors Council, Turkey Farmers of Canada , and the Canadian Association of Poultry Veterinarians.\nThe biggest step in this strategy was eliminating the preventive use of Category I antibiotics - throughout the chicken sector. Category I antibiotics are those considered most important to human health, and as of May 15, 2014 , their preventive use was no longer permitted in the Canadian chicken sector.\nEliminating the preventive use of Category I antibiotics is one part of the larger AMU strategy. Other major components of the strategy include analyzing antimicrobial resistance, reviewing best management practices, ensuring effective controls of AMU in Canada , educating stakeholders, as well as researching and sourcing alternative products. To-date, the poultry sector has invested over $3.2 million through the Canadian Poultry Research council and nearly half of this research has been in areas related to antimicrobial use and alternatives.\nWe do all of these things to make sure that we are providing Canadians with safe, fresh, high-quality chickens so that they have confidence in the food they are buying for their families.\nFor more information on supply management, visit www.chickenfarmers.ca\nSOURCE Chicken Farmers of Canada\nImage with caption: \"Chicken Farmers of Canada (CNW Group/Chicken Farmers of Canada )\".
