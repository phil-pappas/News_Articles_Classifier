Monday, October 12, 2015 Aired 10/12/15 on KPBS Midday Edition . \nDoes California Coastal Commission Have Authority To Ban Breeding At SeaWorld? \nGUESTS: Transcript \nThe strings attached to a California Coastal Commission ruling last week may lead to the end of killer whale shows at SeaWorld San Diego. \nThe commission approved the parkâ€™s request to expand holding tanks for killer whales on Thursday, with the condition that SeaWorld halt its captive breeding program. By agreeing to the terms, SeaWorld may see the end of its killer whale shows since it has already stopped taking whales from the wild. \nWill the commission's decision to ban the breeding of orcas at SeaWorld become a complicated legal issue in court? SeaWorld has not yet said if it will sue to overturn the decision. \nSara Wan, a former Coastal Commission chair, and Carney Anne Nasser, legislative counsel for the Animal Legal Defense Fund discuss the commission's jurisdiction to ban breeding at SeaWorld Monday on Midday Edition.
