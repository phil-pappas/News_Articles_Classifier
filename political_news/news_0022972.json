Advertisement More by this Author \nGatundu South MP Moses Kuria has agreed to be a defence witness in the case against Deputy President William Ruto at the ICC. \nThis follows a request by Mr Ruto’s defence team during their meeting with the MP at Parliament Monday. \nMr Kuria met lawyers of Mr Ruto and his co-accused Mr Joshua Sang, after which the MP’s lawyer, Mr Danson Mungatana, said his client would be a defence witness. \n“Mr Kuria has formally agreed to be a defence witness in the case facing the Deputy President and Mr Sang in The Hague if so required, following a formal request by the defence side,” said Mr Mungatana. \nMr Kuria, who also spoke after the meeting with Mr Sang’s lawyers Katwa Kigen, Logan Hambrick and Philemon Koech, said his conscience was better after writing a statement on alleged witness coaching for the Waki commission. \nHe said he was also happy with Cord leader Raila Odinga, who has indicated willingness to give evidence on what he knew regarding Mr Kuria’s allegations that the MP was part of a scheme to procure witnesses for the commission. \nHowever, Mr Kuria has asked Mr Odinga not to make conditions for his testimony. \nWILLING TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE \nTo Mr Kuria, being interviewed by Mr Sang’s lawyer was a good chance for the matter of witness procuring to come to light. \nI only want it to be known that Mr Ruto and Mr Sang are innocent, he said. \nThe MP, who has been critical of Mr Odinga, pleaded with him to come forward and write a statement. \nHe went on to ask Mr Sang’s defence team to consider inviting the Cord leader to give evidence. \nMr Kuria said he spoke to Mr Odinga’s older brother, Dr Oburu Oginga, before his the interview with the lawyers. \nHe said Dr Oginga had assured him that Mr Odinga is willing to give evidence. “I hope he meant his words,” said Mr Kuria. \nJubilee MPs at the weekend criticised Mr Odinga for allowing his brother to give evidence. They said Mr Odinga should be the one giving evidence. \nThe latest exchanges between Jubilee and Cord regarding the cases was sparked by Mr Kuria’s claim that he was part of a scheme, together with Mr Odinga, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua and Kisumu Senator Anyang Nyong’o, to procure witnesses for the Waki and Kriegler commissions. \nRUDE SHOCK The Jubilee MPs have been holding a series of prayer meetings, over the ICC case. \nThe Waki report was used to charge six Kenyans at the ICC, including President Kenyatta, over crimes against humanity. \nHowever, Mr Ruto got a major blow when ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda admitted recanted witness statements as part of the evidence she would use against the Deputy President. \nCharges against President Kenyatta and three others have since been dropped. \nMr Kuria is also expected to record a statement with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations today (Tuesday) over his claims. \nICC prosecutors have also expressed interest in Mr Kuria’s revelations and are expected to interview him at Parliament precincts on Wednesday. \nOn Monday, Mr Mungatana was cagey about what was discussed during the three-hour interrogation, citing the confidentiality clause. \nHe only said the issues discussed were “sensitive”. Mr Kuria has in the past threatened to name the witnesses allegedly procured. \nHe also wants the ICC to state whether they used their evidence or not. \nIt also emerged that the Sang defence had been requested by Mr Kuria’s lawyer to attend the “question and answer” session with the ICC prosecutor tomorrow but they were yet to confirm attendance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:29:44.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
