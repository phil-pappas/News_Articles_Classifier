That’s because the open enrollment period for Medicare has arrived, and companies are vying for a share of the 55 million member market.\nFrom Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, Medicare beneficiaries have the opportunity to change their coverage and can choose from original Medicare (provided directly by the government) or Medicare Advantage (offered by private health insurance companies). In addition to switching their health care plan, beneficiaries can change Part D plans which provide prescription drug coverage.\nOpen enrollment occurs once a year, and for most people with Medicare, it’s their only chance to change plans. As you weigh your options, here are six things you should know.\nPart B Premiums May Be Increasing for Some People\nA report this month in the AARP Bulletin, based on data from the Medicare Boards of Trustees, finds 1 in 7 Medicare beneficiaries could see their Part B premiums increase as much as 52 percent next year.\nThe increase will go into effect if there is no cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security in 2016, but it will apply mainly to those already paying higher premiums because of their income and affect those who pay premiums directly to the government. Most people making direct payments are doing so because they are delaying Social Security benefits , a strategy that can increase their future monthly payments.\n“Should folks in the latter situation sign up for Social Security now?” asks Patricia Barry, a features editor for AARP Publications who wrote the AARP report and author of \"Medicare For Dummies.” Under the law, those who have their Part B premiums deducted from Social Security cannot be subject to a premium increase.\nBarry says applying for Social Security in October may allow people to save money on premiums in the short run but could cost them more in the future. “They might be giving up higher [Social Security] payments for the rest of their lives for the sake of what could well turn out to be just one year of inflated Part B premiums.”\nPay Special Attention to Your Part D Coverage\nAlthough it’s a smart idea to review your health insurance options each open enrollment period, experts say most plans stay largely the same each year. Instead, most people will find changes in Part D plans . “It’s something [consumers] want to check into every single year,” says Kristin Romel, a health and life agent with Alpine North Insurance Agency in Alpena, Michigan.\nRomel explains that many companies use a claims-based system for determining prescription drug costs and coverage. A medication for which they had a large number of claims may end up moving into a tier with higher copays. However, other insurers may not have had the same number of claims for those drugs, and the out-of-pocket costs for those prescriptions might remain lower in other plans.\nBarry’s research supports this finding. In the last few years, she has analyzed what different Part D plans in the same state charge as copays for the same drug. “Those copays vary enormously, often by more than $100 for a 30-day supply, and sometimes by a lot more,” she says.\nThe Network May Be More Important Than the Price\nThose shopping for a Medicare Advantage plan may gravitate toward the option with the lowest premium. However, there is more than price to consider.\n“Patients should be scrutinizing the providers [in a plan’s network],” says Colin LeClair, senior vice president of business and product development for ConcertoHealth, a health care provider for dual-eligible Medicare and Medicaid patients. “The quality of providers is far more important than cost.”\nWhile it may hard to gauge the quality of unknown physicians, Medicare beneficiaries should at least check a plan’s network to see if their preferred doctors and facilities participate. “You’ve got to be careful with little, fly-by-night companies,” Romel says. “Are hospitals actually going to take that insurance?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:19:00.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
