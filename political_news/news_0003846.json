All three occupants were well and uninjured. The dingy had been missing since Tuesday morning New Zealand time. \nAir Component Commander Air Commodore (AIRCDRE) Kevin McEvoy said the Air Force received a request for help from the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre after local resources in Tokelau had been exhausted searching for the missing four-metre dinghy. \n“The Orion left Whenuapai on Wednesday morning and the crew conducted an extensive radar search of the area north of Samoa. The dinghy was located after several hours of searching. It was an excellent result. \n“Once the dinghy was located the crew remained overhead until they needed to go to Samoa for refuelling. They then got airborne again and directed the surface rescue vessel, a local barge, to the correct coordinates and remained overhead until the vessel arrived. Due to the lack of emergency equipment on board the dinghy, and the difficulty of seeing it in the dark, the Orion’s contribution was an essential part of the successful rescue,” said AIRCDRE McEvoy. \nThe three men in the dinghy were taken on board the rescue vessel and returned to Atafu atoll. \nThis is the second South Pacific emergency the Air Force has responded to in the past 48 hours. On Tuesday a P-3K2 Orion located Tongan fishing vessel Pacific Sunrise, which had issued a distress signal due to no power and flat batteries on board. The Orion successfully dropped a spare VHF radio to the vessel enabling the crew to re-establish essential communication and coordinate a rendezvous with another vessel. \nTo date this year a P-3K2 Orion has responded to 11 search and rescue emergencies involving 100 hours of flying time. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:23:24.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
