Brewmaster and owner Phil Hoechst just released his hoppiest beer yet, a double IPA called Magic Dragon. \nWhat is it? Magic Dragon from Hop Haus Brewing Company of Verona. \nStyle: The Imperial India Pale Ale (IIPA), also called a double IPA, has deep golden to reddish-amber color and medium- to full-bodied mouthfeel. It's known for a strong hop profile with resiny, piney and/or citrus tones depending upon the type of hops in the recipe. There should be some maltiness, which adds a spicy-warm complexity to the flavor and strength of 7.5%-10% ABV. \nBackground: “We’re still playing around to see what people like and what sells,” says Hoechst. The Hop Haus opened last July , and so far, its best seller has been a hoppy IPA called Super Big Time, with an estimated 70 IBUs and 6.6% ABV. But its recently released Magic Dragon is “the hoppiest beer we’ve made so far,” says Hoechst. No kidding; the recipe calls for 10 pounds of hops in a three-barrel batch. \nHoechst uses four varieties of hops: Citra, Mosaic, Columbus and Equinox. All four go into five rounds of dry hopping that helps produce the beer’s potent aroma. However, it’s the Equinox that seems to have the most to say in the flavor. It’s a new hop with strong citrus and tropical qualities. \nNanobreweries like Hop Haus can be more inventive with their hop selections because they make smaller batches that tend to turn over pretty fast. So hoppy beers can be served as fresh as possible (important, before they sit around and mellow). I found Magic Dragon early in its tapping, and the aroma and flavor were intense. The downside with nanobreweries is the brewer may have trouble keeping up with demand for popular beers. Hop Haus may run out of this batch, but Hoechst will be making more. \nMagic Dragon finishes at 8.2% ABV and an estimated 90 IBUs. It’s available in the brewpub for $5.25/10-ounce glass, $10/32-ounce growler (refill), and $16/64-ounce growler (refill). \nTasting notes: \nAroma: Assertive hop aroma with solid grapefruit fruitiness. \nAppearance: Vivid copper color with a slight haziness. A medium soft white head. \nTexture : Medium- to full-bodied, and a subtle softness. \nTaste: Citrus hoppiness; the grapefruit and mango come in early and never leave. \nFinish/Aftertaste: The tropical hoppiness carries through to the end. Not a huge lingering hop flavor or bitterness, but it certainly doesn’t go away quietly. Overall, the selection of hops and the spicy-warmth of the beer’s alcoholic strength blend very well. \nGlassware: Hop Haus serves Magic Dragon in a 10 ounce tulip-snifter, which is a great way to get a sense of this beer’s assertive aroma. The snifter also encourages slow enjoyment and sipping, good with strong beers like this one. \nPairs well with: With such solid hoppiness, Magic Dragon is nice with spicy dishes. I like double IPAs with Cajun and Indian dishes. For cheeses, try it with Stilton, sharp cheddar or blue. \nThe Verdict: While I enjoy the brewery’s Super Big Time, Magic Dragon has a more assertive hop personality and is my preference in a side-by-side comparison. There’s solid tropical aroma with fresh, crisp hints of mango and grapefruit. By the way, if you need another reason to visit, Hop Haus will be having an Oktoberfest party on Oct. 24 beginning at 6:30 p.m. with Oktoberfest beer, music and door prizes.
