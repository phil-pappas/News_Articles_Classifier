If not, I am going to ask you to leave.” \nThe crowd members only chanted louder, however, NBC News reported. \n“Black lives, they matter here,” the group chanted. \nGarcetti, meanwhile, was rushed from the building, surrounded by Los Angeles Police Department officers. \nProtesters blocked his car and one even ran across the hood. \n“No justice, no peace. No racist police,” the activists shouted, the news outlet reported. \nThe activists said they only wanted to communicate their needs to the mayor. \n“White Girl Bleed A Lot”: Get the book that documents racial violence in America, with hundreds of episodes in more than 80 American cities since 2010, where groups of blacks are assaulting, intimidating, stalking, threatening, shooting, stabbing and killing victims. \nThe mayor’s office, meanwhile, responded to the chaos with this statement, reported by NBC News: “We had hundreds of South LA residents attend a community meeting, leaders, business owners, mothers and children, who took time out of their evening to discuss the critical issues that matter most to all of us. I am disappointed that our conversation was cut short when there is so much work for us to do together to make our neighborhoods stronger and safer. I believe in our city and my commitment to our shared concerns continues, stronger than ever.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:55:47.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
