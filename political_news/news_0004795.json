David Cameron has promised a nationwide referendum on the UK's membership of the EU by the end of 2017\nThe likely question is: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" The prime minister has promised to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU beforehand, and says he wants the UK to stay in a reformed union Campaigns have recently been launched on both sides of the argument Q&A: UK's planned EU referendum\nThe December meeting of the European Council could be a chance for Mr Cameron's key demands to be considered by his EU counterparts.\nIn the meantime, talks have been taking place between UK and EU negotiating teams, with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker saying on Wednesday that \"huge progress\" was not being made, and reminding the UK \"it takes two to tango\".\nBBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris said those involved in the \"technical talks\" accepted they had \"got as far as they can\" and that the negotiations needed to \"move onto the political level\".\n'Non-negotiable' The referendum has been promised by the end of 2017, but could be held sooner.\nMr Cameron has not set out his demands in detail, but is thought to want exemption from an \"ever-closer union\", safeguards for non eurozone countries and curbs on migrants' welfare entitlement.\nSpeaking at a press briefing with Mr Juncker shortly before Mr Cameron's arrival, Mr Schulz said: \"Both of us have made it quite clear that both the Commission and the European Parliament at all stages are willing to engage in constructive co-operation.\"\nHe said he hoped for \"steps forward\", adding: \"Above all, we need clarity on what we are going to be discussing over the next few months.\"\nMs Merkel said it was up to the UK to \"clarify the substance of what it is envisaging\" in the coming weeks.\nShe said Germany would work constructively with the British government.\nShe added: \"But it also goes without saying that there are things that are non-negotiable.\n\"That there are achievements of European integration that cannot be haggled over, for example the principle of free movement and the principle of non-discrimination.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4974/production/_86140881_de21.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:03:45.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
