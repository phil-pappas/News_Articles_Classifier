I’ll crash Sam George and defeat him. The battle is ours and we’ll win come election 2016,” the former Works and Housing Minister told Accra-based Joy FM later in an interview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:28:26.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
