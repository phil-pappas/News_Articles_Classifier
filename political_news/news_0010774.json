Clinton received on Aug. 3, 2011, at least five messages that appear to contain virus-laden attachments. They were disguised as speeding tickets. It is unclear if she clicked on them, which would have escalated the security risk and potentially allowed hackers not only to gain access to all of the server’s contents but also to use Clinton’s email to send targeted malware to other top officials, experts say.\nComputer security analysts at the time said that round of scam messages, which were broadly disseminated to the public, appeared to be from Russia.\nThe discovery is sure to incite further criticism of Clinton’s controversial use of a personal, rather than state.gov, email address while acting as America's top diplomat.\nCyber experts tell POLITICO that the fact the phishing email got through, not once but multiple times, demonstrates vulnerabilities in the server’s security, further suggesting Clinton’s email was less secure than if she’d used a government account.\n“One would hope a government agency with proper resources and staffing could ensure a server was more locked down,” said Jake Kouns, chief security officer at Risk Based Security.\nClinton worried about Fox media storm over 'mother' and 'father' passport issue By Nick Gass\nClinton has repeatedly insisted she has no indication that her account was breached, risking the possibility that sensitive information would fall into the wrong hands.\n\"“There’s no evidence of that,” Clinton told CNN earlier this month.\nClinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill maintained that stance Wednesday when asked about the five suspicious messages, which he dismissed as \"spam\"\n“We have no evidence to suggest she replied to this email nor that she clicked on the attachment,” Merrill said. “As we have said before, there is no evidence that the system was ever breached. All these emails show is that, like millions of other Americans, she received spam.\"\nStill, the controversy over her use of a personal server and her decision to erase some of the emails before turning over others to the State Department has hurt the 2016 Democratic front-runner in the polls and triggered an FBI probe into whether classified information was put at risk.\nClinton's Republican critics have seized on the fact that troves of email released as part of a Freedom of Information lawsuit contain hundreds of messages now deemed to include classified material. Intelligence agencies contend that at least two of the messages were so sensitive they should have been marked \"top secret,\" although the State Department disputes that.\nClinton’s email woes deepen as classified messages pile up By Josh Gerstein and Nick Gass\nAnother email released Wednesday suggests that even before the August 2011 phishing scam bombarded her inbox, Clinton was aware of hacking problems with personal email accounts. In a June 4, 2011, email chain, Clinton, then secretary of state, her chief of staff Cheryl Mills, and top aides Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Anne-Marie Slaughter, discussed the vulnerabilities of personal email use among State employees.\nUnder a subject line “Google email hacking and woeful state of civilian technology,” Slaughter, who had left the State Department a few months earlier, encouraged the group to tell Congress that State’s “antiquated” technology caused State employees to ditch department systems and rely on their personal accounts.\n“NO ONE uses a State-issued laptop and even high officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly,” she wrote, suggesting they use that argument to make the case for more State technology funding in the budget. State budget cuts, she said, would “make matters much much worse.”\nBut Mills cautioned against broadcasting that fact, saying it could incite more hacking.\n“As someone who attempted to be hacked (yes I was one), I am not sure we want to telegraph how much folks do or don’t do off state mail [because] it may encourage others who are out there,” Mills wrote back.\nThe exchange came days after Google announced that numerous users of its Gmail service had their accounts compromised by hackers believed to be working with the Chinese government.\nA Google executive said at the time that the attack focused on the “personal Gmail accounts of hundreds of users including, among others, senior U.S. government officials, Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian countries (predominantly South Korea), military personnel and journalists.”\nAbout three weeks later, the State Department issued an agency-wide cable warning employees and their families to take precautions with their personal email accounts and avoid using them to handle official matters.\n“Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts,” the cable said. The message also cited a department regulation that says State’s “general policy [is] that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized” computer system.\nThe 11 must-read Hillary Clinton emails By Nick Gass\nRepublicans have argued that by using a private email system Clinton ignored the advice her department was giving to others in the wake of the Gmail hacks.\nThe Republican National Committee pounced on the chain of emails released Wednesday, arguing that the messages suggest Clinton and her staff were well aware of the threats to their use of personal email systems.\n“This stunning admission undercuts a key claim that Clinton and her allies have repeatedly asserted: that Hillary Clinton’s server was somehow more secure than the government email system and posed no risk to national security,” wrote spokesman Raj Shah in a blast to reporters. “What the email chain shows is that Clinton and her senior aides knew very well that her use of a private email presented, what NSA Director Mike Rodgers recently called a foreign intelligence ‘opportunity’ for America’s adversaries, and would be the target of foreign hackers.”\nThe phishing email came from a \".gov\" account, making it look official. The ticket said she owed the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles for speeding \"over 55.\" The instructions told her to click on the attachment to plead and send it to a certain courthouse.\nIt’s unclear if the hacking group that attacked Clinton knew who she was. Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, however, said that given the myriad Chinese and Russian intrusions into government email systems, it’s highly likely that both nations’ intelligence agencies knew Clinton’s email address. Chinese hackers in particular might design a broader phishing attack, he said, so that the specific attack against Clinton looked innocuous.\n“They’re all about the thousand grains of sand approach,” Kellermann said. “They’ll throw the kitchen sink at a target and see if something gets through.\"\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2015/03/05/state-department-cable-june-28-2011/"], "published": "2015-09-30T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:50:12.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
