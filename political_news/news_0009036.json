The anthrax attacks had begun on Sept. 18, one week after the 9/11 attacks, when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices. All in all, they killed five people and infected 17 others. The FBI said the ensuing investigation became “one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement.”\nThe anthrax crisis spread to Capitol Hill on Oct. 15 when staff members working in the office of Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the majority leader, opened a letter in the Hart Office Building laced with anthrax. Public health officials ordered an “environmental sampling” of the Capitol to determine if the bacteria had spread beyond its initial discovery. A machine used to sort mail in the Ford House Office Building — where, at the time, nearly every piece of mail sent to the House passed through — returned a positive sample.\nDuring the sweep, three offices in the Longworth House Office Building also tested positive for traces of anthrax. The House went into recess on Oct. 17 and planned to stay out until Oct. 23 while the testing proceeded.\nHouse leaders had initially been criticized for their decision to recess early while the Senate remained in session. But the dangerous situation in the Ford building confirmed the wisdom of their decision. Over the next few weeks, the Environmental Protection Agency supervised the laborious decontamination process. The House Longworth Building reopened on Nov. 5 and the Ford building reopened the following day. A decontaminated Hart Office Building reopened on Jan. 22, 2002.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n2\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:15:26.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
