(AP Photo/Andy Wong)\nAssociated Press Oct. 26, 2015 | 4:53 a.m. EDT + More By JOE McDONALD, AP Business Writer\nBEIJING (AP) â€” Facing pressure to pep up a cooling economy, Chinese leaders met Monday to craft a new long-range blueprint to guide development through the end of this decade.\nThe Communist Party's five-year plan is a throwback to the era of central planning but still plays a key role, allowing the ruling party to highlight its goals and planned policy shifts.\nParty leaders are expected to use the 2016-2020 plan to renew their commitment to a marathon effort to shift China from reliance on trade and investment to more self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption.\nAnalysts say the urgency for that change has increased following a deeper-than-expected decline in economic growth and this year's boom and bust in stock prices.\nEconomic growth slowed to a six-year low of 6.9 percent in the latest quarter, fueling concern about a possible rise in job losses and social tension. Some analysts say official figures overstate growth and the true rate might be as low as 4 percent.\nCommunist leaders say they will accept growth below their official target of \"about 7 percent\" so long as the economy generates enough new jobs.\n\"We never said we would defend a certain point to the death, but instead let the economy run within a reasonable range,\" said the top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, at a weekend gathering of officials, according to a summary on the Cabinet's website.\nBank of America and other forecasters say they expect the 2016-2020 plan to lower the official growth target to 6.5 percent or less.\nAnalysts also expect the upcoming plan to increase the ruling party's focus on environmental and social goals including raising household incomes and encouraging more use of renewable energy.\nReform advocates say the party needs to move faster on carrying out pledges to give entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role. That will require cutting back the monopolies and other privileges of state companies that dominate industries from oil to banking to telecoms.\nAn outline for state industry reform issued in September promises to make government companies more efficient by forcing them to face more free-market competition while retaining the party's dominance in the economy.\nBut rather than reducing the party's role, that plan says Beijing will \"strengthen party leadership\" of state companies.\nReform advocates criticized the September plan as inadequate because it fails to address issues including curtailing monopolies and access to low-cost credit, land and other resources.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
