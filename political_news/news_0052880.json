Courtesy of ABC News 24.\nPT3M17S 620 349 The man reportedly tipped to become Australia's next Chief Scientist lives in a house entirely powered by renewable energy and believes that everyone will eventually drive an electric car like him.\nDr Alan Finkel is expected to be appointed by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday to replace Chief Scientist Professor Ian Chubb whose four year-plus term ends in December.\nMr Turnbull has remained tight-lipped on what specific role science will take beyond the word \"central\" in his government's national agenda.\nDr Alan Finkel is tipped to become Australia's new Chief Scientist. Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nIt is understood that the selection process for the position closed as advertised by then Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane on July 17, and was not re-opened even when Mr Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott last month.\nAdvertisement One person who missed out on the role but was short-listed among the final handful of candidates was only informed of the decision about 10 days ago.\n\"[The process has] really come down to the end, post-this PM,\" a source said.\nIn stark contrast to the climate-denialist image that plagued the Abbott government, Dr Finkel, the outgoing chancellor of Monash University, has publicly advocated for nuclear power and electric cars to help reduce Australia's carbon emissions in the fight against global warming.\nIn an essay this year in Cosmos , a magazine he co-founded, Dr Finkel revealed that the electricity in his home was \"100 per cent green\", from either wind farm or solar energy sources.\nElectric cars were the \"transport technology of the future\", the engineer and entrepreneur wrote in the science magazine.\n\"One day, everyone's driving could be close to emissions-free, like mine is. The more of us who buy electric cars and power them with green electricity the faster that day will come.\"\nSimon McKeon, who will succeed Dr Finkel at Monash University, said his choice as new Chief Scientist would be \"fabulous\".\n\"There's no doubt he has done his level-best for the promotion of science in this country,\" he said. \"We do need a good communicator, not just a good adviser on science.\"\nAs Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel could also be expected to speak out more on climate change, Mr McKeon, a former CSIRO chairman, said.\n\"We're in a different era now. We're not as intimidated by what I'm going to call unfortunate comments about science by non-scientists.\"\nDr Finkel has also argued that nuclear power should be considered an alternative energy source, with solar and wind failing to meet the growth in global demand for electricity if fossil fuels had to be avoided. \"Nuclear electricity should be considered as a zero-emissions contributor to the energy mix,\" he has said.\nMr McKeon said if Dr Finkel were appointed as Chief Scientist, he would also continue to speak publicly on nuclear science because it was important to keep all options open in the move to a low-carbon world that is needed to avoid dangerous climate change.\n\"He's saying, 'Let's never just close our minds to something that's not palatable to some'.\"\nDr Finkel, previously a neuroscience research fellow, also established Axon Instruments, a company which supplies tools for cellular neuroscience and drug discovery which was later bought by a US firm and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.\nMr McKeon said that one notable failure among Dr Finkel's CV of successes, his time as chief technology officer at Better Place, would one day be viewed more favourably.\n\"Better Place will just be shown as a company that was ahead of its time,\" he said. \"Science is all about risk.\"\nBetter Place aimed to supply battery-switching services to what was expected to be a mass roll-out of electric vehicles. It filed for bankruptcy in Israel in 2013 after burning through $US850 million (then worth about $885 million) in private funds.\nEvan Thornley, who was chief executive of Better Place and also listed Australia's first high-technology venture on the US NASDAQ exchange, said Dr Finkel would be \"an inspired choice for Chief Scientist\".\n\"It is a rare breed to have someone who is a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur, but has also played such a significant role in academia, been elected by his peers as Australia's pre-eminent engineer, and is first and foremost a lover and champion of science,\" Mr Thornley said.\n\"Having worked together to try to build a national electric car charge network based solely on renewable energy, I know how passionate Alan is about climate change and finding economically attractive ways to reduce emissions.\n\"Such an appointment would be a great signal that the Turnbull government is serious about science, both in the classroom, the lab, but also in the fast-moving real world of technology entrepreneurship and its key economic and environmental role.\"\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:24:43.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
