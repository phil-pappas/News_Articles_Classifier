A 10cm rise in the sea increases major flooding events by a factor of three. Three decades of small levels of sea level rise means New Zealand could experience a major flooding event every two weeks. \n\"We have a duty to protect our children’s future. National is failing to make the worst polluters responsible for the mess they’re creating for our kids and future generations,\" said Mr Shaw. \n\"The Green Party has put forward an alternative, achievable emissions reduction target that we can take to Paris to help secure a better future for us and our children. \n\"I’m want to sit down with National and Labour to achieve a cross party consensus on the climate as it’s the only meaningful and enduring way we can stop the damage we’re doing to the climate,\" Mr Shaw said. \nNew Zealand’s current climate target is insufficient: \nhttp://climateactiontracker.org/countries/developed/newzealand.html \nYes we can!
