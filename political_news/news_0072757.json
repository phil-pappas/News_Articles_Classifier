The regulator would also be able to impose conditions on firms where there are concerns relating to serious or systemic conduct.\nMr Turnbull said the government's agenda would strengthen the accountability and capabilities of APRA, ASIC and the Payments System Board.\n\"Strong and accountable regulators underpin the smooth operation of the financial system,\" he said.\n\"We will be further informed by the findings of the ASIC capability review.\"\nThe government agreed with the Murray inquiry's view that the regulator accountability framework needs strengthening, but did not support the creation of a new Financial Regulator Assessment Board.\nThe government also backed periodic reviews of competition in the financial sector, and a broader focus on competition as part of ASIC's mandate.\n\"We will task the Productivity Commission to review the state of competition in the financial system by the end of 2017, three years after the completion of the inquiry.,\" it said.\nLater periodic reviews are also proposed.\nThe government said it supports the inclusion of competition in ASIC’s mandate and that it will develop legislation to make that explicit in the second half of 2016.\n\"We will also be clear in the statements of expectations that regulators should explain in each annual report how they have balanced competition with other elements of their mandates.\"\nThe government also said it was committed to developing a framework to facilitate crowd-sourced equity funding through next year's budget.\n\"The Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer will consult on draft legislation to implement this framework by the end of 2015,\" the report said.\n\"The government will consult the community on crowd-sourced debt funding in parallel with legislation to implement crowd-sourced equity funding.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:07:21.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
