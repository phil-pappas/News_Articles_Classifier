By Ben Sutherly The Columbus Dispatch • Monday October 26, 2015 5:33 AM \nAn injury at age 5 cost Jadon Wade his ability to talk or move his arms and legs, but not his infectious laugh. \nJadon delights in “knock-knock” jokes. Now 12, he’s happiest swinging in a hammock alongside his grandmother and legal guardian, Nancy Richardson, at their Delaware home. \nBut if the Ohio Department of Medicaid follows through with its plan to stop funding 68 hours of nursing care for Jadon each week at home, Richardson fears that her grandson might have to move to an institution. \nRichardson, a full-time hospice nurse, said she is her family’s sole breadwinner. In addition to Jadon’s mother, who no longer lives in Ohio, her children include a son in college and a daughter in high school who also help care for Jadon. >> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

She doubts that an aide — who would cost Ohio Medicaid far less than a nurse — has sufficient training to meet his needs. \n“His health is at stake,” Richardson said. “He’s suffered enough.” \nThese are uncertain times for many medically fragile Ohioans and their families who rely on nursing services through the state’s Medicaid program. \n“We’ve heard from many families across the state that nursing services are being reduced or eliminated altogether,” said Kevin Truitt, an attorney with Disability Rights Ohio. \nIt’s unclear how many people might be affected statewide, but state officials insist there’s been no policy change when it comes to private-duty nursing care — in-home skilled nursing provided to Medicaid enrollees who need more extensive health-care services. \nAccording to the Ohio Department of Medicaid, 2,591 Ohioans received private-duty nursing care through Medicaid during the state fiscal year that ended on June 30. \nAt least seven individuals in Delaware County have been affected by a proposed reduction or elimination of their nursing services in recent months, with the potential of 40 families to be affected countywide once the state takes over reviews of their care needs from the local county board, said Melinda Draper, Medicaid-waiver coordinator with the county Board of Developmental Disabilities. \n“There definitely have been changes,” Draper said. \nThe Ohio Association of County Boards of Developmental Disabilities has heard reports from some counties of reductions in nursing services and is looking into the matter to see if it’s a statewide trend, according to a spokesman. \nThe Franklin County Board of Developmental Disabilities has heard some concerns about the availability of nursing services, but it’s too early to know how pervasive the concerns are, said Jed Morison, the board’s superintendent. \nState officials say only the rates paid for those nursing services have been changed. No other policy changes have been made to private-duty nursing policy, spokesman Sam Rossi said in a prepared statement. \n“On a case-by-case basis, an individual’s service authorization may change in accordance with changes in their level-of-care needs,” Rossi said. \n“In all cases, however, the Ohio Department of Medicaid remains committed to ensuring that individuals served in the home and community are provided with a series of health-care options to address their daily needs.” \nWhen asked whether Ohio Medicaid has taken a stricter stance recently in authorizing access to private-duty nursing services, Rossi replied, “No.” \nAt a meeting this month in Lewis Center that drew 50 to 60 people, families also expressed frustration that the Medicaid appeals process is stacked against families and often based on faulty information. \nVirginia Fitzpatrick of Sunbury said her 12-year-old daughter, Julia Tice, has Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that often worsens with time. \nJulia, who is prone to seizures and has a stomach feeding tube, receives 36 to 46 hours of skilled nursing care per week. State Medicaid officials in May notified Fitzpatrick that the services would be significantly cut back, and that future nursing care would be available only if a family representative was present. \nThe family appealed, claiming in part that much of the information on which the state based its decision was incorrect. For example, Fitzpatrick said, Julia’s age was listed as 16 instead of 12. A report also stated she was fed through the mouth instead of the stomach. \nWhen Julia’s feeding tube was inserted several years ago, the family was told that Julia would thereafter require skilled nursing services, Fitzpatrick said. For example, if Julia’s feeding tube comes out, it must be reinserted within an hour to keep the opening from closing up, she said. \nA nurse could reattach the tube in the home, but a home health aide would have to have Julia transported to a hospital, she said. \nAfter calling Gov. John Kasich’s office, the family received a letter from the Ohio Department of Medicaid indicating that Julia’s services will remain in place until an alternative solution is found. \nOhio Medicaid said individuals and their families filed 11 appeals of changes in private-duty nursing services in the third quarter of this year, nine in the second quarter and seven in the first quarter. \nOf the 19 cases in which appeals were actually held, Ohio Medicaid’s original decision was upheld in 16 of them. \nState Medicaid officials might in some cases have some legitimate reasons for switching Medicaid enrollees from skilled-nursing services to another kind of care, said Gary Tonks, executive director of Arc of Ohio, which advocates for the developmentally disabled. \nBut after years of being told that their loved ones need skilled nursing services, families are understandably skeptical, he said, adding that state officials are not effectively communicating the rationale for their decisions or what alternatives might exist. \n“Tell us why you’re doing it and what you’re going to replace it with,” Tonks said. \nIt’s important to make sure money is spent appropriately, said state Rep. Andrew Brenner, a Republican from Powell, but “it seems like some of these people are falling between the cracks here. \n“You’re going to see a lot of parents potentially have to give up their full-time jobs or part-time jobs to take care of their kids,” he added. “We can’t add an economic hardship on somebody on top of everything else that they’re dealing with.” \nFamilies who want to appeal Ohio Medicaid’s proposed reduction in nursing care should do so within 15 days if they want to maintain the higher level of care until a decision on their appeal is made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:09:07.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
