The network spoke to Mackie (who is best known as Falcon in the \"Captain America\" films as well as \"Ant-Man\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\") about his new film, \"Our Brand is Crisis,\" which stars Sandra Bullock as a political consultant who is hired to help a presidential campaign in Bolivia. Mackie was asked about Donald Trump's candidacy and said, theoretically, he would be \"100%\" in favor of running that campaign. \"I mean, first that'll be the best party ever when he won, and second, Trump's an easy sell ... When you look at Trump, he's an easy sell because you can sell him as the guy who worked his way up from nothing. And I think if you're a 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps' candidate, people would identify with that,\" he said. He said he was \"on the bandwagon\" after being asked if that was an endorsement.

Anthony Mackie just lost any amount of FINE he had. That dude just said he'd \"run Trump's campaign. 100%.\" I can't. — Awesomely Luvvie (@Luvvie) October 19, 2015 Mackie tweeted late Monday afternoon that the whole thing was a \"bad attempt at a joke,\" so that's one less Avenger on whose support Trump can count on. Sorry Donald, that wasn't an endorsement. Just a bad attempt at a joke, I guess?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:33:55.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
