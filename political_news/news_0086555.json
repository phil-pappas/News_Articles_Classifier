The survey shows that the average hourly rate for women is still 14 percent lower than that of men. \n\"The totally unchanged pay gap is a slap in the face for women, families and the economy,\" says Coalition spokesperson, Angela McLeod. Even worse, MÄori and Pacific women face an outrageous pay gap of 28% and 33% when compared with the pay packets of PÄkehÄ men. We are failing not only these women but their whole families and communities. This costs us all in the long-run. \n\"There are key areas of action the Government knows they can take to reduce the gender pay gap, but they would rather hide behind the excuse that it’s too complicated. ‘We’re working on it’ doesn’t wash any more, women are sick of waiting patiently for equal pay. In the last few weeks we have seen midwives announce court action, as has the union for school support workers, the New Zealand Education Institute. \n\"Increasing the pay of women in undervalued jobs like caregiving and school support work is one way to substantially improve the gender pay gap. There is a ground-swell of support now for workers to be paid for the work they do, and to end the historical under-valuing of women’s jobs. \n\"Today’s women don’t buy the old excuses about why their work is worth less. They just want an end to the discrimination.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:15:27.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
