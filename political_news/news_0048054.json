The resignation of such a senior figure following serious allegations should be a long overdue wakeup call to the Minister. \n\"Cantabrians deserve to have confidence that EQC is operating above board, and certainty that their claims will be resolved quickly. \n\"I hope the Minister will take swift action to restore public confidence that claims at EQC are handled well, and this should include an independent inquiry,\" says Megan Woods. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:02:09.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
