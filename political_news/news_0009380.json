Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who took a pass on running despite entreaties for her to jump into the primary race. \nClinton tried to walk a careful line: \"It is our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn't run amok.\" \nSIGN UP for the free Essential Politics newsletter >> \nRebuilding the Obama coalition \nFrom a shout-out to the importance of \"Black Lives Matter\" to an expansive push for immigration reforms, the Democrats tried to capitalize on the problems Donald Trump has created for the GOP with his harsh rhetoric toward immigrants and others. \nIt remains to be seen whether the Democrats can rebuild President Obama's winning coalition of white and minority voters. But they are trying. \nPerhaps most notable was the overt courtship of Latino voters, a voting bloc that, if big numbers turn out, can sway elections in some key states, including Nevada. \nBoth Clinton and O'Malley promised to \"go further\" than Obama's immigration executive actions -- a sea change from just four years ago when immigration languished as an issue. \nThe also-rans solidify their status as also-rans \nThe debate had long been billed as a match-up between Clinton and Sanders, and the three other candidates solidified their standing as the other three. \nO'Malley appeared unable to ignite and engage in a way that could boost his dismal poll numbers, despite a resume as a former mayor and governor, or his repeated attempts to one-up Clinton. \nFormer Sens. Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee seemed to be struggling to keep up with the conversation. \n\"Anderson, can I get into this discussion at some point?\" Webb asked of moderator Anderson Cooper. \nChafee, the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, boasted in his opening that one of his best qualifications, after serving as mayor, senator and governor, was that \"I have had no scandals.\" \nThe smallness of their campaigns accrued to Clinton. \nBiden continues to hover \nEven without Joe Biden onstage, the potential that the vice president will jump in the race remains a wild card. \nBiden made a cameo during Obama's recorded introduction with gauzy nostalgia for an era not quite yet done. \nBut as he watched from home at the Naval Observatory, it might have been that Biden's moment to join the stage had passed. \nFor the latest from Congress and 2016 campaign follow @LisaMascaro \nFor more, go to www.latimes.com/politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:49:45.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
