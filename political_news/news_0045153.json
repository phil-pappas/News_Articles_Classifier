By changing these properties in the gel to match the various healthy and diseased states, researchers are able to study breast cancer pathology in a relevant human breast tissue environment.\nNot only are animal experiments unreliable , they are also painful and deadly for the animals who are treated as disposable laboratory equipment. In cancer experiments, mice, rats, and other animals are made to grow painful, cancerous tumors all over their bodies before being killed and dissected.\nWhat You Can Do\nMake your breast cancer donation dollars count by giving them to charities that only fund modern, reliable, non-animal breast cancer research, such as the Avon Foundation for Women and the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation .", "external_links": ["http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-experimentation/animal-testing-bad-science/", "http://www.avonfoundation.org/", "http://www.drsusanloveresearch.org/", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/149/607_602x333_595305852_555x307.jpg", "http://phys.org/news/2015-10-gel-mimics-human-breast-cancer.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:17:13.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
