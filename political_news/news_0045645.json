At a time when the UN can consider that perhaps the Kotel HaMa’aravi (Western Wall) is not Jewish or that Jews defending themselves against knife attacks are called aggressors, the statement of the Polish Episcopate is that much more significant and important. May all of Poland and the world hear the clear and moral voice of the Polish Episcopate.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:06:44.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
