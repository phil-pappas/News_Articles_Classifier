It would eliminate mandatory life sentences for three-time, nonviolent drug offenders, reducing those minimum sentences to 25 years.\nThe federal prison population has exploded since 1980, in part because of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Yates said the current system is costly, affects families and contributes to loss of confidence in the justice system.\nHouse lawmakers have introduced similar legislation.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:36:12.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
