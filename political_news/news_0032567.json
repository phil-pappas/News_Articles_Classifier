CBS reports that Sanders said: \"We should not be the country that has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and more wealth and income inequality than any other country,\" As even CBS notes, according to UNICEF, which is probably the source of Sanders's factoid, the US has lower childhood poverty rates than Greece, Spain, Mexico, Latvia, and Israel, all of which are OECD countries or regarded as peer countries. The US rate (32.2 percent) is also more or less equal to the rate in Turkey, Romania, Lithuania, and Iceland. See page 8 of this report. So, while Sanders probably doesn't even know what he means by \"major country\" it's clear that the US is not an outlier among OECD-type countries, even by UNICEF's own analysis. We get much more insight, though, once we have a look at what UNICEF means by \"poverty rate.\" In this case, UNICEF (and many other organizations) measure the poverty rate as a percentage of the national median household income. UNICEF uses 60% of median as the cut off. So, if you're in Portugal, and your household earns under 60% of the median income in Portugal, you are poor. If you are in the US and you earn under 60% of the US median income, then you are also poor. None of the named nations can be considered a peer of the US. The standard, under 60% of the median income, was applied to all the OCED and \"peer\" nations. However, the number of poor people derived from applying that standard does not mean all those people are AT 60% of the median income.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:28:37.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
