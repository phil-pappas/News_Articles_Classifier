Instead he retreated here, to his comfort zone — Cirque du Soleil’s Mystère Theatre at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on the strip — and put on a show.\nTrump mixed in his signature wisecracks and insults with a hefty dose of audience participation, asking supporters to call out the names of countries taking advantage of the United States and inviting a woman with a fire-red dye job to stand and be recognized, as he gushed, “I wish I had that hair.”\nAt one point, as Trump complained about the appearance of his nose on a recent People Magazine cover, a woman seated in the front row waved a copy of the magazine.\nTrump pulled the woman, who identified herself as Hispanic, on stage, and the crowd of 1,600 cheered as she proclaimed her support for the Republican pack leader.\n“Is this a set-up? Did I ever meet you before?” said Trump. “I never met her before. I swear.” (He did not then proceed to saw her in half.)\nThough Trump’s candidacy has thrived on conflict, he pulled out of the Hispanic Chamber event last Friday, a day after POLITICO reported on the tough line of questioning the group’s leaders had planned for him there, and announced plans for a rally here.\nRedState founder Erickson: Trump's tweet false, 'defamatory' By Eliza Collins\n“The risk of another Jorge Ramos moment is too great and the reward for successfully navigating the event is too small,” explained Bruce Haynes, co-founder of Purple Strategies. “He’s trying to assemble a broad-based populist coalition of voters with a direct appeal to specific, visceral economic and cultural concerns.”\nTo do that, Trump came to his home away from home.\nTreasure Island, owned by Trump’s friend and business partner Phil Ruffin, is practically a Trump biosphere. It's separated by just a parking lot and a mall from Trump International Hotel and Tower, where tourists can buy a rhinestone-studded “Trump Las Vegas” denim jacket (made in Bengladesh), Trump Signature Collection ties (made in China), Trump International Hotel golfs shirts (made in Vietnam), Trump candles (made in China), Trump Signature Collection dress shirts (made in Bangladesh), and several styles of Ivanka Trump high-heeled shoes (made in China.) The Trump-branded cologne, “Success,” is made in the United States.\nThe candidate visited his namesake property before the event, calling it the “tallest/most beautiful building in town” in a tweet . The tower is the fourth-tallest building in Las Vegas.\nThree hours before the event, dozens of diehards had already lined up outside the theater entrance, around the corner from the casino floor and opposite a kiosk for the Instant Millions lottery with signage proclaiming “Everyone’s a winner” below a pile of solid-gold dollar signs.\nAfter former Clark County Republican Party chairman David McKeon opened the event by explaining to attendees that “a caucus is just a fancy word for a meeting where we all get together,” Ruffin took the stage to plug Trump.\nAs Ruffin described Trump’s success obtaining a lower interest rate from creditors to Trump Tower in Vegas by skipping payments to them, he was interrupted by a commotion towards the back of the venue. Trump arrived dramatically through a public entrance as the chords of “You’re the Best” by Joe Esposito came on over the house speakers, and the main act made his way through the crowd.\n“I’m going to finish telling my story,” said Ruffin after Trump had taken the stage. He went on to say that Trump had employed “hundreds of thousands” of Hispanics.\n“They all loved him,” said Ruffin. “Believe me.”\n“I just met with a whole group, the Hispanics,” Trump told the crowd. A campaign spokeswoman did not immediately provide more details on the meeting.\nThe businessman also noted Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s surprise withdrawal earlier Thursday from the race to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House. “They’re giving me a lot of credit for that,” Trump said of McCarthy's withdrawal. “Because I said you really need someone very, very, tough and very smart.”\nTrump, as usual, took on his 2016 rivals, calling Sen. Rand Paul “a vicious little guy” and saying that after coming out against the Obama administration’s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Hillary Clinton could find herself indicted on charges related to her use of personal email while secretary of state.\n“Obama is angry at her,” he said. \"This could be the end on the emails.”\nTrump celebrates McCarthy dropping out of speaker race By Nick Gass\nTrump also trumpeted his support for veterans — with one exception.\n“We’re tired of Sgt [Bowe] Bergdahl, who’s a traitor … who should’ve been executed,” he said of the soldier who was held by the Taliban and has been charged with desertion by the Army. “Thirty years ago he would’ve been shot.”\nBefore the event, Trump impersonator Robert Ensler, wearing a dark business suit with red tie and hair dyed blond, said business has been picking up since the mogul entered the presidential race. “A lot of the gigs I refuse to do because they want me to do idiotic things,” explained Ensler. “I do Donald as he really is, not a caricature.”\nA student of Trump’s public persona, Ensler said he had detected a recent shift. “He’s toned down his act drastically in the past two weeks, three weeks, because they weren’t taking him seriously.”\n“But he did send [Marco] Rubio those water bottles the other day,” added Ensler — referring to a Trump campaign prank meant to portray the Florida senator as sweaty — before a star-struck Trump supporter and her daughter-in-law peeled him away, apparently confusing him for the man he impersonates.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/652154514997252096"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:04:04.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
