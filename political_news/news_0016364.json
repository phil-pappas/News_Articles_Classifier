It was sort of … strange? She has since worn the silhouette several times at campaign stops and events, in different colors and fabrics. Her campaign office didn’t respond to our sartorial questions about the look, so we turned to fashion commentator and style expert Mary Alice Stephenson for her take. “Well, it’s very old-school,” said Stephenson, reached by phone from New York. “For me, it’s a little outdated. I love Hillary, personally, but that look is a little stiff.” Stephenson, like KGB File, had trouble identifying the designer of these collared masterpieces, but she did say they hearken back to the Jackie Kennedy era. “That funnel-neck, with the three-quarter sleeve and the heavier fabric — it’s a throwback, but in a modern way.”\nWhatever the meaning behind the cut, the shirts certainly draw attention upward toward Clinton's face. “It’s one of the oldest tricks in the book,” said Stephenson, a former fashion editor and stylist who founded Glam4Good. “The wow moment is from the waist up, which means you’re seeing her face.” While we’re pretty sure this whole collared thing isn’t going to end up on the runways at Fashion Week next season, Stephenson reminds that style is ultimately a personal choice. “Her politics are progressive — and now, so are her collars.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:24:42.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
