What am I going to do differently?”\nWhat would change under a Speaker McCarthy? Would he cater more to the conservatives who forced Boehner out, or would he sideline them in favor of more compromise with Democrats?\nLatest from News What Mahmoud Abbas Really Said at the United Nations: Not Much\nMcCarthy’s problem is that he didn’t really have an answer to his own question. After stumbling into a classic Kinsley gaffe about Hillary Clinton and the House Benghazi committee, he talked about how under his leadership, Republicans would go to battle against Democrats with a “strategy” and would “fight to win.” The implication, naturally, was that John Boehner lacked an effective strategy, but McCarthy didn’t lay out how exactly he would succeed where Boehner failed, either in corralling the cranky conservatives or in actually winning fights with President Obama.\nIt’s not that Kevin McCarthy is woefully unprepared to lead the House. Yes, he would be the least experienced speaker in nearly 125 years , but he has served in the senior party leadership for nearly six out of his nine years in Congress. McCarthy became the Republican whip—the third-ranking post—after playing a critical role in the GOP majority-winning wave in 2010, and he was easily elevated to majority leader last year after Eric Cantor’s stunning primary defeat. (He was a fast-climber in California, too, having become minority leader of the state assembly just a year after his election.)", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/28/kevin-mccarthy-would-be-the-least-experienced-house-speaker-since-1891/", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/4519442873001/rep-kevin-mccarthy-how-he-would-differ-from-john-boehner/?#sp=show-clips"], "published": "2015-10-01T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:49:23.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
