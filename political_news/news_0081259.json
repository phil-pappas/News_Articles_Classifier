Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, executives said.\nDevelopers say units will “feel spacious and full of light” equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\nEach Kasita will plug into traditional utilities.\nDevelopers say they’ll eventually post prices to rent or buy Kasitas, but say that rents will be at half the market rate for a studio.\nWilson is teaming up with Kasita co-founder Taylor Wilson for the plan, which was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week. The two Wilsons are not related.\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\nIn Austin, the project is slated for two different sites near downtown and in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said. However, a specific location has not been finalized, he added.\nTaylor Wilson announced a micro-unit concept project earlier this year. In March, Taylor Wilson announced a ‘micro-unit’ apartment project, Spire, for the East Austin area. However a site for that plan is still pending.\nEach unit was an estimated 400 square feet.\nTrending on Facebook\nToddler's head reattached after wreck thanks to 'miracle' surgery Watch: Shelter dog makes his own bed every night Must watch: Mighty Mites stop mid-game to whip, nae nae Deputy comforts child at accident scene, photo goes viral Glass walkway 3,500 feet above ground cracks under tourists' feet More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:05:16.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
