Tehran's coy suggestion that he might be released in exchange for unspecified Iranians held by the U.S. is a further affront, especially as the official \"adoption day\" of the Iranian nuclear deal looms. That's absurd and makes clear that Rezaian is not a spy, but a hostage. He must be released without condition.\nRezaian, 39, was detained on July 22, 2014, along with his wife, who is also a reporter, and two photojournalists. The others were released, but Rezaian was charged with espionage and distribution of propaganda. He is in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.\nThe secret trial, which consisted of four hearings which Rezaian's family was not permitted to attend, concluded Aug. 10. On Sunday, an Iranian official said that Rezaian had been convicted, but that he did not know the sentence.\nWhat bunk. Iran, emboldened by the loosening of economic sanctions that accompanied the scaling back of its nuclear program, is playing America because it can. The deal Tehran struck with the U.S. and five other nations was carefully negotiated over two years, and President Barack Obama is loathe to endanger it. Further, although Sunday is \"adoption day\" -- when the U.S. officially lifts its sanctions -- many European nations have already normalized relations with Iran.\nObama was right not to link Rezaian's fate to the negotiations. But now that they are over, the president must make plain that the U.S. will not tolerate the illegal detainment of an innocent journalist -- and that he's no longer playing \"Let's Make a Deal.\" The agreement was not a license to abuse Americans. Three others are believed to be held, including a Christian pastor, a former Marine and a CIA contractor.\nThe sentence can be appealed, but enough with the charade. Tehran should release Rezaian and the other Americans now.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737670&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737670&h=Iran+has+no+license+to+abuse+a+US+journalist", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737670"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:08:11.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
