A peace deal would unlock regional co-operation on the eastern Mediterranean's energy potential.\n___\n7:30 p.m.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif met alone Friday evening during a U.N. gathering of world leaders, and the State Department says they discussed the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal.\nKerry and Zarif sent their advisers out of the room to meet alone. They left separately and did not comment.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said the two were \"taking advantage of their presence in New York before they both departed.\"\nEarlier in the week, it was Kerry who introduced Zarif to President Barack Obama for a handshake when they ran into one another on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Iran's official IRNA agency has reported that Zarif came upon Obama \"accidentally.\"\nKerry and Zarif also met earlier in the week.\n___\n6:40 p.m.\nMyanmar's foreign minister says \"peace and stability has been restored\" in its western state where Rohingya Muslims have long been persecuted.\nWunna Maung Lwin addressed a U.N. gathering of world leaders Friday and did not mention the Rohingya by name.\nThe Rohingya are considered Bangladeshis by the government, and in Rakhine state, where most of them live, their rights are stripped and their movement severely restricted.\nThey are also barred from voting in this year's Nov. 8 election, for the first time since independence from Britain, and were disqualified as candidates.\nThe State Department said Secretary of State John Kerry met with Myanmar's foreign minister Friday and stressed the importance of \"ensuring full citizenship and freedom of movement for the Rohingya.\"\nThe election is considered a test of Myanmar's reforms.\n___\n4:50 p.m.\nThe Emirati foreign minister has hailed advances made by Yemen's pro-government forces, including the capture of a key encampment for Shiite Houthi rebels near the Bab al-Mandab straight a day earlier.\nBab al-Mandab is the strategic southern entrance to the Red Sea and the gateway to the Suez Canal. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan says the capture \"further marks the end of the control of the rebels and their supporters.\"\nAl Nahyan spoke Friday at the United Nations General Assembly meeting.\nThousands of Emirati soldiers are taking part in a Saudi-led coalition to help pro-government forces against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nThe Houthis have been in control of the capital Sanaa since last September and are at war with the internationally recognized government of Yemen.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nBritain's ambassador to the United Nations says Russia's draft Security Council resolution seeking to unite global efforts against terrorism has no future.\nIn response, Russia's U.N. ambassador warns that the work of the U.N.'s most powerful body \"will come to a standstill\" if council members oppose something just because Russia proposes it.\nRussia circulated the draft earlier this week during a U.N. gathering of world leaders, shortly after the country began airstrikes in Syria. The draft calls on countries to cooperate with governments where the fight against extremist groups is occurring — a reference to Syria's government.\nBritish Ambassador Matthew Rycroft on Friday told reporters that the strikes are targeting opponents of Syria's president, meaning that a \"long-term solution to this conflict is even further off than we previously thought.\"\n___\n2:45 p.m.\nSomalia's prime minister says the government wants to liberate all remaining territory held by the Islamic militant group al-Shabab in the coming year and have its own forces take over the country's security from an African-led force in the next two to three years.\nOmar Sharmarke said in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday that he believes both goals are achievable.\nHe said al-Shabab \"has lost a lot of ground\" and \"we are the only country that consistently has decreased this radicalization.\"\nSharmarke said Al-Shabab carries out a major attack every two to three months, like the suicide bombing at the gate of Somalia's presidential palace on Sept. 21, while in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots there are sometimes several militant attacks a day.\n11:22 a.m.\nThe United Nations says Somalia has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child , making the United States the only country that has not done so.\nThe U.N. statement Friday noted that Somalia is the 196th nation to ratify the international human rights treaty that is meant to protect children's rights to health, education and freedom from discrimination.\nThe U.S. has never been able to get enough required support from Congress to ratify the treaty. Some members of Congress fear that such treaties could overrule existing U.S. laws.\nThe U.N. said Somalia's signing was significant because the east African country, which is trying to rebuild after a long civil war, has \"one of the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world.\"\n___\n10:47 a.m.\nThe interim president of Burkina Faso has praised his countrymen for showing \"an unprecedented level of patriotism\" in opposing the coup that saw him detained recently.\nPresident Michel Kafando addressed the U.N. annual gathering of world leaders less than a week and a half after his transition government was reinstalled. The elite president guard had arrested him on Sept. 16 but stepped down after pressure from the West African regional bloc, Burkina Faso's military and demonstrating citizens.\nKafando singled out the country's youth for their opposition to the coup and lamented the deaths during the turmoil.\nHe called on the international community's support and pledged that free and transparent elections will be organized shortly.\n___\n9:39 a.m.\nLeaders including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.N.
