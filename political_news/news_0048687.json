The violence that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans has become one of the most dissected foreign policy mishaps of the Obama administration. \nThere have already been hundreds of pages of government findings published in nine reports pinpointing what went wrong and what needs to be done differently. But Republicans argue that the seven previous congressional inquisitions don’t tell the full story. They are eager to lay more of the blame on Clinton. The private email server Clinton set up at her house while she served as the nation’s top diplomat has given them a fresh line of attack, and questions about why and how she used it will play big in Thursday’s exchange. \nBut GOP giddiness about the panel’s work has ultimately damaged its credibility. The seven Republican lawmakers on the special committee are heading into the hearing on the defensive, after comments by some overeager colleagues – House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield, presidential candidates, Republicans in the congressional rank and file – have bolstered charges by Democrats that the inquiry is a partisan hit job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:12:07.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
