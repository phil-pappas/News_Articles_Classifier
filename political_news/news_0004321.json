Cory Booker threatens to filibuster a final No Child Left Behind rewrite that doesn't include adequate civil rights protections. Teachers help sixth-grade students on an assignment at the See Forever Foundation & Maya Angelou Public Charter School on Dec. 15, 2011 in Washington, D.C.\nBy Lauren Camera Oct. 8, 2015 | 4:36 p.m. EDT + More In a last-ditch effort to strengthen protections for disadvantaged students in a bill overhauling No Child Left Behind, Education Secretary Arne Duncan and a group of Senate Democrats on Thursday called on their colleagues to restore the federal K-12 law's civil rights roots.\nCongress is nearing the finish line in rewriting No Child Left Behind – the most recent version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act – and conferees from both chambers are working furiously to broker a final proposal using the bills that cleared the House and Senate over the summer.\nRELATED\nNational Governors Association, Teachers Unions to Congress: Finish Work on NCLB Both measures go far in rolling back the role of the federal government and allowing states to create their own accountability systems to gauge how well schools are educating students.\nBut the law, signed in its initial version by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the civil rights movement 50 years ago, was specifically crafted to ensure poor and minority students have equal opportunities to a quality education. And in providing flexibility for states to design their own accountability systems, critics say, the House and Senate bills lack safeguards to ensure states take action when its most disadvantaged students are falling behind.\n\"Please understand that this law is the result of incredible struggle on behalf of populations that are still marginalized today,\" Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J., said Thursday at a round-table discussion on Capitol Hill with Duncan and others. \"The law is a result of civil rights activism – of blood, tears and sweat. And it's insulting to that memory that we have a piece of legislation that pulls back that kind of accountability.\"\nAn acceptable bill, Duncan said, would require states to intervene to correct big achievement gaps between minority and low-income students and their white and more affluent peers. It would also mandate that states fix schools with especially low graduation rates, and work to turn around schools that are in the bottom 5 percent in their states.\n[ READ: What Boehner's Resignation Means for NCLB Rewrite ]\nOver the summer, when the Senate debated its version of the law's rewrite on the chamber floor, a trio of senators offered an amendment that would do those things. Even though their proposal failed, enough Democrats supported it to prove they have the votes to block a conferenced measure that does not include at least some additional accountability language.\n\"The idea that we would pass a major piece of education legislation and in effect just shovel money to states and say, 'Do what you want,' and not have accountability for how that money is being spent for our children is appalling,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Thursday.\nThe group noted that the bill should not be overly prescriptive in telling states how to fix low graduation rates, big achievement gaps or chronically failing schools, but that it should at least ensure they do something.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., left, speaks with fellow senators before a news conference on Tuesday. \"You decide what the medicine is,\" Booker said. \"You decide the answer.\"\nAny compromise the conferees may make on accountability will have to pass muster in the House, where both Republicans and Democrats will be needed to support the final version of the bill for it to pass. And that makes crafting the specific language tricky, given Republicans – especially the far-right flank in the House – are adamant about limiting the role of the federal government as much as possible.\n\"There's no use in passing a federal education bill if it's not a civil rights bill,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who was also at the round-table. \"To get this done we need to remind our colleagues that the whole reason we are in the education business at the federal level is for civil rights.\"\nThe meeting comes on the heels of the announced resignation of House Speaker John Boehner – the Ohio Republican who was an original architect of No Child Left Behind and an important advocate for the federal K-12 overhaul in the House – and Duncan, who last week shocked the education community with his plans to step down in December.\n[ ALSO: Congress Gets a Failing Grade on Education Policy ]\nIn addition, Rep. John Kline, the chairman of the House education committee and author of the House reauthorization bill, announced last month that he will not seek re-election next year.\nThe trio of announcements, many education experts say, significantly diminishes the chances that a bill gets to the president's desk.\n\"We don't know how this ends,\" Duncan said, adding that the chance a bill is signed into law is less than 50 percent. \"But the goal is not to replace the law with a bad law. At the end of the day, we need to be very clear that student outcomes matter.\"\nBooker said he's ready to filibuster or find other ways to block the bill from passing in the Senate, should a final conferenced measure not include enough accountability. But it's unclear how many other Democrats would join him.\n\"I will stand, filibuster, do whatever I have to do,\" Booker said, adding also that the president has the power of the pen, meaning he could veto a bill that he thinks doesn't include enough safeguards for low-income and minority students.\nTAGS: education policy K-12 education Duncan, Arne No Child Left Behind Booker, Cory Murphy, Chris Warren, Elizabeth", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Democrats%20Push%20to%20Maintain%20No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%27s%20Civil%20Rights%20Roots", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Democrats%20Push%20to%20Maintain%20No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%27s%20Civil%20Rights%20Roots&summary=Sen.%20Cory%20Booker%20threatens%20to%20filibuster%20a%20final%20No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20rewrite%20that%20doesn%27t%20include%20adequate%20civil%20rights%20protections.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Democrats%20Push%20to%20Maintain%20No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%27s%20Civil%20Rights%20Roots", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0m3z%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:46:14.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
