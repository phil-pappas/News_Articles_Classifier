(Photo: Elaine Thompson / AP) \n28 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Dozens of Detroit residents Monday urged the City Council to pass an ordinance to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries.\n“I think we need common-sense licensing and regulation to bring dispensaries into compliance so our community can be safe and attractive,” Pam Weinstein said. “That’s going to be a win-win for everybody.”\nA handful of others told council members there are too many of the businesses in the city, causing problems in neighborhoods.\n“We should take the position that many suburban communities have — and that’s not to allow dispensaries at all,” said Tracy Perry, president of the Eastside Unity Association. “I believe (allowing them in the city) will open a door and we’ll have no control over what happens. It’s already out of control.”\nThe group voiced their concerns to the City Council’s Public Health and Safety committee. Members Janee Ayers, Raquel Casteneda-Lopez, and Council President Brenda Jones were present with councilman Scott Benson excused.\nThe committee was joined at the hearing by four other council members: George Cushingberry, Mary Sheffield, Andre Spivey and James Tate.\nThe committee didn’t take any action on the ordinance.\nTate led the effort to develop the legislation, which has been in the works since last year.\nTate said earlier this month the ordinance is designed to address licensing requirements for dispensary operators and an amendment to the zoning code that will specify where dispensaries can locate.\nHis proposed legislation doesn’t set a cap on the number of pot shops permitted in the city. However, he said, all existing dispensaries in the city — estimated to be at least 80 — and all future businesses will be subject to licensing.\n“This is not a witch hunt,” Tate said Monday. “This is really a pathway for individuals who need medicinal marijuana to have safe access.”\nCushingberry said he plans to introduce some amendments, including, according to media reports, allowing dispensaries to provide customers drive-thru service and operate 24 hours a day.\n“I agree we have to have some regulations,” he said. “But we don’t want to put them all out of business.”\ncramirez@detroitnews.com \n(313) 222-2058", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:48:44.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
