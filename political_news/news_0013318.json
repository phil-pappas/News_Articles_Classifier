Trey Gowdy, who chairs the Benghazi committee, was a no-show at the interview of Hillary’s closest and most trusted aide, Huma Abedin, an interview the AP described as a “grilling” though no one in the closed hearing did. In fact, top attack dog Democrat on the committee Elijah Cummings tweeted that the questions of Abedin were “overall fair.” Trey Gowdy, who had nothing in particular going on the day he missed the interview, issued a statement. “The interview with Ms. Huma Abedin has concluded. She answered all questions posed by Members and staff, and the Select Committee on Benghazi greatly appreciates her willingness to take the time to voluntarily appear before the committee, as well as her service to the United States over a number of years.” He didn’t mention her illicit double dipping. “The information she provided,” he continued, “will assist the committee in writing its final report.” Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton will testify and all will look for any indication that Republicans have set up a Kangaroo Court. If the Republicans have backed off, Hillary should be able to cackle her way out of answering questions when she is interviewed by the committee. It could well end up like the last interview in which the Senate gave speeches and behaved as if they were in awe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:23:53.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
