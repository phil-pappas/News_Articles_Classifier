This is the first national fundraiser of its kind in New Zealand. \nThe nationwide Doughraiser will take place on Wednesday October 28, from 4pm to 9pm, in 91 Domino’s stores across New Zealand. \nOne dollar from every pizza sold from 4pm-9pm will go towards Youthline’s Go Forward suite: online tools designed for youth support and personal development. \nYouthline is stoked to have this opportunity as part of their national partnership with Domino’s Pizza New Zealand. \n“We are extremely grateful to Domino’s Pizza NZ for being such a generous partner to Youthline,” says Youthline National Spokesperson, Stephen Bell. \n“They are making a very real contribution to New Zealand’s young people and, through them, to our country’s future,” he adds. \nDomino’s Pizza General Manager, Scott Bush says this partnership is of the highest importance to Domino’s Pizza. \n“We really value the work that Youthline consistently do. We have been blown away by how many touchpoints they have with youths in New Zealand and we also understand the expense of running such a successful and multi-faceted organisation. \nWe have set a target of $30,000 for this Nationwide Doughraiser but I hope we smash this figure out of the park and can report back a number that surpasses our expectations.” \nDomino’s are excited and motivated by Youthline’s vision and mission, and are expressing their commitment to the organisation and its work in multiple ways. In addition to the Doughraiser, Domino’s and Youthline have developed an employment and training program for young people called Connect the Dots. \nThis programme gives participants hands-on industry experience and takes place at a Domino’s store over two days. Participants learn basic food handling, customer service and how to be a good employee. Upon completion of the course they are fast tracked to a job within Domino’s, or can use their new skills to gain employment in any other food handling role. \nSupport Youthline on October 28, it’s an easy (and tasty!) way to back a great cause. $1 from every pizza sold between 4pm and 9pm will support Youthline. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:34:59.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
