Ryan of Wisconsin for House speaker, assuring that he will have the votes to secure the post next week and averting a leadership crisis for Republicans. Not only does Paul Ryan want to give legal status and job permits to millions of illegals who have invaded our borders who are causing political, social and devastating financial consequences, but he also wants to be dictator and exempted from section 315 of the House Rules under which he can be removed as Speaker of the House by its members. Paul Ryan has also been a big fan of Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority which is blatantly unconstitutional. Fast-track trade power allows the President to negotiate regulations of commerce with foreign nations in secret, while Congress only part before these regulations become law would be an up or down vote within 90 days upon receiving the presidents' concocted deals. Keep in mind that our Constitution places exclusive power to legislate regulations of commerce with foreign nations in Congress hands. Placing this power in Congress hands was intended by our Founders to insure that any regulations of commerce would be formulated, debated, and amended if needed by the various States Congressional Delegations sent to Washington to insure that each States best interests would be represented and served in the making of such regulations. And after any regulations of commerce were drawn up in a bill and agreed upon by Congress, the president was left with a limited power to either approve or veto the regulations of commerce agreed to by Congress. Fast Track Trade promotion authority is intentionally designed to reverse the president's and the Peoples Representatives constitutionally assigned duties as they apply to regulating commerce with foreign nations. In this reversal, the president would usurp Congress assigned duty to represent particular state interests when fashioning regulations of commerce while Congress would be left with the limited power to either approve or veto what the president has cooked up in secret with foreign nations. Fast-track trade authority and open borders are Chamber of Commerces ideas and benefit international corporate giants who have no allegiance to America or any nation. As Speaker of the House Paul Ryan would be in a position to prevent any legislation to reverse these traitorous acts which are not in the best interests of Americas general welfare or the interests of Americas working people. The good news is, those who support Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House will expose themselves for the traitors they are, and hopefully they will be removed from office this coming election along with Paul Ryan who is the mouthpiece for the Chamber of Commerce and a shill for our Global Governance Crowd JWK To support Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House is to support a continuance of Obama's illegal immigration tyranny which includes giving legal status and work permits to tens of millions who have invaded our borders! The CNN email about this says he pretty well has a lock on it now. I too am surprised. Location: massachusetts Posts: 4,537 Paul Ryan is the tallest midget, the most intellectual of the three stooges, the least smelly garbage bucket....in short, he ain't much but who else they got? But what happens when these lying scumbags get in a position where they have to put up or shut up? It's one thing to propose vague programs that have no chance of passing into law, it's another when you are the speaker. If you want to replace ObamaCare with \"Something Better\", you have to say what \"something better\" is, you have to pay for it, and you have to make the rules. If you want to base a tax cut on \"closing loopholes\" and \"savings to specified later\", that's great in a presidential campaign, but if you're the Speaker, you need details.... Nothing changes for the better in Washington.

This free movement of people across national boundaries is the centerpiece of the open borders ideology to which Ryan has devoted much of his career. Any member of the Republican Party who votes for Paul Ryan to be Speaker of the House needs to be primaried this coming election!
