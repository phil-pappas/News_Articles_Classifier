Darrian Traynor Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan A secret deal to pay the Australian Workers Union $25,000 a year from a cleaning company was kept out of a workplace agreement because it would look bad for the employer and the union, the trade union corruption inquiry has heard.\nJulianne Page, a general manager of the Spotless cleaning division, said the payment by Cleanevent to the AWU in 2010 for union memberships would have looked like a \"pay-off\" to the union because the agreement traded off wages and penalty rates.\nEmails between Ms Page and Cleanevent's then general manager of human resources, Michael Robinson, about the deal were tendered to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Monday.\nThe AWU's Victorian branch has been accused of allegedly trading away $6 million in wages and penalty rates of low-paid cleaners in exchange for $75,000.\nCleanevent, a subsidiary of Spotless, paid the union $25,000 a year and supplied lists of employees who, unknown to them, were entered in the union's membership roll to artificially inflate union membership numbers. The union chose to retain an agreement struck under WorkChoices.\nMr Robinson wrote that the deal would generate savings to the company of $1.5 million in exchange for a donation to the union.\n\"I am sure that making this 'donation' in whatever form we choose would be legal but then this becomes a question of scruples,\" he wrote.\n\"While I share… concerns for any exposure we may be opening ourselves to, I feel there is definitely merit in fleshing this out simply for the massive competitive advantage that we will be creating for ourselves in the market.\"\n Mr Robinson told Ms Page that the union \"will never agree to having any trade-off for lower wages with a payment of membership in the one document\".\n\"It would be crazy for the union to put that down on a page and, to be honest, I wouldn't feel happy with it being on the same document either.\"\nAsked why Mr Robinson would believe it was crazy for the union to put the issues together, Ms Page said \"I suppose it would look bad for the union, it would look like it was some sort of pay-off\". She agreed it would also look bad for Spotless and Cleanevent too.\nA former cleaning company executive, Stephen Hunter, blamed the collapse of his company on its inability to compete with Cleanevent's cheaper labour costs.\nMr Hunter, who worked at Cleanevent before starting his own company, Douglas Site Services, said he paid his workers under the award because he was unable to negotiate an agreement with the AWU.\nHe said he could not reach an agreement with the union because he refused its demands to pay the union memberships of employees as a condition of the agreement.\nIn an email, former AWU organiser John-Paul Blandthorn​ told Mr Hunter that the union's then Victorian secretary Cesar Melhem​ would only sign the agreement \"if we are guaranteed membership through some arrangement\".\nHe said he had high employment costs compared with Cleanevent which was not paying penalty rates, and those extra costs were a \"significant reason\" for the company's subsequent failure.\nMeanwhile, a blackmail charge against construction union organiser Johnny Lomax was dismissed on Monday after the prosecution didn't submit any evidence.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:02:17.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
