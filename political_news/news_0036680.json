(The White House via AP) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nThe Secret Service agent credited with saving President Ronald Reagan's life on the day he was shot outside a Washington hotel has died. \nThe retired agent, Jerry Parr of Washington, District of Columbia, died Friday at the age of 85. \nParr was in charge of Reagan's detail on March 30, 1981, when a young man with mental problems, John Hinckley Jr., shot the president outside the Washington Hilton. When the shots rang out, Parr pushed Reagan inside the presidential limousine and it sped away for the White House. \nAfter Reagan complained of chest pains and showed blood on his lips, Parr redirected the limousine to George Washington Hospital. As it turned out, Reagan had been hit in the chest and was bleeding internally. Doctors later said that any delay would have cost the president his life. \nIn a statement Friday, former first lady Nancy Reagan called Parr \"one of my true heroes.\" \nParr was born on Sept. 16, 1930, in Birmingham, Alabama. An Air Force veteran, he joined the Secret Service in 1962. He retired in 1985 and became an ordained minister. \nHe is survived by his wife, Carolyn, and three daughters.
