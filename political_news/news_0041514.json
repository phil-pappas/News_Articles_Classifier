I'm not naive not to believe certain documents have been classified.\n\"We need this dark cloud of Iraq to move on... It's like having an open wound that is constantly prodded.\"\nMr Keys acknowledged the complexity of the inquiry, but said he was \"prepared to run with what we've got\".\n\"This is not just months overdue, it's years overdue. Information will keep bubbling to the surface for years to come. We cannot wait for other little memos to keep coming up here and there,\" he added.", "external_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3020112.stm", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12224606", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0786/production/_86262910_39208430.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:05:25.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
