(AP) - A federal judge has ordered an eastern Pennsylvania city to pay nearly $1.4 million to civil rights lawyers who thwarted the city’s immigration law in U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe Hazleton Standard-Speaker reports (http://bit.ly/1JVlbX3 ) Judge James Munley on Tuesday awarded about half of the $2.8 million that lawyers sought for the case. \nHazleton’s law penalized companies that hired immigrants who lacked legal status to work in the country and landlords whose tenants lacked legal residency status. \nThe law was struck down and a federal appeals court upheld Munley’s ruling in 2010. A year later, the Supreme Court asked the appeals court to reconsider. But it stuck to its original decision and the Supreme Court declined further involvement. \nMayor Joseph Yannuzzi says the city still feels it is right. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:57:24.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
