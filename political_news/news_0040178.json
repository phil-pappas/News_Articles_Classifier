It installed or updated drinking fountains and bottle-filler stations around campus, distributed hundreds of reusable containers and encouraged students to carry them around.\nThe goal was noble, the expectations high.\nBut the results were not at all what the administration intended.\nA study by a UVM nutrition professor found students were not using or purchasing fewer single-use bottles; indeed, since the policy change the school's plastic bottle footprint had increased.\nTo top it off, students were instead purchasing sugary and unhealthy drinks and consuming a great deal more of them.\nThe failed UVM bottle ban illustrates a classic case of unintended consequences. A policy is proposed with a lofty objective in mind, but upon implementation, an entirely different result occurs.\nIt's a case study that presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders -- who represents Vermont -- might want to consider.\nDuring Tuesday night's Democrat presidential primary debate, the self-proclaimed socialist proclaimed the U.S. needs medical and family paid leave \"like every other country on Earth.\"\nHe continued, \"I think we should look to countries like Denmark, like Sweden and Norway, and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people.\"\nIt's true the U.S. represents the minority when it comes to family leave policies. It's true also the Nordic nations are among the most generous.\nManhattan Institute scholar Kay Hymowitz looked at leave policies in all three nations: Denmark gives mothers a full year of leave at full pay; Sweden allows 480 days of leave at roughly 80 percent of a full-time salary; and Norway offers up to 47 weeks off.\nWhen compared to the U.S., northern Europe seems like a feminist utopia.\nStudies show such laws help bring women back into the workforce. They also provide mothers and children bonding time research suggests is crucial for healthy childhood development.\nBut the benefits seem to stop there.\nAs with the UVM bottle ban, a cascade of unintended consequences make such policies not merely less than ideal but maybe even harmful.\nCornell University economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn looked at 22 countries and confirmed the expansion of family-friendly policies, including parental leave and part-time work entitlements, has increased female workforce participation.\nBut they found that such policies \"also appear to encourage part-time work and employment in lower-level positions,\" not to mention lower wages and less advancement for women.\nIn fact, Blau and Kahn concluded that U.S. women -- a relative few of whom enjoy paid parental leave -- \"are more likely than women in other countries to have full-time jobs and to work as managers or professionals.\"\nGenerous leave policies may handicap working women, decreasing their attachment to the workplace and thus opportunities for promotion as well as income potential.\nYou might even say they increase workplace inequality.\nAs Hymowitz puts it, these laws \"have a tendency to harden a country's glass ceiling.\"\nAnd it's not only Europe where such \"women-centered\" policies are eroding female careers.\nIn Chile, the government sought to increase female participation in the workforce by altering the labor code to require companies with 20 or more female employees to provide and pay for child care at a nearby location.\nThe law also significantly increased the cost of hiring female employees.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise when three economists found the law resulted in a decline in women's starting salaries of between nine percent and 20 percent.\nThere are good reasons for companies to consider expanding parental leave or implementing more family-friendly policies on their own.\nBut holding up the mandatory, one-size-fits-all policies of Scandinavia as beacons of equality and fairness ignores the unforeseen consequences such policies often create.\nWhether banning bottles on campus or mandating generous paid parental leave, all policies that create benefits have costs, and it doesn't appear that the costs of such policies mean much to Sanders.\nAbout The Writer\nCynthia M.
