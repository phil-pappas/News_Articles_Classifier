Brooks piled two stacks of Clinton's emails on her desk -- a taller set from 2011 and a shorter collection from 2012. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, asked Clinton why she had never given Stevens her personal email address. He then pushed Clinton on whether Stevens had her home address, fax number or cell phone number, too -- reminding her that her friend Blumenthal does. Others pressed the same issue. It was part of an attempt by Republicans to demonstrate that Stevens' requests for additional security were ignored by Clinton because she didn't offer him enough access. \"Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you, Madam Secretary, but the ambassador did not,\" Gowdy said. The problem for Republicans, who appeared overly focused on what has become a political hot button, is that most of the resources the committee has are in the form of emails, thousands of documents they've received from the State Department about what happened in Libya and Benghazi. That limits their ability to press Clinton on records obtained otherwise. Clinton's email controversy explained 9. The Republicans refuel. What about Thursday's marathon hearing will give the GOP new ammunition in the fight against Clinton and her performance on Benghazi? The revelations that she told both a top Egyptian official and her own family that the attack was premeditated and, respectively, carried out by an known terror group will likely be used against her. Jordan read out a conversation she had with then-Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil the day after the Benghazi attack in which she told him: \"We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest.\" And he also read from an email to her family right after the attack in which she wrote: \"Two officers were killed today in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group.\" 22 photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi 22 photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi – Attackers set the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But the storming of the mission was later determined to have been a terrorist attack.

Hide Caption 22 of 22 Clinton explained the discrepancy between those sentiments and the administration's repeated statements in the days after the attacks that the attacks were spontaneous as largely due to fast-moving intelligence assessments in a chaotic period. But to Republicans, they are likely to be seized on as evidence that the administration was not upfront about the nature of the attacks. Many in the GOP have long maintained that the Obama administration wanted to conceal the attacks' ties to terrorists out of fear that would undermine a central argument in President Barack Obama's re-election campaign -- then in its closing weeks -- that he had been effective in fighting terror. From Benghazi to Capitol Hill: 3 years of accusations and investigations 10. 2012 election considerations? Jordan submitted the former secretary of state to a dramatic period of questioning when he alleged that she and other Obama administration staff tried to blame the attack on the consulate on an anti-Muslim YouTube video to avoid undercutting Obama's claims that he had crushed al Qaeda. \"You could live with a protest about a video, that won't hurt you, but a terror attack would,\" Jordan said, saying that Americans could accept, reluctantly, compatriots being killed abroad but \"what they can't live with is when their government is not square with them.\" Clinton rejected the claim, saying in the desperate hours after the attack that information on the true nature of the assault on the compound by a mob was unclear. \"I am sorry that it doesn't fit your narrative, congressman,\" Clinton said. \"I can only tell you what the facts are.\" Clinton's testimony in GIFs 11. 'I really don't care what you say about me.' At the end of the 11th hour -- and after a brief coughing fit -- Clinton could no longer hide her contempt for the Republican-led committee, and particularly Gowdy. \"I really don't care what you say about me. It doesn't bother me a bit,\" she said while defending Admiral Michael Mullen, who helmed a previous Benghazi investigation. She added: \"I can't help, Mr. Chairman, that you all don't like the findings\" of previous reviews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:58:42.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
