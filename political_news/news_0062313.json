Sanders has been extraordinarily clear about the kind of shift hed like to effect: Republicans divide people on gay marriage. They divide people on abortion. They divide people on immigration. And what my job is, and its not just in blue states. . . [is] to bring working people together around an economic agenda that works. People are sick and tired of establishment politics; they are sick and tired of a politics in which candidates continue to represent the rich and the powerful. The theory that economic populism unites voters is hardly new. Lyndon Johnson, in New Orleans and about to lose the South to Barry Goldwater in 1964, expressed it in one of the most remarkable campaign speeches in history.

I just feel like I have one in me. The poor old state, they havent heard a Democratic speech in 30 years.
