He said there's a 'long way to go' but 'enough of a basis of pragmatism, goodwill and mutual understanding to get the job done.\nWelsh Government sources had warned that far from boosting the powers of the Assembly, the bill would have the opposite effect and 'roll back' devolution.\nIn the video clip below, Stephen Crabb tells me why meeting those concerns is his top priority.\nPlay video He refused to speculate on whether or not the UK Government will push ahead with the legislation even if the Welsh Government and the Assembly disagree.\nOne of the main sticking points is thought to be the question of creating a separate legal jurisdiction for Wales. Stephen Crabb's comments suggest the UK Government is standing firm in its opposition to such a move but that the bill will 'find a way to allow the Welsh Government to create and enforce offences without fundamentally revising the principles of England and Wales law.'\nA spokesperson for the First Minister issued a terse response which hinted at the difficulties which remain:\nIt was a constructive discussion. It will be difficult to come to a settlement without properly addressing the issue of a single jurisdiction, but talks will continue.\nâ€“ First Minister's spokesperson The draft Wales Bill is due to be published next week and will be followed by pre-legislative scrutiny and a widespread consultation. It's expected that the full bill will be published in February. It could become law by early 2017.\nLast updated Mon 12 Oct 2015 Politics Stephen Crabb Carwyn Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:33:34.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
