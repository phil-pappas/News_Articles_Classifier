Graft busters have probed into alleged corruption and other ethical lapses in China's journalism world in the past year, though the news outlets implicated have mainly been commercial publications rather than official organs.\nThis changed late Sunday when the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Communist Party's internal watchdog, criticised the mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper and the party's main political journal Qiushi for what it described as a broad range of transgressions.\nAt the People's Daily, these include lax enforcement of internal discipline, misuse of public funds for travel, and improper use of official vehicles and residences, the antigraft team said.\n\"Some domestic bureaus made use of party newspaper resources to pursue profits through joint development projects,\" the CCDI said. It added that there had also been \"instances of extortion related to the reporting or non-reporting of news in return for compensation.\"\nThe CCDI didn't provide details of the alleged wrongdoing, which it said was uncovered during a two-month inspection that concluded on August 31. It wasn't clear whether the allegations were related to a corruption case against two senior executives from the People's Daily website who were detained by Chinese prosecutors in August.\nAccording to the CCDI statement, People's Daily editor-in-chief Yang Zhenwu said the newspaper is paying great attention to the agency's findings and will take steps to strengthen discipline and improve its anticorruption mechanisms. People's Daily didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nQiushi -- whose name means Seeking Truth -- was hit with similar allegations of ethical and journalistic failings, as well as lax discipline. Inspectors also accused Qiushi of performing lax political checks on articles it printed, and allowing essays to be published on the basis of personal connections and favors.\nIn the CCDI statement, Qiushi editor-in-chief Li Jie said the journal will firmly implement the CCDI's recommended remedies for its failings. Qiushi didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDespite the public raps, People's Daily and Qiushi were praised by the CCDI for their efforts in marshalling public debate and opinion, as well as promoting discipline and ethics across the Communist Party. In any case, as key party organs, both publications are unlikely to face the kind of legal consequences other Chinese news media received for alleged corruption.\nIn April, Chinese media regulators shut down the website of 21st Century Business Herald, a popular business-news daily, after investigators alleged that the website extorted several hundred million yuan (tens of millions of dollars) from Chinese companies. The site published negative reports about the firms and then deleted them after signing advertising deals with the targeted companies, state media said at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:37:16.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
