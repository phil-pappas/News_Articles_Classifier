So far, there hasn't been any mayoral debates and only one neighborhood group debate in the preliminary election period for the city council. Giesta, the onetime co-chief of staff for former Congressman Barney Frank, asked for a debate in each of the city's six wards, as well as a separate at-large debate. \"Ideally I would like to engage in a debate at least once a week from now until Election Day,\" Giesta said in a press release. \"Time is running short and only one debate is tentatively scheduled; we can't wait much longer for this mayor to volunteer to share his ideas with the voting public so I’m calling on him to begin doing so.\" \"Let's sit down and hash out a schedule. The issues at stake in this election deserve a full public airing,\" the statement read. This story will be updated.
