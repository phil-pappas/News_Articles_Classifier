It’s an impressive outcome. Of course it’s not perfect, and we’d have loved more dairy access, but overall most New Zealand firms will be pleased with the result\". \nLower costs of doing business will also help \nIn addition to the market access, the TPP will remove some of the grit in the wheels of Asia-Pacific supply chains. We should see improved trade facilitation, lower non-tariff barriers and improved regulatory coherence. Barriers to services exports should fall, and inwards and outwards investment will be made easier and less risky. \n\"These factors will all lower transaction costs for Kiwi firms, again boosting competitiveness and opening new avenues for regional economic integration. Over time, this will positively contribute to lifting Kiwis’ living standards\", Mr Ballingall said. \nMore importantly, the TPP is a boost to ongoing trade liberalisation efforts \nOn the wider stage this New Zealand-initiated process has delivered the first large scale improvement in the global trading environment for years. This is one more step in the long road to further integration in the Asia-Pacific region and puts pressure on others not involved to make similar adjustments. \n\"The demonstration effect of this achievement cannot be overstated. An enormously complicated deal was pulled and pushed into being. It shows what can be done to promote regional - and hopefully global - economic integration if the political will is strong enough\", Mr Ballingall added. \nThe report is available at nzier.org.nz \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:06:42.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
