Gomes wants the city to explore the Gloucester Police Department's Angel Program, in which addicts can turn in their drugs and get treatment rather than jail time. \"If Gloucester can do it, we can do it,\" said Gomes. \"If we come up with a plan that gets you away from drugs and gives you opportunities, I think we should take advantage of it.\" According to the City Council agenda for Thursday's meeting, Gomes will request that the Committee on Appointments and Briefings, the Committee on Public Safety and Neighborhoods, along with the Police Chief David Provencher, meet with the Gloucester Police to discuss their program. He also plans to ask the City Council to back Gov. Charlie Baker's proposed legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis, which includes a provision to allow medical professionals to commit a person to a drug treatment facility for up to 72 hours if they pose a danger to themselves or others. It would also limit first-time prescriptions for opioid painkillers to a three-day supply.
