Friday's report, which also showed job growth for July and August revised down by a combined 59,000, created an extra opening for such criticism.\n  Congressman Stephen Fincher: From Tea Partier to corporate welfare champion It would be an understatement to say Fincher has come to terms with boondoggles and special interests.\nBy Timothy P. Carney • 10/02/15 9:49 AM \"This just isn't good enough. Flat wages, weak job growth, and far too many people simply giving up,\" said Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the party's most influential voice on domestic policy matters. \"This recovery continues to disappoint, but we can't accept it as the new normal.\"\nThe Wisconsin Republican called for a rewrite of the tax code, finishing trade agreements, and safety-net reform to boost growth.\n\"While job openings are increasing, hiring is slow and layoffs are on the rise,\" said Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \"This all points to an uncertain and apprehensive trajectory for the U.S. economy.\"\nPrivate-sector economists had expected slightly more than 200,000 new jobs for September, and many analysts had anticipated that August's initially reported 173,000 new jobs would be revised up.\nInstead, job growth in both months was found to be weaker than previously estimated. August's revised gains were only 136,000.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Job growth disappoints at 142,000 in September, unemployment rate 5.1 percent Following August's disappointing 173k mark, economists had expected a rebound to 203k new payroll jobs.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/02/15 8:31 AM Nevertheless, the longer-term trend is toward lower unemployment. At 5.1 percent in September, the unemployment rate is almost half of the 10 percent recession peak in 2009. Monthly job growth above 100,000 is sufficient to keep the unemployment rate headed down, according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nIn a statement on the report, White House economic adviser Jason Furman blamed the weak report on slowing growth overseas and \"global financial turmoil.\"\nHe noted that the private-sector has added 13.2 million jobs over 67 straight months of job growth, which is the longest such streak on record.\n\"Given the increased uncertainty around the world, it is imperative that the United States not further exacerbate that uncertainty with unnecessary brinksmanship and austerity,\" Furman said, in a challenge to the GOP-led Congress that will soon have to negotiate a spending agreement and an increase in the debt ceiling.\nHe called specifically for Congress to increase spending above the statutory across-the-board limits currently in place, and to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank, which saw its charter expire at the end of June.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Vatican: Pope's meeting not a full endorsement of Kim Davis Pope Francis' \"only real audience\" during his U.S. visit was with one of his former students and his family.\nBy Barbara Boland • 10/02/15 9:17 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:10:38.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
