I will not allow anyone to tell me I'm any less British because I believe in the strongest possible Britain for business, for our security and our society.\"\nHe will cite CBI estimates that the benefits of trade, investment, jobs and lower prices mean membership is worth £3,000 per year on average to every UK household.\n\"When you consider that our annual contribution is equivalent to £340 per household, our contribution to the EU is an investment on which British families get a 10-to-one return,\" he will say.\nHowever, those who back Britain leaving the EU claimed their case had been boosted by reports that David Cameron had drawn up a four-point plan of key demands that he would make as part of a renegotiation of the UK's membership ahead of the vote.\nThey include explicit statements making it clear that the EU is a \"multi-currency union\" and that Britain will be exempt from the founding principle of \"ever closer union.\"\nHowever, there is no mention of an opt-out of the free movement of people across the EU, which those who back an exit believe will prove a crucial factor.\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage said: \"What the British government is asking for, frankly, is nothing. There is no renegotiation.\"\nHe also suggested that Boris Johnson, the Tory MP who is stepping down as Mayor of London next year, could be persuaded to take a prominent role in the campaign to leave the EU.\nShare article Mr Johnson has so far been careful to support Mr Cameron's position of waiting to see the outcome of the current renegotiation before taking sides, but many believe his private views are more hardline.\n\"We might just get him,\" Mr Farage said. \"We might just get him and he is a recognisable figure. That would be good news.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-12T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:09:48.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
