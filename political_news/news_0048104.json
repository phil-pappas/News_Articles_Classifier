Rand Paul has raised $2.5 million over the last three months for his Republican presidential bid. \nSpokesman Sergio Gor confirmed Paul's fundraising haul Thursday for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. He says Paul has $2 million in the bank after paying expenses. \nThe quarterly figures mark a practical and symbolic measure of strength for all presidential campaigns. \nPaul's $2.5 million represents a decline from the $6.9 million he raised over the first three months of his campaign. By comparison, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised more than $20 million in the last quarter. \nGor says there's been \"an uptick across all fronts\" recently. The campaign raised $750,000 over the last two weeks alone, he said. \nGor says that with $2 million cash on hand, \"we're not going anywhere.\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:55:29.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
