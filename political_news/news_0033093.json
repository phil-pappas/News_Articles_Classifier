There is no reasonable explanation for that exclusion. \n\"The regulations are still to be finalised. Michael Woodhouse must take this opportunity to put people ahead of politics and give people working on farms the choice to have health and safety reps if they want them. As Michael Woodhouse would say, that is not an onerous request,\" says Iain Lees-Galloway. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:18:29.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
