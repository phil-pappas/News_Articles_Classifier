Many of her contributions have come in the form of small dollar donations. To see breakout of size of donations among candidates. \nIronically, the campaign finance reform initiative (I-122) nicknamed \"Honest Elections\" has raised over 788-thousand dollars, the source of the greatest campaign contributions so far. \nThe opposition campaign, \"No Election Vouchers,\" has listed a little more than $2,400 worth of contributions, so far. \nWayne Barnett, Executive Director of the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission oversees all disclosure reports, both individual campaigns and independent expenditure committees. \n\"We try to audit every report that comes in. we brought in another employee to help us through this big period,\" said Barnett. \nWhile candidates' individual campaigns have maximum contribution limits of $700 in Seattle; independent expenditures have no limits. \nHowever, the IE spending cannot be known or made in cooperation or concert with the candidate's campaign, or so they've sworn. \n\"That affidavit is signed under pains and penalties of perjury, so ultimately the person who is doing the independent spending risks potentially jail time if they are falsifying that they are coordinated with the campaign,\" said Barnett. \nAs of this week, 12 Independent Expenditure committees have filed. The latest ones include \"Neighbors for Shannon,\" \"United for Tim,\" and \"Seattle Needs Ethical Leaders.\" \nJason Bennett, listed as the contact for \"Seattle Needs Ethical Leaders,\" told KING 5 \"it will be a pro-Burgess, anti-Jon Grant IE committee,\" \n\"We anticipate donors will include a mix of business, veterans' advocates, and parties who are concerned about Jon's activities while at the Tenants Union. The total budget will be around $200k,\" said Bennett. \nTo learn more about other recently filed IE committees. \n\"Accountability is really important here,\" said Sage Wilson of Working Washington. \nWilson started a political website, \"runforthemoney.org\" to highlight who is contributing to campaigns. The SEEC considers Wilson's work opposition spending. However, Wilson says he's trying to give voters in depth information, beyond the IE disclaimer. \n\"What are the real agendas of these organizations spending money,\" Wilson advised voters to ask. \n\"Nobody wants these big money voices trying to run the show in the election. The public doesn't want it, and I don't think the candidates want it either. We think that by disclosing it, it helps push it out,\" he said. \nAhead of the August Primary, business backed PACs had spent the most in support of candidates they endorsed. However, the Union backed PACS have tens of thousands of dollars worth of \"cash on hand,\" according to disclosure reports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:39:02.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
