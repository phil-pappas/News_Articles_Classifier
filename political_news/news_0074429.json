Tim Scott more than they like Lindsey Graham, they think it was the right decision that the Confederate flag was removed from state grounds in June, and they consider religion very important to their lives, a new Winthrop University poll out Wednesday has found.\nWith a two-thirds majority, South Carolina adults believe the legislature made the right decision to remove the Confederate flag from the state property, where it flew until July. More South Carolinians, though, do believe that the flag is a symbol of Southern pride (47%) than of racial conflict (40%). The poll also found that almost half of those who lean Republican said if it was left to their personal choice, they would continue to let the flag fly.\nWinthrop polling director Scott Huffmon thinks these new numbers make the flag issue less of a political landmine for presidential candidates.\n\"It's definitely safer to talk about it now. This poll shows why. Even folks who personally would prefer it was flying, even they say it was the right choice to bring it down,\" Huffmon said. \"Presidential candidates can play both sides. They would be in agreement with the base and the general sentiment.\"\nThe poll also asked voters their assessment of how Scott and Graham are performing in public office. Scott's approval ratings were much higher than Graham's, 53% to 40%.\nSince the last Winthrop University poll in March, which was taken before Graham launched his presidential campaign, he has seen a dip in approval ratings from 46%, while Scott's approval has remained steady during the period.\nHuffmon said the low numbers represent a view that Graham is not conservative enough.\n\"He was derisively called 'Lindsey Grahamnesty' in 2010 by the tea party folks because of his stance towards immigration,\" he said.\nHuffmon equates Scott's approval ratings with the status of him becoming a very important endorsement. \"Tim Scott's approval among the core base is through the roof. His ratings make him the platinum endorsement in South Carolina right now,\" he told CNN.\nScott has been hosting a series of town hall meetings across the state, providing a forum for GOP presidential candidates to introduce themselves to the first-in-the-South primary voters of South Carolina. But he has yet to endorse a candidate for the White House.\nResidents were asked whether they thought the country was on the right track on the current path it's taking. A mere 20% of respondents believed the United States is on the right track, while 70% said we're headed in the wrong direction as a nation.\nEducation and jobs/unemployment tied the top of list of biggest problems that face the state of South Carolina at 13% each. Racism followed with 8%.\nIn relation to recent news events of Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to approve same-sex marriages, residents in South Carolina were asked if they believed a clerk or judge could deny a same-sex marriage license on the basis of personal opposition. In a state that largely opposes same-sex marriage, a majority of adults (63%) do not believe a clerk or judge should be allowed to deny the license.\nAnd an overwhelming majority of respondents said that religion plays a \"very important\" role in their lives.\nThe poll surveyed the opinions of 963 South Carolina adults during the week of September 20-27th on statewide matters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.winthrop.edu/winthroppoll/default.aspx?id=9804", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:05:19.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
