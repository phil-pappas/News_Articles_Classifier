Courtesy ABC News 24.\nPT1M24S 620 349 Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer is insisting all tax reform options remain \"on the table\" but is playing down the prospect of the Turnbull government curbing negative gearing.\nNegative gearing is the practice where investors use losses made on property investments to reduce their overall taxable income. Some 1.3 million Australians use the concession, making it a politically sensitive area for reform.\nFormer Treasurer Joe Hockey told Parliament this week that negative gearing should restricted.\nKelly O'Dwyer, Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer.

It needs to be dealt with,\" Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen said.\nFollow Latika Bourke on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:39.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
