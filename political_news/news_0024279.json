(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 7:51 p.m. EDT + More By HILLEL ITALIE, AP National Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” U.S. Sen. Al Franken is not done with his career as an author.\nThe second-term Minnesota Democrat, former \"Saturday Night Live\" writer-performer, and best-selling author is working on a memoir about his years in Washington. He is describing it as a \"psychological thriller,\" in which he will recount the frustrations and the hopes of life in the Senate, with a few jokes likely added.\nThe 64-year-old Franken was a prominent liberal satirist before joining the Senate in 2009. He had great success with such books as \"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\" and \"Lies And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,\" which infuriated one of its subjects, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, and led Fox to briefly attempt legal action for using the network's slogan \"Fair and Balanced.\"\nThe new book doesn't yet have a title or publisher. Franken is being represented by Washington attorney Robert Barnett, who said Thursday that he will be in touch with publishers over the next couple of weeks. Barnett's other clients include President Barack Obama and one of Franken's fellow Democrats in the Senate, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
