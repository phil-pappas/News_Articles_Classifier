The government’s inability to pay up its debts to ECG and VRA for that matter has resulted in the situation we are in”. \nThis is the fourth year of the energy crisis but unfortunately, it’s been handled on an ad hoc basis. The president came to parliament to tell us that he was going to fix the power crisis, by no stretch of imagination is this being fixed. It is just being handled on an ad hoc basis”, he continued. \nNigeria Gas indicated it will cut gas supply to Ghana if the 180 million dollars debt owed it by the Ghana government is not paid. \nA high powered delegation from the Power and Finance Ministries are currently in Nigeria trying to broker a deal with Nigeria Gas for the settlement of the debt. \nMr Aidoo is looking forward to fruitful delegations with authorities of Nigeria Gas and the Ghanaian delegation. \n“I just pray that the negotiators will be able to come out of this negotiation in a positive manner in order to have industry and Ghanaians in general to go about their duties”. \nAs the deliberations continue, the Petroleum Minister is upbeat Ghana’s Atuabo gas project will also help to resolve the power crisis. \nAddressing a news conference this morning, Emmanuel Kofi Buah explained government has put in place plans to ensure the flow of gas from Atuabo through the West African gas pipeline to the Tema enclave which relies heavily on Nigerian gas. \nStory by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | Naa Sakwaba Akwa | [email protected]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:22:28.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
