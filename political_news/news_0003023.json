Kevin McCarthy is not even Speaker of the House yet, but there is already a group ready to fire him.\nA group of prominent right-leaning organizations formed a coalition Wednesday dubbed \"Fire Kevin McCarthy,\" pledging to remove the California Republican should he be chosen to replace John Boehner when he retires at the end of next month.\n\"Having worked with Kevin McCarthy in the House, I'll admit he's a friendly guy,\" former Georgia Rep. Paul Broun said in a statement announcing the formation of the coalition. \"But we need a dramatic change in House leadership — we can't afford to replace Speaker Boehner with someone who will continue to carry out his failed legacy, one that has been stifling conservative progress for six years.\"\nElections for the next House Speaker are slated for Oct. 8.\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 09/30/15 7:01 PM Other people and groups backing the new organization are the Constitutional Rights PAC, Special Operations Speaks, FreedomWatch, Conservative Action Fund and PatriotPAC, Life & Liberty PAC, Alan Keyes, GatorPAC, American Dream Initiative and Political Media. Other conservatives and conservative organizations are expected to announce their joining of the effort to \"Fire McCarthy\" later on, the group said.\nLarry Ward, Chairman of the Constitutional Rights APC, organized FireMcCarthy.com. According to Ward, \"McCarthy will change nothing if chosen as Speaker — he's a go-along-to-get-along politician that isn't concerned much with principle. The American people deserve better than a nice guy.\"\nMcCarthy, who is currently the House Majority Leader, has been a California congressman since 2007. Considered the favorite to be Boehner's replacement, he is so far only up against Daniel Webster of Florida.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:19:04.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
