And although more men are taking an active role in child rearing, it’s still rare to hear about a guy whose chances for employment or career advancement might be blocked because of a hypothetical paternity leave. So while the debate on women in the workplace rages on, here are three surprisingly simple reasons why mums make for great employees:\nEfficiency\nMums have to juggle responsibilities. Caring for another completely dependent human being as well as yourself is not easy. It requires the ability to anticipate and manage problems, and to use resources wisely. In order to be a great mother, a woman needs to be able to have the time to take her child to the park and leave on time to be able to tuck the kid into bed at night. She can’t do any of these things unless her work is well done.\nEmpathy\nBeing a mum makes you automatically try to identify how those around you might be feeling, and also makes you adept at using that information to make things better for everyone. ‘Mum-employees’ are often able to use that newfound empathy to to maneuver through challenges that others might find overwhelming.\nDetermination\nMums are determined. As a rule, they will generally do anything necessary to get the best for their children. This often makes firms worry that what is best for their child will not be best for the company. But if you can make the employee’s and your needs align, you will win a worker who is willing to go to the mat — with more tenacity than any other hire.\nMoms should not be seen as high-risk employees, but rather as high-potential team members — as an indication of the qualities she will bring to the company that employs her.\nSource: www.inc.com\n lifestyle career employment hypothetical paternity Also Read India’s first ever 'condom fashion show' to help raise awareness Watch: The secret to stress relief revealed What's your hemline story this season?
