Last year, he announced that he would withdraw US forces from Afghanistan in 2016, saying it was “time to turn the page” on a decade of wars. \nIn addition to handing the Afghan war on to the next president, Mr Obama was forced to return troops to Iraq to tackle Isis extremists after he had removed US forces from the country. The president is also highly unlikely to achieve another of his top foreign policy goals — shutting Guantánamo Bay. \nMr Obama said he changed strategy because the Afghan security forces were still not strong enough to fend off the Taliban. He said US forces would remain to train Afghan forces and support counter-terrorist operations. The move also comes as the US worries about Isis operating inside Afghanistan. \n“I know that many of you have grown weary of this conflict. As you are well aware, I do not support the idea of endless war,” he said. “Yet, given what’s at stake in Afghanistan . . . I am firmly convinced that we should make this extra effort.” \nJens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of Nato, welcomed the US move, saying it “demonstrates the continued commitment by Nato Allies and our partners towards Afghanistan”. \n“The Afghan security forces continue to carry out their security responsibilities across the country, in a very challenging environment. So it’s crucial that we continue to support them, practically and financially, to preserve the gains we have achieved in Afghanistan through our joint efforts over many years.” \nWhile Mr Obama has won two major foreign policy victories in recent months — the Iran nuclear deal and a new era in relations with Cuba after decades of hostility — he has been haunted by Afghanistan, and faces a dogged threat from Isis in Iraq and Syria. He is also confronted by Russia’s intervention in Syria and an increasingly assertive China in the South China Sea. \nRichard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, said that while the move was “very significant”, the US would have been better served to make that commitment two years ago. But he said Mr Obama should be applauded for being flexible in responding to changing conditions. \n“The big lesson, which the administration has come around to, is that the president may have wanted to end the wars but he doesn’t get to decide on his own when a war will end.” \nOn Thursday, Mr Obama said he was not disappointed about the change in Afghanistan, saying his view “has always been how do we achieve our goals while minimising the strain and exposure on our men and women in uniform and make sure that we are constantly encouraging and sending a message to the Afghan people this is their country and they’ve got to defend it\". \nAfghan and Pentagon officials have for months urged Mr Obama to change course. General John Campbell, the top US commander in Afghanistan, recently told Congress that the US should reconsider plans to withdraw troops in 2016 given the continued strength of the Taliban. \nThat message was amplified after Taliban forces recently seized the northern city of Kunduz, in an embarrassing setback for the government. While Afghan forces later recaptured the city, the temporary fall underscored the resilience of the Taliban more than 14 years after the US invasion. \nThe temporary takeover of Kunduz — which led to an accidental attack by a US military aircraft on a hospital in which 24 died — was just the latest example of the dire security situation facing the one-year-old government of President Ashraf Ghani and his Nato allies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:09:58.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
