Additionally, a GMO-free certification program will provide consumers who choose to purchase non-GMO items a reliable means of doing so.\nThe fly-in, organized by the Coalition for Safe Affordable Food, featured men and women from 22 states who represent the entirety of the nation's food supply chain: farming groups, co-ops, seed producers and food companies. In total, the group had more than 140 meetings on Capitol Hill yesterday.\nParticipants in the fly-in expressed the urgent need for action by the Senate soon on the critical issue.\nMinnesota farmers rely on GMOs to help them grow more crops on less land while using fewer pesticides, less irrigation and limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In 2014, 93 percent of the corn, 94 percent of the soybeans and 95 percent of the sugarbeets grown in Minnesota were genetically modified.\n\"With farming such a vital piece of Minnesota's economy, I was excited by the opportunity to discuss why a uniform, national food labeling standard makes sense for Minnesota farmers today,\" said Anna Boroff , public policy director for the Minnesota Corn Growers Association. \"There is enough unpredictability involved in farming, we certainly don't need more. Unfortunately, if Congress doesn't act soon, that's exactly what will happen. It's time for the Senate to pass reasonable legislation that gives farmers and consumers a consistent, transparent labeling standard.\"\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act in July by a significant 275-150 bipartisan vote, with 45 Democrats voting yes. That legislation would ensure that consumers have access to the same science-based information regardless of which state they shop in instead of different state mandates. It would also create a national GMO-free certification program that would provide consumers who prefer GMO-free foods a consistent means of identifying those products.\nThe Coalition for Safe Affordable Food is committed to passing a reasonable, common sense labeling standard this fall and will continue to advocate for food labeling policies that keep prices down and provide reliable and consistent science-based information.\n releases/minnesota-members-of-cfsaf-tell-congress-of-urgent-need-for-uniform-national-food-labeling-standard-300156711.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/minnesota-members-of-cfsaf-tell-congress-of-urgent-need-for-uniform-national-food-labeling-standard-300156711.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH23709&Transmission_Id=201510081142PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH23709&DateId=20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:53:47.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
