He is expected to face the vetting committee, Friday. \nThe Volta Regional NDC regional chairman John Kwadwo Gyapong confirmed to Joy News that they have received various petitions against Mr. Akpadzi and other aspirants. \n“People are saying he [Mr. Akpadzi] is still using EOCO vehicles and other issues. These are issues that are personal and when we get there we will look at it,” he said. \nMr Akpadzi has meanwhile declined comment when Joy News tried to speak to him. \nSome parliamentary aspirants were vetted today in the Volta Region. National Vice Chairman of NDC, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo was happy about the process, and told the media “all has been very smooth”. \nHe said enthusiasm shown by supporters of the aspirants at the vetting venue is indicative of the fact that the “party still enjoys a lot of support” in the Volta Region, which has for decades been the stronghold of the NDC. \nTo minimize acrimony after vetting, he said the panel would ensure that they do a thorough job. \nOne aspirant from the Biakoye Constituency Harry Adjololo voluntarily stepped down from the race. \nTwo people were however disqualified by the committee. They are Kwame Bachabori and Ahmed Muniru from Nkwanta North and Akan respectively. \nKwame Bachabori who crossed carpet from the opposition New Patriotic Party failed to meet the four-year membership requirement to contest as an MP. For Ahmed Muniru he was disqualified on the grounds of going independent in 2012 elections after losing the party primary. \nMr Ofosu Ampfo announced that vetting of aspirants from the Nkwanta South has been withheld for “strategic reason”. Joy News’ sources believe the decision was taken to allow the ethnic tension in the constituency to calm down first. \nThe vetting which took place in various regional centres today will continue tomorrow.
