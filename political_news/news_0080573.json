Alfonse D’Amato (R-N.Y.) staged the second-longest solo filibuster in Senate history on this day in 1992. His dusk-to-dawn talkathon was the first such nonstop event since the Senate inaugurated gavel-to-gavel televised coverage of its floor proceedings in 1986. D’Amato railed against plans by Smith Corona, a typewriter maker, to move some 875 jobs from its upstate New York factory to Mexico in an effort to lower its wage base and to help it compete against lower-priced imports that had entered the U.S. market.\nAmong digressions in the course of his filibuster, which lasted 15 hours and 14 minutes, D’Amato sang “South of the Border (Down Mexico Way).” Had D’Amato spoken for an additional 17 minutes, he would have broken the record Sen. Huey Long (D-La.) set in 1935 when he conducted arguably the most notable filibuster in Senate history — an effort that included his recipes for fried oysters and turnip-green pot liquor.\nD’Amato began speaking around dinnertime and continued into the following morning — so as not to interrupt regular Senate business, a consideration that rarely arose in the filibusters of the pre-TV era. His ostensible object was to amend a pending $27 billion tax bill so as to decrease the company’s incentive to move. He abandoned his quest after the House adjourned for the year, dooming any chance that his proposed amendment would be included in the final legislation.\nAs a dark-horse candidate, D’Amato had defeated incumbent Sen. Jacob Javits in the 1980 Republican primary, after Javits had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, an invariably fatal illness. D’Amato was reelected that November by 90,000 votes out of 6 million cast. He lost his Senate seat in 1998 to Rep. Chuck Schumer after having labeled his Democratic opponent a “putzhead” in a meeting with Jewish constituents.\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:01:53.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
