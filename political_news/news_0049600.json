We still are stuck, there’s still gridlock.” \nAnd while that jab could’ve been aimed at any one of four incumbent senators in the GOP field, his next one was a bit more specific. \n“By the way,” Bush added a few moments later, “I think if congressmen and -women are elected to serve, they actually ought to show up and vote.” \nThat shot was unmistakably meant for Rubio, who has caught flak in recent days for missing Senate votes while campaigning for president. And it wasn’t the end of Bush’s tirade against senators. \n“We did something that has been lost, I think, a lot in public life, which is, when someone had a problem, I tried to fix it,” he said of his time as Florida governor. “I didn’t try to yap about it. I didn’t file an amendment and call it success.” \nThe contrasts drawn between Bush and Rubio by their respective campaigns have sharpened recently , as Rubio has risen in polling and the competition between them intensifies for Republicans seen as more moderate or aligned with the party’s establishment. \nStill, when asked by an event attendee in Muscatine about his willingness to attack other candidates, Bush suggested he would do no such thing. \n“I’ve got to tell the Jeb story. I’ve got to say who I am. I’ve got to show my heart,” Bush said. He added, “I want to show that I have a servant’s heart. Tearing down everybody else isn’t going to help me show that I have servant’s heart.” \nMuscatine retiree and event attendee Robert Bolton appreciated hearing more about Bush’s gubernatorial record in Florida, and said he did prefer the background and experiences that governors and non-politicians might bring to the presidency. \n“I’m not a fan of senators that run for president, because they’re part of Washington to begin with,” he said. “They don’t necessarily understand what goes on outside of Washington.” \nThat said, Bolton cautioned that he wasn’t committed to Bush and was still weighing his options for the caucuses. \nABOUT THE EVENT \nSETTING: In Muscatine, Bush spoke at Elly’s Tea and Coffee on a crowded sunporch with Mississippi riverfront views. In Oskaloosa, he met diners at Smokey Row, the iconic downtown diner that routinely plays host to presidential candidates and other political aspirants. \nCROWD: About 80 in Muscatine, and around 100 in Oskaloosa. \nREACTION: Bush received positive receptions from both crowds, drawing cheers throughout his remarks and question-and-answer session and attracting a mob of photo- and autograph-seekers after he spoke. \nWHAT’S NEXT: Bush continues a three-day Iowa swing on Thursday with a morning speech to the Greater Des Moines Partnership’s Iowa Caucus Consortium in Des Moines and a lunchtime meet and greet at Pizza Ranch in Indianola.
