Share article \nThe Crown Prosecution Service has previously stressed that it \"at no point made any request to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) that they reopen their investigation into Lord Brittan in relation to complaints highlighted by Tom Watson\". \nIt also pointed out that the peer was interviewed before it had forwarded the MP's letter to police.
