Instead, Ryan said he plans to return home to Janesville, Wis., to spent time with his wife and three young children.\nDemocrats seized on Ryan's appeal for seemingly fewer work hours than typical House speakers, and say his demand dovetails with Democratic calls for the House to approve paid medical leave, sick leave and other family-friendly legislation that Ryan has opposed.\n\"I hope that respect for his particular situation would translate to a recognition for what that means for all American families,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday of Ryan's desire for a reduced work schedule.\n  Obama defends DOD veto as a move against 'gimmicks' \"I'm going to be sending it back to Congress; and my message to them is very simple: Let's do this right.\"\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/22/15 5:47 PM Pelosi called Ryan's desire to eschew work for his family, \"very exciting,\" and suggested it might influence Ryan to change his mind on his past budget proposals to reduce the cost of Medicare, which she said could hurt seniors.\n\"Maybe in praise of family there will be a change of heart as to how it affects the welfare of seniors,\" Pelosi said.\nConservatives already skeptical of Ryan taking the speaker's gavel were unhappy with the request, which to some seemed like an indication he does not really want the job.\n\"The speaker's position adversely affects his personal life and his family commitments,\" Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., said. \"He does not have time to do the speaker's job as it has been done in the past. And I am troubled by the insistence by many members that we put him in a position he has shown a reluctance to take.\"\nRyan didn't back down from his request for a shorter work week after Republicans pushed back on it in a private meeting earlier this week.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Here's why I didn't fire anyone over Benghazi debacle Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., was the first to ask why no one has been fired yet.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/22/15 1:26 PM \"Hey look, I'm here four days a week as it is,\" Ryan told The Hill. \"I'm not going to spend the other three days a week running around America.\"\nConservative pundits accused Ryan of handing a gift to the 2016 Democratic presidential candidates, who are pushing legislation requiring paid family leave, which most Republicans believe would harm the economy.\n\"Gaffe gaffe gaffe...a legislative mastermind like Ryan gives Hillary & Co. a free goal in first few secs of play,\" conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham tweeted.\nHouse and Senate lawmakers have long adhered to a Washington, D.C., workweek of just three or four days. But most do not return home for rest and relaxation, and instead conduct town hall meetings and other official business in their districts. House Republicans have in recent years added to the calendar more time away from Washington, which they call district work periods.\nBut the speaker often remains in Washington, D.C., or gets on the road for fundraisers that are critical for helping to elect and re-elect House Republicans and keep the majority in the hands of the GOP.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Netanyahu urges Kerry to reject Palestinian 'lies' Netanyahu spoke alongside Kerry as Palestinian-inspired attacks continued.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/22/15 5:14 PM Boehner said he came up with a compromise that would allow Ryan to do some fundraising during district work periods but skip the weekend trips.\n\"I think there's a way to do that,\" Boehner said. \"And I frankly outlined over the last week or so a way that Paul could do this differently than the way I did it.\"\nTop Story Gowdy scolds Benghazi Dems for focus on 'money,' not 'heroism' Gowdy tore into Democrats at the Benghazi hearing for complaining about the $5 million price tag Thursday.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/22/15 4:34 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:00:54.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
