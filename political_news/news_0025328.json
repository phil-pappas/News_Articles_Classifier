She lost significant support in the polls and became mired in another government investigation . But as she heads into the first Democratic debate on Tuesday, the news is not all bad . In August, the survey research firm YouGov re-interviewed 1,418 people it contacted in May. The second interviews showed whether voters stood by their initial choices or moved to a different candidate over the summer. It turns out that Mrs. Clinton’s summer wasn’t all about losses. There were some gains as well. A quarter of her May supporters abandoned her over the summer, but she also picked up nearly half that many voters from her rivals. Moreover, a large majority of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, 75 percent, stuck with her throughout the summer despite the rising popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders and the potential candidacy of Vice President Joe Biden . OCT. 8, 2015 Of the nearly 700 Democrats in the survey, 73 percent stuck with their initial choices over the summer, and 23 percent shopped around at least once. Mrs. Clinton was not alone in holding on to her early fans. Mr. Sanders kept 85 percent of his May voters, and Mr. Biden maintained 72 percent of his supporters. Of course, Mrs. Clinton started with many more voters than the others, and Mr. Biden has not yet said if he will enter the race. Voters may start to shift around more if Mr. Biden jumps in or after they see the candidates up close in Tuesday’s prime-time debate.

Credit Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press Voters who left Mrs. Clinton over the summer paint a portrait of the kind of voter who is susceptible to appeals from other candidates going into the debate. Those who moved away from Mrs. Clinton were more likely to be young, white, female and college-educated relative to those who stayed with her. Of the 25 percent who left Mrs. Clinton, most switched to support Mr. Sanders (15 percent), while 6 percent moved to Mr. Biden, and 4 percent jumped on board with other candidates or became unsure of their choice. And what about those who were attracted to Mrs. Clinton in her summer of decline? Their characteristics illustrate what types of voters might leave the other candidates after Tuesday’s debate and join Team Clinton. Of the 12 percent of Mr. Biden’s initial voters and 10 percent of Mr. Sanders’s voters who moved to Mrs. Clinton over the summer, 57 percent were nonwhite. Only 26 percent of the voters who stayed with these other Democrats over the summer were nonwhite, a comparison that drives home Mrs. Clinton’s appeal in the black and Latino communities. Those who moved to Mrs. Clinton were also more likely to be men — 57 percent of Mrs. Clinton’s new voters were men compared with 41 percent of those voters who stuck with one of the other candidates over the summer. Of those who switched to Mrs. Clinton, 80 percent did not have a four-year college degree. Only 65 percent of those who stayed with one of her rivals were in this category. With the exception of men, those moving to Mrs. Clinton look a lot like the set of people who initially supported her.

Bernie Sanders picked up a majority of those who left her.
