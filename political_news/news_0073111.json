In places like Dallas, Phoenix and Minneapolis, retirees can pay for housing, food, transportation, health care and utilities on $100 per day.\nBy Emily Brandon Oct. 13, 2015 | 8:00 a.m. EDT + More\nYou can retire sooner or with less savings if you are willing to significantly cut your expenses. One way to quickly lower your retirement costs is to move to a place with a low cost of living.\nReducing your housing costs can add to your retirement savings and make your ongoing bills more affordable. \"Downsizing to a less expensive, more manageable house has numerous benefits,\" says Paul Staib, a certified financial planner for Staib Financial Planning in Aurora, Colorado. \"You could use the proceeds from the sale of your current home to add to your retirement savings, thereby providing a bigger source of retirement income, while significantly potentially cutting other housing-related costs, including property taxes, insurance, utilities and ongoing maintenance and management costs.\"\nU.S. News analyzed U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics data to determine where a retiree could cover his or her basic expenses, including typical costs for housing, food, transportation, health care and utilities, with less than $100 per day, or $36,500 per year, in retirement income.\nIt's important to note that in many of these cities $100 a day just barely covered these five basic expenses. The analysis does not factor in the costs for recreation, clothing, consumer goods, hobbies or travel. A little extra income from savings or a part-time job would make you much more comfortable living in many of these places.\nHousing costs are the biggest driver of retirement expenses, but they also vary considerably based on whether retirees rent, own or have paid off their mortgage, with homeowners who are living mortgage-free paying the lowest housing costs. \"You can't eliminate housing costs 100 percent because you still have property taxes to pay and insurance, but you could live with less if you find someplace that is cheaper for you to live or if you can get rid of your mortgage,\" says Edward Fulbright, a certified public accountant and CEO of Fulbright Financial Consulting in Durham, North Carolina. It's also important to factor in the transaction and moving costs when you relocate to a new city .\nHere are 10 places where it's possible to cover basic monthly costs on just $100 a day:\nAurora, Colorado. Aurora has 97 parks and over 5,000 acres of open space for hiking, biking and fishing.
