She kept her mouth closed about higher-ups who certainly were involved. Now the DOJ is going to sweep the whole thing under the rug and blame it on bad management and conservatives' imaginations. \nThe lawsuit filed by many of those affected groups continues to wend its way through the court system. It may wind up being settled right around the time we have a Republican Administration that could take a fresh look at criminal charges, with any luck. \nBut for now, the Obama Administration has solidified its legacy as one of the most corrupt ever to exist. Let's hope all the people who voted for Obama twice are proud of their accomplishment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:22:16.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
