It was a Browning 12-gauge shotgun, and I saved money from my paper route and cleaning a drive-in restaurant to buy it in time for dove season. In the years before I could legally drive, I'd tie the Browning across the handlebars of my bike and ride to the fields outside town to hunt.\nI've owned several guns since, and own a ha ndgun now. I bought that gun to keep my family safe, and lock it up to keep them safe from it. Like I said, responsible.\nAnd so while I'd like to believe I'm not part and party to the gun violence that stains America, I can't. My grandmother shot and killed herself with a gun, and a few years ago my father shot and didn't quite kill himself with one. My stepbrother died in a murder-suicide with a gun, and the husband of one of my sister's co-workers was killed in a mass shooting.\nNone of that happened with my gun, of course, but after every new mass shooting, I'm reminded that I bear a portion of the responsibility for our nation's gun violence. There are too many guns to do anything about it, the gun lobby says. Regulations are a slippery slope that only limit the rights of responsible gun owners, they say.\nMy gun is being used to argue against common-sense laws and policies that could reduce gun violence in America, arguments I find unconscionable. That's what being a responsible gun owner means today – I'm responsible. I've been uneasy about that for a while now, and ashamed to admit it's taken two more mass shootings for me to do anything about it.\nThat ended today. Today I disassembled my handgun, a 9mm Ruger, clamped the pieces in a vice and cut them in half with an angle grinder. I'm sending the proper paperwork into the state to report it destroyed.\nNone of us individually can stop gun violence in America, but as a responsible gun owner, I will no longer be used as a justification for doing nothing about it. Today I did what I could. Today there is #ONELESSGUN .\n Elliott's story , since shared over 44,000 times, is a common one in the context of American gun culture — early exposure to firearms, a sense of overwhelming normalcy to their use, and, yes, safe storage and responsible habits ​ — ​but the evolution in attitude he traces is less so.\n\"After every new mass shooting, I'm reminded that I bear a portion of the responsibility for our nation's gun violence,\" he says, even if it's never been his gun that's ended up on CNN. ​\"My gun is being used to argue against common-sense laws and policies that could reduce gun violence in America, arguments I find unconscionable. That's what being a responsible gun owner means today — I'm responsible.\"\nMore From Cosmopolitan His implication is that it is in his name that the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups say they are fighting. It is on his behalf, they say, that they're making arguments about how no new gun laws can help, and ones that are enacted can only affect law-abiding gun owners like Elliott. And each mass shooting provides a reminder that this attitude, this defeatism bordering on nihilism, cannot possibly be acceptable.\nBut perhaps the most telling passage speaks to the toll that gun violence has wrought on those close to Elliott. After all, mass shooting deaths make up just a tiny fraction of the over 33,000 people killed by firearms each year. Overwhelmingly, for how loud they are in the moment, gun deaths are a quiet phenomenon. It is the suicides, often alone in one's own home, like his grandmother's, that add up to over 20,000 Americans dead each year. It is the murder of a family member, like the one in which his stepbrother was involved, that ​illustrates the daily brutality of this American epidemic, far more than any mass shooting. ​\nBut for all the positive reception to his post, it seems not everyone will be following his lead.
