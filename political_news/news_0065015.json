Any reasonable person would think this length of time pumping money into the slots is a worry. The fact SkyCity seems to think this is okay, shows it has a warped view of what is problem gambling. \n\"This is the second time in two years that SkyCity has been caught out by the media demonstrating zero host responsibility in allowing people to gamble for hours on end. \n\"Last time, I made a complaint to Department of Internal Affairs Gambling Compliance, which found SkyCity had been negligent in its host responsibility obligations. \n\"SkyCity have obviously learned nothing from that experience, as they have again been caught out as rogue corporate failing to show any host responsibility. \n\"I’ll be making another complaint to Gambling Compliance and hope this time some stronger action, such as a suspension of SkyCity’s casino licence for a short period, may teach it to show some responsibility in addressing problem gambling. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:25.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
