( Reuters ) In an exclusive interview with The Brody File, Ted Cruz says he's the only republican presidential candidate that's been, \"walking the walk.\" What about his rivals? \"The other candidates have not,\" Cruz tells The Brody File.\nCruz points to the fight over Planned Parenthood, which he says he led, and others just talked a good game: \"I was proud to lead that fight and it was striking that out of the other 10 fine men and women standing on that debate stage not a one of them was anywhere to be found. It was almost like they were in the witness protection plan. It's very easy when the TV cameras are on you in the debate and say you support it. But can you imagine how different that fight would have been if all eleven major republican presidential candidates descended on Washington, spoke in unison and said, 'Mitch McConnell and John Boehner stop sending 500 million dollars of taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood. That would have been leadership and I think the reason conservatives are coalescing around our campaign is because I've been walking the walk and the other candidates have not.\"\nWe're starting to see Cruz mix it up more now as the campaign season heats up. Cruz and his campaign team has been methodical since this presidential season began. They know what they're doing and are fully aware of the cadence and pace to a presidential campaign. Cruz has issues as it relates to winning a General Election but can he win the nomination? He's got a realistic shot.\nWatch the video below.\n ", "external_links": ["http://shop.charismamag.com/collections/life-in-the-spirit/products/life-in-the-spirit?utm_source=charismanews.com&utm_medium=article", "https://secure.strangmagazines.com/~strangma/charisma/2015/40years/?utm_source=charismanews.com&utm_medium=article", "http://cbn.com/tv/embedplayernews.aspx?bcid=4565859003001"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:31:32.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
