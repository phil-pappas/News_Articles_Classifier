Echoing comments she has made before, Clinton said her decision to not use a government email address was a mistake, but she emphasized that she wanted to focus her energy on policy issues that were more important to voters. Sanders unexpectedly came to her aid. “Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right,” he said. “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/14/us-usa-election-democrats-idUSKCN0S70B920151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:34:16.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
