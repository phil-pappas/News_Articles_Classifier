The vast majority are not against IS at all.\n\"Our evidence indicates they are dropping unguided munitions in civilian areas, killing civilians, and they are dropping them against the Free Syrian forces fighting Assad.\n\"He's shoring up Assad and perpetuating the suffering.\"\nMr Fallon denied that Russia's involvement had left Europe and the US looking weak.\n\"I don't accept he has outmanoeuvred us. He has complicated the situation in Syria. But we're not powerless.\"\nShare article He indicated that the changed circumstances would not prevent the Government pressing ahead with making the case to extend the RAF's strikes against IS from Iraq into Syria.\nIt would be \"morally wrong\" not to target IS in Syria, he said, adding: \"We can't leave it to French and Australian, American aircraft to keep our own British streets safe.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:43:16.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
