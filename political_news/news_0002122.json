(Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst) Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talks with Democratic members of congress as she returns to resume her testimony after a lunch break at the House Select Committee on Benghazi about the attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Capitol Hill in Washington October 22, 2015. \nIn the time leading up to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, U.S. officials at the facility had to acquire physical security items from other nations, such as the U.K., that were pulling out of the area. \nDuring a hearing of the House Select Committee on Benghazi Thursday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was questioned about security at the compound and her actions leading up to and in reaction to the attack in which four Americans were killed by Islamic militats, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. \nQuestioning Clinton about security, Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, noted that there are \"certain levels of security\" for consulates and embassies that vary depending on their importance. \nBrooks specifically asked Clinton about an email correspondence between Stevens and another State Department official in which it was mentioned that the Americans were forced to buy \"fire sale\" security items from other Western countries because they weren't being provided by the Obama administration. \n\"Those â€¦ fire sale items were barricades. They are additional requests for security for the compound. That's what that fire sale was,\" said Brooks to Clinton.

Isn't that right? So they're picking up a fire sale because other consulates are pulling out.\" \nClinton replied that she thought the fire sale that the Benghazi consulate employees were doing \"showed their entrepreneurial spirit\" and argued that improvements to the compound security had been done.
