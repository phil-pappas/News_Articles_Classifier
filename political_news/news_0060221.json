Paul Ryan infuriated House Freedom Caucus members on Tuesday night when he said he couldn’t live under the constant threat of a procedural motion to oust him if he were to become House speaker. Ryan (R-Wis.) said the process to declare the speaker’s office vacant — essentially booting the speaker from his position — needs to change.\nMany members of the Freedom Caucus thought he meant he wanted to get rid of the so-called motion to vacate. But in conversations with Republican lawmakers over the past 12 hours, Ryan has refined his remarks, and is floating a series of reforms to the procedure.\nCurrently, the motion to vacate can be filed as a \"privileged\" motion. That means any member can bring it up and it becomes the immediate business of the House. In the House’s current configuration, only 29 Republicans are needed to remove the speaker of the House.\nCongress\nHow Paul Ryan got to (almost) yes By Jake Sherman , John Bresnahan and Anna Palmer\nRyan has discussed raising the threshold to bring a motion to vacate to the floor, perhaps by mandating an internal party vote first. He also has suggested stripping it of its privileged status, so 218 votes would be needed to bring it up. He has discussed raising the threshold of passage to a two-thirds majority, but that has lost steam because Democrats then would be needed to remove a Republican speaker.\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a leader of the Freedom Caucus, said Ryan’s proposal wasn’t specific in his Tuesday night speech to the House Republican Conference.\n“Does that mean you want to get rid of it entirely? I would oppose that,” Mulvaney said. “I like Paul Ryan a lot, I like Thomas Jefferson better. But if the proposal is it’s going to be harder to file, different circumstances under which you vote on it, we’ll talk that through as friends and colleagues.”\nRyan is set to meet with the Freedom Caucus Wednesday afternoon.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:01:08.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
