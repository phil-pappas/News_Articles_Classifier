Ryan in Janesville, Wis., his hometown, in 2012. He spent the weekend there as he considered entreaties from Republicans to become House speaker.

Ryan stepped out of St. John Vianney Roman Catholic Church after Mass here Saturday evening into the twilight of a cloudless day, far removed from the bleating of Washington that had surrounded him roughly 24 hours before. In his hometown, he was not being chased by reporters with microphones or beseeched by his colleagues courting him to be the next speaker of the House. Instead, he was among friends and neighbors, shooting the breeze as he meandered across a large suburban parking lot. “Hey, Paul, what are the odds?” one of them asked about the chances he would try to ascend to the office second in the line of succession to the presidency. A knowing Mr. Ryan stopped, smiled and gestured toward the lone journalist in the crowd. “He’s a reporter,” he said, by way of apology, and kept walking. But the question is on many minds in Janesville, a town of blue-collar workers, still suffering from the idling of a General Motors plant almost seven years ago, and of well-to-do families like the Ryans. The people here seem almost as conflicted as Mr. Ryan himself professes to be. OPEN Graphic Mr. Ryan has called Janesville home since childhood, and he helped put it on the political map as an adult when he was named Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate in 2012. It is also where he came during the weekend to be surrounded by a tight-knit circle of family and longtime friends as he ponders an answer. He appears to have spent Saturday morning bow hunting (a local pastime and favorite hobby of Mr. Ryan’s) and the afternoon around the house with family, including his older brother, Tobin Ryan, who has served as something of an informal political adviser throughout his career. As of Saturday evening, despite entreaties from some of the most respected leaders of his party, Mr. Ryan said he had not budged. “I’ve got nothing for you. I’m sorry,” he said as he walked alone toward his Chevrolet Suburban, which bore a Green Bay Packers license plate cover. “I haven’t changed my mind.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But there were signs here that Mr. Ryan, the powerful, numbers-driven chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was still working over the math. “This was all a big surprise to us 48 hours ago, so we’ll see,” Tobin Ryan said as he perused a farmers’ market downtown with his wife earlier in the day. “We’re just praying for him that he gets the kind of contemplation he needs with his family to make this decision.” It was a sentiment shared across Janesville over the weekend, by Mr. Ryan’s supporters and critics — of whom there are many here — alike. Though the ascension of a local son to one of the most powerful perches in American government could help bring federal attention and investment that residents said this city badly needed, most people here said Mr. Ryan should make the right decision for himself, by himself. Neighbors doing yard work Saturday afternoon wished their friend up the street well but said they had made a habit of not commenting to the press. Patrick Lyons, a close friend of Mr. Ryan’s since childhood, declined to share his thoughts. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Roz Thorpe, who raised her family across the street from the Ryans when Paul was young, said she would be “very surprised” if Mr. Ryan took the job, but then again she had not yet spoken to him since he had returned to town. Janesville residents of the type who occasionally see Mr. Ryan around town or share mutual friends were less circumspect, though few could agree on how the speakership would affect Mr. Ryan’s high-potential career, what role family considerations might play in the decision and what it might mean for their city. Outside the Citrus Cafe, a popular diner on Main Street, Karl Anderson explained between puffs of a cigarette that though he was not a big Ryan supporter, he thinks the congressman’s perseverance under pressure is wise. With Representative Kevin McCarthy’s stunning decision to withdraw from the race for speaker on Thursday, the Republican leadership elections were turned upside down. The competitive races were supposed to be those for lower-tier positions. Now the big uncertainty is who the next speaker will be. “The party is just not united enough for him — it would be kind of a death sentence,” Mr. Anderson, 47, said, emphasizing that he thinks Mr. Ryan’s only obligation should be to the citizens of his district. “Who wants that job?” he said again. “My god, who wants to be that? It’s a chopping block.” Across town at the weekly farmers’ market, where shoppers examined kettle corn and kringle on a closed-off commercial district street, Jenifer Jelinek, a 33-year-old Democrat, largely agreed. “I feel like out of our choices, he’s a little bit better,” she said. “But I think given the Republican House, he’s not going to get any more done than Boehner. You can’t win, because any compromise they refer to as capitulation.” Even people who said Mr. Ryan should succeed Speaker John A. Boehner did so with an asterisk. “I think he should take it. I think he’s the best qualified,” said Howard Hoekman, a Janesville resident, before qualifying that view just a few seconds later. “It’s probably not good for his family, no,” he added. “If I was him, I wouldn’t do it.” Others, like Sister Marie Lucette, a nun who works at St. Elizabeth, a nursing home up the street from the Ryans’ home, and who knows the family, said she would not presume to make a judgment on what she said was really a family matter. “He’s a prayerful man,” she said, “so he should follow his heart.” Even if Mr. Ryan enters the race, support from the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, which helped force Mr. Boehner’s resignation, is not assured. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the caucus’s chairman, said on “Fox News Sunday” that though the group “would look favorably” on a Ryan candidacy, Mr. Ryan would be expected to address its agenda. Mr. Ryan, seemed to be doing much of that contemplating at home in his stately six-bedroom, red brick, 5,800-square-foot colonial in Janesville’s Courthouse Hill neighborhood, where he has lived since 2010 with his wife, Janna, and three children, ages 10, 12, and 13. In a largely industrial and aging city, the neighborhood stands out for its handsome architecture and placement on a hill above the city. On Saturday, Mr. Ryan’s children played in the sprawling back yard, which nestles against a patch of woods and includes a tennis court. Neighbors made use of the sun-dappled day to catch up on outdoor chores or prepare for homecoming at one of the local high schools. For much of the day, the only movement around Mr. Ryan’s home belonged to falling leaves and an American flag tossed by the wind. The weekend offered the kind of weekly retreat that Mr. Ryan covets and that he has suggested he would be unwilling to give up for the House speakership, which requires long hours and frequent travel for fund-raising. (Mr. Boehner has in some years spent more than 200 days on the road.) Mr. Ryan’s views are shaped in part by his father’s early death from a heart attack, when Mr. Ryan was just 16, and time with his three young children is scant enough given his work weeks in Washington. “It’s his oxygen to be here and be with his family,” Ms. Ryan told The Janesville Gazette in a rare interview in August. And it is a refuge. He spent Sunday, like so many in his state, worshiping the unofficial state religion: watching the Packers game. \nFollow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
