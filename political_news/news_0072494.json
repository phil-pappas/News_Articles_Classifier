Comey, said Thursday that he was certain the bureau would be able to complete the investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s personal email account in a timely manner and that he would make sure politics did not interfere with it.\n“I am following this very closely, and I get briefed on it regularly,” Mr. Comey said at a quarterly meeting with reporters at F.B.I. headquarters.\nHe added, “I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, as we do all our work, so that we are able to do it in a professional, prompt and independent way.”\n Related Coverage 3 Hillary Clinton Emails Deemed ‘Secret’ in State Dept. Review of 6,300 Pages SEPT. 30, 2015 String of Emails Raises Questions About When Hillary Clinton Began Using Personal Account SEPT. 25, 2015 Hillary Clinton Email Inquiry Weighs if Aides Erred at ‘Send’ SEPT. 24, 2015 The F.B.I. opened an investigation this summer into how classified materials were handled in connection with Mrs. Clinton’s account when she was secretary of state in response to a referral from the inspector general of the intelligence community. The inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III , had said that sensitive national security information had been found in the account. It is illegal to have classified information on an unsecure network.\nMrs. Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has said that she complied with all federal laws and regulations regarding email use.\nMr. Comey declined to discuss the specifics of the inquiry, but said that one of the reasons he has a 10-year term as director was “to make sure this organization stays outside of politics.”\n“If you know my folks, you know they don’t give a rip about politics,” Mr. Comey said. “And my job as director of the F.B.I. is to ensure that we remain those things I said we are: competent, honest and independent — and that we do our work well. Part of doing our work well is we don’t talk about it while we do it.”\nMr. Comey declined to answer a question about whether he would make the results of the investigation public when it is completed, even if charges are not filed. He said that lawmakers on Capitol Hill had asked him recently about the investigation, but he said that he had declined to discuss it with them.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/25/us/25emails/24emails-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/01/us/01emails/01emails-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://www.dni.gov/index.php/about/leadership/inspector-general", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/26/us/26emails_web1/26emails_web1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:06:14.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
