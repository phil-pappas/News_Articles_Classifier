According to the schedule, God willing, the first phase of the new airport in Istanbul will be operational in the first quarter of 2018,\" Erdogan said at a ceremony to finalise funding for the project.\nHe gave no reason for the delay.\nThe third airport, close to the Black Sea, is expected to initially handle 90 million passengers a year and more than 150 million when fully operational.\nIt hopes to rival Dubai's Al Maktoum International airport, which opened in 2013 and can accommodate 160 million passengers a year.\n\" Turkey 's biggest project\" has an estimated cost of over 32 billion euros ($36 million), Erdogan said.\nThe president is frequently criticised for his ambitious construction projects for the city of 16 million people, with detractors slamming them as excessive and damaging to the environment.\nThe airport is based in a heavily forested area near Terkos Lake, one of Istanbul's main drinking-water reservoirs.\nThe project was announced in May 2013 amid mass protests that started as a local environmental campaign to save Istanbul's Gezi Park from redevelopment and evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement.\nErdogan has accused protesters of trying to hamper Turkey 's growth by criticising the airport project, and he said Monday that \"the same 'lobby' carries on with its sabotages today\" -- without linking the remarks to the delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:29:46.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
