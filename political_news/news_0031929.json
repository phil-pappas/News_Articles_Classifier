You will note that I purposely did not say, \"Mayor.\" While that is her highest and most important office, it is not the only one at which she has worked tirelessly. \nShe has given freely of her time to do commendable work with the animal shelter as well, a constituency of dogs, cats and other animals which cannot even vote for her.\nNo matter what one's political persuasions may be, we can all recognize Bettina Bieri's efforts to make our community a better place to live and we should be grateful for her accomplishments. She deserves to be reelected as our mayor.\nJames W.
