Governments will then be required to ensure there is a surplus in \"normal times\"\nAt the Labour Party conference in September, Mr McDonnell pledged support for Mr Osborne's plans, saying Labour were not \"deficit deniers\".\nHe told the Guardian : \"We accept we are going to have to live within our means and we always will do - full stop.\n\"We will support the charter on the basis we are going to want to balance the book, we do want to live within our means and we will tackle the deficit.\"\nBut on Monday the shadow chancellor signalled a change of position on the policy.\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Osborne says governments should run a budget surplus \"to bear down on debt and prepare for an uncertain future\" \"We will underline our position as an anti-austerity party by voting against the charter on Wednesday,\" he said.\n\"Labour will set out our plan for tackling the deficit not through punishing the most vulnerable and decimating our public services but by ending the unfair tax cuts to the wealthy, tackling tax evasion and investing for growth.\"\nResponding to Labour's decision, Mr Osborne said: \"Labour's economic policy has lurched from chaos to incredibility.\n\"Two weeks ago ‎they said they were going to vote for a surplus - now we know they want to keep on borrowing forever. That would be a grave threat to the economic security of working people‎.\"\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will be responsible for policing the new rules, which were first proposed by Mr Osborne in January 2015, and confirmed in his post-election Budget in June.\nThe OBR is also expected to have the power to decide when the government should be able to spend more than it is taking in revenue, for example, when the country is in a recession.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6B24/production/_86082472_029340570-1.jpg", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-will-match-osborne-and-live-within-our-means", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9CDE/production/_86085104_029441561-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:49:12.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
