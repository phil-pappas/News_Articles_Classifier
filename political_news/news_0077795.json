It was a bit odd that the state's finances didn't get more attention during the first televised debate of the campaign season.\nThere were no direct questions about taxes or even accepting Medicaid expansion, which would have a profound effect on the state's financial picture. There was one question about higher education funding -- but it was during the \"lightning round\" when candidates were only given a minute to respond. By contrast, about 10 minutes was handed over to discuss issues surrounding same-sex marriage and religious freedom.\nMedical marijuana efforts may struggle if Vitter becomes governor.\nThe Louisiana Legislature -- with the support of Gov. Bobby Jindal -- passed a bill last spring to give state residents access to medical marijuana under restricted circumstances.\nThree of the major candidates -- Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and state Rep. John Bel Edwards -- said they supported the new law, and would tweak it to make it more workable.\nBut U.S. Sen. David Vitter didn't seem interested in making medical marijuana accessible at all. He called the recent bill passed by the Legislature problematic, and said that he was uncomfortable with medical marijuana in general.\nThe new medical marijuana law has hit a few roadblocks. For example, LSU and Southern University are the only institutions with the authority to grow marijuana for medicinal use under the new state regulations, and neither university is ready to commit to doing that yet. In some ways, it doesn't seem like Louisiana is any closer to having medical marijuana now than it was before the new law was enacted by the Legislature in June.\nStill, an all out rejection of medicinal marijuana by Vitter would be a departure from the Jindal administration's approach. Jindal had been supportive of making medical marijuana available -- so long as it was tightly controlled.\nAll the major candidates belong to a gun rights or hunting organization.\nThe three Republican candidates in the race all belong to the National Rifle Association and Edwards, the only Democrat running, is a member of a local hunting organization in his community. (At one point, Edwards served on the organization's board.)\nThree candidates -- Angelle, Vitter and Edwards -- brought up personal experiences with hunting during the debate, as a way of signaling they would be supportive of gun owners' rights. Dardenne never made a personal reference to hunting, instead focusing on how important hunting was to Louisiana tourism and its economy.\nEdwards is finally facing some attacks.\nThe three major Republican candidates have spent most of the campaign so far beating up each other -- leaving Edwards, the only Democrat in the race, mostly alone.\nBut Vitter launched a few preliminary attacks against Edwards during the debate. On two different occasions, he brought up the fact that Edwards had voted for and supported President Barack Obama. In the future, it appears Vitter will try to tie Edwards to Obama, who is unpopular in Louisiana.\nRecent polling shows Edwards might be attractive to a wide spread of voters, including those who don't typically support Democrats. This makes Edwards more of a threat to the Republicans than some might have originally thought.\nThe debate moderator didn't go near Vitter's 2007 prostitution scandal.\nWDSU anchor Scott Walker did not bring up a single question about Vitter's 2007 prostitution scandal or even ask a more general question about all the candidates' personal struggles, which might have forced Vitter to address the topic.\nThe scandal stems from events eight years ago when Vitter's telephone number was found in the records of the so-called D.C. Madam, Deborah Jeane Palfrey, who was accused in federal court of racketeering by running a prostitution ring that netted more than $2 million over 13 years.\nQuestions about personal issues aren't unusual for political debates. Vitter's scandal came up during debates in 2010. U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy and Mary Landrieu were also asked more generally about personal challenges during their debates in the 2014 U.S. Senate race. Yet Vitter managed to escape the WDSU debate without having to answer any uncomfortable questions about his personal life.\nThat didn't stop Vitter's opponents from bringing up prostitution though. Angelle said Vitter is wrong \"on fornication\" at one point, and Dardenne made a reference to legalizing prostitution in Louisiana (though he did not specifically mention Vitter in that comment.) Only Edwards refrained from making a indirect reference to the scandal.\n. . . . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge .
