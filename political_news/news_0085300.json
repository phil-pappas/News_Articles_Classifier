Arabia in Yemen had been “the last option” to fight the Shia rebels, known as Houthis, who overthrew the legal Yemeni government by force. The Foreign Minister said that his country conducted the intervention at the request of the Yemeni Government, following the seizure of the presidential palace by the Houthis in March.\nAn Arab coalition led by S. Arabia, performs airstrikes in Yemen targeting Houthis sites since March. However, many of the airstrikes target populated areas and in August, Amnesty International reported that the airstrikes are not precise and caused the death of hundreds of civilians. Then the NGO demanded from the United Nations Human Rights Council to initiate a war crime inquiry in Yemen.\nTwo days ago, New York Times reported that Arab coalition warplanes bombed a wedding party on Yemen’s Red Sea coast on Monday, killing 131 civilians. The US daily underlined that the death toll was difficult to confirm, in part because the bodies of the victims were badly mangled, witnesses said. After the latest incident, UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack saying that “any intentional attack against civilians is considered a serious violation of international humanitarian law (and) violations of international law should be investigated through prompt, effective, independent and impartial mechanisms to ensure accountability.”\nHuman rights abuses in Yemen seems to worry the Dutch diplomats at the UN, as they submitted a resolution at the UN’s Human Rights Council for the establishment of a mission to monitor and report possible right abuses in war-torn Yemen.\nOn 24 September, the Associated Press (AP) reported that the Netherlands tabled a request at the UN Human Rights Council asking for the investigation of human rights abuses in war-torn Yemen. The proposal by the Netherlands, is challenging another resolution co-sponsored by S. Arabia. The S. Arabia resolution was submitted by the Arab Coalition and asks from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, Prince of Jordan, to provide “technical assistance,” to exiled Yemen’s government in order to assess the human rights abuses committed in Yemen.\nHumanitarian catastrophe in Yemen\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the conflict in Yemen has spread rapidly across much of Yemen since mid-March 2015, with devastating consequences for civilians. Partners now estimate that 21.1 million people – 80 per cent of the population – require some form of humanitarian protection or assistance.\nThis figure includes 12.9 million people who continue to struggle with access to sufficient food; 20.4 million people who lack access to safe water or adequate sanitation; 15.2 million without access to health care. In addition, Yemen still has one of the highest rates of chronic and severe malnutrition among children with more than 850,000 children under the age of five acutely malnourished – and this figure expected to sharply rise.\nMore than 1.8 million school-aged children lost access to school due to the conflict, with more than 3,500 schools closed due to insecurity and hundreds damaged or occupied by IDPs and armed groups. A generation of Yemeni children are at risk, with nearly 3 million in total unable to access an education due to conflict, poverty and discrimination.\nYemen’s humanitarian crisis is fuelled by conflict and widespread insecurity, large-scale displacement, civil strife, political instability, chronic food shortages, a breakdown of social services, endemic poverty, and internal and international population movements. The crisis has complex origins and varies in scale across the country. Some needs relate to conflict, but others are due to long-standing underdevelopment and lack of investment in basic social infrastructure and services, poor governance, widespread poverty and lack of access to income.\nCivilians are bearing the brunt of the violence in Yemen, with conflict posing grave risks to their safety and psychosocial well-being. An estimated 12.2 million people are directly affected by the conflict, and partners estimate that 11.4 million people need protection assistance, including 7.3 million children.\nAl-Jubeir said in his UN speech, that S. Arabia provides humanitarian support to Yemen. He also said that S.Arabia provides to Yemeni people employment in the oil-rich country as well as education and health care.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:54:58.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
