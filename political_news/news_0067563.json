This week the OIG responded: No dice. \n“We have determined that the material in the report meets the classification requirements… and is therefore exempt from disclosure,” a letter from the OIG says. “It contains sensitive information on foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources and contains sensitive information concerning vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans or protective services relating to national security. Therefore, your MDR request is denied.” \nThe State Department’s security operations in Libya have been under a microscope since the deadly 2012 attack on an American diplomatic facility in Benghazi , which claimed the lives of four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens. A State Department internal investigation of that incident found that there was a “ systematic failure ” by the department to address the security needs of the Benghazi facility. \nA year and 10 months later, the July 2014 evacuation from Tripoli by American officials was prompted by “freewheeling militia violence” that presented a “very real risk to our personnel,” as Secretary of State John Kerry put it at the time. Militias were battling, in part, over Tripoli’s international airport not far from the U.S. Embassy. \nThe convoy of more than 150 people withdrew at dawn, attempting to keep a low profile in a caravan of armored vehicles, to make a 250-mile overland trip to Tunisia. The U.S. military provided airborne security for the convoy with two nearby F-16s, high-altitude surveillance platforms and two MV-22 Ospreys filled with additional Marines. \nThe white-knuckle evacuation was deemed a success afterwards, but the OIG report was the first to publicly raise questions about State’s actions – questions that remain unclear and unanswered. \nlee.h.ferran@abc.com \nEditor’s Note: The original version of this report said ABC News requested the MDR in August. It was requested in early September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:18:53.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
