Additional buses of DTC with frequency of one or two minutes will be deployed on this route for better facilitation of commuters. \n\"We want to encourage people to use buses, metro, auto rickshaws and other public transport mode so that pollution level could be brought down in Delhi. Cars are one of major sources of pollution in the national capital,\" the transport minister said, adding that there are around 90,000 cars registered with the transport department. \nThe Minister also said that some auto drivers will provide free service to support the Car-Free Day. \nEarlier this month, Police Commissioner B S Bassi had denied permission to Delhi government to hold the programme, citing that the latter did not consult with the force before taking such a decision. \nHowever, the permission to host 'Car-Free Day' was later given after Lt Governor Najeeb Jung intervened in the matter. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:23:54.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
