The expected ascension of Rep. Paul Ryan to House speaker offers the GOP a fresh start after flailing attempts at coordination and bombs thrown all year long between the two chambers under Republican control.\nRyan is said to be much more comfortable with setting expectations about what the Senate can realistically accomplish than was House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who annoyed the Senate GOP with suggestions that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell change Senate rules to make it easier to overrun Democrats.\nGOP senators are expecting a very different attitude from the conservative but pragmatic Ryan (R-Wis.).\n“This will be an opportunity for us to try to refresh the relationship,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who spent countless hours alongside Ryan during his vice presidential run in 2012. “The fact is we have a different system over here, and Paul gets that. I think he’ll be very effective communicating that to his colleagues.”\nThe House’s latest shot at the Senate came in the form of a debt ceiling proposal loaded with conservative goodies, including a proposal that would stifle the Senate minority’s ability to filibuster spending bills. While House Republicans have since ditched that plan, it is emblematic of the turbulence of the first Congress fully under GOP control since the Bush administration.\nThe two chambers have been at odds again and again. First the House tried to use a homeland security spending bill to nix President Barack Obama’s immigration policy, a strategy rejected by McConnell. A dispute between the two chambers over surveillance reform caused a law used to track terrorists to lapse for two days. And in July, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) called a transportation bill proposed by McConnell (R-Ky.) a “piece of sh--.”\nCongress\nHouse Republicans scramble for debt-ceiling plan By John Bresnahan and Jake Sherman\nNow Republicans in both chambers are struggling mightily to raise the debt ceiling in a manner that can appease fiscal conservatives. A House call to Dr. Ryan might be just what this tumultuous relationship needs.\n“He has a lot of friends over here as a result of his presidential campaign and the work on budget negotiations and all that,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “It will probably be an improvement.”\nOne thing Ryan will have trouble doing is corralling the House conservatives who seem to relish tweaking senators as gutless appeasers of Democrats. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), who loathes McConnell’s tactics and strategy, laughed for 10 seconds when he was asked whether Ryan would help ease antagonism toward the Senate and instructed a reporter to “record that laugh and print that.”\n“They should expect us to continue to remind folks back home that the Senate is the problem,” Mulvaney said. “Mitch McConnell overpromised and underdelivered. And he’d better do something about it quick or else he’s going to be back in the minority.”\nThere has always been tension between the two chambers. Uninhibited by the filibuster, the House majority can run roughshod over the minority and jam through as much legislation as it wants; the Senate runs at a pace as languid as an August day and empowers individual members to muck up the best-laid plans.\nRepublicans from both chambers held a rare joint retreat last winter to help set expectations based on those fundamental differences. While Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was blamed as the choke point between the House’s legislation and Obama’s desk, the reality is that the Senate’s rules play a big part, too.\nOften, House members have a revelation about the Senate’s limitations only if they become senators themselves.\n“That’s just baked into the cake. You just have a little bit of institutional rivalry,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). “Maybe this will give us an opportunity to unify. I think that’s the single most important thing: When we’re divided, we basically default to the opposition.”\nSenate Democrats are also intrigued by Ryan’s speakership given his work on a major bipartisan budget deal in 2013 with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). For all their attacks on his budget-slashing reputation, Democrats believe that Ryan’s broad backing by Republicans in both chambers gives him more room to run than Boehner has had in years.\n“He wants our country to function, and I respect him for that,” Murray said.\nIf Ryan can return some sense of normalcy to the House, it could hurt Democratic efforts to use the GOP disarray as a weapon in next year’s elections. Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) have been arguing for months that one-party control of Congress has been a mess, with the threat of government shutdowns and debt defaults constantly hanging over Washington.\n“To the extent that Paul helps us develop better strategy, better messaging and stuff, that would be helpful. What happens or doesn’t happen here [in the Capitol] could certainly influence my race,” said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, one of the most endangered Republicans in 2016. “I’d say he’s going to be a positive influence on my race.”\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester of Montana said he had no intention of using Republicans’ support for Ryan’s budget and its reforms to Medicare as a main point of attack in 2016.\nVitter barely makes Louisiana governor runoff By Kevin Robillard\nTop Republican aides are cautioning against looking to Ryan as a savior. For one thing, they said that the nine-year leadership relationship between McConnell and Boehner basically worked well, and there’s no guarantee that will be replicated by Ryan and his staff.\nPlus, the fundamental balance of power in Congress isn’t going to be changed by Ryan. The Senate is still going to need at least six Democratic votes to clear filibusters, and House Republicans are still going to get mad about it.\nRyan “should give the Senate some confidence that maybe the relationship can get better,” said Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.). The three-term congressman then paused to give the Senate some marching orders on overhauling the filibuster so Republicans can more easily pass their agenda. It was exactly the kind of advice from House members that senators have chafed at.\n“Now, there’s some things obviously they can fix over there … if they don’t want to be the punching bag that they’ve been,” Ribble said. “The American people would embrace it.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:11:30.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
