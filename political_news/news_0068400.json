Companies who believe their profits or market privileges are threatened can sue our government in secretive overseas tribunals,\" says Reid. \n\"Even on the government’s primary metric for success - dairy access - they’ve fallen remarkably short. Protected dairy markets remain mostly intact.\" \n\"The deal also locks in protections for big pharmaceutical companies with biologics patents, this means less competition and higher prices for Pharmac and ultimately New Zealanders,\" says Reid. \n\"Working New Zealanders can have no confidence in this government.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:05:01.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
