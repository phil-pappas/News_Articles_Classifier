(AP) - Gov. Terry McAuliffe is challenging the General Assembly to approve legislation to keep guns out of the hands of people who have committed domestic violence. \nMcAuliffe issued the challenge Wednesday as a report was issued showing that of that 109 homicides involving family members or so-called intimate partners in 2014, 64 were committed with a firearm. \nThe governor heard from people touched by domestic violence and urged the passage of “common sense” legislation to keep firearms out of volatile domestic situations. \nOne proposed bill would prohibit someone who was convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor from purchasing or possessing firearms. \nAttorney General Mark R. Herring also joined McAuliffe in supporting legislation to shield victims of domestic abuse from gun violence. He urged lawmakers to side with victims, not their abusers. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:18:16.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
