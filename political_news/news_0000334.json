What they are looking for are direction and the resources to work.” \nHis promise to members of the party across the 10 regions of the country in this respect, he said, will be to give the party direction. \n“We may not have access to the resources the ruling party may have, but I am fully confident that the little that we get we will put it to use efficiently,” he maintained. \nStop talking at each other \nThe NPP flagbearer, once again, reiterated his appeal to NPP members to desist from running to the media with issues concerning the party, but should, rather, employ the use of internal mechanisms available to the party in the resolution of differences. \n“We must stop talking at each other. We must put aside our personal egos. And we must forget about what we may not like about each other and just do what has brought us all together: to work together and win power to do something productive with it for the benefit of Ghana and Ghanaians,” he said. \nThe NPP flagbearer continued, “It is that simple. It is nothing personal. I don’t have to like the colour of your shirt or socks. I just have to be committed to the goal of the party. What we stand to gain by working together for success is far greater than what we can’t stand about each other, if any.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:15:04.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
