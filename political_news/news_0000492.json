Her name is Jourdan Dunn.\nDunn has been highly successful since she started modeling in 2007. In 2008, she was the first black model to walk a Prada runway in a decade . She is a spokesperson for Maybelline, and in 2014, she was listed as one of Forbes 's top-earning models. She's been on the covers of Vogue , British Vogue, Elle , and i-D magazine. Actually, she's been on the cover of i-D eight times, which is why it's so weird that the magazine totally forgot her name in this tweet:\nWhile promoting their coverage of the Balmain x H&M event, they shared a picture of Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, and Dunn with the caption: \"Kendall, Gigi & more rock their bodies as Backstreet's back at #balmainxhm.\"\nKendall, Gigi & more rock their bodies as Backstreet's back at #balmainxhm : https://t.co/PGfGxXXCuO pic.twitter.com/7WJm6Fx1M7\n— i-D (@i_D) October 21, 2015 Oh, I'm sorry, did Jourdan Dunn changed her name to Moredan Dunn? Is “& More” her new nickname? No? Let Dunn's fans and Twitter supporters provide gentle reminders as to who Dunn is:\n@i_D That \"more\" girl has been on your cover 8 times\n— Faiz Fenty (@Faiz_Fenty) October 21, 2015 i-D has since apologized , but hey, at least they didn’t confuse her with Chanel Iman.\ni-D has and always will champion, 8-time cover star @missjourdandunn .
