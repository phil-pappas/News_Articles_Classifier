(AP Photo/John Locher) A new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll shows Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in a virtual tie in New Hampshire. Clinton received 37 percent support, with Sanders just behind at 35 percent, when Joe Biden is included in the tally. Biden, who has not said if he will run, received 11 percent support, Jim Webb 3 percent, and Martin O'Malley 1 percent. Lincoln Chafee and Lawrence Lessig each received less than 1 percent support. Clinton Wants Congress to Fix Spike in Medicare Bills Sanders had led Clinton in several recent polls of Democratic voters in New Hampshire, but it appears Clinton's strong debate performance on Tuesday helped her standing in the state. Fifty-four percent of likely voters who watched the debate said they felt that Clinton won, compared to just 24 percent for Sanders. \"Clinton's willingness to engage Sanders on gun control established her progressive credentials,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"And her debate performance solidified her standing with New Hampshire Democratic voters, who have her leading her closest rival for the first time since July.\" Half of those polled said they don't think Biden should run for president at this point, while 36 percent said they think he should run.
