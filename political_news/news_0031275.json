Nearly 40 per cent of them were born in New Zealand. \n\"The proportion of Pacific people speaking their heritage languages is declining so it is important that we support communities to keep speaking those languages. That is why these Pacific language weeks are so important,\" Mr Lotu-Iiga says. \nThe 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week later this month. \nA list of events marking Fiji Language Week can be found at www.mpia.govt.nz \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:33:53.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
