Te Ture Whenua MÄori remains the most significant reform of MÄori land in this generation. I am serious about helping tÄngata whenua to better utilise their land and it’s imperative the right measures are in place to make that happen\", he says. \nMr Flavell says \"The Ministerial Advisory Group has extensively consulted with the public, and is continuing to engage widely on the Bill and related changes, so MÄori land owners can continue to influence the proposed reforms. I will continue to inform the public\", he says. \nMinister Flavell has made public consultation a priority, with an exposure draft allowing people to have an input, while specific workshops have been held for stakeholder groups and Te Puni KÅkiri has facilitated workshops when requested. \n\"I extended both the public submission date and the timeframe to table the Bill in the House allowing people more time to tell me what they think. There will also be another opportunity for public submissions once the Bill goes to Parliament\", says Mr Flavell. \nIn 2011 the consensus of MÄori land owners was that whenua MÄori should be retained and used to enable it to be passed on to future generations; and that the use of the land should balance cultural and commercial imperatives. (Owners’ Aspirations Regarding the Utilisation of MÄori report) \n\"Four years later MÄori owners continue to reiterate this call. They have also raised specific issues with me including land retention, landlocked land, valuation and rating of MÄori land. I have extended the reforms to ensure these matters are also considered as part of this process\", he says. \n\"I have asked my officials to find solutions to these matters, as they are major obstacles for MÄori land owners’ aspirations for their land\", says Mr Flavell. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:00:45.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
