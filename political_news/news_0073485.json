Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2015 Another Republican candidate surging in the polls, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, pointed to Biden bowing out as another sign that Clinton would inevitably become the Democratic nominee. \n\"He has to do what he feels is right in his heart,\" Carson told reporters during a book tour stop in Oklahoma City.
