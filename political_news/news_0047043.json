(AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\nAssociated Press Oct. 18, 2015 | 11:16 p.m. EDT + More By RONALD BLUM, AP Baseball Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) — Daniel Murphy hit his fifth playoff homer and rookie Noah Syndergaard outpitched Chicago Cubs ace Jake Arrieta, sending the New York Mets to a 4-1 victory Sunday night and a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.\nMets outfielder Curtis Granderson robbed Chris Coghlan of a homer, stole two bases and scored twice. Murphy became the first player since Tampa Bay slugger Evan Longoria in 2008 to homer in four consecutive postseason games.\nThe best-of-seven series shifts to Wrigley Field on Tuesday night, with New York ace Jacob deGrom scheduled to pitch against Kyle Hendricks. The wild-card Cubs need a comeback to capture their first pennant in 70 years.\nArrieta gave up hits to his first three batters and was pulled after five innings — matching his shortest start of the year.\nSlumping star David Wright put the Mets in front with a hit-and-run double in the first. Murphy followed with a two-run shot.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
