The Treasury Department has already issued a stark warning to Congress that Nov. 5 is the date the government will run out of money -- and risk a potentially catastrophic default -- unless lawmakers raise the nation’s borrowing limit.\nBut in a series of interviews, GOP senators running the ideological gamut from moderates to fiscal conservatives said they think there’s significantly more wiggle room than the Obama administration is letting on. They’d always expected to have to act by the end of the year, but an accelerated debt deadline following so quickly on the heels of an averted government shutdown is drawing lots of GOP suspicion.\n“It is interesting, which is a polite word, that all of a sudden the administration moved up considerably the timing of when the debt limit needs to be extended,” said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a leading centrist Republican. “What I’ve found over the years is that the date on which the debt limit truly has to be increased seems to be a very squishy date that often changes depending on the political winds.”\nHouse Freedom Caucus endorses Daniel Webster for speaker By Lauren French and Anna Palmer\n“There is nothing that the White House considers more flexible than the debt ceiling deadline,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). Asked if the Nov. 5 deadline is an attempt to jam the GOP Congress, he replied: “Yes.”\nA delay of even a few days into late November could make it a lot easier for lawmakers to package a debt limit increase with a broader budget deal that would eliminate the threat of a government shutdown and a default for the duration of the presidential campaign. Republicans think a major budget deal, including a mix of spending cuts and increases, may be the only way to make a debt limit increase politically palatable enough to pass Congress. But they say they have to wait until the House gets a new speaker at the end of October to begin making moves.\nMany Republicans believe the White House stands to gain by forcing Republicans to first increase the debt ceiling – which the administration insists must have no strings attached -- and then dive into budget talks to keep the government open past Dec. 11.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if that were the case. That’s always the position they start with,” said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 GOP leader, when asked if the White House was trying to separate the debt ceiling from the spending debate.\n“They have a lot of flexibility. It always seems like they have it when they want it,” he added.\nFor congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama, there may be an advantage to early action on the debt ceiling.\n“Why would you want to challenge that? It makes no sense. The debt limit should be a no-brainer for us to resolve,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.)\nBoehner gets McCarthy's back on Benghazi comments By Jake Sherman\nBy separating the two, the White House could get a clean debt limit increase and then enter budget talks, which could free Democrats and President Barack Obama to take a hard-nosed approach to push for spending increases on domestic programs without the fear of rattling financial markets with the risks of a debt default.\nHowever, they also could end up with a long-term continuing resolution if the GOP feels like it has insufficient leverage in spending talks – an outcome the West Wing would like to avoid.\nRepublican leaders insist there’s a problem with either scenario: They say a clean debt ceiling increase cannot pass the Senate, much less a House that’s locked in a tumultuous leadership shake-up with the retirement of House Speaker John Boehner.\n“I don't see how just a clean debt ceiling can pass. It’s all going to be wrapped up in one big negotiation,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).\nPrivately, administration officials are brushing off Republicans’ skepticism, noting that the Nov. 5 date is a product of financial reality, not political calculus.\nBut if Republicans doubt the veracity of the deadline, perhaps the only way to test it is by waiting until Nov. 6 to see what happens, a scenario that government officials have warned would have dire consequences for financial markets.\nStill, Washington Democrats privately admit that the date could yet move forward. Treasury’s projections are based on complex formulas about government spending and receipts, which can move on a daily basis and shift the drop-dead debt deadline dramatically due to unanticipated transactions.\nCongress\nMcCarthy in command By Jake Sherman , Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nBut it may be weeks before Treasury updates its debt limit projections, and it can take several days for Congress to pass controversial legislation like the debt ceiling. So Treasury is urging Congress to make haste.\n“We urge Congress to act soon to raise the debt limit well before Treasury exhausts its extraordinary measures. We will continue to update Congress as we receive additional information,” said a Treasury spokesman.\nSome Republicans are asking their colleagues to heed Treasury’s warning, in an effort to appear responsible stewards of government. Preventing a government shutdown and avoiding any flirtation with default are the prime goals of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nPlaying hardball with the debt deadline could run counter to a strategy that GOP leaders believe can help them maintain control of the Senate in next year’s election.\n“We just need to assume that that’s the date absent better information,” Cornyn said.\n“We just don’t have the information to question it,” added a fellow Senate Republican.\nAt this point, the bigger the final fiscal deal, the easier it will be to avoid a fiscal train wreck. Republicans say that wrapping together a transportation bill, a mix of spending cuts and increases and raising the debt ceiling is their best play this fall. If there’s something for everyone to support, with a fiscal catastrophe looming in the background, the thinking goes, then the GOP can move something through the Capitol and to Obama’s desk.\nNBC's must-see Clinton TV By Hadas Gold\n“Just by sheer convergence by deadlines and time and clock allocation and everything else, it all comes together at the same time,” Thune said. “If we have to do the debt limit we ought to do something to address the debt.”\nBut the calendar may be working against the GOP. Few on Capitol Hill believe Congress can seal a budget deal while Boehner is still the speaker and ahead of the new Nov. 5 deadline. If that date is as firm as Treasury says it is, that will leave Republicans to either try to jam through a standalone debt ceiling increase without fiscal reforms or take a chance and see if Treasury’s most recent projection was wrong.\nNeither option is particularly attractive for Republicans, and they aren’t likely to decide until after next week’s recess. The uncertainty is worrisome to some party elders.\n“There could be a little bit more flexibility. But we’re getting down to where we’re going to have to do something about it,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the GOP’s most senior senator. “That should be an automatic vote to do what’s in the best interests of the country. Unfortunately it’s used by both sides [politically]. I think it’s stupid.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:24:17.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
