As a result, we are committed to helping ensure volunteer fire departments in communities in which we operate have the resources they need to respond effectively.\"\nThis year, Pembina will invest a total of $100,000 , the Company's largest contribution to date for this program. The donation will be divided between 31 volunteer fire departments in communities across the Company's operations, and will support the purchase of new equipment and/or training as needed locally.\nChief Leo Sabulsky of the Chetwynd Fire Department explains the impact of Pembina's Fire Prevention Project: \"The Chetwynd Fire Department has 52 years of history and 24 years of operating a rescue truck. With these funds, our volunteers are happy to have the addition of certified struts for vehicle stabilization, which provide greater safety for those trapped in vehicles. Before, they had to improvise with ropes and other devices. As the Fire Chief, I wish to give my wholehearted thanks to the Pembina team for thinking of our team.\"\nPembina's community investment program supports non-profit and charitable organizations that are based in, or support, the communities where they operate. Within this framework, Pembina's investment decisions and partnerships are focused on initiatives that improve access to education, protect or preserve the environment, promote safety, create community space, and encourage recreation and a healthy lifestyle.
