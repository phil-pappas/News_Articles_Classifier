Kirsten Gillibrand is betting the vice president will get into the 2016 race eventually. “If I was a betting woman, I’d say he would. I think he’s always aspired to it. He’s been a vice president for a long time,” the New York senator said Monday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Summit in Washington. “He’s been a wonderful public servant who cares deeply about issues, and he’s a champion and he wants to fight for his values and his goals for America.”\nThe vice president has yet to decide if he’s running, but CNN has a lectern ready should he surprise everyone and enter the race Tuesday.\nAlthough she’s a Democrat, Gillibrand briefly touched on the Republican field.\nShe praised former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina for her strength and “holding her own in a very, very expansive field.\"\n“I think it’s important that women run. I think it’s really important that women show that they have strong values and they’re going to fight for them. I think it’s great for America to have strong women candidates,” she said.\nBut one woman who won’t be running for president in 2016? Gillibrand herself. She said she doesn’t aspire to be president, and this time her chips are in for Clinton.\n“I feel that the job I have right now is amazing, and I feel like I can create national policy as well as create a national debate,” Gillibrand said. “And I’m supporting Hillary. I really want her to run, and I think she is the most qualified person we could have running for president today. I’m going to work very hard to see her get elected.”\nGillibrand credits Clinton’s speech at the United Nations Fourth World Congress on Women in Beijing for inspiring her to enter a career in public service.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/KirstenGillibrand/posts/10153296642923411", "http://fortune.com/2015/10/13/senator-gillibrand-joe-biden-president/"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:46:33.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
