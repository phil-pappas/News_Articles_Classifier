Bobby Jindal is pumping up a federal tax plan that is decidedly different from ones proposed by some his GOP rivals in the presidential campaign.\nThe governor wants all citizens to pay at least some federal income tax. Currently, around 45 percent of American citizens don't pay federal income taxes, either because they don't make enough money or because they qualify for federal income tax deductions and exemptions.\nJindal would eliminate many of those deductions and other exceptions that allow people to get out of paying income taxes. Lower income people who don't currently pay federal income tax would be more likely to pay something under the governor's tax proposal.\n\"We simply must require that every American has some skin in this game. If we have generations of Americans who never pay any taxes, it will be very easy for them to turn a blind eye to absurd government spending and to continue to allow our government to bankrupt our nation,\" Jindal said in a written statement .\nAs a trade-off for everyone paying some federal income tax, Jindal has proposed eliminating corporate taxes, the estate tax and and the Alternative Minimum Tax. Both the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax more significantly affect upper-income earners. Jindal would also seek to simplify the tax code -- reducing the number income tax brackets from seven to three.\nJindal's tax plan is decidedly different from those proposed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush or Donald Trump, according to The Wall Street Journal . Both Bush and Trump want to move more people off the income tax rolls. Jindal proposes adding people to them, though he says less federal taxes would be collected overall under his plan .\n\"Jeb [Bush] and [Donald] Trump are campaigning on a promise that they are going to move more people off of the tax rolls,\" Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center told The Wall Street Journal . \"Jindal is going the other way.\"\nRead Jindal's explanation of his tax plan here .\nRead The Wall Street Journal's explanation of Jindal's tax plan here .\n. . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge .
