Terry Branstad for details that spell out an estimated $51 million in cost savings for a shift of Iowa's Medicaid health care program from state government oversight to private management. \nState Sen. Robert Hogg, D-Cedar Rapids, chairman of the Iowa Senate Government Oversight Committee, said Monday he is skeptical about Branstad's plans and he is asking the Republican chief state executive for information that documents claims that privatizing Iowa’s Medicaid program will save money without hurting services. \nHogg's inquiry follows statements by Iowa Department of Human Services officials last week that they have no documents or even a list of experts consulted to support their estimates that a controversial plan to hire private companies to manage the Medicaid health insurance program will save taxpayers money. \nMORE: Iowa can't show math on Medicaid savings estimate \nThe absence of any public data behind the estimate is significant because the Iowa Legislature relied on the projection when it approved the budget for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Some lawmakers have said they now have doubts about whether the Department of Human Services' estimate is accurate and how Branstad's administration came up with the number. \nBranstad responded Monday at his weekly news conference by pointing out that Iowa Senate Democrats earlier this year had estimated the cost savings at $102 million for the first six months of the private management for the Medicaid program, but they were eventually persuaded to accept his administration's lower figure of $51 million. \n\"Every year, the Department of Human Services gives us an estimate of what they think Medicaid is going to cost,\" Branstad told reporters. \"It is a range and we have always chosen the mid-range because we think this is the reasonable approach.\" \n\"If you have followed Medicaid over the last 30 or 40 years, you know that there are times when Medicaid estimates have been way off, and we were stuck with providing a supplemental appropriation in the next fiscal year. I worked when I was governor before to stop those bad practices,\" Branstad said. \"We are going to do our level best, and we think that the predictability and the experience that other states have gotten through managed care improves the likelihood that the estimate will be more accurate than it has in the past.\" \nHogg said Iowans have many objections to Branstad's plans to hire private companies to run the Medicaid program , which serves low-income and disabled persons. He said many Iowans believe the governor's initiative is poorly planned, endangers health care for the 560,000 Iowans on Medicaid, will fail to fully reimburse Iowa health care providers for their work, and will limit access to health care and increase health care costs for all other Iowans. \nIn his letter to Branstad, Hogg wrote, \"​You have said it will save money without hurting services. I doubt it. That’s why, as chair of the Senate Government Oversight Committee, I am formally asking you to release the evidence you used to calculate privatizing Medicaid will save the state of Iowa government $50 (sic) million in the first six months of 2016.\" \nMichael Bousselot (Photo: Special to the Register) \nBranstad said the Department of Human Services developed the Medicaid cost estimates in the same manner as it has been done \"forever.\" Michael Bousselot, the governor's chief of staff and the governor's health care policy adviser, said that prior to last year's legislative session, the Department of Human Services worked with actuaries whom have been under contract for many years in assessing what other states have seen and what Iowa could see in savings. \n\"The savings estimate ranged, as you all know. The Department of Human Services picked that middle point, based not only what other states have seen, but what our actuaries thought was prudent, and that mid-point in the end received bipartisan support so we could count on that for the coming budget year,\" Bousselot said. \nAsked if he would make public the documents showing the math behind the calculations, Bousselot said, \"Our office did not administer or oversee the Medicaid projections. Rather, that is handled by the Department of Human Services, as well in conjunction with LSA (The Legislative Services Agency) and the Department of Management for the budget projections. So it is done in partnership, but the Department of Human Services has worked on that and has continued to work on what those savings estimates will be once we move fully to managed care.\" \nAt that point, a reporter again asked Bousselot if the Branstad administration will provide documentation about the Medicaid calculations to the public. \nBousselot replied, \"I would talk to the Department of Human Services, who has handled that, and I will work with Director Chuck Palmer on getting you what we have for the estimates that we worked with our actuaries on calculating.\" \nBranstad then intervened, saying, 'It is a range and it is what has been used by the Department of Human Services as long as I can remember. I can tell you we went through this before with the Legislature back in the 80s and the 90s. And they would choose the high end of the range in terms of savings in order to put less money into the budget, and that was not right. So we said, 'Wait a minute. We know that this is an entitlement program and so that we just have to use the best estimate that we have done'. That is what we have always done, and there is nothing different about this.\" \nDepartment of Human Services spokeswoman Amy McCoy said after Branstad's news conference that while savings are important because of the continually growing cost and number of Iowans who need medical assistance, care coordination is at the center of the department's plans. \n\"We are not changing the types of services offered through Medicaid; instead we are taking a currently one-size-fits-all program and utilizing nationally-experienced companies to coordinate care in a way that makes Medicaid members healthier and finds efficiences,\" McCoy said. \"These companies will even be able to offer preventive services above and beyond what members could receive under the current program. This is how most Americans have their care managed, including about 80 percent of Medicaid recipients across the country.\" \nManaged care is not new to Iowa, McCoy added, with nearly all Medicaid participants having had their behavioral health managed through a managed care organization since the 1990s, and some physical health members. She said Medicaid program costs have climbed by 73 percent since 2003, pointing to a need for a more predictable and sustainable Medicaid budget. \n\"Instead of cutting the types of services offered through the Medicaid program — and to keep the Medicaid need from encroaching on other taxpayer-funded programs — we are taking a proactive, patient-centered approach,\" McCoy said. 6 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1RS1NRk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:20:33.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
