Pack up the nets. It's time to roll out the blue-and-orange carpet in Brooklyn.\nThe home of Hannah Horvath and her hipster friends is set to sound the horn for the arrival of John Tavares and the New York Islanders.\nFans, make sure there's a MetroCard tucked in the wallet next to the game ticket. There's a new way to travel on game night — by subway, by train, and probably with an Islander or two along for the ride.\nThe Brooklynization of the Islanders at the Barclays Center is underway.\nLed by the Blue and Orange Army — the hardcore fans who will \"Rock the Barc!\" every night — the Islanders know the generational loyalists will follow them about 30 miles to their new home.\nBut will Brooklyn get off the stoop and head to the rink?\nThe Islanders fled their outdated, lovable dump of a home in Uniondale, New York, for a fresh start at the state-of-the-art Barclays Center. So far, the Islanders have every reason to feel right at home.\nStanley Cup banners hang from the rafters, and the arena is wrapped in Islanders' imagery. John Tavares and teammates have their faces plastered all over the building, nearby businesses, and subway terminals.\nAlexa Ray Joel is set to sing the national anthem before the opener on Friday night and there will be other nods toward the franchise's past — all with an eye set on the future.\n\"We're asking the fanbase to be with us along the way because we may do some other things that Brooklynizes the in-game experience,\" Barclays Center COO Fred Mangione said. \"There will always be a nice balance and that's our goal.\"\nThe Islanders are entering their first season at the Barclays Center — home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets since 2012 — after spending their first 43 years at Nassau Coliseum.\nBut if the Nets underwent a total reboot, from name to logo to jersey colors, this transition is more like Islanders 2.0.\nBrooklyn remained true to the Islanders' roots and brought along some Coliseum staples that should appeal to the traditionalists.\n— Paul Cartier will play the organ just as he's done since the Stanley Cup heyday.\n— The four Stanley Cup Championship banners and six retired jersey banners will hang in the rafters, along with the banners of former head coach Al Arbour and former GM Bill Torrey.\n— The Islanders super-fan group, the Blue and Orange Army, will pack sections 228 and 229.\nThe Islanders listened to focus groups and beefed up train service with a Barclays Center Direct line, adding two additional direct pre- and postgame trains. The two postgame trains will leave 20 minutes after the end of each game, regardless of when the final horn sounds.\nOh yes, that horn.\nThe Islanders' plan to abandon their traditional goal horn with one that sounded like a subway horn was panned by fans during preseason games and abruptly scrapped.\nThe balance between old and new remains a work in progress.\n\"With 80 percent of our patrons taking a subway, you'd think they'd get the connection,\" Mangione said. \"But look, the tradition outweighed the connection and we understood that. We met on that right away.\"\nThe Islanders also irked some fans — yet likely made some new ones — with the black and white third jersey they will wear 12 times this season. The jersey kept the four stripes that pays homage to the championships, yet scrubbed the skyline that omits Brooklyn and Queens.\n\"Our group always understood this change was a lot better than a Kansas City or a Quebec move,\" said Blue and Orange member James Fess. \"The cause is still the same, only the building has changed.\"\nWhile arena and team officials touted the parking lots around the arena, The Blue and Orange Army have ditched the cars this season for Traingating. The pregame party starts on the line and rolls right into Barclays.\nWho will join them?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:46:20.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
