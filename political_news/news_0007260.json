Amos ranked 69 out of 100 CEOs on the prestigious list.\nThis year, Harvard Business Review updated its methodology to reflect CEOs who led companies that excel in financial performance in addition to environmental, social and governance performance. Past methodologies ranked executives on stock performance alone. This is also the first time Harvard Business Review's list includes CEOs with tenures that began prior to 1995. Amos's tenure as CEO at Aflac began in 1990.\nAn article published at HBR.org states that HBR's ranking of CEOs is meant to be a measure of enduring success, tracking and analyzing each CEO's performance starting from day one of their tenure. The goal is to create a list that gets beyond the most recent quarterly or even annual results and truly evaluates long-term performance.\nUnder Amos, Aflac began its fight against childhood cancer by branding and funding the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta . In 2015, Aflac celebrated its 20 th anniversary of this lifesaving partnership by reaching a milestone of $100 million in contributions to the facility.\nThe key architect of Aflac's award winning marketing campaign featuring the Aflac Duck in both the U.S. and Japan , Dan elevated Aflac's brand recognition from near single digits in 1999 to over 95% today. Under Amos's tenure Aflac has been featured on Fortune's list of 100 Best Companies to Work For 17 times and received Ethisphere's World's Most Ethical Companies award for nine consecutive years. Black Enterprise Magazine has honored Aflac as one of the 40 Best Companies for Diversity 10 times, and Latina Style presented Aflac its Best Places For Latina's to Work award 16 times.
