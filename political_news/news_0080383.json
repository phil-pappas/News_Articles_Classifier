Mr Sharif also said Pakistan was the “primary victim” of terrorism.\n“In truth, it (Pakistan) is actually a victim of its own policies of breeding and sponsoring terrorists. The heart of the matter is a state that regards the use of terrorism as a legitimate instrument of statecraft... The world watches with concern as its consequences have spread bey-ond its immediate neighbourhood,” India’s first secretary at its UN permanent mission in New York Abhishek Singh said in a sharp retort, exercising India’s right of reply in the general debate during the 70th UNGA session.\nSeparately, MEA spokesman Vikas Swarup said in a series of tweets: “To de-militarise Kashmir is not the answer, to de-terrorise Pakistan is... Pakistan is not primary victim of terrorism, but of its own policies. It is in fact the prime sponsor of terrorism.” Mr Swarup further added that Pakistan’s “instability arises from its breeding of terrorists. Blaming neighbours is not a solution.”\n Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif Pakistan Kashmir nation PoK United Nations Also Read Poll campaign speeches lead to asthma attacks 3-day public service for drunken driving Bangladeshi infiltrators would have to go back: Narendra Modi I support plea to summon Manmohan Singh in coal scam case: Ex-MoS tells court", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151002/nation-current-affairs/article/pakistan-occupier-must-vacate-pok-india", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/PoK%20protest%20against%20pakistan%20PTI_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/PoK%20protest%20against%20pakistan%20PTI_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:46:52.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
