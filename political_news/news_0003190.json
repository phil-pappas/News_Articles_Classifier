This is what he sent us - Image via Random Nerds \nCombining comedy and technology might only bring to mind funny cat videos and Internet memes, but D.C. will get a chance to see what happens when comedians and tech-savvy programmers get together at the first ever Comedy Hack Day DC on Oct. 24. \n\"Comedy apps, websites, all kinds of tech will be built,\" said Bryce Rudow, editor-in-chief at Random Nerds and one of the judges for the event. \"Hackers can be funny, and comedians can be really into tech.\" \n\"It's going to be a big weekend affair with the hackathon on the 23rd and then the big comedy show on the 24th.\" \nComedy Hack Day started melding the minds of comedy and tech experts since 2012, starting in New York and expanding to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Cambridge, Ma. It's run by Cultivated Wit , which was founded by former writers at the Onion. Rudow has been a fan of the event for a while, which is why he is judging and Random Nerds is one of the sponsors along with a bunch of other local companies. The event even won a $1,000 grant from the Awesome Foundation , which picks and gives a grant once a month to an interesting community project . \nThe hackathon itself will take place at Canvas CoWork, with the presentation and party on the 24th at iStrategyLabs. Random Nerds is also providing the prize for the winner of the hackathon, a Wii U and copy of Mario Maker. \n\"It's tempting me all the time because I want it for myself,\" said Joe Corbett, Random Nerds CEO. \nAlong with Rudow, the judges include D.C. Innovates executive director Sibyl Edwards, DC Improv Comedy Club co-owner Allyson Jaffe and actor and comedian Seaton Smith. Corbett and Rudow both pointed out that the judges, as well as the team organizing the event, are a lot more diverse than the stereotype of white men in tech. That's partly just the nature of the world of comedy, but it's also a deliberate choice, adding to the mix of people getting together for the event. \n\"D.C. is always talking about increasing diversities and mashing communities up,\" Rudow said. \"Comedy Hack DC does that perfectly.\" \nIf you're interested in checking out what the comedians and tech people come up with, you can buy tickets here .
