His campaign announced last week it had raised $2.5 million in the third fundraising quarter — a modest sum in comparison to GOP rivals Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ The lengthy memo addresses some of the main concerns political pundits and insiders have vocalized with regards to Paul's campaign, including his ground operations in early voting states, low poll numbers and debate performances.\n  Bush and Rubio squabble while Trump runs away with it After Bush announced his fundraising total, his campaign started a spat with Rubio over who did better.\nBy Byron York • 10/16/15 6:19 AM \"Here are the facts and why SRP [Sen. Rand Paul] is here to stay,\" the memo begins.\nThe memo claims Paul has the \"best organization in America\" when it comes to readying the senator for early nominating contests, and reminds recipients of the three separate straw polls Paul won this year, including the Conservative Political Action Conference, Republican Leadership Conference and, most recently, the New Hampshire straw poll.\n\"SRP's strength in New Hampshire comes from his continued legwork in the state,\" states the memo. \"Like John McCain in 2008, Senator Paul's campaign isn't showing up in October polling, but will be there when it counts-on Election Day.\"\nStafford and Englander also tout Paul's campaign apparatus in the earliest voting state of Iowa, and the efforts he's making to court young voters with frequent trips to college campuses. In August, Paul's campaign announced its \"300 in 30\" pledge to establish \"Students for Rand\" chapters at 300 separate universities in 30 days.\n\"Students make the calls and walk the doors. They also give the campaign the ability to organize cheaply in later states,\" states the memo, adding that \"in Iowa, Students for Rand will have a huge impact.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Boehner's bucket list: Find a speaker, solve fiscal train wreck The current House speaker had hoped he could retire on Oct. 30.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/16/15 12:01 AM \"You will not see this student advantage show-up in polls, but you will see it show-up in elections-just like the straw polls we keep winning,\" the memo continues.\nWhen it comes to the numbers floating around about Paul's campaign, the two staffers said the media's coverage of fundraising figures and Paul's position in national polls \"makes less sense.\"\n\"SRP currently has over $2 million cash-on-hand and is running a lean campaign heavy on organization and light on expensive advertising. SRP has the financial resources to continue indefinitely and will keep racking up wins once the voting begins,\" it reads.\nThe memo also assured recipients that Paul would \"no question\" be on stage during the third Republican debate Oct. 28.\n\"Although the criteria to make the cut for the next debate requires a 2.5% average in the polls, you never read anything about Christie, who currently sits at 1.9% in the RCP average of polls,\" reads the memo.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner RNC chair: GOP will be 'cooked' as national party with 2016 loss The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM In a final plea for recipients to stop fretting over Paul's position in the GOP field, Stafford and Englander wrote:\n\"We bet on breakthrough — and the continued passion and dedication of our team to fight for Senator Paul's vision of liberty, opportunity and justice for all Americans is what will bring us success when it actually counts – on Election Day.\"\nTop Story RNC chair: Republicans are 'cooked' if defeated in 2016 The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:33:26.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
