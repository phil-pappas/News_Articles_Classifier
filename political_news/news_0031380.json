We operated in accordance with these consents. \n\"The River Recharge worked as it should, ensuring river levels were maintained. The scheme will be working again this summer and is ready to operate anytime if river levels get low enough.\" \nCouncillor Cardiff says he and Regional Council Chair Chris Laidlaw are in complete agreement about the objectives of the scheme and the benefits of collaboration. \n\"This is an example of two councils working together to implement an innovative and environmentally-responsible project as part of the solution to the district’s long standing water supply issues. Councillor Wilson’s lack of knowledge about a significant KÄpiti project in which his own council is heavily involved is breath-taking,\" said councillor Cardiff. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:08:52.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
