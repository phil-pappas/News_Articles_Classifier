Charles Brunner, a Democrat who becomes term-limited at the end of next year. Currently Bay County's 6th District commissioner, Tilley said he's been eyeing the seat for a long time. \n\"We've done a lot of great things with the county, and it's time to take my passions for helping the public to the next level,\" he said. \nTilley outlined a running platform with a focus on education funding and reform that includes his support for prevailing wage and LGBT-friendly changes to Michigan's civil rights law. A county commissioner since 2006, he said his experience in government sets him apart. \nTwo other candidates have already announced their intentions to seek the seat. Brian Elder , a Bay City attorney, and Brian DuFresne , principal of T.L. Handy Middle School — both Democrats — are also running. Meet Don Tilley \nAge: 47 \nAddress: 617 Green Ave., Bay City \nProfessional experience: Teacher at Bay City Central High School since 1996, with five years' prior experience with Bay Area Catholic Schools. \nPolitical Experience: 6th District Bay County commissioner, 2006-present; chairman of Bay Political Action Committee, 2003-2015; chairman of the educator caucus of the Michigan Democratic Party. \nCommunity Involvement: Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bay Future Inc.; chairman of the Michigan Works Great Lakes Bay Region consortium board; active with local Friends of Celtic Culture and Ancient Order of Hibernians. \nEducation: Bay City Western High School, 1985; associate's degree from Delta College, 1989; bachelor's degree from Saginaw Valley State University, 1991; master's degree in educational technology from Central Michigan University, 2003. \nFamily: Wife, Brandy Tilley; four children, ages 13 to 23. \nWhy voters should choose you? \"I bring to the table forward-thinking ideas and a lot of experience in dealing with private and public officials and people. I like to get out in the community and meet people and talk to people.\" \nTilley has a long list of education policy goals, including raising corporate tax rates to boost funding for public schools. He also hopes to bring regulations for charter schools closer to mandates for public schools and undo legislation barring retired teachers from serving as substitute teachers. \n\"Being a schoolteacher, I have a sensitivity to public education and the funding of our schools,\" he said. \"Some of the regulations and the policies that have been passed over the course of the past few years, I believe have been detrimental to the public school system.\" \nTilley said teacher evaluations in Michigan rely too heavily on student growth scores. As a result, he said, a community's socioeconomic status can \"weigh heavily\" on teachers' evaluations. \n\"When we're pit up against that, you've set some schools and some teachers up for failure,\" Tilley said. \"It's punitive versus rewarding.\" \nTilley is perhaps best known locally for his recent sponsorship of a 2013 Bay County ordinance that would have offered employment protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of the county and its contractors. \nAfter a robust local debate , the ordinance failed in a 4-3 vote before the Bay County Board of Commissioners. In the aftermath of the vote, though, the County Board moved to change its personnel policy to include LGBT protections. \nTilley said if he goes to Lansing, he'll work to change Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to extend civil rights protections to LGBT persons around the state. \nTilley declined to offer comment on DuFresne's and Elder's bids for the seat, though he said he wishes them the \"best of luck.\" \n\"I'm a firm believe that this is a good community, and it can be a greater community,\" Tilley said. \"I'd like to go to Lansing and help us grow.\" \nThe 96th District covers Bay City, Essexville and the following townships: Kawkawlin, Monitor, Bangor, Frankenlust, Hampton, Portsmouth and Merritt. \n— Sam Easter is a general assignment reporter for The Bay City Times.
