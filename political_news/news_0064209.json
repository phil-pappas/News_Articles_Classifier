A 2009 Berl study, applying a methodology endorsed by the World Health Organisation, estimated harmful alcohol use cost New Zealand $4.9 billion in 2005/06. \nGAPA emerged from the inaugural conference held in New York in 2000, and has networks operating in Africa, European Union, South America, South East Asia, USA and Western Pacific regions. \nProfessor Sally Casswell says, “The conference will showcase positive advocacy, translational research and local action from around the world, as well as highlighting the difficulties the alcohol policy field faces, especially from the inappropriate influence of the alcohol industry.” \nProfessor Casswell will draw on data from the International Alcohol Control Study which is coordinated from New Zealand in order to challenge some of the industry messages about policy. \nShe says, “Being part of the global conversation gives us in New Zealand new insights into innovative activities taking place globally, so we can learn, as well as be enabled to make a contribution to the global response to the high levels of alcohol-related harm being experienced.” \nFind out more about the conference here: http://www.gapc2015.com/ \nMore information on Professor Sally Casswell: Sally Casswell is Professor of Social and Health Research and the Director of the SHORE & Whariki Research Centre, College of Health at Massey University. \nHer research interests are in social and public health policy, particularly in alcohol and other drugs.
