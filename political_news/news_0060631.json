Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, never mentioned Clinton by name at the high-profile fundraising dinner but implicitly criticized her delayed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Keystone XL pipeline as well as her vote in favor of the Iraq war and passage of the Defense of Marriage Act during her husband's administration.\"I promise you tonight as your president I will govern based on principle not poll numbers,\" Sanders said, eliciting roars from his supporters. It's true. Clinton has ALWAYS been a Goldwater republican. They call it a \"centrist\", but she's a neoliberal just like W and Obama. Here's a neoliberal Quote: DEFINITION of 'Neoliberalism' An approach to economics and social studies in which control of economic factors is shifted from the public sector to the private sector. Drawing upon principles of neoclassical economics, neoliberalism suggests that governments reduce deficit spending, limit subsidies, reform tax law to broaden the tax base, remove fixed exchange rates, open up markets to trade by limiting protectionism, privatize state-run businesses, allow private property and back deregulation.

Quote: Mrs. Clintons economics team includes Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and Peter Orszag. In the 1990s, Rubin and Summers put in place the trade, deregulation and competition policies that have gotten us in so much trouble. The housing bubble that ended so badly also began on their watch. Above all, they argued persistently for fiscal austerity and even toyed with privatizing Social Security. Following in the footsteps of Messrs. Rubin and Summers, for the last several years Mr. Orszag has been collecting booty on Wall Street. Before that, his starting job in Washington was to write papers showing that budget deficits increase interest rates, thereby preparing the political table for a menu of fiscal austerity and entitlement cuts. Not only do neoliberal economists have Mrs. Clinton's ear, but Wall Street bigwigs are largely funding her campaign, as they have in the past, as detailed here, here, here, here, and here. It bears noting as well that Clinton's Wall Street funders are not taking her recent rhetorical turn to liberal themes, exemplified in last week's economic policy speech, too seriously. But our focus today is on neoliberal ideology. Consider these excerpts from the aforementioned policy speech, each of which exemplifies neoliberal ideology (emphasis added): Many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation. Small businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. Ive said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, Im going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification. We are in a global competition, as Im sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But thats exactly what were doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future. I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the companys success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees pockets. Its a win-win. She defines it quite well.
