The accusations have gotten under Summey’s skin.\nAt a candidate forum Sept. 9, Summey, the mayor for 21 years, refused to answer a question, saying he was “just tired of listening to an angry man,” referring to Singletary. At a later forum, Summey said Singletary needed to take off his Citadel class ring “because it says you’re supposed to be a man of the truth.”\nSingletary said last week that “there is nothing in my past that I am ashamed of,” but a background check through the State Law Enforcement Division revealed fraudulent check charges from 2000 and a Jan. 26, 2010, charge of solicitation of prostitution.\nSingletary calls the misdemeanor prostitution charge a set-up. He said his tiff with the city started when his neighbor in Evanston Estates tried to take some of Singletary’s land. City officials say it was because the steps on Singletary’s home violated setback laws. Either way, the disagreement has been going on for several years.\nIn a July 2014 order by Circuit Judge J.C. Nicholson, Singletary was labeled a “vexatious litigant” for “filing lawsuits in state and federal courts for five years concerning the same litigation.”\n“This abuse of the legal system has forced tremendous wasted litigation costs” and “unduly burdened the courts,” according to the order. “The record shows that Plaintiffs have systematically engaged in frivolous, dilatory tactics, which consistently abused the judges, the parties, and opposing counsel with accusations of racial discrimination.”\nAccording to the judge’s order, Singletary cannot file “a new civil action in any South Carolina state courts” without first submitting the proposed filing and a copy of Nicholson’s order and getting approval.\nSome records regarding the case are sealed, which Singletary said is against the law. He said he can file lawsuits if he wants.\n“It’s an abuse of discretion for a judge to say if someone does you wrong, you can’t sue,” he said. “It’s a constitutional right, the right to remedy.”\nSingletary said the prostitution charge was in retaliation for the lawsuits.\n“That case was completely thrown out as a false arrest by the city of North Charleston. They were supposed to expunge and take that off because they falsely put that on there. ... There was never, not only a conviction, there was never even a court case.”\nRecords, however, show otherwise. According to an audio account and an incident report obtained by The Post and Courier, Singletary agreed to pay $20 for “straight sex.”\nHe paid $470 bail on Feb. 3, 2010, according to court records, and was “tried in absence (bail forfeited)” on May 4, 2010. Local criminal defense lawyers said that is considered a conviction.\nSingletary said last week he would sue anyone who brings up the charge for “defamation, libel and slander.”\nOn Tuesday, he did not respond to a request for comment.\nSingletary said he filed a complaint with the State Ethics Commission claiming that Summey violated a state law on campaign contributions. He said state law prohibits companies that have received a contract with an entity that wasn’t through competitive bidding from making campaign contributions to public officials who were involved.\n“Most of the money he receives comes from these types of contracts,” Singletary said. “There are over 100 of them (contributors) like that.”\nThe city disputes that.\n“An ample amount of transparency exists in the procurement process to inform the public on all city expenditures,” said North Charleston spokesman Ryan Johnson. “Like in cities all over South Carolina, there are infrequent instances that allow cities to waive the lengthy bid process. Again, in these cases, a public vote on a public agenda is required from the full body of City Council.”\nSingletary said the complaint won’t be heard until after the election. Complaints filed with the Ethics Commission are confidential, according to Executive Director Herbert Hayden.\nThe city also has condemned his property, changed city codes and refused to give him a certificate of occupancy for his home, Singletary said. He claims he’s been arrested at gunpoint, had pets disappear from his yard, and has been under surveillance by the police department.\n“Those are the kind of bullying tactics that (Summey) uses against people,” Singletary said. “This is why, in 20 years, not one white person has ever run against him because they are afraid of him because he bullies.\n“Most of the African-Americans have nothing to start with so you don’t really lose anything,” he said. “In my case it was different. My net worth was over $3 million before the city started this vendetta that he has against me.”\nThe two other mayoral candidates, the Rev. Chris Collins and Clifford Smith II, a CEO of a construction company, have largely stayed out of the fray.\nCollins, a member of the Charleston County School Board, owes $24,499 in fines to the Ethics Commission as of August, according to the commission’s website.\nHe said Tuesday that he filed a quarterly report late during a time when he was moving his business, and then the $100-a-day late fees accrued.\n“It’s outrageous to penalize somebody that much money,” said Collins, who also ran against Summey in 2011.\nReach Brenda Rindge at (843) 937-5713.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:43:34.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
