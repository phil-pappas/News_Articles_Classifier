However, sporadic violence continues, particularly in Upper Egypt,\" the report read.\nThe report lists a detailed account of all churches burned and the sectarian strife resulting in the death of many Copts in Upper Egypt following the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi.\nIt highlighted that, although many churches have been rebuilt, no investigations have been made into the deaths of 29 people due to the sectarian strife.\n\"The inability to protect Copts and other religious minorities, and successfully prosecute those responsible for violence, continues to foster an atmosphere of impunity,\" the report read.\nBlasphemy law\n\"Blasphemy cases have increased since 2011, and this trend continued during the reporting period,\" the USCIRF annual report stated.\nIt indicated that the majority of those sentenced to prison terms for blasphemy have been Christians, Shi’a Muslims, and atheists, mostly as a result of flawed trials.\nThe report cited many cases from 2014 of defendants convicted on blasphemy charges.\nOne such example is the case of Coptic Christian Kirollos Shawqi Atallah, who was sentenced in Luxor to six years for posting photos on a Facebook page that were deemed defamatory to Islam.\nMeanwhile, the report referred to the initiative by ministries of religious endowments and sports and youth to combat the spread of atheism among Egyptian youth.\nAt the end of the report, USCIRF urged the Egyptian government to revise Article 98(f) of the Penal Code, which criminalises contempt of religion, and, in the interim, provide the constitutional and international guarantees of the rule of law.\nRecommendations\nUSCIRF recommended several points to improve religious freedom conditions in Egypt.\nThe first was to ensure that a portion of U.S. military assistance is used to help police implement an effective plan for dedicated protection of religious minority communities, and to provide direct support to civil society to advance freedom of religion and belief for all Egyptians.\nIt has also recommended that the Egyptian government undertake \"immediate reforms\" to improve religious freedom conditions, including repealing decrees banning religious minority faiths, removing religion from official identity documents, and passing a law for the construction and repair of places of worship once a new parliament is formed.", "external_links": ["http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/USCIRF%20Annual%20Report%202015%20(2).pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:18:58.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
