NBA star Stephen Curry and other members of the Golden State Warriors warmed up the San Francisco crowd. Those attending the Democratic National Committee fundraiser paid between $250 and $10,000.\nObama encouraged the audience to be politically active and says he plans to remain so when his presidency concludes, saying \"I'm just getting started.\"\nObama was using his campaign speeches and many others these days to point to progress he said the country has made during the past seven years, from the drop in the unemployment rate, to millions of additional people with health insurance.\nBut he said GOP candidates are painting a dismal picture for voters.\n\"There's almost no measure by which we're not better off than when I took office and when we started this process for change,\" Obama said. \"But it does kind of make you wonder. Why are so many Republican politicians so down on America? Why are they so grumpy?\"\nHe got some of his loudest applause when making the case for changes in the nation's gun laws, saying the amount of gun violence taking place in the U.S. is not normal.\n\"We know we've got to do something to prevent the kind of gun massacres that we see with growing frequency in this country,\" Obama said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:30:20.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
