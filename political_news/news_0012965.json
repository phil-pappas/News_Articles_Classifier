It's about actions.\" O'Malley says on Tuesday he'll point to how he built consensus during his time as a governor and mayor on such issues as comprehensive gun safety, immigration and marriage equality.\nO'Malley also says he disagrees with Clinton's suggestion that the United States create a no-fly zone in Syria because of a potential clash with Russia.
