Nope.\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 21, 2015 | 5:00 p.m. EDT + More Vice President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he will not run for president in 2016. Biden, speaking from the White House Rose Garden, flanked by his wife Jill and President Barack Obama, said the \"window on mounting a realistic campaign for president … has closed.\" Biden, who cited the recent loss of his son Beau to brain cancer and the toll on his family among the reasons for his decision, said that while he won't run, he will not \"be silent.\" Said Biden, \"I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.\"\nSally Kohn at CNN is \"sad\" Biden won't be running, but thinks it's ultimately the right decision. \"The path to winning the Democratic nomination certainly wasn't clear, let alone easy,\" she writes, \"and it's better for Biden to end his career at the high point of the vice presidency rather than try for the presidency once again and fail.\" And, argues Kohn, he would have \"muddied the otherwise helpfully clear waters between [Democratic front-runner] Hillary Clinton and [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders.\" Biden's got \"populist street cred,\" but he promotes Clinton-esque, centrist policy; his participation in the race would have \"unhelpfully complicated things,\" she writes.\n[ READ: Biden Decides Against A 2016 Presidential Run ]\nHoward Fineman at the Huffington Post says Biden was never serious about running and needlessly dragged out his decision. When, in February, Biden said he'd decide on a run by summer's end, \"no one thought much of it,\" argues Fineman. And after losing his son in May, Biden didn't have a third run in him, and everyone knew it. Not even his dislike of the Clintons was really enough to get him on board with 2016, says Fineman. \"But letting go is hard,\" he writes, \"and the concentric circles of Biden loyalists and friends weren't eager ... to tell him to do so.\" What resulted was a \"waiting game\" with no clear goal. \"The departure looks, at least in part, like the result of naked political calculation,\" writes Fineman, noting that Biden waited until after Sanders and Clinton performed well in the first Democratic debate last week. \"It was a fond farewell, but it went on just a little too long.\"\nNate Cohn at The New York Times' The Upshot says Biden already lost the race, despite never entering. The real battle, he writes is \"the invisible primary, the behind-the-scenes competition for elite support that often decides the nomination\" – and Clinton has handily bested Biden there. \"[T]he reality was that he would have struggled for the same reason that other traditional, establishment-friendly candidates decided not to run. The support from party operatives, donors and officials wasn't quite there. The party had already decided, for Mrs. Clinton.\"\n[ ALSO: Joe Biden Would Bring Lazy and Wrong Foreign Policy to the 2016 Race ]\nPhillip Bump at The Washington Post agrees that Clinton will reap the rewards of a Biden-free Democratic field, much more so than Sanders, who is polling second in the race thus far. \"Sanders has only a few months left to peel enough support away from Clinton to win enough primaries to get the nomination,\" he writes. \"Biden handing Clinton a bunch of support moves him in the opposite direction from that goal.\"\nSo what's the Dems' Plan B if Clinton falters? John Fund at National Review says a Clinton \"collapse\" is unlikely, but possible. An FBI report on the possible compromise of classified information sent using Clinton's private email server is due right before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary vote; \"If the report has dramatic political repercussions,\" he notes, \"Democrats would be in the unusual position of having an inevitable but politically damaged nominee.\" And with establishment-safe Biden out (well, never in), and Sanders an unlikely alternative, who's left? Fund offers up Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, \"a populist who fits the mood of the party better than Hillary,\" he says. And while Fund acknowledges Warren's repeated refusal to run in 2016, he says she hasn't given any \"Shermanesque statements.\"\nWas Joe Biden Right Not to Run for President?\nYes No View Results Yes 0.0% No 100.0% Total Votes: 1 View Poll\nTAGS: Biden, Joe Clinton, Hillary 2016 presidential election politics", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-long-goodbye_561fbd08e4b028dd7ea6d1b9", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/opinions/kohn-biden-not-running-president/index.html", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Joe%20Biden%20Will%20Not%20Run%20for%20President%20in%202016%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/upshot/joe-bidens-decision-and-hillary-clintons-victory.html?_r=1", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Joe%20Biden%20Will%20Not%20Run%20for%20President%20in%202016%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Joe%20Biden%20Will%20Not%20Run%20for%20President%20in%202016%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20Joe%20Biden%27s%20decision%20not%20to%20seek%20the%20Democratic%20presidential%20nomination.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/425891/dems-have-all-their-chps-hillary-or-there-plan-b-john-fund", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/us/politics/transcript-of-joe-bidens-remarks-on-not-running-for-president.html?ribbon-ad-idx=5&rref=politics&module=Ribbon&version=context&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=Politics&pgtype=article", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/10/21/welcome-back-presumptive-democratic-nominee-hillary-clinton/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef3cr%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:52:03.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
