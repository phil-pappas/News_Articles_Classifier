The idea has been backed by TV host Bill O'Reilly, and presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Cruz and fellow presidential candidate Marco Rubio are co-sponsors of this legislation in the Senate.\nIt's named after Kate Steinle, who was killed in San Francisco this year by an illegal immigration who was deported several times, but still managed to pick up the loaded gun of a federal officer and fire it.\n\"In a time of limited federal resources and tough choices, is it fair to treat localities that cooperate with federal law enforcement or work hard to follow federal law no better than localities that refuse to help or actively flout the law?\" McConnell asked on the Senate floor Thursday. \"When felons enter our country illegally and repeatedly, is it fair to victims and families to not do what we can now to stop them?\"\n  Dubya's big role pushing brother Jeb for president George W.
