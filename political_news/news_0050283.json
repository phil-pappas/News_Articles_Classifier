Renee Ellmers, the subject of unsubstantiated rumors of an extramarital affair with McCarthy that were fueled, in a large part, by Rep. Walter Jones, a fellow Tar Heel State Republican. Both Ellmers and Jones have been enmeshed in an ideological battle between grassroots conservatives and the GOP establishment in North Carolina, one that mirrors that in Washington. Both are facing serious primary challenges for the second straight election — Jones from a foreign policy hawk, Ellmers from the right — and that was before Jones issued his now-infamous letter calling on any candidate for House leadership who committed “misdeeds” to “withdraw” from the race.\nThough he initially denied any such intent, Jones acknowledged having heard rumors of an extramarital affair between Ellmers and McCarthy, confirming to POLITICO that it was “a factor” in his decision to go public with the letter, he said. Ellmers has refuted the allegations and asked for \"prayers and support\" from House colleagues. She told a local morning radio show that the allegations show the \"very ugly side of politics.\"\nDuring last week’s recess, while voters were buzzing about the turmoil on Capitol Hill, Jones campaigned while Ellmers held few events, attended a fundraiser and laid low. She barred further questions from the local press about the allegations.\nBut even though Ellmers won’t discuss it directly, “Everybody’s been talking about it here,” said a Republican Party county official, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “There’s been some concern about the rumors that have been floating around for a while now, but there’s no proof yet.”\nBehind McCarthy's decision to bail By Jake Sherman , Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nLocal operatives said that the allegations could hurt Ellmers, a 51-year-old nurse who was first elected to Congress on the tea party wave in 2010, in her deeply red district. But — ironically — the letter could buoy Jones, the would-be snitch who is a frequent GOP gadfly. His anti-interventionist stance frustrates some military hawks at home, but standing up for family values could rally conservatives to his side.\n“If the rumors are true, then the [Ellmers] race gets instantly incredibly competitive. If they’re not true, then it doesn’t change that it’s still competitive,” said Carter Wrenn, a North Carolina Republican consultant who worked on Ellmers’ 2010 campaign. “If you come back here in February and no one’s got ads on TV in her race, then she’s probably going to win. But if someone is, she’s got a real race and she could lose.”\nHouse GOP disapproves of Iran deal in symbolic vote By Lauren French\nThe discord in the North Carolina GOP illustrates how divisions in Washington can be mirrored in the states, pitting establishment against grassroots outsider, especially in a changing environment like North Carolina. Democrats have made some inroads into the Tar Heel state, backing President Obama in 2008, even as some conservatives target Republicans who aren’t rabid enough in their distrust of government.\nEllmers held an event on Tuesday with veterans and local employers — but a local TV station reported the media weren’t allowed to speak with her unless they agreed to not ask questions about the alleged affair.\nSeveral conservative activists said the rumors fed already existing distrust in Ellmers. “People were already questioning Ellmers on family values, and even just the fact that these sorts of rumors are circulating tends to reinforce that feeling within the district,” said Linda DeVore, former chairwoman of the Cumberland County Republican Party.\nBut others said it was her voting record that was the issue, not the controversy in D.C., which Miriam Chu, chairwoman of the Moore Tea Citizens, called \"gross, tawdry.\"\n\"I would like to see Renee defeated on the issues,\" she said. \"I don’t know if it’s true or not, and I frankly don’t care.\"\nEllmers' defenders called it \"supposition and idle gossip,\" said Linda Dark, a former staffer to North Carolina's Republican Sen. Jesse Helms who now lives in Pinehurst. \"Women in Washington, very often, are put under more scrutiny when it comes to situation like this, people will draw conclusions, particularly if they’re attractive, But these accusations are really unfair and not based in any fact.\"\nThree Republicans are vying to take out Ellmers in next March’s primary, including retired businessman Jim Duncan, who has $206,000 in cash on hand, which positions him well, several operatives said. That includes about $100,000 of his own money, and Duncan has said he is willing to put in more, if necessary.\nFrank Roche, a former economics professor at Elon University who challenged Ellmers in 2014 primary and is running again, called the rumors a “bonus for my campaign, but it’s sad that it’s at the cost of a family,” he said in a telephone interview. “She’s been so exposed in her first four years of misrepresenting herself and lying to the district that she’s not getting the benefit of the doubt now on the rumors about McCarthy.”\nKay Daly, another challenger, stirred national attention with an ad they said ran on cable TV in the district during the second Republican presidential debate, calling Ellmers a “RINO,” or “Republican In Name Only,” then showed Daly firing a shotgun and saying, “I’m hunting RINOs.” Daly and her husband, Jack, have been involved in conservative politics for years, including a 2000 run for state auditor, when Jack Daly allegedly recruited a homeless man to run because he had the same last name as the Democratic incumbent, according to a report by the Associated Press .\n“I'm not running against Renee because she's been unfaithful to her husband; I'm running against Renee because she's been unfaithful to her constituents,” Daly wrote in an email.\nHer opponents face a number of obstacles in unseating her. State lawmakers voted last month to move the state’s primary up to March 15, which gives the other candidates a shortened timeline for building credible campaigns.\n“There’s a price point they must reach in order to reap the benefits of another candidates sins, true or not,” said one North Carolina Republican consultant, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the race. “With this new primary date, it is more costly than ever before to move the needle on a race.”\nMcCarthy's Benghazi gift to team Hillary By Rachael Bade\nAnd there’s always the possibility that Ellmers’ three opponents could split the anti-Ellmers vote — though under the state’s election procedures, Ellmers still needs to earn more than 40 percent of the vote to avoid a runoff with her top primary challenger.\nLast year’s primary against Roche — Ellmers defeated him, 59 percent to 41 percent — showed there’s a sizeable number of Republicans who already aren’t inclined to support the incumbent. A one-on-one runoff this time around raises the specter of national groups diving into the race to defeat Ellmers — which didn’t happen in 2014.\n“It wouldn’t surprise me at all if national money came in here in a big way,” Wrenn said. “That’s a big wild card. If an independent group spends a million there, that changes the whole landscape.”\nIn contrast, Jones’ letter likely buoyed his outsider status among conservatives in his eastern North Carolina district, Republicans said. Jones has long been a foreign-policy iconoclast, and Taylor Griffin, a former Bush administration official, cited Jones’ anti-interventionist stances (he voted against the Iraq War, for example) when he challenged Jones last year.\n\"I don't think there was much political calculus behind putting out that letter, but it may have been a very smart move at the end of the day,\" said Paul Shumaker, a Republican consultant, working on North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr's campaign.\nGriffin is running again, a year after nearly unseating Jones, losing 51 percent to 45 percent. Phil Law, another Republican, is also challenging Jones.\n“I’m not the establishment candidate, and we’ve got two candidates who are running, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Law, and they will not be able to attack me as a part of establishment,” Jones said in a phone interview with POLITICO. \"I have had many people in the district tell me I did the right thing.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.the-dispatch.com/article/20000219/NEWS/2190307?tc=ar", "http://www.fayobserver.com/news/local/rep-renee-ellmers-affair-rumors-very-ugly-side-of-politics/article_cc2d42f0-3345-5d16-b054-6efe122a4f9d.html", "http://abc11.com/politics/ellmers-refuses-questions-about-affair-allegations/1031625/"], "published": "2015-10-18T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:27:39.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
