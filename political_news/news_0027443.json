(Pete Marovich/Bloomberg) September 30 at 5:22 PM The understanding reached by President Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that neither side will engage in or condone economic espionage in cyberspace has triggered the correct degree of skepticism among experts who doubt that China will stop its well-documented theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies [“ Will the Chinese really stop hacking? ” The Fed Page, Sept. 28]. The real question is whether the current understanding will serve as the foundation for more meaningful discussions between two of the world’s leading cyberpowers.\nLike nuclear powers who have to agree on constraints, controls and confidence-building measures, cyberpowers must find mechanisms to interact and prevent more destructive uses of their cybercapabilities. Many experts dismiss the notion of deterrence in cyberspace because it is too easy for state and non-state actors to conduct disruptive operations; trying to achieve deterrence in cyberspace is a fool’s errand. But that does not mean it’s impossible or shouldn’t be attempted.\nAs national security adviser Susan Rice noted, Chinese economic hacking is an “economic and national security concern for the United States.” The understanding reached by Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi can be a small but necessary step in creating a framework for further discussions and agreements on a balance of power that would serve the national security interests of both countries.\nTerry Thompson , Clarksville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:22:04.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
