He has also made it clear when he spoke before reporters that he has actually told President Barack Obama of his plans to retain Canada's streak as an ISIS-fighting country, despite pulling out of the coalition. \nCNN's partner CBC reported that Trudeau is looking toward providing help for those affected by the war and violence in Syria and Iraq in a more \"humanitarian\" way, instead of engaging in the bombing missions. \nWhile the new prime minister says the U.S. president knows of his plans, a White House statement that detailed the phone call between the two leaders said there was no mention of withdrawing from the airstrike missions, according to CNN . \nTrudeau will be taking the place of Conservative Stephen Harper in the next weeks, who is known for his support for the airstrike campaigns against the biggest terror group in the world. Harper sent out Canadian warplanes in November of last year to help the coalition against the fierce battle against ISIS forces. \nThe new prime minister's strategy might come as a new flavor to Canadians who have seen Harper's efforts to aid the coalition, but as many outlets noted, his popularity among the Canadian people could be one of the key factors that would lead them to understand his intentions of engaging in the battle against the extremists \"in a responsible way.\" \nMeanwhile, the Daily Star said the ISIS has released a new campaign video wherein the militants are seen blowing up rubber condoms and attaching an explosive at the end of each balloon. The blown-up contraceptives are released into the sky as one of the bombs explode in the air. \nThe bizarre footage also shows numerous \"condom bombs,\" as they have been branded, lined up, ready for release. It is yet unclear if the new clip is flaunting the jihadists' new way of attacking members of the U.S.-led coalition, but the outlet noted that the terrorists may have started using \"safer\" attack methods against Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:23:06.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
