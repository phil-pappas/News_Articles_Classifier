Delaware tomorrow. You can feel the Joementum!” \nThe tweet sent around 10:30 a.m., didn’t make clear if Biden had already confirmed that fact to Obama at an early lunch, or if Biden was due to confirm that run to Obama at a looming lunch hour. \nBut the message only furthers what’s been reported in recent hours about a likely Biden run. \nWhen it comes to goofy gaffes and dimwitted declarations, nobody does it better than America’s most beloved uncle figure, smilin’ Joe Biden. “Biden Time: Crazy Uncle Joe In His Own Words” chronicles his most memorably moronic or misfired quotes over the last 40-plus years \nAs WND previously reported , sources have been confirming for days the vice president was going to jump in the race. \nA Pennsylvania congressman, Rep. Brendan Boyle, tweeted just this week: “I have a very good source close to Joe that tells me VP Biden will run for Prez.” And Ed Henry with Fox News tweeted in that same time frame three sources told him Biden was definitely running and was probably going to make it official during a planned October 24 event in Iowa. \nYet another source who recently traveled with Biden’s son, Joseph Hunter, told WND on Monday the vice president was definitely going to seek the White House.
