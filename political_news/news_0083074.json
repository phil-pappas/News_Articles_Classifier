The SABC and Communications Minister Faith Muthambi said they were still studying the judgment.\nMr Majavu said there was a possibility of an appeal to the Constitutional Court by Mr Motsoeneng, but that depended on how the minister and the SABC decided to proceed.\nMs Madonsela’s various findings have been contested by President Jacob Zuma, Parliament and the former CEO of the Passenger Rail Agency of SA.\nThe judgment also has a bearing on an application brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to the Constitutional Court on the Nkandla matter.\nConstitutional law professor Pierre de Vos said the judgment was about the standing of the findings and the remedial action contained in the public protector’s reports.\nThe judgment stated: \"It is well settled in our law that until a decision is set aside by a court in proceedings for judicial review it exists in fact and it has legal consequences that cannot simply be overlooked.\"\nThe SABC and Ms Muthambi ignored Ms Madonsela’s recommendations and appointed attorneys to \"investigate the veracity of the findings and recommendations of the public protector\".\nIt was \"impermissible\" for the SABC to have established a parallel process to that of the public protector, the court said.\nThe court found that if the SABC was aggrieved by the public protector’s report, its \"remedy\" was to challenge it by way of a review.\nMr De Vos said the case was different to the EFF’s application to the Constitutional Court on Nkandla. However, if the Constitutional Court agreed with the principle set out by the judgment — and they may not — it meant the way the Nkandla report was dealt with was wrong.\nExecutive secretary for the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) Lawson Naidoo said the judgment was a \"step in the right direction\" towards clarifying the powers of the public protector.\n\"I have no doubt that it will assist the Constitutional Court greatly when it deliberates on the matter,\" he said.\nThe SCA case follows a protracted legal battle started by the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape High Court to force both the SABC and Ms Muthambi’s hand in enacting the public protector’s directives contained in her explosive report, When Governance and Ethics Fail, on the governance mess at the state broadcaster.\nIn her report, Ms Madonsela made damning findings against Mr Motsoeneng, who was acting COO at the time and was subsequently appointed permanently to the post. They included that: he lied about his matric qualification; his hiring on an acting basis was irregular; and his salary increase from R1.5m to R2.4m in the same financial year was irregular.\nBut the SABC not only ignored the public protector’s remedial actions, it sought a legal opinion from a law firm that apparently exonerated Mr Motsoeneng. In addition, the SABC hired Mr Motsoeneng as its permanent COO without giving the public protector notice.\nThe DA then approached the Western Cape High Court seeking Mr Motsoeneng’s suspension and disciplinary action to be taken against. The DA also wanted his appointment set aside.\nAlthough the high court ruled on the suspension and disciplinary action in April, it is yet to make a pronouncement on Mr Motsoeneng’s appointment.\n© BDlive 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:28:09.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
