To dress as an energy vampire, the Department of Energy suggests dressing like a vampire and hanging electrical cords around your neck and arms.\n\"This Halloween, unplug all the unused phone chargers in your house and attach them to yourself for a costume that will fill your friends with terror while saving you money,\" the department said. It even provided a picture of the costume in case people can't picture it.\nThat's the only truly terrifying costume the Energy Department is suggesting. Other ideas include dressing up like a particle accelerator, which you can do by walking around all night with a lit-up hula hoop around your waste. The department said that would make it clear to people that you are a particle accelerator.\n  Why Katy Perry and Bill Clinton are an awkward pairing Katy Perry's lyrics may have some echoes of the former president's salacious past.\nBy Sean Langille • 10/24/15 5:37 PM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ \"Run blinking LED piping along a hula-hoop and attach some suspenders, decorate your black turtleneck with quarks, bosons and neutrinos, and BAM! You're a particle accelerator!\" the department said.\nAnother idea is to go as a wind turbine, which involves cutting out windmill blades out of foam and then wrapping yourself in a white towel.\n\"You won't produce electricity, but at least you'll generate conversations wherever you go, so why not impress your friends with the fact that U.S. wind energy prices reached all-time lows in 2014, or that wind could provide up to 35 percent of the nation's power by 2050?\" the department asked.\nThe department's proposal for a solar panel is to wear a sandwich board that has drawings on it to make it look like a solar panel.\n\"BONUS: Have a friend dress up as the sun and spend the night basking in his or her glow,\" the department suggested.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump on super PACs: 'I think they’re the dumbest thing' Trump suggested most of the leading outside support groups backing presidential candidates \"are a disaster.\"\n  4:50 PM The Department's final idea is to dress like Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who helped negotiate the much-criticized Iran nuclear deal. To get the right look, the department suggested a \"foundering father\" wig.\nTop Story Trump on Carson's rise: It just means I have to work a bit harder Two   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:00:49.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
