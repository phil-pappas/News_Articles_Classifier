Known as ICD-10, it expands the number of diagnostic codes from 14,000 to about 68,000, dramatically increasing the specificity of information doctors can transmit to insurers to get paid.\nThere could be some glitches as providers adjust to the new system, although those won't be known for a few more days since doctors won't immediately bill for healthcare services performed starting Oct. 1. And some experts fear that insurers could reject more claims, as they scrutinize more specific codes to see whether certain services were medically necessary.\nBut overall, providers and insurers say they're prepared for the transition. They say an update to the billing codes was long overdue, since the current ICD-9 system has been in place since 1979. Under the old system, doctors couldn't make basic differentiations such as specifying whether a patient had Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.\nMore from the Washington Examiner The Chinese problem that won't go away China's Xi made clear that China would not back off its claims in the wide areas of ocean far off its coast.\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/05/15 12:01 AM \"What we're hearing from our members is they're ready,\" said Lynne Thomas Gordon, chief executive of the American Health Information Management Association. \"They see the need for ICD-10 because it's difficult for people to code with such an outdated system. They're almost like, 'Let's get it over with, let's go for it.'\"\nThe change isn't likely to have a huge effect on patients, who typically don't have to deal with medical billing codes. But it is a big transition for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, private insurance companies and the government health insurance programs of Medicare and Medicaid, which are constantly transmitting codes back and forth.\nMost doctors will use only a subset of codes, depending on their specialty. Hospitals have the most to learn, and they've spent millions of dollars on training their billing departments and hiring coding experts whose job it is to know ICD-10 backward and forward.\n\"Hospitals have been working really hard to get ready,\" said Chantal Worzala, policy director for the American Hospital Association. \"They've been training their staff, they've upgraded their IT systems. So the vast majority of our members feel confident they'll be able to make the transition.\"\nAt the same time, independent doctors and smaller hospitals could struggle more with the transition, since preparing for it cost money and staff hours.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Voting Rights Act unlikely to be part of Obama legacy Next year's presidential election is on track to be the first conducted without the law's full protection.\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/05/15 12:01 AM \"I think it's fair to say that smaller hospitals have fewer resources to make this transition,\" Worzala said. \"That's not to say they're not ready.\"\nThe American Medical Association, which represents doctors, pushed back against the new codes until July, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services eased up on the rules during the transition period. The guidance says claims won't be denied if doctors list the wrong codes as long as they're in the right family of codes, along with easing other potential pitfalls for doctors.\nThe codes are virtually the only way for insurers to decide whether to reimburse for a particular health service, and if so, how much. They're also used among doctors to transmit a patient's medical information and communicate what kind of a procedure or treatment the person might need.\nThe codes also have an impact on scientists and medical researchers who rely on them to study how patients react to certain treatments, Gordon noted. \"If you're a researcher, you have better information to pull upon,\" she said.\nThe codes are so specific that lots of fun has been poked at them. There are codes for being bitten by a macaw, being injured in a prison swimming pool and for being hurt by a \"prolonged stay in [a] weightless environment.\" At least one Twitter handle, @EveryICD10, is tweeting out every one of the individual codes.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Can Clinton delete her past?

The specificity forces doctors to be more careful in recording a patient's ailment. And many new conditions have been discovered since the old codes were implemented more than 30 years ago.\n\"There have been a lot of things that have changed in the last 39 years,\" Jorwic said. \"The new system is going to bring the coding system up to date. It will allow for more specificity and data and [will help] combating fraud and abuse.\"\nTop Story Defiant   calls Fiorina a liar Cecile   \"deceptive.\"\n  3:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:19:50.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
