The commander of the Libyan National Army of the internationally-recognized House of Representatives (HoR) government in Tobruk launched new attacks in Benghazi and the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned the military escalation saying it undermines the current political dialogue.\nOperation Doom\nThe Libyan Armed Forces, headed by General Khalifa Haftar begun the military operation, “Operation Doom,” claiming they will get rid of Islamic State militants and other Islamists in the Libyan city. Digital Journal reported that some parts of Benghazi are still controlled by the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries but some of that group have joined the Islamic State that according to reports it expands its influence in the city.\nHowever, the Tripoli-based General National Congress (GNC) government said that the operation launched by Haftar, aims to allow the HoR government to control Benghazi and then attack Libyan cities controlled by GNC. Pro-GNC Libyan Observer reported that the Libyan Armed Forces would move on to cities of Misrata, Tripoli when Operation Doom complete its target in Benghazi. It is well-known that Haftar, rejects any negotiations with the GNC militia, Libya Dawn, whom he calls terrorists and radicals.\nThe United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) on Sunday strongly condemned the military escalation, stressing to all sides that they need to give the ongoing political dialogue a chance to bring the country’s conflict to an end.\nUNSMIL response\n“The timing of airstrikes clearly aims at undermining the ongoing efforts to end the conflict ,” USMIL said of Saturday’s escalation.\nIt noted that Benghazi has suffered for too long, with too many civilians having been killed or wounded and more than 100,000 having been displaced by the conflict that has raged in the city for over a year now. Residential neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble, it added.\nThe airstrikes are “a clear attempt to undermine and derail the ongoing efforts to end the conflict” at a time when the negotiations currently taking place in Skhirat, Morocco, have entered “a final and most critical stage,” said the Mission.\n“The only solution must be within the framework of the ongoing dialogue process and a political settlement that ensures inclusion, balance and consensus. The parties in Libya now have a historic opportunity to reach such an agreement that brings an end to the divisions and suffering, and allows for a new page to be turned in Libya,” it continued.\n“UNSMIL calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Benghazi and across Libya, and on the warring parties to desist from any escalation or counterattack, and to exercise utmost restraint to give the ongoing dialogue in Skhirat the chance to successfully conclude in the coming hours.”\nHaftar\nIn July, the European Union announced it considers imposing asset freeze and travel ban on General Haftar, as the former Gaddafi aide is using his armed forces sometimes against the United Nations-sponsored peace talks.\nInternational Business Times spoke with the General’s spokesman Mohammed al-Hejazi then who described the potential sanctions as “meaningless.” “If the West calls us criminals it makes no difference to us because we are fighting terrorism and will continue,” he then said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:00:11.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
