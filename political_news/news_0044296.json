It has also shown the rest of the world the current capacities of the Russian army in situations of real warfare. To everyone’s astonishment, it has proved to possess a system of signal jamming capable of rendering the Atlantic Alliance deaf and blind. Despite a far superior budget, the United States have just lost their military domination.\nVOLTAIRE NETWORK | DAMASCUS (SYRIA) | 19 OCTOBER 2015\nThe Russian military intervention in Syria, which was at first considered a risky bet by Moscow against the jihadists, has transformed itself into a demonstration of power which upsets the strategic balance of the world [ 1 ]. Originally conceived to isolate and then destroy the armed groups equipped by states who support the jihadists in violation of the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council, the operation has now blinded all the Western actors and their allies.\nThe Pentagon is now divided between those who tend to minimise the facts while attempting to find a weakness in the Russian system, and those who, on the contrary, consider that the United States have lost their superiority in terms of conventional wafare, and that it will take long years before they are able to recover it [ 2 ].\nWe remember that in 2008, during the war in South Ossetia, although the Russian forces had managed to repel the Georgian attack, they had above all shown the world the deplorable state of their equipment. And only ten days ago, ex-Secretary of Defence Robert Gates and ex-National Security advisor Condoleezza Rice were describing the Russian army as a « second-rate » force. [ 3 ].\nSo how has the Russian Federation managed to rebuild its defence industry, and to design and produce very high-technology weapons without the Pentagon measuring the importance of the phenomenon, and allowing itself to be over-taken ? Have the Russians used all their new weapons in Syria, or do they have other surprises in reserve ? [ 4 ]\nThe confusion in Washington is so great that the White House has cancelled the official visit by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and a delegation of the Russian Chief of Staff. This decision was taken after an identical visit to Turkey by a Russian military delegation. There is little point in discussing the operations in Syria, because the Pentagon does not know what is happening there. Furious, the « liberal hawks » and the neo-conservatives are demanding a relaunch of the military budget, and have succeeded in stopping the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.\nIn the most bizarre fashion, the Atlantist commentators who are witnessing the out-distancing of US military power are now denouncing the dangers of Russian imperialism [ 5 ]. And yet Russia is only acting to save the Syrian People, and proposing that other states work in collaboration with them, while the United States, when they enjoyed military pre-eminence, imposed their economic system and destroyed a number of states.\nWe are obliged to note that the hesitant declarations by Washington, published during the Russian deployment before the offensive, should not be interpreted as a slow political adaptation of official rhetoric, but should be understood for what they actually reveal – the fact that the Pentagon did not know the terrain. It had become deaf and blind.\nA system of generalised jamming\nWe know, since the incident of the USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea on the 12th April 2014, that the Russian Air Force has at its disposition a weapon which enables it to jam all radars, all control circuits, all systems for the transmission of information, etc. [ 6 ]. Since the beginning of its military deployment, Russia had installed a jamming centre at Hmeymim, to the North of Latakia. Then, suddenly, the USS Donald Cook incident occurred, but this time within a perimeter of 300 kilometres – which includes the NATO base at Incirlik (Turkey). And this is still going on. Because the event happened during a sand-storm of historical proportions, the Pentagon first thought its measuring equipment had malfunctioned, but then discovered that it had been jammed. Completely.\nModern conventional warfare is based on what is known as « C4i » – an acronym which corresponds to the English terms « Command », « Control », « Communications », « Computer » and « intelligence ». The satellites, planes and drones, ships and submarines, tanks and now even the combatants themselves, are all connected to one another by a system of permanent communication, which enables the Chiefs of Staff to oversee and command the fighting more efficiently. It is this entire system – NATO’s nervous system – which is presently jammed in Syria and part of Turkey.\nAccording to the Romanian expert Valentin Vasilescu, Russia has installed several Krasukha-4, equipped its planes with SAP-518/ SPS-171 jamming equipment (like the plane that overflew the USS Donald Cook), and its helicopters with the Richag-AV system. Besides this, it is using the spy-ship Priazovye (Project 864 Vishnya class, to use NATO terminology), in the Mediterranean [ 7 ].\nIt seems that Russia has agreed not to interfere with Israëli communications – a US preserve – which means that it will not deploy its jamming system in South Syria.\nRussian planes have enjoyed the privilege of violating Turkish air space many times. Their purpose was not to measure the reaction time of the Turkish Air Force, but to verify the efficiency of their jamming capabililies in the area concerned, and also to keep an eye the installations which are at the disposition of the jihadists in Turkey.\nHigh-performance Cruise missiles\nRussia has used several new weapons, like the 26 stealth (or LO technology) cruise missiles (3M-14T Kaliber-NK), equivalent to the American RGM/UGM-109E Tomahawk [ 8 ]. Fired by its fleet in the Caspian Sea – with no military necessity – they reached and destroyed 11 targets situated at 1,500 kilometres distance, in the non-jammed area – so that NATO could appreciate their performance. These missiles crossed Iranian and Iraqi air space at an altitude varying between 50 and 100 metres, depending on the terrain, and flying just four kilometres away from a US drone. None of them were lost, compared to US missiles, which have a margin of error beteen 5 % and 10 %, depending on the models [ 9 ]. At the same time, this salvo demonstrated the waste of the incredible sums of money spent on the useless « anti-missile shield » built by the Pentagon around Russia –even though it was officially intended for protection against Iranian launch sites.\nTaking into account that these missiles can be fired from submarines situated anywhere in the oceans, and that they can transport nuclear warheads, the Russians have clearly made up for their delay as far as launchers are concerned.\nFinally, in the case of a nuclear confrontation, the Russian Federation would be destroyed by the United States – and vice versa – but would win in the case of a conventional war.\nOnly the Russians and the Syrians are capable of evaluating the situation on the ground. All the other military information from other sources, including the jihadists, are without foundation, since only Russia and Syria have an overall picture of the terrain. Moscow and Damascus intend to profit as far as possible from their advantage, and are therefore keeping their operations secret.\nFrom the official communiqués and the confidences of certain officers, we may conclude that at least 5,000 jihadists have been killed, including several leaders of Ahrar el-Sham, al-Qaïda and the Islamic Emirate. At least 10,000 mercenaries have fled to Turkey, Iraq and Jordan. The Syrian Arab Army and Hezbollah have re-captured the area without waiting for the promised Iranian reinforcements.\nThe bombing campaign should end by the Orthodox Christmas. The question which will then have to be answered is whether or not Russia will be authorised to finish its job by pursuing the jihadists who have found refuge in Turkey, Iraq and Jordan. Failing this, Syria will have been saved, but the problem will still not have been resolved. The Muslim Brotherhood will not fail to seek revenge, and the United States will not fail to use them again against other targets.\nKeep in mind\nThe Russian operation in Syria was designed to deprive the jihadist groups of the support they receive from various states under the cover of aid for the « democratic opposition ».\nThe operation demanded the use of new weaponry, and transformed itself into a demonstration of Russian force.\nRussia now has the capacity for jamming all NATO communications. It has now become the primary power in terms of conventional warfare\nThis performance has stoked discord in Washington. It is still too soon to say whether this will favour President Obama, or whether it will be used by the « liberal hawks » to justify an increase in the military budget.\nThierry Meyssan\nTranslation\nPete Kimberley\n[ 1 ] “ Russian Military Uses Syria as Proving Ground, and West Takes Notice ”, Steven Lee Myers & Eric Schmitt, The New York Times, October 14, 2015.\n[ 2 ] “ Top NATO general: Russians starting to build air defense bubble over Syria ”, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, The Washington Post, September 29, 2015.\n[ 3 ] “ How America can counter Putin’s moves in Syria ”, by Condoleezza Rice, Robert M.

I think so. The president hasn’t made the decision yet.”\nU.S. Sec. of State, John Kerry\nU.S. Ambassador to UN, Samantha Power\nOn the same day, under tremendous pressure from utopian Secretary Of Defense Ashton Carter, Obama conceded a virtually open-ended commitment of US forces in Afghanistan. These developments come in the wake of earlier bellicose outbursts by both Carter and Kerry. And at the United Nations, humanitarian bomber Samantha Power has violated all norms of diplomatic decency by refusing to join in condemning the shelling of the Russian Embassy in Damascus in the midst of a pro-Putin and pro-Assad demonstration as an act of terrorism — obviously, out of concern for the tender sensibilities of the terrorist groups supported by the CIA.\nFrom the combat zone in northern Syria comes news of the deployment of a new Russian electronic jamming system which can reportedly blind radar, disrupt electronic guidance systems, and interfere with satellite imagery as well. As a result, NATO is effectively blinded inside a bubble of 600 km in diameter centered on the Russian base at Latakia, reports, Thierry Meyssan from Damascus.\nRussian Secret Weapon Deployed in Syria\nThe technology in question seems similar to the KRET Richag-AV system, although it apparently functions on a larger scale. A tactical version of this system was presented to journalists in the Russian city of Back in April 2015. As Sputnik reported then:\n“The Richag-AV system, mounted on the Mi-8MTPR1 (a variant of the Mi-8MTB5-1 helicopter) is said to have no global equivalent. Its electronic countermeasures system is designed to jam radar, sonar and other detection systems in the aims of defending aircraft, helicopters, drones, ground and naval forces against air-to-air and surface-to-air defense systems within a radius of several hundred kilometers. It can be mounted on units from any branch of the armed forces, including helicopters and airplanes, as well as ground and ship-based forces. The Mi8-MTPR1-based Richag-AV platform, using multi-beam antenna arrays with DRFM technology, is designed to actively jam and thus ‘blind’ radar systems in order to defend against radio-electronic guided weapons systems. In a combat situation, the system would operate as part of an aviation shock attack group aimed at breaking through virtually any defense system, blinding everything up to and including the US MIM-104 ‘Patriot’ anti-aircraft missile system.”[ i ]\nNATO supreme commander and US Air Force General Philip Breedlove was probably talking about this new KRET system when he addressed the German Marshall Fund on Monday, September 28. Here Breedlove had warned that Russia was creating an “A2/AD bubble” over the Syrian coast, and the eastern Mediterranean. A2/AD is the abbreviation for anti-access and area denial. Breedlove pointed out that Russia has already established such bubbles over the Baltic Sea at the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, and also over the Crimea and the black Sea.\n‘While Russia’s stated goal in moving into Syria is to fight the Islamic State, NATO’s top commander believes Russia’s new presence includes the first pieces of an intricate layer of defensive systems deployed to hinder U.S. and coalition operations in the region. “As we see the very capable air defense [systems] beginning to show up in Syria, we’re a little worried about another A2/AD bubble being created in the eastern Mediterranean,” said Breedlove to an audience at the German Marshall Fund Monday. A2/AD stands for anti-access/area denial. During the early stages of warfare, A2/AD could have been a moat around a castle, or spikes dug into the ground—anything to keep the enemy off a certain swathe of territory. In the 21st century, however, A2/AD is a combination of systems such as surface-to-air missile batteries and anti-ship missiles deployed to prevent forces from entering or traversing a certain area—from land, air or sea. According to Breedlove, the introduction of an A2/AD bubble in Syria would be Russia’s third denial zone around Europe. The first and oldest he said, was in the Baltics where the Russian naval base in Kaliningrad has robust anti-air capabilities. The second zone—originating from Russian-occupied Crimea—covers the Black Sea. “Russia has developed a very strong A2/AD capability in the Black Sea,” said Breedlove. “Essentially their [anti-ship] cruise missiles range the entire Black Sea, and their air defense missiles range about 40 to 50 percent of the Black Sea.”’[ ii ]\nRussian SU-24 fighter: blinded Aegis radar on US destroyer in Black Sea, knocked out guidance for Tomahawk cruise missiles.\nUS Aegis destroyer firing cruise missile: shut down by new Russian jamming system\nIn addition, the Russian military had provided a demonstration of their ability to blind even the sophisticated Aegis phased array radar, which is part of the equipment of modern US cruisers and destroyers. This incident came during the Crimean crisis of spring 2014, when the US sent a destroyer into the Black Sea. This ship was repeatedly buzzed up by a Russian Sukhoi-24 jet fighter, which was able to cripple the radar guidance the systems of the vessel. Here is a summary of the incident from Live Leak:\n“The US destroyer USS Donald Cook, equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles entered the neutral waters of the Black Sea on April 10, 2014. The purpose was a demonstration of force and intimidation in connection with the position of Russia in Ukraine and Crimea. The appearance of American warships in these waters is in contradiction of the Montreux Convention about the nature and duration of stay in the Black Sea by the military ships of countries not washed by this sea. In response, Russia sent an unarmed bomber Su- 24 to fly around the U.S. destroyer. However, experts say that this plane was equipped with the latest Russian electronic warfare complex. According to this version, Aegis spotted from afar the approaching aircraft, and sounded alarm. Everything went normally, and the American radars calculated the speed of the approaching target. But suddenly all the screens went blank. Aegis was not working any more, and the rockets could not get target information. Meanwhile, Su-24 flew over the deck of the destroyer, did battle turn and simulated a missile attack on the target. Then it turned and repeated the maneuver. And did so 12 times.”[ iii ]\nThese developments only add to the urgency of a purge of the Obama cabinet, starting with Ashton Carter and John Kerry. In order to retain his authority, Obama needs to carry out some high profile firings, with special emphasis on warmonger officials who have insisted on going off the reservation. Obama would also be well advised to cancel the Trident Juncture ’15 NATO exercise in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. This drill presents too much danger of collisions between NATO and Russian forces and should not be held. Beware above all a flight forward by crazed neocons.\n[i] — http://sputniknews.com/military/20150304/1019042643.html#ixzz3omjOH4o2\n[ii] — https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/29/top-nato-general-russians-starting-to-build-air-defense-bubble-over-syria/\n[iii] — http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=588_1398932554", "external_links": ["http://tarpley.net/images/Samantha_Power.jpg", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//blogspot/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/29/top-nato-general-russians-starting-to-build-air-defense-bubble-over-syria/", "http://tarpley.net/#fii", "http://sputniknews.com/military/20150304/1019042643.html#ixzz3omjOH4o2", "http://www.voltairenet.org/auteur125569.html?lang=en", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/_sv2Kdd4ApY", "http://www.gmfus.org/events/nato%E2%80%99s-next-steps-warsaw-and-beyond-livestreamed", "http://tarpley.net/images/twsp.ico", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article185860.html", "http://tarpley.net/kerry-wants-enablers-on-the-ground-in-syria-but-no-decision-from-obama-on-ground-war-yet-russians-jamming-nato-electronics/", "http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=588_1398932554", "http://www.ziaruldegarda.ro/cu-ce-arme-ultrasecrete-a-cistigat-putin-suprematia-in-razboiul-radioelectronic-din-siria/", "http://tarpley.net/audio/WCR-20151017.mp3", "http://tarpley.net/#fi-ref", "http://blogdogcicle.blogspot.ca/search?q=Russia+is+not+the+Aggressor&#038;max-results=20&#038;by-date=true", "http://ria.ru/world/20151008/1299041800.html", "http://tarpley.net/#fiii", "http://tarpley.net/images/Sukhoi_Su-24_inflight_Mishin-2.jpg", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html", "http://ecfr.eu/page/-/Russias_Quiet_Military_Revolution.pdf", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb7", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb6", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb5", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb4", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb3", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb2", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb1", "http://www.voltairenet.org/auteur29.html?lang=en", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189021.html", "http://twsp.us/", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb9", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nb8", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh9", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh8", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/world/middleeast/russian-military-uses-syria-as-proving-ground-and-west-takes-notice.html", "http://twsp.us/briefing/20151016", "http://edition.cnn.com/2015/10/08/politics/russian-missiles-syria-landed-iran/", "http://tarpley.net/images/John_Kerry_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait.jpg", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh1", "http://reseauinternational.net/larme-ultrasecrete-qui-permet-a-poutine-dassoir-sa-suprematie-dans-la-guerre-radio-electronique-en-syrie/", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh3", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh2", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh5", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh4", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh7", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189043.html#nh6", "http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L400xH300/1_-_1-129-3a4d9-2236a.jpg", "http://tarpley.net/images/US_Navy_Aegis-class_destroyer_USS_Hoppe.jpg", "http://tarpley.net/images/ufaa.ico", "http://tarpley.net/images/20151016-tweet.png", "http://againstausterity.org/", "http://tarpley.net/#fii-ref", "http://www.voltairenet.org/article189028.html", "http://www.irna.ir/en/News/81791375/", "http://tarpley.net/#fiii-ref", "http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/russland-und-syrien-das-rezept-gegen-putins-imperialismus-a-1057162.html", "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2015/10/248049.htm", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQwFtRx7_uc", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/09/29/top-nato-general-russians-starting-to-build-air-defense-bubble-over-syria/", "http://tarpley.net/#fi"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:02:38.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
