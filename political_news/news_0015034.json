Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during the CNN Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. Bernie Sanders joked about Larry David's \"Saturday Night Live\" impersonation of him, pointing out on the campaign trail Sunday that he has \"an ample supply of underwear,\" NBC News reported. The Vermont senator told supporters in Iowa, \"In terms of Larry David, I think we're going to put him up on the stage at our next rally — let him do it rather than me. He does it better than I do.\" Eddie Murphy Receives Top U.S. Humor Prize Mimicking Sanders, David said: \"I'm the only candidate up here who's not a billionaire. I don't have a Super PAC, I don't have a backpack. I carry my stuff around loose in my arms like a professor between classes … I own one pair of underwear — that's it.\" Real-life Sanders responded: \"Last week, I bought my second pair of underwear,\" adding: \"Please don't write it down. That was a joke.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:27:09.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
