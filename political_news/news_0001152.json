Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee said on Friday (October 23) he is dropping out of the race for Democratic nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Chafee, who was polling at the bottom of the Democratic field, announced his decision in a speech to the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum in Washington. \"After much thought I have decided to end my campaign for president today,\" Chafee said, before calling for the United States to stop getting involved in wars overseas, which had been a key message of his campaign. The field of Democrats seeking the presidency in the November 2016 election narrowed considerably this week. Former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia on Tuesday dropped his bid and said he would explore an independent run for the White House. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden announced he would not seek the top job after months of indecision about whether to run. His announcement removed a potential hurdle for Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Chafee with support from less than 1 percent of respondents.
