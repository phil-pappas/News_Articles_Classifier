Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders saw a small bump in his popularity following last week’s inaugural 2016 Democratic debate, but is still running far behind Hillary Clinton nationally, a new poll released Monday showed.\nThe CNN/ORC poll out Monday found that Clinton still led the Democratic 2016 field with 45% support among registered Democrats and independents, compared to 29% for Sanders.\nVice President Biden, who still hasn’t decided on a run, got 18% in the poll — the first taken after last Tuesday’s debate that saw Clinton and Sanders both perform well — and no other Democratic candidate registered above 1% support.\nIn the prior CNN/ORC poll, taken in mid-September, Clinton got 42%, compared to 24% for Sanders. In that poll, Biden got 22%.\nSCOTT MORGAN/REUTERS Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders saw a bump in popularity but still lags behind Clinton. A separate Monmouth University poll released Monday, however, showed Clinton building on her lead over the Vermont senator.\nThe Monmouth poll, also taken after the debate, found that Clinton got the support of 48% of registered Democrats nationally, compared to 21% for Sanders.\nThose results marked a six-percentage-point jump for Clinton since the last Monmouth poll in September, when she got 42% support, and a statistically meaningless one-percentage-point increase for Sanders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:08:05.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
