Where's Hillary? User Name Current Events Current Events Forum - Latest political news and events Bernie Sanders Endorses Obama's Push to Protect Your Retirement. Where's Hillary? | Mother Jones Quote: Update: Following publication of this story, Sanders' press secretary in his Senate office emailed Mother Jones with a statement: \"Senator Sanders supports the DOLÂ’s fiduciary rule.\" While Sanders had objected to a previous version of the rule, it's not too surprising that he has come out in support of this measure. The Clinton campaign still hasn't discussed whether she supports Obama's proposal. All the Democrats running for president want to assure primary voters that if elected they would crack down on Wall Street. Bernie Sanders regularly rails against the big banks and how the government needs to bust them up. On Thursday, Hillary Clinton released a new plan that described how she'd strengthen Dodd-Frank, the 2010 Dem bill that attempted to fix Wall Street after the crash. But neither Sanders nor Clinton has said whether they support or oppose one of the Obama administration's key proposals to protect consumer investments. Known as the \"fiduciary rule,\" the plan comes from the Department of Labor and attempts to protect the interests of people with retirement accounts. Currently, retirement investment managers don't have a legal responsibility to represent their clients' best interests when offering advice. Instead, they're free to push their clients toward investments that would be profitable for the manager rather than the consumer. A broker might steer a client's 401(k) to a favored firm that sponsored a recent golf outing, for example. That sort of shady advice hurts consumers, especially as old-fashioned pensions continue to decline and are replaced by 401(k)s and IRAs. The Department of Labor has estimated that conflicted advice costs consumers $17 billion per year.
