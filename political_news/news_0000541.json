Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.\nChaffetz is now the chair of the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the conduct of the Secret Service for unrelated scandals. But in 2003, he applied for a job at the Secret Service, and the IG confirmed that this information was examined by dozens of current Secret Service employees.\nThe IG said the leak was large, and that 45 employees accessed the application, when at most, that number should have been four.\n\"At least one senior Secret Service executive, who knew about the fact of the Chaffetz application, suggested that it be leaked,\" the report said. The action of this senior Secret Secret executive, Edward Lowery III, appears to violate the federal Privacy Act.\n  White House claim: We've got Putin right where we want him \"Right now [Russia's]   south.\"\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/01/15 12:01 AM \"Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out,\" Lowery emailed.\n\"The Privacy Act prohibits the government from disclosing records it maintains about an individual to anyone — even inside their own agency — unless that individual consents to disclosure or the disclosure falls within a dozen categories of permissible disclosure,\" the report said. \"Knowing and willful disclosure of material protected by the Privacy Act is a crime.\"\n\"The Inspector General could not determine exactly how many of the 45 employees disclosed this information to others, but can conclude that the disclosure was widespread,\" the release added.\n\"The OIG identified 18 supervisors — including the Acting Chief of Staff and the Deputy Director — who knew or should have known that Chairman Chaffetz' personal information was being accessed. Yet, with a single exception, there was no evidence that any of the managers attempted to inform up the chain or to stop or remediate the activity,\" the release added.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner RNC launches next phase of voter turnout plan for Election Day The RNC is in year three of a major reboot, after Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama in 2012.\nBy David M.
