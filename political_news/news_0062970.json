(NYSE: MATX), has announced the expansion of its corporate giving activities to include support for charitable organizations and community efforts in Alaska .\nMatson Foundation contributes funds, material goods and services to assist in the development and operation of locally-focused not-for-profit, charitable and community-based organizations located where Matson has business operations. Last year, the Foundation donated more than $1.9 million in cash and in-kind support to organizations in Hawaii , Guam / Micronesia , the South Pacific and the mainland U.S.\nWith the addition of Alaska as a new focus area, the Foundation now has three geographically oriented committees – Pacific, Mainland and Alaska – each led by local Matson leaders that consider requests from their respective communities.
