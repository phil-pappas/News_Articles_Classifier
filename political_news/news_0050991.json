Decision now rests with Gov. Mike Pence. Buy Photo 6 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIndiana is expected to pay off a federal unemployment loan to relieve businesses from shouldering another year of penalties that are projected to reach $327 million next year. \nA committee staffed with state lawmakers and a budget leader authorized a plan Friday for the state to pay off the $250 million loan with an advance from the state’s general fund. \nThe state must pay off the loan by early November so that businesses can avoid paying penalties in 2016 because of the debt. Those penalties are projected at $126 per employee, an increase from $105 this year. \nThe loan dates to 2008, when the state had to begin borrowing from the federal government to meet unemployment demands as the recession took hold. \nSeveral lawmakers, including the Indiana House’s top Republican, lauded the committee’s action Friday. But the decision ultimately lies with Gov. Mike Pence, who has said his administration is exploring paying off the loan to provide “tax relief for job creators.” \nWhen asked for comment Friday, the governor's office would only say \"stay tuned\" for more information. \nHouse Speaker Brian Bosma, an Indianapolis Republican, said the state’s ability to pay off the federal loan will save money for Hoosier employers. \n\"This move is the right decision as we look to maintain Indiana's favorable business climate and keep our historic jobs numbers growing,” Bosma said in a statement. \nMaterial presented to the committee by the state Department of Workforce Development stated that Pence would make a decision by the end of the month. Statements sent by several lawmakers Friday indicated the state would move forward to pay off the loan. \nThe head of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce said the organization is looking forward to final approval by Pence. \n“While policymakers face many difficult decisions, we feel this one was straightforward: Penalize Indiana employers and their employees an additional $327 million for 2016 — or keep that money in our state to have it reinvested by growing companies and adding more jobs,” Kevin Brinegar, the chamber’s president and CEO, said in a statement released Friday. \nUnder the plan, the state will be reimbursed by the end of the fiscal year in June. The plan allows the unemployment insurance trust fund to borrow from the state to pay off the federal government by the November deadline. Then the trust fund, which is filled by employer taxes, will pay back the state. The fund is expected to make that payment by the end of May. \nAt the height of the recession, the debt to the federal government soared upward of $2 billion. But the trust fund is now structurally sound. Committee members spoke Friday of the need to build up a reserve. \nMicah Vincent, director of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, has stressed that the penalties businesses pay are a “tax on hiring.” He said the proposal calling for an advance from the state means it won’t compete with any other spending priorities, such as roads and education. \nThe pending decision to pay off the unemployment loan comes as Pence proposed this week a $1 billion spending plan for Indiana road and bridge improvements. Ultimately, the proposal, which includes aspects that will require legislative approval, will reduce the reserve level to 11.5 percent of the state budget. That’s down from the 12.5 percent level Pence previously said he wanted. \nStar reporter Tony Cook contributed to this story. \nCall Star reporter Chelsea Schneider at (317) 444-6077.
