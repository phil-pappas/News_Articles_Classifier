This will include Auckland's Hyatt Regency Hotel. \n“This is a great decision for families and for the protection of children, and shows that more and more companies are not wanting to profit from sexual exploitation and pornography addiction,” says Bob McCoskrie, National Director of Family First NZ. \n“This decision follows similar decisions by other businesses including Google which changed its policy to prohibit pornographic ads and any ads that link to websites with sexually explicit content on them, and Facebook which has taken steps to improve efforts to block and report child pornography on its site.” \n“Society is finally being woken up to the fact that pornography harms and leads to addictions, broken marriages, increased sexual violence, child sexual abuse, sex trafficking and prostitution,” says Mr McCoskrie. \n“This is a significant cultural shift which is well overdue.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:27:43.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
