Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavoni of Boardman and Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan of Youngstown are sponsoring the proposal in their respective chambers and announced their plans at a news conference in Youngstown.\n“This puts some actual parameters and safeguards in,” Schiavoni said in an interview. “It’s not just like a ‘Here you go, CEO. Do whatever you think is best.’  ”\nJohn Fortney, a spokesman for the Senate Republican majority, said the GOP caucus looks forward to reviewing the bill.\n“We strongly believe in the need for the law the Senate helped pass, making serious and positive changes to put students first,” Fortney said in an email.\nThe new state law turns over control of the troubled district to a CEO with sweeping management, operational and educational powers. It also revises the powers of Ohio academic distress commissions and gives them more of an advisory role in the improvement of a district’s performance rather than a direct leadership role, according to a legislative analysis of the law.\nBackers of the Youngstown Plan point to years of poor performance as reason for such change.\nJoe Andrews, a spokesman for Gov. John Kasich, said the state’s previous system for academically struggling schools was not working.\n“By re-energizing the support system for struggling schools, we can make sure every Ohio student gets the opportunity they deserve to reach their potential, regardless of where they live,” Andrews said in an email.\nUnder the law, the chief executive has the authority to replace school administrators, determine class sizes and curriculum, replace teachers and set compensation. A CEO is expected to be hired by year’s end, and that person’s improvement plans are to be in place by spring.\nSchiavoni said that while he doesn’t embrace the CEO model outlined in the law, he wanted to make it “more workable.”\nHis legislation would modify the makeup of an academic distress commission that picks the CEO. Instead of a five-member panel, the commission would consist of seven members and include more representation from the Youngstown area.\nThe proposal also would expand the concept of school action teams beyond community learning centers to each school district building — giving parents, teachers, employees and others a larger role in helping the CEO implement an improvement plan for the district, Schiavoni said.\nAmong other changes, the legislation would:\n• Scrap the CEO’s ability to change or modify teachers’ collective-bargaining contracts at any time.\n• Delay certain actions by the CEO for a year, including replacing teaching and nonteaching staff.\n• Require the CEO to have at least 10 years of teaching or administrative experience in education.\n• Require that all documents be made public when related to the CEO’s appointment and the appointments to an academic distress commission.\n• Require the CEO to present any plans to close a school at a public hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:59:24.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
