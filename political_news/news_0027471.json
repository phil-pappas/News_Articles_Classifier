Alwaleeds interest in News Corp., the media conglomerate of Rupert Murdoch and once-parent company to Fox News, started in 1997 with a $400 million investment, according to a description of the investment on Alwaleeds Kingdom Holding Co.s website. That was 3 percent of News Corp.s worth. In 2005, he increased his holding to 5.5 percent, the site states. The picture is a little different now because News Corp. split into two companies in June 2013 amid fallout from the companys phone-hacking controversy with its British newspapers. The move spawned a new News Corp., housing publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Vogue. A second company, 21st Century Fox, oversees movies and TV programming, including the Fox News Channel. Murdoch is chairman of both companies and controls just under 80 percent of the voting stock in each (between himself and his family trust). Whos next in line? According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, its Alwaleed. Alwaleed owns 7 percent of Class B voting stock with 21st Century Fox, second only to Murdoch, as of Aug. 19. The filing notes, in compliance with federal securities law, 40 percent of Alwaleeds voting rights are suspended because he is not an American citizen. He is the third largest stockholder in the new News Corp., trailing Murdoch and an investment firm, with a 6.6 percent stake. The relationship with Murdoch is reciprocal. News Corp. has a sizable stake in Rotana, a broadcasting company that airs Arabic and English programming in the Middle East. Alwaleed owns an 80 percent stake of Rotana, according to Bloomberg. So Alwaleed has a sizable interest in Fox News, second in one aspect only to Murdoch. Experts told us that translates to being the No. 2 owner of Fox News. . . . OMG the right wingers support a news station that is owned by an Aussie and Arab Sheik. Way to go right wingers. THEY certainly love the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:42:48.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
