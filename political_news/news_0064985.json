Their Secret Service protection doesn't need to wait for a warrant to secretly track cell phones connected to possible threats. \nIn almost all cases, the Department of Homeland Security needs a warrant to use cell site simulators, which basically trick mobile phones into pinging their location as though they were real cell phone towers. But protecting the president and other people under Secret Service protection sometimes makes warrants \"impracticable,\" according to a recently published DHS memo . \nThe exception to getting a warrant doesn't mean the Secret Service can just ignore all the rules in place regarding the phone-tracking tech. They have to follow the Pen Register rules, which means getting court approval except in case of emergency. Even so, skipping the warrant will speed up the process of getting the tech in place significantly. \nAs the 2016 presidential election starts to heat up, threats to presidential candidates mount up ever higher. Most of them are easily dismissed, but the possibility of an attempted assassination puts a lot of extra pressure on the Secret Service, right at a time when they are dealing with more than a few issues internally. The warrantless phone tracking, which applies to places as well as people under Secret Service protection, has privacy advocates worried about possible abuse. \nThough only a small part of the ongoing debate about security versus privacy in how technology should be used, the exceptions made for the Secret Service do at least concede the point that using this tech should be an exception, not the standard. The Justice Department has officially said that using the technology requires a warrant in all but the most emergency cases, but it's not going to ease the concerns of privacy advocates that the exceptions exist at all. As the election gets closer, how the tech is used (or misused) could become a flashpoint for the larger debate.
