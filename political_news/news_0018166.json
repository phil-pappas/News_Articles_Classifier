Driving the $5 million Batmobile 28min \nHastert's attorneys told U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin on Thursday that they have reached a plea agreement on the charges that he lied to federal investigators about plans to pay someone he had wronged $3.5 million in hush money. \nHastert is scheduled to enter his plea at an October 28 hearing, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Northern Illinois. Only then will the details of the plea agreement be revealed, even though prosecutors submitted a draft of the agreement to the judge sometime before Monday. \nHastert was not in the courtroom for Thursday morning's hearing. \nThe Chicago Tribune and other news outlets reported the agreement prior to the U.S. Attorney Office's announcement. \nTwo sources with knowledge of the federal investigation told CNN in June that Hastert was paying a former student to stay quiet about allegations of sexual abuse from when he was a wrestling coach and teacher in Yorkville, Illinois. \nThe indictment details payments and a payment plan to an unidentified \"Individual A,\" by Hastert. But that person has never been officially identified. \nHastert was charged with lying to FBI investigators about his payment plan for \"Individual A\" and structuring bank transactions under $10,000 to avoid triggering federal reporting requirements. \nHastert initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but Hastert's defense team entered negotiations with prosecutors last month. At the time, Durkin set an October 15 hearing date to receive either an update on the negotiations or set a March or April trial date. \nThe plea deal would forgo the trial, which could easily be damaging for Hastert. Hastert has remained on bail on his own recognizance, although he did surrender his passport as part of the bail agreement. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
