In the first amendment to its stance since 1973, the new resolution officially recognizes the evolution of evangelical thought into two distinct streams, each “citing strong biblical and theological reasons either for the just character of the death penalty in extreme cases or for the sacredness of all life, including the lives of those who perpetrate serious crimes and yet have the potential for repentance and reformation.”\nOn the face of it, this shift from unequivocal support for capital punishment to recognition of multiple views seems somewhat inconsequential. But the NAE resolution provides a window into deeper and more significant changes within American evangelicalism.", "external_links": ["http://nae.net/capital-punishment-2/"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:54:33.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
