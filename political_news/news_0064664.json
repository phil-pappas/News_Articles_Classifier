The plant, owned by FirstEnergy, will be one of two plants in the region to be shut down, affecting 380 employees. The Evironmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Obama administration have been taking major steps to get coal-fired power plants into compliance with clean air regulations.

John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper said in May the Clean Air Act gives the EPA the authority to develop regulations and that Colorado would draw up a clean power plan to comply. \nHudson says Coffman disagrees with Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper's spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. \n(Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)
