The disease causes symptoms such as fatigue, hoarse voice, muscle aches and tenderness, stiff joints and unexplained weight gain.\nBy Angela Haupt Oct. 12, 2015 | 9:00 a.m. EDT + More On her hit TV show \"Jane the Virgin,\" which kicks off its second season tonight, star Gina Rodriguez weathers no shortage of curveballs: an unplanned pregnancy after being artificially inseminated by mistake. A love triangle, nefarious drug lord and baby-snatching.\nWhile perhaps not as, ah, dramatic as the TV cliffhangers, Rodriguez, 31, is opening up about a real-life struggle. When she was 19, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism – which happens when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of important hormones, potentially leading to problems such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease. Years later, while shooting the pilot for \"Jane,\" she grew very ill and was ultimately diagnosed with the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's disease.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, Hashimoto's disease arises when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland , causing inflammation and the inability to sufficiently produce thyroid hormones. It causes symptoms ranging from fatigue and sluggishness to a puffy face, hoarse voice, muscle aches and tenderness, stiff joints and unexplained weight gain. For some patients, treatment includes thyroid hormone replacement therapy, an often lifelong regimen. Untreated Hashimoto's disease can lead to heart problems, mental health issues like depression, decreased sexual interest and birth defects in babies born to women with the disease.\nRodriguez spoke with U.S. News about her diagnosis – and the punchy way she keeps stress in check – via an email interview. Her responses have been edited.\nWhen were you diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, and what led to the diagnosis? What kind of symptoms were you experiencing?\nI was diagnosed when I was 19 years old – I was attending New York University and got very sick. The doctors thought I had mono, but it turned out to be thyroid disease. Ten years later, I found out I had Hashimoto's – and my doctor said I could have had it for many years.\nThe symptoms I was experiencing included extreme fatigue and weakening of the muscles, and it was very hard to stand on my own. I had chills and no appetite.\nHow did you feel when you were diagnosed? Were you surprised? Worried?\nMy mother has had it my whole life, so I think I was expecting it. I used to ask why she complained so much about being tired, and it gave me an opportunity to understand it firsthand. Now I appreciate her strength even more.\nWhat's living with this disease like – how does it affect your life and well-being?\nI'm always tired regardless of the amount of sleep I get, but you just pull through. Depression is one of the symptoms, so it's important to stay positive and have good people around you.\nHow do you manage your condition?\nI take medicine every morning, I try to do 30 minutes of cardio a day, I take naps when my body asks for it and I try to eat as healthy as possible.\nWhat made you take up boxing?\nI grew up in a boxing household – my father was a professional referee. It's my favorite sport. It's my favorite form of working out, and I don't have a victims' walk because of it.\nHow does boxing help you manage Hashimoto's disease?\nCardio is very important for the thyroid , and boxing is all cardio.\nSeason two of \"Jane the Virgin\" premiers tonight – you clearly have a lot going on. What are your favorite stress-busters?\nBoxing!\nWhat's your advice for others coping with Hashimoto's disease or another diagnosis?\nKnowing what your body is going through and using your mind to push that growth, that change, that challenge forward is key. When I was diagnosed, I was relieved because then I knew what I was fighting and could find different ways to win. And I have been working on it for years, and will keep working on making myself strong and healthy. You have the strength – I'm not saying it will be easy, but you can do it , and you can win.\nTAGS: thyroid women's health", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=%27Jane%20the%20Virgin%27%20Actress%20Gina%20Rodriguez%20on%20Living%20With%20Hashimoto%E2%80%99s%20Disease", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=%27Jane%20the%20Virgin%27%20Actress%20Gina%20Rodriguez%20on%20Living%20With%20Hashimoto%E2%80%99s%20Disease&summary=Ahead%20of%20the%20show%27s%20season%20two%20premiere%20tonight%2C%20the%20star%20opens%20up%20about%20her%20thyroid%20condition.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtwev%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=%27Jane%20the%20Virgin%27%20Actress%20Gina%20Rodriguez%20on%20Living%20With%20Hashimoto%E2%80%99s%20Disease"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:16:24.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
