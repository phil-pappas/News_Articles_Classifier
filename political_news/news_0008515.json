Promoted stories \nCllr Payne, pictured below, has insisted the Townhill Park project can and will be delivered and funding will be provided through the new development company, a commercial arm of the council being set up to borrow at cheaper rates. \nHe says he is hoping that construction work could start at the end of next year or the beginning of 2017 and that the first homes could become available later that year. \nHe said: “The motive for wanting council houses at Townhill Park was that it made good economic sense for the council to do it, and if it is no longer possible for councils to deliver that housing then we must come up with an alternative delivery model.” \nCllr Payne also says the Government changes will lead to a “crisis” in social housing supply, adding: “Every resident in Hampshire who is currently waiting for an affordable home will have to wait a bit longer because of what the Conservatives have done to affordable housing.” \nHis Conservative opponents claim the figures are “wildly inaccurate” and have called for him to stand down over delays to Townhill Park and their concerns that there is not enough money for the scheme or other estate regeneration projects. Share article \nCouncil housing bosses in other areas of the county have also said they have concerns over the social housing rent changes. \nKay Mandry, Conservative housing chief at Fareham Borough Council, said she had written to party MPs Suella Fernandes and Caroline Dinenage over “concerns” about the loss of income but that she could not comment further until the final Government proposals were announced.

If you don't stand up and say no, they will keep turning the screw. The Tories hate social housing everyone knows that. If you're born poor, tough luck, that's how it is now.

The system is different here than how it is there. They live 6 people in a 1 or 2 bedroom place. In the uk you will get a lot of housing points for that as its seemed cramped etc. It's not their fault it's our system.

We need a point system before we allow anyone else over here they must be clever enough to get a decent job to support themselves and not just come here for the free ride our soft government has given them. We need to round up all the asylum seekers that can not offer anything except scrounge from us and return them to where they came from. Stop spending money on foreign aid to countries that have their own space program and funding other Europeans countries that could never afford to be in the Eurozone. We need to start looking after Britain before its to late, put the British first for a change sort our own country out clear all the crap that has come for the free ride and lets make Britain a place the British can be proud of. Woolston now has at least five Polish/Bulgarian shops WTF only in Britain can we let foreigners come and take over. Get us out of Europe.
