Learning about money can be fun, especially when you add a catchy tune.\nBy Kimberly Palmer Oct. 21, 2015 | 11:37 a.m. EDT + More Teaching kids about money can be a little boring. You want them to learn to save, invest and spend money in smart ways, but knowing how to pass on that information without causing their eyes to glaze over is not always obvious. That's where rap lyrics come in.\n\"Music is so powerful … learning can be fun,\" says Alex Rappaport, CEO of Flocabulary, which uses hip-hop music to teach topics from personal finance to social studies. For example, a song about credit cards, aimed at grades six through 12, explains what happens when you pay only the minimum balance. \"Credit's like a stick of dynamite; it can mess you up, if you don't see it right. Pay it off each month, don't forget it,\" the refrain chants.\nThe online videos are accompanied by review questions, a quiz and worksheets and are currently used in 35,000 schools. \"We've had phenomenal responses on how it's transforming classrooms,\" Rappaport says, by providing a fun way to introduce a topic and pique student interest. \"It encourages kids to ask more questions and have more of a dialogue about financial literacy,\" he adds.\nEducators like Rappaport are experimenting with a variety of creative ways to teach kids about money . In addition to Flocabulary's hip-hop videos, video games and even a financial screenplay have hit the market recently. The goal is a familiar one: Get students interested in basic money concepts so they can get smart with their money before they hit adulthood.\n\"All of the activities that we provide for our teachers are active, engaging and fun, and they have clear learning objectives,\" says Nan Morrison, president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education. The organization provides personal finance lesson plans for teachers, including one based around an online video game, \"Gen i Revolution,\" which is played in classrooms in all 50 states with over 250,000 users. In the game, students compete against classmates by solving financial problems . ​\n\"Kids love playing it. As you make good decisions, you progress through the game, not just memorizing information but learning how to think through problems critically,\" Morrison says. The game is based on the national standards in financial literacy published by the council, which are also the basis for Flocabulary's personal finance videos.\nBen Carter,​ a 28-year-old entrepreneur, founded Manage Your Damn Money, a company that promotes financial literacy, publishes a comedic video Web series and hosts \"money music nights,\" which feature financial professionals alongside musicians and artists. Earlier this year he published a screenplay, \"A Completely Untrue Story About Money Friends & Moscow Mules,\" which he describes as a \"fictitious financial fairy tale.\"\n\"Most financial literacy books are boring line item diatribes of what you should and shouldn't do with your money,\" he says. He wanted to create something more entertaining but also educational. \"When people read it, I imagine they see scenes playing out in their heads,\" he says. \"I hope this style of writing entertains and also inspires looking inward, maybe about saving money or paying down credit card debt,\" he adds.\nStill, some educators say you don't need flashy games or tricks to impart knowledge. Beth Kobliner, ​a member of the President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans and author of the forthcoming book, \"Make Your Kid a Money Genius,\" says showing, not telling, is the best way to teach kids about money . \"Using everyday life lessons as they happen in the real world, whether it's explaining why you pay extra for organic at the grocery store or why you decided to buy a used car instead of a new one, is the best way to make money lessons stick,\" she says.\nKobliner says parents should explain how credit cards work to their kids the next time they pull one out of their wallet, or ask children to calculate a tip on a restaurant bill and explain why you're leaving it. When it comes to splurges like a vacation, explain to kids how you're saving for it, she suggests.\nThe U.S. Mint also suggests a variety of free games and lesson plans for parents and teachers on its website .​ They include playing with a virtual allowance, creating a piggy bank and games with coins.\nWhether you're imparting money lessons in the checkout aisle or through a video game, most experts agree on one thing: the importance of talking with kids about money.​ You don't want to let them graduate to the real world without a grasp of basic financial concepts.\nTAGS: personal finance financial literacy savings education parenting students children money entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=How%20Hip-Hop%2C%20Fiction%20and%20Games%20Can%20Teach%20Kids%20Financial%20Literacy", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=How%20Hip-Hop%2C%20Fiction%20and%20Games%20Can%20Teach%20Kids%20Financial%20Literacy", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=How%20Hip-Hop%2C%20Fiction%20and%20Games%20Can%20Teach%20Kids%20Financial%20Literacy&summary=New%2C%20creative%20ways%20are%20helping%20kids%20learn%20about%20money.%26nbsp%3B&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://youtu.be/lhrD4ITtMWQ", "http://www.usmint.gov/kids/teachers/financialliteracy/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8i4s%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhrD4ITtMWQ"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:21:44.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
