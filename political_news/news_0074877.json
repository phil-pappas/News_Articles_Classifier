Lee County sheriff's deputies investigated and found the store owner wasn't breaking a law because there isn't a law. \nSimonton says he specifically wants to look at how private gun ranges are being used. He says he wants to make sure everyone is safe without impeding anyone's right to bear arms. \nInformation from: Dixon Telegraph, http://www.saukvalley.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:05:50.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
