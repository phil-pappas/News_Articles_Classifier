But then these young Palestinians seemingly snapped.\nAccording to police accounts, some of them disputed, they stabbed Israelis in \"lone wolf\" attacks. Motives often remain murky, but attacks have been escalating, with eight Israelis and 12 suspected assailants killed over the past month, many in Jerusalem.\nThe violence comes amid growing Palestinian hopelessness, particularly in the Israeli-annexed Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem. Social media amplifies the anger and promotes revenge attacks as amateur videos make the rounds showing Israeli forces seemingly using excessive force, or angry bystanders cursing at wounded Palestinian assailants.\n___\nSubhi Abu Khalifeh grew up in the Shuafat refugee camp, one of the poorest areas of east Jerusalem. Shuafat, like several other Arab neighborhoods in the city, has been cut off from the rest of Jerusalem by Israel's West Bank separation barrier. Services are spotty, with garbage often piling up in the streets.\nThe entrance to the camp looks like a battlefield, with scorched cars and streets blackened by burning tires — remnants of frequent clashes between stone-throwers and Israeli security forces.\nEvery weekday, Abu Khalifeh, 19, crossed through the barrier gate on foot, passing through metal detectors and an ID check. On the other side, he and two brothers were picked up by a contractor and driven to building sites in Tel Aviv.\nAbu Khalifeh, an electrician, was making about $60 a day, and was saving money to get married, which can cost a prospective groom several thousand dollars for a gold dowry and other expenses.\nOn Thursday, he didn't show up for his ride to work. Brothers Rami, 24, and Mohammed, 28, left without him. He didn't answer his phone all morning; by early afternoon, the family received word that he had been arrested as a suspect in a stabbing attack that seriously wounded an Israeli man. He remains in custody, and the family has had no contact with him.\nHis parents said they could only speculate about his motives.\nHis father, Ibrahim, said that over the years, he had been beaten and verbally abused while working as a street cleaner in Jewish neighborhoods, experiences he shared with his sons.\nHis mother, Samar, said her son was particularly upset about an incident last week in which an 18-year-old Jerusalem woman, Shuruq Dwayat, was shot and wounded by an Israeli civilian after police said she stabbed him. A Palestinian version on social media said the man had harassed teen, trying to remove her headscarf, but she did not stab him.\nAfter Abu Kalifeh's arrest, his two brothers were fired and his father was suspended from his street-cleaning job.\nDespite the loss of income, Ibrahim Abu Khalifeh said he could understand his son's anger. \"This is very, very normal when you look at what is happening to us,\" he said.\n___\nA few streets away, two dozen men sat Monday on plastic chairs in an alley outside the home of the Ali clan. A young relative, 19-year-old Mohammed Ali, had been killed two days earlier by police fire near Jerusalem's Old City neighborhood.\nFlags of Fatah, the movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and its rival, the Islamic militant Hamas, fluttered above their heads, though neither claimed Ali as a member.\nYoung men showed visitors a video on their smart phones. It showed Ali standing next to a wall after being stopped by police for an ID check. Ali handed over his ID and then leaped forward, waving a knife. Police said he stabbed two officers. Troops opened fire, killing him and mistakenly wounding two officers.\nAli's relatives said they believe he was driven by anger over what many Palestinians claim is an Israeli plot to take over a Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, the third-holiest site of Islam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:13:15.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
