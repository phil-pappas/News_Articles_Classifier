Bobby Jindal about his thoughts on immigration. (Photo: Linh Ta/The Register) Buy Photo \nIn the front row of Bobby Jindal's campaign stop at a coffee shop in Ottumwa were some faces not always seen at his events: young students. \nStudents and educators from both Ottumwa High School and Ottumwa Christian School made up half of Jindal's audience during the stop at The Vine Coffeehouse Thursday. Several home-schooled students were in attendance, as well. \n“Can you speak until 3:05 p.m.?” one student asked. \n“No, maybe not that long,” the Louisiana governor who is running for president laughed back. \nSeveral questions from the audience focused on the Republican's views on school choice and the national debt. \nIn Louisiana, students can choose to attend any school, without being restricted by geographical location, with the state providing funds for students to attend schools they may not otherwise be able to afford. \n“The dollars should follow the students instead of students following the dollars,” Jindal said. “We want parents to decide what's the best learning environment for their kids.” \nA student from Ottumwa Christian asked Jindal about his plan for handling the national debt. Jindal said there needs to be cuts in government spending, along with an increase in revenues. He said unnecessary programs and stifling regulators, like the education department and the Environmental Protection Agency, should be cut. \n“It's the young people here that are most likely going to face the consequences of our debt,” Jindal said. \nLeah Hallgren, a science, biology and Spanish teacher at Ottumwa Christian, said she liked Jindal's answer on school choice, saying that feels like teachers are told to focus on tests and assessments when there are other ways of educating. \n\"Sometimes, teachers don't feel like we're being treated as professionals,\" Hallgren said. \"Kids could be getting to do things that are really cool like different projects, trips and events.\" \nTyler Lyons, 16, from Ottumwa High School said the military and immigration are important issues to him. He said he liked Jindal's responses regarding building up the military and stopping illegal immigration by securing the border. \n\"I think that he has a lot of great ideas,\" Lyons said. About the event \nSETTING: The Vine Coffeehouse in Ottumwa \nAUDIENCE: Around 110 people were in attendance with about half of the people from various local schools. \nREACTION: The students were excited to see Jindal, and asked him a range of questions. Twelve-year-old student Adam Sieren asked, \"If you ever meet the guy, can you say hi to Bill O'Reilly?\" Jindal said he'll tell him Adam of Ottumwa said hi. \nWHAT'S NEXT: Jindal will meet with students at Faith Baptist Bible College at 9 a.m. in Ankeny Friday.
