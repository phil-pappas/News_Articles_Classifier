President Obama quizzed President Putin on Russia's aims when they met at the United Nations. In his address to the UN General Assembly, President Obama said he is willing to work with Russia to find solutions in Syria.\nAnd Secretary of State John Kerry has said we welcome a role for Russian forces if the focus, as President Putin affirms, is combating the Islamic State.\n\"But if what they're doing is, in fact, propping up the Assad regime,\" John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said, \"then that's an entirely different issue altogether, because it is the Assad regime that has been a magnet for extremists inside Syria.\"\nThis response reveals the dilemma for President Obama. Russia's two aims are intertwined. Russia helps Syria fight the Islamic State, but is also protecting Assad from being overthrown. But then, so are we. By fighting the Islamic State, as we are, we too are protecting Assad.\nIn a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Kerry excluded any role for Assad in a political solution for Syria. The State Department reported that Kerry \"reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fight (the Islamic State) with a coalition of more than 60 countries, of which Assad could never be a credible member.\"\nThis U.S. position -- that Assad has no role in discussions about a transition of power in Syria -- puts us at odds not only with Russia but with the United Nations and the European Union.\nBoth see a role for Assad, even as they hope he can be eased from power. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura views Assad as \"part of the solution.\" EU foreign relations coordinator Federica Mogherini does not see Assad as president in the long term. But, like de Mistura, she hopes for a negotiated settlement, with Assad sitting at the table.\nThe two presidents clashed in their UN speeches, President Obama castigating Assad, but President Putin casting him as a source of stability and a bulwark against chaos.\nPresident Obama has set out no clear approach that would lead to a stable political order in Syria. Our efforts at supporting the so-called moderate opposition have floundered.\nPresident Putin is saying that the thrust of Russian military involvement in Syria is to counter the Islamic State. So Russia is putting itself on our side to that extent. Our own efforts against the Islamic State have not been effective so far, so Russia's help may turn out to benefit to our cause.\nPast Russian policy in Syria has not always been against U.S. interests. When President Obama announced in 2013 that he would launch air strikes over Syria's use of chemical weapons, he met an avalanche of protest in Congress.\nTo Obama's aid came President Putin, proposing that Syria be convinced to destroy its chemical weapons. President Putin provided President Obama a welcome way out of an impasse.\nCaution is counseled as well by our own past role in regard to democratic rule in Syria. In 1957, a government was in place in Syria that President Eisenhower saw as too cozy with Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom Eisenhower viewed as a threat to the West.\nSo the CIA paid Syrian military officers to overthrow the Syrian Government. It was not the CIA's finest hour. The plot unraveled, and three U.S. diplomats who conveyed the cash were expelled from Syria.\nWhen the Russian moves in Syria are seen in context of the overall situation there, President Obama's low-key response is probably the wisest.\nAbout The Writer\nJohn B.
