They cite the ongoing criticism of Planned Parenthood and a movement in many state legislatures to restrict access to abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Michigan on behalf of its members against Trinity Health, a group of 86 hospitals in 21 states that has in recent years engaged in a number of mergers with other health care facilities. The complaint, obtained by Al Jazeera, alleges that Trinity hospitals have refused appropriate emergency care to women suffering pregnancy complications, including miscarriages. For many women experiencing pregnancy complications, even when the pregnancy isnt viable, abortion is the standard of care necessary, or they can develop infections, become septic or experience hemorrhaging, ACLU attorney Alexa Kolbi-Molinas told Al Jazeera. Rights advocates say Trinity Health emergency rooms and physicians often send patients home instead of offering them procedures such as tubal ligations (commonly referred to as tube tying) or the removal of an unviable fetus in an ectopic pregnancy. Women are told, There's nothing we can do for your miscarriage, go home, and think they are getting medical advice but in fact are getting religious advice, said Washington state abortion rights advocate Mary Kay Barbieri. She has been collecting testimony from women who say they have experienced such treatment at Catholic hospitals. It's about time. These hospitals take in federal dollars. They can't deny health services because of religious reasons.
