John Campbell Miss. Senator, Top U.S. Commander Discuss Situation in Afghanistan WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today met with Gen. John Campbell, Commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, to discuss the ongoing situation there. “Afghanistan can be an enduring success story for Americans, but only if we avoid the mistakes we have made elsewhere,” Wicker said. “Afghans and their elected leaders need to know that the U.S. is prepared to help protect our hard-fought gains. In addition, NATO and our allies around the world are looking at our actions in Afghanistan. We need to show that we are a reliable partner.” Gen. Campbell is scheduled to testify on the issue of Afghanistan at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on October 6, 2015 at 9:30am ET. 10/5/15 Posted October 6, 2015 - 4:55 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
