It wouldn’t be happening otherwise.\nOne phone call from Obama to Netanyahu demanding an immediate halt to Israeli lawlessness, making it clear Washington won’t tolerate it, would change everything now ongoing.\nIt continues because of full US support and encouragement. Don’t let duplicitous comments from John Kerry’s State Department spokesman, Admiral John Kirby, fool you – claiming Kerry “remain(s) deeply concerned by the continued escalated violence.”\nAt the same time, revealing Washington’s official policy by “condemning the (Palestinian) terrorists attacks against Israelis.”\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest echoed the same sentiment – blaming Palestinians for Israeli high crimes, saying:\n“(T)he United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks – the recent terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, which resulted in the murder of three Israelis and left numerous others wounded.”\nNo condemnation of vicious, premeditated Israeli state terror – murdering 33 Palestinians through Wednesday, injuring well over 1,600 others, another 4,000 harmed by indiscriminate use of toxic tear gas.\nNeurotoxins in tear gas are potentially lethal. They can cause severe side effects, including extreme pain, intense tightening in the chest, a burning and stinging sensation in the nose, eyes and throat.\nTear gas canister impacts can cause severe bleeding, fractures, at times requiring amputations. Israel uses extremely toxic agents in canisters marked “Made in USA.”\nTear gas is a terror weapon. Doctors treating its victims have no antidote for the toxins used. All they can do is get them to a safe place, wash the gas from their eyes and other affected areas, using sterile saline.\nChildren, the elderly, pregnant women, as well as anyone with respiratory or heart problems are especially vulnerable to potentially serious harm from tear gas exposure. Longterm effects are unknown.\nIts use is banned in warfare under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. Palestine is a war theater, its residents guaranteed Fourth Geneva protections.\nIsrael spurns all international laws, especially humanitarian ones. Palestinian victimization is longstanding, no end to their suffering in sight, no outside help afforded them, their own Ramallah government against them, acting solely as Israel’s enforcer.\nOn October 10, BDS activists called for “(s)olidarity with the Palestinian popular resistance! Boycott Israel now!”\nSaying “a new generation of Palestinians is marching (in) the footsteps of previous (ones), rising up en masse against Israel’s brutal, decades-old regime of occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid.”\n“World governments” shamelessly ignore Israel’s full responsibility for ongoing violence.\nCalling on both sides to show restraint insults millions of suffering Palestinians, the tens of thousands murdered by Israel over nearly 7 decades, the brutality of endless daily persecution, a vicious Arab-hating state run by fascist extremists no different from Nazis – a racist, tyrannical criminal regime by any standard.\n“The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the Palestinian leadership of the global BDS movement, calls on people of conscience around the world to support Palestinians in their quest for freedom at this crucial moment by stepping up BDS activities against Israel’s regime of oppression.”\n“It is high time to isolate Israel’s regime of militarization, securitization and racism as a danger not just to Palestinians and the Arab region, but to humanity at large.”\nWe’re all Palestinians now! Support the struggle of courageous people for the fundamental rights they’ve been long denied!\nJoin in solidarity with their resistance against a ruthless oppressor! Speak out in their behalf! Help them in their time of need!\nStephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

He is also the author of many political essays and articles available in print and online.\nPaul Larudee responded to FNA’s questions about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The following is the text of the interview.\nQ: How do you assess the humanitarian situation in Palestine, in general, and the Gaza Strip, in particular? What’s your feeling towards the fact that the people there are denied access to food, medicine, water and shelter, as well as scores of other goods they need for their daily lives? Why is the world community silent about their ordeal?\nA: Did Gaza have an earthquake, a tsunami or a hurricane? What happened? There was no natural disaster there. This is a human-made disaster and the disaster is continuing because it is the Israeli policy to maintain the maximum level of the disaster that the world will permit; and the world is quite tolerant in permitting a very high level of disaster. They’re doing nothing to help. Some of them are willing to repair the damage if permitted by Israel, but Israel is not permitting international community to go in and repair the damage. And the international community is quite tolerant with Israel’s refusal. So, this is the entire international community permitting Israel to practice ethnic cleansing in Gaza. That’s the bottom line.\nQ: So, why do the world powers allow Israel to continue practicing these harsh and unconventional policies in the Occupied Territories, and especially in the Gaza Strip? Why don’t they take a firm stance and make it clear that killing and blockade won’t be sustainable forever?\nA: Well, it’s for a number of reasons. One of this is that they absolutely don’t care at all about what happens to Palestinians, if they die under miserable circumstances, from killing weapons that poison their body or white phosphorus that burns inside their body. They don’t care. The United States doesn’t care! But more important than that is the fact that the Israelis have accomplished a great deal in terms of manipulating the governments of other nations and especially powerful nations like the United States. So, nobody can get elected to political office in the United States without the permission of Israel and its allies. And therefore, there is no elected person in Congress that can get elected by criticizing Israel. That’s why they follow Israeli policy to the maximum. So, we cannot expect the United States or other countries to do anything on the basis of conscience. And to think that they will do it because it’s some sort of national priority or benefit to the United States, that’s nonsense! There is no benefit to the United States in protecting Palestinians. So, we find the United States allied with Israel.\nQ: It sounds like the criticism of Israel has become so costly and risky in the West that few people jeopardize their reputation and job by directing criticism against what Israel is doing in the Gaza Strip or West Bank. Are they so powerful that they can raise the costs of criticizing their actions and intimidate those who are inclined to voice opposition to their policies?\nA: Well, they haven’t stopped you Kourosh, and they haven’t stopped me and there are a lot of people that they haven’t stopped. They’re very powerful. They have a lot of money behind them and they’ve managed to strangle nations like the United States, France, Britain, Germany and quite a few others; you could even include India to a certain extent. And they’re experts at this, but they are not strangling the grassroots which cares very deeply, as the movement is growing. And after the grassroots, you have the press that needs to come along; and the press today, believe it or not, is much, much better than it was 15 years ago. There’s more criticism in it. It has got still a long way to go. And for last of all, it will be the governments that begin to change their policy. So, I don’t know how patient we have to be. I don’t like patience very much! So, I think impatience is a virtue. But we’ll not be surprised; things will be very hard until the very end and then it’s possible that everything will change very quickly, as it did with South Africa\nQ: So, finally, do you believe that the future would be better for the people of Palestine? Are there solutions to adopt to force a change in the Israelis’ behavior and ensure a safe, peaceful and untroubled life for millions of Palestinians suffering under military occupation?\nA: There’s only one way. Any nation that has given up a power or given up an occupation – it’s when the occupation becomes too expensive for that nation to bear. We must make the occupation impossible for Israel to continue. A lot of this depends on the Palestinian people and I would not recommend to the Palestinians to depend on the international community, although it’s good to get as much support as possible from the international community. But it’s really the responsibility of the Palestinians if they want this. It’s their choice; it’s really their responsibility to make the occupation really unbearable for the Israelis and then the Israelis will change what they’re doing.\nInterview by Kourosh Ziabari", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8fAVPNTZjU", "http://sjlendman.blogspot.ca/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F4C6DbZZso", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdAUWwNVzJQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRFf2bmRE9Q", "http://www.claritypress.com/LendmanIII.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9i7G5wEg8fw", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/9q2yRAD2cAk", "http://sjlendman.blogspot.ca/2015/10/obama-could-stop-israeli-state-terror.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/e__sflExQLo", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAG5LIGqlvI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lMjJogAJo8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEZAOI4KTg8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z3JvimuGLY0", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940722001613", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2WNfcn_iyk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvzYjMccumM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3becbu4HIbQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdrS9W1OuFk"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:14:00.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
