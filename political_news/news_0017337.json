There are large sums of money at stake here and it’s important that we get a good system and that the proceeds that are raised from gambling go where they are meant to. The passing of the Gambling Amendment Bill (No 3) helps to achieve that purpose. \nThe Gambling Amendment Bill (No 3) passed today will: \nIncrease the transparency of grant-making from the proceeds of gaming \nmachines in pubs and clubs (Class 4 gambling) \nReduce potential conflict-of-interest situations between non-casino gaming machine operators, venues and grant recipients \nImprove transparency surrounding the use of management companies carrying out specific gambling-related functions for gaming societies \nSimplify compliance and reduce costs for societies and venue owners in some areas \nEnsure the efficiency of the Gambling Act appeal processes. \nMr Dunne said the Bill was just one of a series of reforms he has announced recently, including reviewing the minimum amount that gambling trusts must return to the community from gaming machines and a look at the Class 4 sector within the broader context of the gambling sector. \n\"The Gambling Act has been in place for over 10 years and it is time to assess what it has achieved and what changes are needed to ensure that New Zealand’s gambling regulatory system remains sustainable and fit for purpose.\" \"This work is at an early stage. Once some preliminary advice has been received, the government will decide early next year what further steps are required. \n\"I want to maintain a sustainable community funding stream delivered by trusted and reputable gambling operators; and I also want an Act that is flexible enough to meet the future challenges ahead\", Mr Dunne said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:40:02.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
