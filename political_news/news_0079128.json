When the suspects tried to flee in a dark SUV, the woman pulled out her concealed 9mm handgun and began shooting. \nThe SUV escaped but police believed that at least one of the bullets hit the vehicle, flattening a tire. The suspects were described as two men in their 40s, one black and one white. It was not immediately clear if either of the men were shot as they fled. \nThe Detroit Free Press reported that the woman had a concealed carry permit and was cooperating with law enforcement. Auburn Hills police had not decided if the woman would be charged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:13:50.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
