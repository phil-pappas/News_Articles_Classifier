The 73-year-old Illinois Republican is charged with breaking banking laws and lying to the FBI in efforts to pay someone $3.5 million to hide claims of past misconduct. The Associated Press and other media, citing anonymous sources, have reported the payments were meant to conceal claims of sexual misconduct decades ago. Hastert allegedly structured cash withdrawals in increments of just under $10,000 to avoid financial reporting rules and then lied to the FBI about the reason for the withdrawals. Investigators have said Hastert withdrew about $1.7 million. When Hastert was charged in May, the indictment noted that he had been a longtime high school teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville, west of Chicago, suggesting the charges are linked to that history. . . . You know he's not the only man to do this. Wonder if he'll sing on the others? What a corrupt and unethical bunch of representatives we have seen in the past 40 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:43:00.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
