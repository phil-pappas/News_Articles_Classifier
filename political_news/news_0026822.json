Rick Scott and the state's two legislative leaders discussed some of their major priorities Wednesday at the annual legislative meeting held by The Associated Press. \nScott wants another large round of tax cuts, and he wants to boost spending on incentives used to lure new companies to the state. \nThe two Republicans in charge of the House and Senate say they support tax cuts, but they are unsure about whether they will cut taxes as deeply as Scott wants. \nSenate President Andy Gardiner also said the Senate wants to overhaul how the state spends money on business incentives. \nBoth Gardiner and House Speaker Steve Crisafulli said a top priority in 2016 will be to create additional programs to assist families with disabled children. Legislators also expected to debate health care changes.
