The 40-second cellphone video, released Thursday by the Nevada Department of Public Safety two days after the Las Vegas Review-Journal had requested it, was taken from a berm atop Trench No. 11 overlooking the soil cap of Trench No. 14. Trench No. 14 is where containers of low-level radioactive waste were buried in part of a pit the size of a football stadium in the 1970s.", "external_links": ["http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/fire-rescue/video-shows-blasts-nuclear-waste-dump-site-shut-down-us-95", "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/fire-shut-down-us-95-called-hot-powerful"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:15:20.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
