Jeb Hensarling could run.\n“The goal is to keep us united and to get behind a conservative candidate — hopefully from Texas — who can unite the conference in a conservative way,” said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Arlington.\nBarton said he had a candidate in mind, but he wouldn’t say who. There are more House Republicans from Texas — 25 — than from any other state.\nHensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee and formerly the No. 4 House Republican, would not comment on his plans. He briefly considered a run after Speaker John Boehner announced Sept. 25 that he was resigning the post, effective at the end of October.\nWith McCarthy out, Boehner said he would remain speaker until a successor is chosen.\nMcCarthy’s surprise decision could freeze a leadership scramble that involved another Dallas Republican, Rep. Pete Sessions, who has been running for majority whip, the No. 3 post.\nSessions’ name also has been floated as a potential speaker candidate. He chairs the powerful Rules Committee and served two terms as chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, culminating in the party’s return to a House majority. Sessions’ spokeswoman declined to comment.\nTexas Republicans huddled in a House conference room shortly after McCarthy’s announcement. Some told reporters that the delegation would unite behind a candidate and wants someone to serve through the end of 2016, not as a temporary caretaker.\nSaid Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth: “We had a shock today. We’re going to have to now elect someone as speaker who’s strong enough to lead us through this.”\nAsked if that could be a Texan, Granger said, “It could be,” adding: “Texas will play a big part in this.”\nRep. John Ratcliffe of Heath said he would try to draft Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina before committing to a Texan. Gowdy, who has led the committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, has so far declined to run.\n“This is all a very fluid situation,” said Ratcliffe, who said there were several Texans he would support. “If they enter race, I’ll consider them.”\nHensarling and 18 other House Republicans urged colleagues in a letter Thursday to “figure out what we are and where we are going” before rushing to pick a speaker.\n“Too often decisions are made in a 24/7 news cycle where people do not have full information, and members are locked into a position that may very well change based on future circumstances,” they wrote.\nTwitter: @sylvanlane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:48:03.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
