But he sounded uncharacteristically resigned on Sunday when it came to last week’s mass shooting in Oregon, saying such shootings will continue in the United States “no matter what.”\nIn interviews on the Sunday morning talk shows, Trump rejected calls from President Obama to pass tougher gun laws, saying they would do nothing to stop an attack like the one that killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon.\n“No matter what you do — guns, no guns, it doesn’t matter — you have people that are mentally ill, and they’re going to come through the cracks, and they’re going to do things that people will not even believe are possible,” Trump said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\nHis air of resignation sounded not unlike the reaction of Jeb Bush, a presidential rival Trump has often criticized, who said after the Oregon shooting that “stuff happens” in suggesting that government is not always the solution to such problems.\nWith gun rights under the Second Amendment a core issue among Republicans, the party’s candidates — almost in unison — have roundly rejected what they see as a predictable overreaction to the shooting in the form of tougher gun laws. Trump aligned himself clearly with that position on Sunday as he shrugged aside calls for more restrictions on guns.\n“People say, ‘oh, we’re gonna stop it’ — it doesn’t work that way,” he said in a separate interview on ABC’s “This Week.” Mass gun violence in America “has taken place forever, from the beginning, and it’s going to go on a million years from now,” he said. “You’re going to have problems, and even if you have a very tough system, you’re going to have people who slip through the cracks.”\nOn the polls\nTrump said on “Meet the Press” that if he drops in the polls, he will drop out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n“I’m not a masochist,” he said. “And if I was dropping in the polls where I saw that I wasn’t going to win, why would I continue?”\nSunday’s comment — the second time Trump said he could stop his campaign — came as the Republican front-runner’s standing in polls has leveled off.\nTrump remains ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire, but his lead has shrunk in the past month, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll.\nTrump said he would have “no problem” going back to work as a businessman.\n“If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me because you no longer have any interest in Trump because ‘he has no chance,’ I’d go back to my business,” he said.\nThe Los Angeles Times contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:14:05.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
