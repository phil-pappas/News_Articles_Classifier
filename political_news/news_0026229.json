Carson said his remark was intended as advice for future attacks.\n\"I want to plant in people's minds what to do in a situation like this. Because, unfortunately, this is probably not going to be the last time this happens,\" he told CBS.\nEarlier, Carson said if he had been present at the Oregon attack, he would have tried to stop the gunman who killed nine people.\n\"Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all,' \" he said.\nCarson said people are too quick to \"set up battle lines\" over every comment instead of solving problems.\nA gun-rights supporter, Carson says one solution is more aggressive intervention for people with psychological problems and keeping guns from people declared dangerous by psychiatrists.
