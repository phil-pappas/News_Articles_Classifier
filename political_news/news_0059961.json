Calgary MP Michelle Rempel, on the other hand, is openly musing about a bid.\nAnd a Conservative source is highlighting the fact that Jason Kenney has been one of the party's most successful fundraisers -- bringing in $450,000 alone to his own riding since January, and another $300,000 through other activities.\nIt's all part of the chatter around a race that doesn't even have a convention date set yet, in a party where Stephen Harper is technically still the leader. A leadership committee was struck on Tuesday evening.\nMulroney, son of former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney, says his family is always interested in public service and politics. But will he run?\n\"No. But that being said, you never say never to these things,\" Mulroney said in an interview Thursday.\nFor now, Mulroney said, he's focused on his job as the Toronto-based head of capital equity markets at National Bank. His brother Ben is a broadcaster with CTV, and sister Caroline is an investment management executive.\n\"It's not something that hasn't crossed my mind and my brother's mind, but I'm focused on the job at hand,\" Mulroney said in an interview.\nHe added that he is happy to actively help the party.\nBrian Mulroney was a high-profile labour lawyer who became deeply involved in Tory party politics, and was a corporate executive at the time of his leadership win in 1983.\nThis week, Calgary MP Michelle Rempel mused publicly on Twitter about throwing her own hat into the ring, referring to people who had been urging her to \"do it.\"\nShe pointed out some of the comments that women in politics get when they consider such a leap.\n\"I mean, I'm too brash, impetuous and abrasive, right? Maybe I should take a little time -- good things come to those who wait. I'm a bit too aggressive. Maybe the base won't understand me,\" she tweeted.\n\"As a party, we have some pretty incredible people who move the ball forward on the field. Now is the time to recognize all of them ... and set any preconceived notions aside. My party can reflect all of Canada.\"\nOther names that have been circulating as potential leadership candidates include MPs Lisa Raitt, Kenney, Kellie Leitch, Michael Chong and Tony Clement.\nThe Conservative source who shared Kenney's fundraising numbers said the defence minister has been the most successful MP in the party's history at reaping donations.\nRaitt hasn't ruled out a run, but said earlier this week that the party needs to first do a proper analysis of the last election campaign and figure out where it's going.\nOn Thursday, MP Diane Finley became the first to put her name forward for interim leader, a job that is appointed by the parliamentary caucus.\nRelated Stories Diane Finley intends to run for interim Conservative leader Brad Wall says he won't run for Conservative leadership Photos Former prime minister Brian Mulroney, second from left, with his son Mark, left, and daughter Caroline in Toronto, on May 31, 2010.
