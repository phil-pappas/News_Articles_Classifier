The point here is that there is a special relationship between New Zealand and Australia and we are Anzac brothers. We get a better deal, frankly.\" \nHe said Mr Turnbull was a \"moderate guy\" and they would have \"good conversations\" about the issue. \n\"That's going to dominate the weekend, that's the reality of what the press are going to ask,\" Mr Key said. \nMr Key also told TV3 he did not need Labour to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership but it would be \"great\" if the party did. \nSpeaking to Newstalk ZB, Mr Key said this morning he believed logic and flexibility would be taken into account by Mr Turnbull - but he could not guarantee the policy would change. \nHe said \"badgering\" Australia would not help but there would be intense discussions about the policy this week. \n\"In the end I think they'll want to preserve that special relationship and I do think that you'll see some movement there but I can't guarantee it. \n\"I can't force them and badgering them won't get there, but I think the power of reasonable logic will play out over time,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:39:04.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
