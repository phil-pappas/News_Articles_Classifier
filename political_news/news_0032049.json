Patty Hymanson, D-York, has proposed a bill that would bring a new approach to Maine to address drunken driving. Inspired by a successful program being used in South Dakota, Hymanson’s bill would create a pilot program that would require participants convicted of drunken driving to be tested twice daily to prove they are no longer drinking. “We have been trying the approach of imposing fines and taking away licenses to deal with drunk driving for years, and it hasn’t worked,” said Hymanson. “The places that have tried the testing method in my bill have had very good results.” Under this program, people convicted of drunken driving are given the option of the testing regime as an alternative to jail and losing their license, which helps prevent the loss of employment that often comes when offenders lose access to transportation. If they test positive, they immediately go to jail – 12 hours for the first offense, 24 hours for the second offense, and longer, at a judge’s discretion, for a third offense. Additional costs for the program are minimal, as the offender pays for the tests, according to Hymanson. Since passing the law in 2005, participants in the South Dakota program have a pass rate on the tests of over 99 percent. Approximately 158,000 people have been convicted of operating under the influence in Maine over the past 30 years. Roughly 48,000 of these convictions occurred within the past 10 years, including nearly 6,500 repeat offenses, according to an analysis by the Portland Press Herald. “This goes after the real problem behavior, which is drinking,” Hymanson said. “And the knowledge that they will face immediate punishment makes people think hard before they drink.” Bills for the second session must win approval from the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council will meet Oct. 22 to decide which bills will be allowed to move forward. Hymanson, a retired physician, is in her first term in the Maine House. She represents Ogunquit, part of Sanford, part of Wells and part of York, and serves on the Health and Human Services Committee. seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 12:07 PM » Comment or view comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:03:57.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
