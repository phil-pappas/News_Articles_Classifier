Yemenis stand around a crater reportedly caused by air strikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in Sanaa, Yemen, on Thursday.\nOct. 5, 2015 | 10:27 a.m. EDT + More By: Julian Pecquet, Congressional Correspondent for Al-Monitor\nAl-Monitor\nCongress shifts its attention to the war in Yemen this coming week amid rising concerns about the civilian death toll.\nRELATED\nThe Battle for Sanaa Looms The Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds a hearing Oct. 8 on the US role and strategy in Yemen and the Gulf counties. The hearing comes as the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels is being blamed for killing more than 130 people in a missile strike against a wedding party Sept. 28.\nThe rising death toll — 4,500 people killed through late September, according to the United Nations, more than half of them civilians — is putting pressure on lawmakers to play a bigger role in overseeing US support for the coalition. The Obama administration remains supportive of the offensive against the Iran-backed rebels and declined to support Dutch calls for an independent UN probe this past week, ensuring passage of an alternative Saudi plan for a national investigation by Yemen.\nIn the House, the Foreign Affairs panel on the Middle East on Oct. 6 holds the first in a series of hearings on the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Witnesses include representatives from Save the Children, Mercy Corps, World Vision and the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere.\nIn other Syria news, the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing Oct. 7 on the refugee crisis' impact on the security of the US refugee admissions program. Some Republican lawmakers have raised concerns about the Obama administration's plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.\nRELATED\nU.S. Official: Saudis Have Used Cluster Bombs in Yemen Meanwhile, debate over must-pass defense legislation shifts to the Senate after the House passed a compromise bill worked out by the House and Senate Armed Services panels this past week. The bill, which President Barack Obama has threatened to veto because it spends too much, contains a number of Middle East provisions, including a $150 million border security boost for Lebanon and Jordan.\nThe House for its part is scheduled to vote Oct. 9 on legislation to lift the crude oil export ban. Markup of similar legislation in the Senate Banking Committee this past week led to the addition of a provision to bar sanctions relief for Iran until Tehran pays court-ordered damages to the families of terror victims; the amendment would violate the terms of the July 14 international nuclear agreement and its passage effectively kills the crude oil bill in the Senate.\nFinally, sources tell Al-Monitor that the Tom Lantos bicameral commission on human rights is expected to hold a hearing next week with Egyptian-American activist Mohamed Soltan in his first congressional testimony since his release from prison. The hearing has not been scheduled yet.\nMore from Al-Monitor.com :\nBibi's UN speech nothing more than hollow words\nBy Mazal Mualem\nHeadscarves in schools: On or off?
