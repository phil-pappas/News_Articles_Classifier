The weak employment data caused market expectations of liftoff to get dialed back and stocks have benefited in the aftermath.\n\"While [the jobs report] was a disappointing report, it was only one report. If it is symptomatic of broader weakness in the economy, then we should wait\" on raising rates, Mr Rosengren said. \"If it is one weak report but not symptomatic of broader weakness in the economy, then I think future meetings should continue to be on the table,\" he added.\nMr Rosengren isn't a voting member of the interest rate-setting committee. Over the years, he's been a strong advocate of the Fed's easy-money policies. But recently he had been on board with those who'd like to move on rates in 2015.\nBefore the jobs report came out Friday, Mr Rosengren told Fox Business Network he'd been cheered by the recent jobs news and said he thought it would be appropriate to start increasing borrowing costs by the end of the year \"if we continue to get positive data.\"\nWhen the employment data came in weaker than expected Friday, it raised an already high bar for the central bank to up interest rates at its October meeting. Market expectations of lift-off were dialled back Friday with fed-funds futures showing a 2 per cent likelihood the central bank would move in October versus 14 per cent before the report. Monday those odds stand at 7 per cent.\nThe Fed still has the opportunity to raise rates this year in December if it holds off this month. Fed funds futures show investors and traders put the odds of a December rate rise at 36 per cent even though Ms Yellen and New York Fed chief William Dudley have said in recent weeks they think a rate rise this year will be appropriate.\nWhile lower rates for longer would signal that the economy isn't as robust as the Fed would hope, stocks have taken a liking to the idea that liftoff will be delayed further. The S&P 500 is up 3.2 per cent since the jobs report and on track for its best two-day win streak since the end of August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:17:16.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
