It's better for us to stay in, but to stay in a reformed EU. That's where I am,\" he said.\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption David Cameron discussed his EU reform aims with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week The MP, who is touted as a potential future Conservative leader, said he had \"great faith\" in Mr Cameron's negotiations to secure EU reform, describing him as \"a fantastic bridge player [and] negotiator\".\n\"In our party we're backing the prime minister. I think he's got every chance of getting a good deal,\" he said.\nBut Mr Johnson also cautioned that it was sensible not to rule out walking away from the table in the negotiations.\n\"You have to wait and see what the deal is going to be. But I've got great faith in the prime minister,\" he said.\nOn Sunday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was possible that Mr Johnson could head the Leave.EU campaign, but the London mayor told the BBC he was unaware of the Eurosceptic's overtures.\n\"News of this pronouncement has not detonated over [Japan] like a thunderclap. I don't know about these invitations,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34502343", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4AFD/production/_86079191_de27-3.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1519C/production/_86082468_029534405-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:05:30.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
