Those Democrats, combined with the GOP support, will produce more than the 218 signatures needed to push the bill to the floor for a vote in late October.\n  Sanders and Cummings 'sickened' over drug CEO Turing Pharmaceuticals' Martin Shkreli hasn't lowered the price of a drug that he jacked up 5,000 percent.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:44 PM \"It would be rare\" for a bill to move to the floor over the desires of the GOP leadership, Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said Friday. \"But it's been talked about widely in the conference, about why people would do it. It's one way of getting it done.\"\nThe bank's authorization expired on June 30 after House Republicans refused to bring a reauthorization of the bank's charter to the floor for a vote. Since then, the bank has only been able to manage the export credit and credit guarantee contracts already in operation as of June, and has been unable to authorize new contracts to help overseas entities finance the purchase of U.S. goods and services.\nMany conservatives despise the bank and want to keep it from coming back to life, and say it represents a form of corporate welfare backed by the taxpayers.\nBut some Republicans and many Democrats believe the bank supports thousands of U.S. jobs and believe it's expiration is damaging the nation's economy. They want to vote on a bill that would reauthorize and reform the bank.\nWith no move to bring the bill to the floor by the GOP leadership, a trio of Republican proponents took the unusual step of trying to circumvent \"regular order\" with the discharge petition. The petition's sponsors are Reps. Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn., Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., and Chris Collins, R-N.Y.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Lawmaker wants birth control device off the market The Food and Drug Administration has received 5,000 safety reports about Bayer's Essure device.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:32 PM \"This Republican-led petition is a procedure to stand up to Washington's broken system that is killing thousands of American jobs and jeopardizing thousands more,\" the three lawmakers said in a statement. \"Our constituents expect us to fight for them and get the job done, but Congress has failed to even hold a vote to reform and reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. We refuse to look any more hardworking Americans in the eye and say, 'You lost your job because Congress refused to hold a vote.' This cannot wait any longer. If we do not get this done for the American people, the only thing our country will be exporting is jobs.\"\nBut not everyone who supports Ex-Im revival is signing the petition.\nRep. Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, said she won't support the petition. Wagner is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, led by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. Hensarling is the chief House opponent of the bank and led the effort to eliminate it.\n\"I wish we could have done this through regular order and through the committee,\" Wagner said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner 1 dead in shooting at Northern Arizona University One person is dead and three others are wounded after a shooting at Northern Arizona University.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/09/15 8:53 AM Top Story Rock bottom?
