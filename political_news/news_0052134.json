The proposal would shut out major fantasy sports websites such as DraftKings and FanDuel unless they strike a deal with the state-licensed casinos, said Rep. George Dunbar, whose amendment was expected to be considered Wednesday by the House Gaming Oversight Committee. \"It will still be legal as long as it's done through our casinos,\" the Westmoreland County Republican said. \"It will be banned elsewhere.\" On Thursday, Nevada regulators ordered DraftKings and FanDuel to stop operations unless they get a gambling license. Fantasy sports are also barred in at least five other states. Dunbar said his latest plan would ensure that state regulators scrutinize operations of the now-unregulated companies to protect consumers. It also would benefit the casinos by drawing people to their websites and potentially raise more than $100 million annually in badly needed state revenue, Dunbar said. \"It isn't going to solve our budgetary problems,\" he said, referring to the partisan stalemate that has left in limbo a state budget that was supposed to have been in place by July 1. Dunbar's original bill, introduced in May, proposed allowing the casinos to host their own fantasy websites, leaving the unregulated websites to continue. But he has changed his approach with the amendment he has written. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office has not received any complaints about fantasy sports, spokeswoman Sadie Martin said Friday. A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, Richard McGarvey, declined to comment. DraftKings and FanDuel hired a lobbying firm in Pennsylvania in June, according to state lobbyist registration reports. Attempts to reach officials at both companies by email were unsuccessful Friday.
