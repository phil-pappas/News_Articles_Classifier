He's supposed to meet with county attorney to determine the rate of pay and all that. We'll have our first executive session Monday.\"\nThe hiring of special counsel does not necessarily mean for a special project, he said.\nCounty attorney Ross Dyer would not comment on Bolton's assessment Thursday, while county Mayor Mark Luttrell referred questions to Dyer.\nDyer has consistently pointed to the county charter, which states that the county attorney is the \"chief counsel\" for the county and \"shall act as legal advisor\" to the mayor and commission.\nBolton, who also wouldn't comment, asserts in his brief that chief counsel does not mean \"sole counsel.\"\n\"Based on the portions on charter that Julian pointed out, I believe that the commission is fully within its rights to hire any staff it needs to do its job, including legal counsel,\" said Commissioner Heidi Shafer .\nThe move to hire Bolton comes as tensions rise between some Republican commissioners, including Roland and Shafer, and the Republican mayor's administration. The county attorney is appointed by the mayor and approved by the commission.\nCommissioner Van Turne r, an attorney and a Democrat, believes that there is a way for the commission and the administration to reach a compromise, which may hinge on whether Bolton is called special counsel or a policy advisor who \"happens to be an attorney.\"\n\"I believe there is space for a reasonable resolution outside of court intervention. However, I believe both parties have to be willing to give and take and hopefully this can be mediated,\" Turner said.\nIf that doesn't happen, an appeal to the courts won't result in a quick solution.\nAnd at that point, he said, the commission might choose to consider \"a different outlook on this whole notion of having special counsel.\"\n Ltr to R Dyer 10 21 15 (1) (PDF)\nLtr to R Dyer 10 21 15 (1) (Text)\n ", "external_links": ["https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2478442/ltr-to-r-dyer-10-21-15-1.txt", "https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2478442/ltr-to-r-dyer-10-21-15-1.pdf", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis", "http://www.facebook.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:34:03.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
