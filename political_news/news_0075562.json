Three people have been admitted to hospital and two are critical. D. Venkataiah, 65, and his four sons consumed pesticide alleging harassment from a local organisation and a TRS leader. The deceased were identified as D. Srisailam, 39, and his brother D. Mahesh. Their other two brothers D. Chandra Shekhar and D. Kumar are undergoing treatment in district hospital.\nDSP P. Krishna Moorthy said Venkatiah, who was the president of the Kuruma Sangam in the area, had purchased a land for the association’s office. He also bought land for personal use in the same area. “Venkataiah alleged that a TRS leader was supporting the Sangam and that’s why police and MRO did not help him. He and his family went to the TRS leader’s house. After the quarrel, five people consumed pesticide,” said the DSP.\nStates: Telangana nation Current affairs South Suicide Also Read LDF for court-monitored probe Polls, Metro make Hyderabad gasp for fresh air Centre favours Andhra Pradesh with grants, says Akbaruddin Owaisi PIL filed on dropping port plan", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/SUI_0_1_0_1_0_3_0_11_1.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/SUI_0_1_0_1_0_3_0_11_1.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/5-family-attempt-suicide-2-dead-mahbubnagar-district", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:34:09.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
