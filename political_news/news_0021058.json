It will be made worse by the fact that the Government’s bill allows bylaws to be made for different areas within each Council district, and will require a review process every five years. We will likely see a patchwork of confusing and inconsistent rules being applied when a national approach would provide certainty for everyone. \n“Nobody should be forced to shop on Easter Sunday, or any other time, no employee should be forced to work, and no business should be forced to open. But in 2015, these choices should rest with individuals, employees and business owners, not the Government or Council bureaucrats. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:21:01.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
