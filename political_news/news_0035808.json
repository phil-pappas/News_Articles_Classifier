The Freedom Caucus is comprised of about 40 hard-line members who want the House Republicans to be much more aggressive. They are the also the group who forced out Speaker John Boehner by threatening a Motion To Vacate The Chair. According to Freedom Caucus rules, you need the support of four-fifths of the caucus to secure their endorsement. That means anyone who is opposed by more than 8 members will not be able to be endorsed by the group. Already 10 Freedom Caucus members have publicly expressed their opposition to Ryan or his key demand, which is enough to sink his candidacy. Only proves the Koch brothers bought \"freedom caucus\" is nothing more than people trying to tank our economy so the Koch brothers can get more slave workers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:26:03.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
