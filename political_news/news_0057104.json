Even with the highest stakes of his mayorship on the table, Mitchell spoke before the Massachusetts Gaming Commission in his usual measured, even-keeled manner. The buttoned-down veteran of the U.S. Attorney's office and onetime Dartmouth High School basketball player, Harvard economics major and holder of a law degree from George Washington University, is an unusual combination of high ambition and low-key manner. As Mitchell spoke to the commission that day in March, he calmly laid out his case for New Bedford, describing a city that “is not a satellite of Boston, not part of the Boston orbit…we have to make our own way.” New Bedford has the largest commercial fishing port in America, a vibrant artistic sector and a strong industrial base, the mayor said. But he added that despite those assets, “we still have one of the highest unemployment rates in Massachusetts.” “What KG Urban (the would-be casino developer) has presented to me…after some three years of talking about it…I believe will accelerate what we’re trying to do in New Bedford,” he told the commissioners. The commission then voted 3-2 to grant a 45-day extension of New Bedford's application. The personality game Mitchell's understated manner can make attendees at his annual State of the City address unsure of whether to laugh at the mayor’s puns. The dry humor is familiar at business ribbon-cuttings, budget press conferences and community events across New Bedford, at campaign handshake events and even in the infomercial Mitchell made with his grandmother to encourage residents to recycle. Mitchell is well aware of public perceptions of his persona. “I’ll be at my uncharismatic best tonight,” he joked last Tuesday, referring to the first mayoral debate, which was hours away. As Mitchell, 46, seeks a third term as mayor of New Bedford, against an aggressive challenge from onetime Congressman Barney Frank's former co-chief of staff Maria Giesta, his appearance before the Gaming Commission , perhaps more than any other over the past year, remains reflective of his approach to governance. Steady hand, calm demeanor and eyes on a future of high goals for the city, no matter the stakes. “It is all about the long run,” Mitchell said, talking about his administration on an October afternoon in City Hall. He cited his administration's increased focuses on port dredging, road and bridge repair and other not-very-sexy infrastructure development. “We’re doing the hard work of rebuilding the metro-area economy,” he said. That work has led to 3,000 more people working in New Bedford than in 2012, data verified by the state Office of Labor and Workforce Development. “That’s huge for any city our size,” Mitchell said. Building permit numbers are up 40 percent since 2011, he added, and the average value of single-family homes in the city is up 40 percent since 2012. Swings and misses Mitchell has referred many times in recent months to a “singles and doubles” approach to economic development, touting small business growth and incremental gains. That strategy could be an effort to balance the home run swings that failed to connect earlier this year. The Cape Wind proposal for a wind power farm in Nantucket Sound collapsed early in the year after the shale oil market changed the energy economy. That's driven a renewed focus on cargo and federal offshore wind leases as future customers for the $113 million, Marine Commerce Terminal in the city’s South End. Next, after months of testy negotiations and a last-minute deal, the waterfront casino proposal died abruptly in July. KG Urban said it withdrew because it couldn’t secure financing from investors. New Bedford’s selection this spring as a host venue for Olympic sailing events, should the 2024 Summer Games come to Boston, also sank, when the U.S. Olympic Committee turned away from Boston2024. Mitchell said efforts in both those areas were calculated attempts to boost local growth. “We don’t take a detour from our economic development strategy to go after them,” Mitchell said. “Each one of them entailed some risk, and each one of them ultimately was determined by factors over which the mayor of New Bedford has no control.” Mitchell’s long-term approach can be seen in city finances, as well. The mayor and New Bedford City Council went through a contentious budget season earlier this year, marked by spending reductions of 1.2 percent to non-public safety departments and debate over school spending. Hearings also were marked by lingering impacts from the record-setting blizzards that put the city nearly $900,000 over its snow removal budget and wiped out 19 snow removal vehicles from late January into March. Mitchell said additional budget-straining factors — including rising health care and pension costs, union contracts and more — are not going away. “The pressures are still there, so nobody should be under the illusion that the city will be flush with cash any time soon,” Mitchell said. “But what they can be confident in is that we will continue to manage city government with discipline, and with our view fixed on the long run.” Dollars and sense Part of good fiscal management for Mitchell was the hiring of Ari Sky as the city's first chief financial officer. Sky has professionalized the city's financial management, implementing budgeting and capital spending practices designed to save the city millions in coming years. But the fiscal discipline has led to some hard choices. The fiscal year 2016 budget adopted by Mitchell and city councilors includes $118.8 million in spending for New Bedford Public Schools, $7 million less than the $125.8 million initially requested by Superintendent Pia Durkin. When Mitchell took over as mayor, the New Bedford school system was on the brink of a state takeover and the mayor on the campaign trail has emphasized that school spending has grown by $15 million since 2012, the year he first took office. School funding under Mitchell indeed has risen from $103.6 million in 2012 to the $118.8 million for 2016 and Sky pointed out that that figure is almost $10 million above the state's minimum net school spending level. In fact, education reform and improving a school system that had long struggled with low test scores and a high drop-out rate, has been a major focus of Mitchell's mayorship. On the campaign trail, Mitchell frequently says that as the result of his administration, New Bedford High School’s dropout rate is the lowest in 15 years. Data from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE) supports that statement. But when Durkin decided that to accomplish reform up to 50 percent of teachers should reapply for their jobs, it was Mitchell, as chairman ex officio of the School Committee, who earned the enmity of the teacher's union. In the School Committee's first evaluation of Durkin — a superintendent favored by the state who was hired under Mitchell — the mayor wrote that when some residents opposed the high school turnaround plan and student discipline methods, \"Dr. Durkin did not fully appreciate the extent of the public fallout, the threat it posed to her agenda, or how to mitigate it.\" Durkin has since hired a community relations spokesman but when asked to comment for this story about her relationship with the mayor, she issued an ambiguous statement: \"Support from city leaders is important to lead the community toward understanding and supporting the attention, focus and resources that are necessary to make excellence a reality in every classroom, championed by every employee and embraced by every member of this community.\" A testy relationship with council Mitchell's style has rubbed some city councilors the wrong way. During budget talks in June, councilors made more than $2.3 million in final cuts to Mitchell's budget. After Mitchell asked in August for a supplemental transfer to restore about $1.2 million of those cuts, councilors approved only $700,000, about a month later. Mitchell criticized that process publicly, saying it hurt the city's ability to provide public services. Some councilors said that criticism showed an unwillingness to compromise. “It’s been a very strained relationship,” said Councilor-at-large Linda Morad who in 2011 ran for mayor against Mitchell. “I’m disappointed in the way he interacts (with) and reacts to the council.” Mitchell said his efforts to compromise, though, have come before a budget is presented, not after. “What I’ve presented, particularly in the past two years, to the City Council are budgets that are as lean as we can make them,” he said. Mitchell and City Council President Brian K. Gomes both praised the weekly meetings they’ve held over the past year. Mitchell said he’s offered such meetings to the council president, and other councilors, since he took office. “I have no problem with the interaction with this mayor, as City Council president,” Gomes said. “There is a mutual respect between this president of the City Council and this mayor.” 'In the crucible' When asked in October about how 2015, and all that it included, compared to his first three years in office, Mitchell gave a predictably measured response. “Every year has its challenges, and every year has its opportunities,” he said. Joe Michaud, chairman-elect of the New Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce, said he finds Mitchell’s nature reassuring. “He’s a very thoughtful person, and he’s been in the crucible,” Michaud said. “He’s been a federal prosecutor — you just don’t get rattled that easily.” Michaud added that Mitchell does, indeed, get excited about New Bedford and its future. “When I talk to him, I can hear the passion in his voice,” Michaud said. “If you want to see how passionate he is, have somebody make some derisive comment about the city — he’ll be the first one up out of his seat, defending it.” Follow Mike Lawrence on Twitter @MikeLawrenceSCT By Mike Lawrence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:39:09.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
