Jim Webb ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday and said he'll consider an independent run. Oct. 20, 2015. (WGN-TV) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nFormer Virginia Sen. Jim Webb said Tuesday he is dropping out of the Democratic race for president and is considering his options about how he might \"remain as a voice\" in the campaign. \nWebb said at a news conference that he is \"withdrawing from any consideration\" of becoming the Democratic Party's nominee and would spend the coming weeks exploring his options about a possible independent bid. \n\"The very nature of our democracy is under siege due to the power structure and the money that finances both political parties,\" Webb said, joined by his wife, Hong Le Webb. \"Our political candidates are being pulled to the extremes. They're increasingly out of step with the people they're supposed to serve.\" \nWebb said many of the issues that he cares about are not in line with the hierarchy of the Democratic Party, saying he did not have a \"clear, exact fit\" in either party. Asked if he still considers himself a Democrat, Webb said, \"We'll think about that.\" \nA Vietnam War veteran and former member of President Ronald Reagan's administration, Webb complained that he did not get the chance to make his views fully known at the first Democratic debate.

Bernie Sanders. Webb has been polling in the back of the pack with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. \nWebb has raised only about $700,000 and ended the month of September with more than $300,000 in the bank. Rivals like former Secretary of State Clinton and Sanders have raised millions for the campaign. \nWebb surprised many fellow Democrats when he became the first major figure in the party to form a presidential exploratory committee in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:19:50.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
