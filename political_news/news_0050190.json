Paul Ryan for speaker of the House, all but guaranteeing he'll get the job.The group of around three dozen rebellious conservatives stressed that their support for Ryan was not an official endorsement because they couldn't muster the 80 percent agreement such an announcement would require. Yet after meeting behind closed doors Wednesday night, members of the group made clear that their intent was to unite behind Ryan and give him the consensus he has said he needs to seek the speakership.Support from the group was not certain since they've repeatedly opposed GOP leaders and pushed the current speaker, John Boehner, to announce his resignation.Ryan, the GOP's former vice presidential nominee, did not want to run for speaker but yielded to entreaties from party leaders and said he would -- if he could gather consensus support.
