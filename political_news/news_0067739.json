Foreign affairs complicated Salinas’ visit. The day before, a coup aimed at overthrowing Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator— one supported by the United States — had failed.\nWith diplomatic tensions running high, Salinas, speaking in Spanish for about 30 minutes, stressed his vision for Mexico and the strides he said the country had taken over the previous five years to improve its economy and combat drug cartels.\n“Mexico, together with the rest of the world, promotes cooperation and friendship. We seek new and strong relations for trade, investment and technology transfer with an integrated Europe and with the Pacific basin,” Salinas said. “We are a sovereign society that is open and participating in world changes.”\nAlthough many members of Congress followed his remarks through a printed translation, Salinas spoke fluent English. He held a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard University and went on, in 1978, to earn a doctorate from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.\nDuring his visit, President George H.W. Bush also hosted a state dinner for his Mexican counterpart. Earlier, the two presidents had met in the Oval Office to review environmental and employment issues between their countries.\nSome 26 months later, the two met at Camp David to hammer out the main provisions of what was to become the North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite opposition from pro-labor Democrats, President Bill Clinton subsequently succeeded in driving the pact through Congress. The House voted 234-200 to approve the pact. Later on, the Senate assented, 61-38.\nDuring Bush’s first year in office, four foreign leaders — from Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, and South Korea — addressed joint meetings of Congress.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:49:34.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
