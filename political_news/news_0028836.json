(AP Photo/Molly Riley, File) more > By Stephen Dinan and Anjali Shastry - The Washington Times - Friday, October 9, 2015 \nSeveral Republicans floated their names Friday as potential replacements for House Speaker John A. Boehner, a day after Republicans were thrown into chaos when heir-apparent Rep. Kevin McCarthy withdrew from consideration — but all eyes remained on Rep. Paul Ryan. \n“Paul is looking at it but it’s his decision,” Mr. McCarthy said as he emerged from an all-GOP closed-door meeting, giving the strongest signals yet that Mr. Ryan may be reconsidering his long-standing refusals to seek Congress’s top job. \nEven those Republicans who were acknowledging thinking about a run said they would bow to Mr. Ryan , including Rep. Darrell Issa of California and Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. \nSEE ALSO: House GOP left rudderless as McCarthy abruptly ends bid for House speaker \n“The fact is, yes, I think that I could potentially be a candidate. At the same time, I agree with the vast majority of members, I think. We need a Paul Ryan or we need somebody who is, A, experienced, B, has been a committee chairman or something other than just up through the leadership ranks,” Mr. Issa said in an interview on MSNBC. \nFriday’s closed-door meeting was the latest in a series of get-togethers as Republicans have tried to figure a way forward in the two weeks since Mr. Boehner abruptly announced his retirement from Congress, effective at the end of this month. \nHe has vowed to stay on until a successor is found, and that suddenly grew more complicated Thursday when Mr. McCarthy walked into a room where his colleagues were prepared to vote to nominate him for the next speaker, and instead he announced he couldn’t unify the GOP, and so he wasn’t the right person for the job. \nMr. Ryan is the obvious choice for many Republicans, having been the party’s well-received nominee for vice president in 2012, and having led a successful push earlier this year to pass fast-track trade authority through the House, finding a way to work with Democrats on a critical and controversial issue. \nHe is now chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and was chairman of the House Budget Committee, where he won passage of a major budget deal in 2013, which he negotiated with Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat. \nMr. Ryan has repeatedly said he is not interested in the speaker’s job, having given several different explanations. Initially he said he wants to spend time with his young children and didn’t want to invest the time on the road that the speaker has to spend in fundraising and recruiting candidates. But on Thursday he said he believes his time is better spent heading the Ways and Means Committee right now. \nPressure to reconsider is growing, however, as other candidates fail to catch fire. \nTwo candidates who were challenging Mr. McCarthy remain in the race: Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:33:01.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
