White and Braden Walker CNN President Obama crashes California wedding Obama takes several pictures with the ecstatic couple UPDATED 9:51 AM CDT Oct 14, 2015 \nAfter a weekend of glitzy West Coast celebrity fundraisers starring Kanye West, Jamie Foxx and Star Wars director J.J. Abrams, President Barack Obama has no intention of staying on the political sidelines during the 2016 campaign. \nIn fact, White House... \nPresident Barack Obama. \nPhotographers Jeff and Erin Youngren were there to capture it. \nWhile visiting California, the President enjoyed a round of golf at Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla, where Stephanie and Brian Tobe were about to tie the knot. \n\"We saw the two SUVs that were the Secret Service SUVs, so then we knew he was on the course,\" the groom told CNN affiliate KGTV. \nThere was a decision to be made. \n\"We got word that we needed to delay the ceremony or start immediately,\" Youngren said. \nThe couple opted to wait for the President to finish the 18th hole, and enjoyed champagne while trying to catch a glimpse of him. \n\"I started photographing the couple and the family,\" Jeff Youngren said. \"It was such a joyful few minutes.\" \nBrian and Stephanie were content with seeing the President from the window of their hotel suite, but their photographer had some other ideas. \n\"I said I bet you if we went down there he would take a picture,\" Youngren said, \"Stephanie was like 'YES,' and she took off running.\" \nThey made it just in time. \nThe President took several pictures with the ecstatic couple. \n\"He was so kind and gracious, especially to the couple,\" Youngren said. \n\"It was a life moment that none of us will ever forget,\" Erin Youngren wrote on her blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:57:07.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
