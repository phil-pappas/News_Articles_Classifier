Here are the top lines from Tuesday's Democratic main event:\n1. Discussing Hillary Clinton's email scandal, Bernie Sanders zigged where other Republicans have zagged.\n\"Let me say — let me say something that may not be great politics,\" he said. \"But I think the secretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Clinton responded. \"Me, too. Me, too.\"\nThe two then exchanged a friendly handshake.\n2. “I don’t think the revolution’s coming,\" said Jim Webb, who is apparently bearish on Sanders' promise of radical political change.\n3. Responding to Sanders' assertion that the U.S. could learn something from countries like Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Clinton defended her approach in reining in capitalism's excesses.\n\"But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America,\" she said. \"And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system.\"\n4 . \"Anderson, you're looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues,\" Lincoln Chafee said when pressed on his changing party affiliation. He said he may have switched parties, but his views remained constant.\n5. Chafee discussed the importance of repairing American credibility after the invasion of Iraq, hitting Clinton for her vote to authorize the Iraq war in 2002.\n\"So any time someone is running to be our leader, and a world leader, which the American president is, credibility is an issue out there with the world. And we have repair work to be done. I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That's how I feel.\"\n\"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\" Anderson Cooper asked.\nClinton: \"No.\"\n6. Bernie Sanders, asked by Cooper if he considered himself a capitalist: \"Do I consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which Wall Street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy? No, I don't. I believe in a society where all people do well. Not just a handful of billionaires.\"\n7. \"I respect [Sanders'] passion and intensity,\" Clinton said amid an exchange about the 2007-2008 recession. \"I represented Wall Street as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 — before the big crash that we had — and I basically said, 'Cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.'\"\n8. Bernie Sanders, when asked about how he'd pay for his proposals: \"Well, let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today — taxes in the future than they're paying today.\"\n9. Clinton, remarking on the enemies she is most proud to have made: \"Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians. ... Probably the Republicans.\"\n10. Webb, a Vietnam veteran, responding to the same question: \"I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to.\"\n11 . Sanders, on how he would vote on Nevada's measure to legalize marijuana next year: \"I suspect I would vote yes.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:13:38.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
