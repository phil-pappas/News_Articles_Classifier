The mission of \"Billions in Change\" is to create a movement to build a better future through the widespread adoption of solutions in areas of water, energy and health. To solve these complex global problems, Stage 2 has focused on three practical inventions:\nThe Rain Maker, which can convert 1,000 gallons an hour of any existing water – including sea water or polluted water – into water suitable for drinking and agriculture; The Free Electric system, which can provide electricity, free of cost and without pollution, to billions of people around the world who live without electricity; The Renew ECP medical device, which promotes good blood flow, one of the basic foundations of wellness. Bhargava, who has publicly committed 99 percent of his personal wealth to charity (including the funding of inventions), hopes that the film inspires people to implement change.\n\"The title of the film doesn't refer to billions of dollars. It means that people working together will have a significant effect on billions of lives,\" said Bhargava. \"The inventions that really matter to our future are the ones that will help the poorer half of the world.\"\nA companion website, www.BillionsinChange.org , offers more information on Stage 2's creations – and also provides users with resources, ideas and opportunities to take action and get involved in implementing change.\n\"Awareness of the world's problems isn't enough,\" said Bhargava. \"They require action, and every single person can make a difference.\"\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nMelissa Skabich, PCE Communications\n(973) 760-9926\nMskabich@pcecommunications.com\nVideo - http://youtu.be/vOji2QKVzM4\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273503LOGO\n releases/billions-in-change-chronicles-simple-solutions-for-the-worlds-biggest-problems-300153500.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151002/273503LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE18732&Transmission_Id=201510050831PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE18732&DateId=20151005", "http://www.billionsinchange.org/", "http://www.billionsinchange.com/", "http://youtu.be/vOji2QKVzM4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOji2QKVzM4?version=3", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/billions-in-change-chronicles-simple-solutions-for-the-worlds-biggest-problems-300153500.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273503LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:40:42.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
