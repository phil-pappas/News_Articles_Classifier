The incident is serious enough to warrant concern. \n\"Recording the details of anyone who believes they may have been exposed and guaranteeing follow up monitoring would at least provide some reassurance. \n\"No-one should have to live with the constant worry their health might be affected. \n\"Dr Coleman and his colleagues need to act now. They also need to get the rebuild off the ground sooner rather than later.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:52:41.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
