They stood against the rights of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who have shown their concern about National’s secrecy on the TPPA. \n\"National has claimed the TPPA will be debated in Parliament, but it will not. \n\"There is a need to ensure future governments explain details of any treaty before they negotiate our rights away. \n\"As we have always said, a higher level of transparency is crucial as currently small, privileged and often out-of-touch groups are negotiating these deals on behalf of the wider public. \n\"Our Bill would stop governments from making blank cheque commitments on behalf of New Zealanders.\" \nThe International Transparent Treaties Bill would give Parliament or select committees the right to examine and review the terms of any international treaties before or during negotiation. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
