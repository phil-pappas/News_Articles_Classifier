I see that the word LOVE in the text must thus be replaced by HATE because they do hate their enemy: Muhammad and the Muslims . Bible is rewritten and reshaped just to counteract the Quran. As it happens in the texts you´ve just read me--;-- they produce nothing but sayings and words contradictory to our holy Quran: that the Muslims hate and kill their enemies but the Christians dont. We Muslims live by sword and we dont forgive the sinner. We require booty and collect jiziya and loot the lands we conquer, but they never .\nDont you see that it is a fabricated account? The words of Jesus are not God ´s words but the politicians´ and people with a hideous agenda.\nNot convinced, I read him the following Hadith:\nAbu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"The beast would appear (near the Last Hour) along with the signet-ring of Musa b. Imran s staff asaa(pbuh). It would make a believer s face brilliant with the staff and brand the nose of a disbeliever with the signet-ring till inmates of a collection of houses adjacent to one another would assemble and this (man) would utter, O believer and that (man) would say, O infidel .\"\nAnd asked him:  Could you depict any trace of peace in the Hadith and alike?\nThen added:  I feel rather scared every time I come across such Ayats of the Quran: (Smite ye above their necks and smite ye all of their finger-tips.)\nAnd the ayat: ( fight in the way of Allah and shalt sly and be slain.)\nAfter all I came with a suggestion which gave him a shock:\n Dont you think that we need a new prophet who would bring a real peace and a profound safety in place of fear and war?\nHow dare you!! I will kill you if you say such a rubbish again. he burst in outrage .\nThen he murmured with himself: Astagfirullah and turned to me toiling and struggling to appear calm:\nListen to me dear, there are more than one evidence that the Quran is a miracle, never changed and would never as Bible did, in this way it was and still is challenging all minds and wits all over the globe, in all times and eras!\n I give you another challenge yet easier to your digestion. he sighed again and said:\n Muhammad PBUH says I am the seal of the prophets, thus the last one, in other terms: no prophet would appear after him. And this is another challenging, if not , why did not a prophet appear after him?\nNow after three decades I think back of my friend´s words and my thought goes to Mahatma Gandhi and his doctrine and principles of peace:\n\"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\"\n\"There are many causes that I am prepared to die for but no causes that I am prepared to kill for.\nLater in his life when he was asked whether he was a Hindu, he replied:\n\"Yes I am. I am also a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist and a Jew.\"\nAnd I say if there were a prophet yet to come then, Ghandi could have been the first successor!\nAnd an excellent Prince of Peace!\nFreeyad Ibrahim", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/translate_beta_res.gif", "http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.ahewar.org/eng/show.art.asp%3Ft%3D0%26aid%3D2171&langpair=en%7Car&hl=en&ie=UTF8"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:51:42.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
