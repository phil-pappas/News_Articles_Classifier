Abdul Rahoof | October 06, 2015, 05.45 am B. Laxman Rao Hyderabad: A retired bank employee was killed when an old electricity pole made of cement fell on him on Monday at RTC Colony in Trimulgherry.\nElectricity board employees were working in the area when the cement pole fell and the police is verifying whether it came down while they were pulling the cable from that post to another one.\nThe suspicion arose as soon after the incident, all the workers absconded. The cops are searching for them for questioning.\nThere’s another old and tilted pole next to the fallen one and locals said that the two poles had been dangerously tilting since many months, but concerned officials hadn’t done anything about them despite the issue being reported.\nThe victim, 60-year-old B. Laxman Rao, died on the spot as the pole crushed his head. He was walking back home after giving his bike for servicing. Police has booked a case for causing death due to negligence against the Electricity Board, however no names or designations have been mentioned in the FIR.\n Electricity Board cement pole Hyderabad police Crime Telangana Also Read Hyderabad cops chain teen for ‘cellphone theft’ Traffic out of gear in Telangana Harassment on the move MHA: Killings part of larger conspiracy", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/B%20Laxman%20Rao_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/B%20Laxman%20Rao_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151006/nation-current-affairs/article/man-dies-after-cement-power-pole-falls-him"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:24:35.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
