Police officers fired tear gas when they threw stones at them. A similar protest was held in the capital on Saturday when police also intervened. \nAnti-government leaders had staged daily protests in a main street in Podgorica, but police removed their tents on Saturday. Opposition parties have vowed to repeatedly gather in a bid to force an early election. \nThe opposition groups earlier last week also staged an anti-NATO protest during a visit by alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to Montenegro. \nOpponents have accused Montenegro's government of authoritarian rule and using pressure against opponents. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:00:48.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
