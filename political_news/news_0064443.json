I was a civvy but worked in the centralised CID department which dealt with murders and major crimes. The media strategy was always massively important part of the investigative process and often in some cases for one reason or another there would be a media blackout.We had a case where they were 90% sure who the offender was but needed more proof. They gave little to the media to the point of basically saying they had no suspects. All the while a team of under cover officers were monitoring the suspects every move.From the outside it looked like the police had no clue at all, whereas the truth internally was they had their man and were collecting evidence. They kept the information out of the media because they didn't want to spook the suspect.We had a different case where they needed to flush the suspect out so made a massive song and dance about how they knew the suspect and were about the arrest him.I suspect there is something similar in this case where there was a valid reason for keeping it quiet.
