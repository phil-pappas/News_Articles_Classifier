Just saw an article speculating he would do drop out this morning. Might run as an Independent. Location: nunya Posts: 3,248 Good article you shared. I give credit where credit is due. I agree with Webb. He is one of the first ones to publicly admit the Democrats have slid into the abyss of socialism and no one really wants that. I hope he does run a third party campaign. Hell I might even support him if he does Thanks from Twisted Sister and Lyzza Location: massachusetts Posts: 4,504 Because a guy who can't get 2% of the Democratic vote has third party written all over him. Who is going to fund that campaign? Quote: Originally Posted by goober Because a guy who can't get 2% of the Democratic vote has third party written all over him. Who is going to fund that campaign? If I wanted to try and split any Dem votes in certain areas I would. Who knows? I guess it will really depend on who the nominee ends up being, and what trouble comes along with that. Location: Earth Posts: 364 One thing I dislike is that the media focuses on a few candidates, and everyone else can shove off. Hillary and Sanders get all the coverage. O'Malley and Chafee could disappear tomorrow off the face of the Universe and never heard from again. Then for the GOP is Trump, Carson and Bush. Everyone else can just quit and die. Webb was in the wrong political party anyway. I think he tried an angle, to be a moderate to conservative Democrat who was a war veteran and is pro-gun. Problem is that all the comservative Democrats are Republicans now. Concerning debates, get rid of the audience. Get rid of the Facebook crap. Quit making it \"entertainment\" like a wrestling match. Have all the candidates in a studio, with two moderators, one a FOX news person, and the other from CNN/NBC, etc. Also, each candidate gets to answer all the questions. Ask a question and each candidate gets to answer the questions!
