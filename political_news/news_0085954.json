Mass shootings have become an unsurprising part of American life, with lame public rituals in which politicians express grief and then retreat quickly into denial about this scourge.\nOne thing the NYTEB fails to do, much like Obama and the other Dems commenting, is offer any solutions\nModern high-powered weapons, adapted from war and unscrupulously marketed on the home front, have unfortunately provided the means for a shooter to act out his anger and despair in a matter of minutes. The state-sponsored citizens report on the gun massacre of 20 schoolchildren and six workers in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 concluded there is “no legitimate place in the civilian population” for fast-firing rifles and large-capacity magazines that were invented for the military but have flooded the American marketplace.\nAs I wrote in the comments at the Editorial,\nSo, what policies does the NY Times Editorial Board suggest?\n“Fast firing rifles”? They really fire no faster than ones from WWI. One pull of the trigger, one shot. Automatic weapons are illegal.\n“Large-capacity magazines”? If there’s no one to stop a shooter, it doesn’t matter if the mag is 7 or 15. It takes seconds to reload.\nEasy access? The majority of weapons are purchased at a federally licensed firearms dealer.\nPlease, tell us what would stop any of these tragedies? Please tell us what will stop the constant shootings and murders in cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Newark, Camden, St. Louis, etc, which already have massive gun control laws.”\nThe first semi-automatic rifle was invented in 1885. The first semi-auto pistol in 1892. The vast majority of legal gun owners will never use any of their firearms for a crime. For all the thundering anger, what policies would stop these events? Murder and attempted murder are illegal. Yet, people still do it.\nOther than repealing the 2nd Amendment and full confiscation, what policies can the anti-gunnites offer that would stop this from happening?\nAnd why don’t they seem to care about all the Black on Black shootings/murders in liberal cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Camden, Baltimore, St. Louis, etc, which all have strict gun control policies?\nCrossed at Right Wing News .", "external_links": ["http://www.shac.ct.gov/SHAC_Final_Report_3-6-2015.pdf", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/opinion/the-political-ritual-after-mass-shootings.html?action=click&#038;pgtype=Homepage&#038;module=opinion-c-col-left-region&#038;region=opinion-c-col-left-region&#038;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&#038;_r=0", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/429b2804/ping.blo.gs/2.0.gif"], "published": "2015-10-03T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:41:34.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
