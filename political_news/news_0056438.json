Bernie Sanders, Clinton's toughest primary opponent thus far.\n\"Hillary Clinton's growing scandals and the multiple investigations into the potential mishandling of classified info is a mess of her own creation. As Democrats debate in Vegas the RNC will continue to remind voters, including Democrats, why the vast majority of Americans find Clinton to be dishonest and untrustworthy,\" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QST-4QaGrW8", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:46:49.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
