The grants have been given for a year-long audio artworks project called Lending an Ear and involving all 21 libraries in the county. Working with community groups and a range of artists the project aims to create 21 library specific audio artworks. There will be a permanent Lending an Ear webpage so that all of the work can be experienced from within the libraries or from a device with internet access. Cllr Lucy Hodgson, cabinet member for localism and communities said: 'We are delighted to have been granted this money from the National Lottery through Arts Council England. The project provides such a great opportunity to showcase the county's heritage, culture and unique character and by creating a permanent project website we will be able to share this with an audience near and far.' Peter Leslie Wild, Lending an Ear Artistic Producer said: 'I'm thrilled to be working on this project as it brings together three of my great passions: creative audio, the diversity of my adopted county, Worcestershire and libraries. It's great to be working on something which will involve so many local people and which will paint a sound picture of this fascinating and beautiful area.' The aim is to have the first audio artworks online by December.
