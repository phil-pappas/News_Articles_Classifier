She also invoked her Catholic faith in her sharp response. Related Content Planned Parenthood files federal lawsuit against Alabama \nA reporter for the conservative news outlet CNSNews.com asked Pelosi, \"Is an unborn baby with a human heart and a human liver a human being?\" \n\"I am a devout, practicing Catholic, a mother of five children. When my baby was born, my fifth child, my oldest child was six years old,\" she said. \"I think I know more about this subject than you, with all due respect.\" \n\"So it's not a human being?\" the reporter pressed. \n\"And I do not intend to respond to your questions, which have no basis in what public policies that we do here,\" Pelosi said. \nPelosi, who supports abortion rights, has repeatedly criticized Republicans for attempting to defund Planned Parenthood following the release of undercover, edited videos accusing the group of illegally selling tissue and organs from aborted fetuses. \nShe said she was concerned by the undercover filming by the Center for Medical Progress, which produced the edited clips. \n\"I think they should be investigated as to how they obtained those and doctored those and had them be accepted as something that was an indictment against Planned Parenthood. Because that's not true,\" she previously said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.
