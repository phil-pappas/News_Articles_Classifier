We have since met political parties’ leaders and we shall soon be meeting the parties’ national executive committees,’ Mr Murungi said. \nMr Murungi stated that his team would also hold talks with MPs, County Assembly members and grassroots officials before the parties are closed. \n“We have up to December to complete the process of formation of one party. No party has been formed as yet. The merging process is still on. The structures of the new party will be explained later,” Mr Murungi said. \nThe Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) leader has however faced criticism from some APK supporters for announcing its dissolution to join JAP. \nAPK delegates who met at Meru Sports Club last week criticised Mr Murungi for allegedly failing to consult them. They termed Mr Murungi’s move, which has been supported by a majority of APK top officials and MPs from Mt Kenya East, selfish, undemocratic and backward. \nAs a result, the delegates have mandated Meru Governor Peter Munya to form another party by December and vie for presidency in 2022. \n“It is unfortunate the good idea is causing ripples,” Mr Murungi said. \nMr Murungi said the decision to wind up APK and other Jubilee affiliate parties was arrived at during a meeting that brought together leaders from Mt Kenya East in Nkubu weeks ago. \nHe said that elected leaders should not fear that nominations would be rigged if they vied in one umbrella party, saying “we are going to set up a transparent nomination process.” \nHe said: “Let them join JAP. Nobody will be unfairly treated. There is no need for people to run away and form new parties”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:09:20.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
