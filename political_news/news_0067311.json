The Union Government is bound to provide these according to the (Andhra Pradesh)\nRe-organisation act,\" Parakala Prabhakar, Advisor (Communications) to the state government, said.\nThe foundation stone for AP's capital city Amaravati, coming up in the Vijayawada region, would be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 'Vijaya Dasami' day of October 22.\nThe state government is planning to organise the foundation stone laying ceremony on a grand scale, without being extravagant, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said last week.\nIt has \"pooled\" more than 33,000 acres of land from farmers and other land owners in the region as per its \"land pooling scheme\" offering them benefits like share in developed land.\nAsked about mobilisation of funds for capital city development, Prabhakar said the Master Developer, to be chosen in the Swiss Challenge method, will have to bring in investments in a Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.\n\"That is the job of Master Developer. Master Developer is not a builder. He is a developer. He will have to bring in investments in a Public Private Partnership. That is the reason why Government of AP or its agencies will take a stake so that these things when they yield profits, they are going to be beneficiaries of those profits or returns,\" he said.\nRead: AP's capital city project yet to get environmental clearance: Former Union Finance Secretary\nChandrababu Naidu had already said the government would adopt a transparent procedure, like Swiss Challenge, for developing the capital city.\nBesides raising administrative buildings, the State government would make efforts to establish hubs of activity in areas like health, education, knowledge, sports, legal and also entertainment in the capital region so that vibrant economic activity takes place.\nSingapore and Japan, countries, which are economic and technological powerhouses, have been requested to join the endeavour to develop Amaravati as a grand city and they have shown interest, Naidu had said.\nPrabhakar said about one lakh invitations, including about 5,000 VIPs across the country, would be sent out for the foundation laying event.\nThe VIPs include Union Ministers, Chief Ministers of all states, Governors of all states, judges, MPs, eminent personalities and also top industrialists.\nPublic representatives at the grass-root level in the state and about five lakh common people would attend the function, he said.\nDuring the two-hour event, the Prime Minister would walk through an exhibition depicting the past, present and future of Amaravati.\nAmaravati, the historic village in present day Guntur district after whom the capital city is named, was the capital of Satavahanas and other rulers, besides being a place of immense Buddhist significance. The Prime Minister would visit Tirupati after the two-hour-long foundation laying function.\nThe state government said water and soil would be brought from all the villages in the state to Amaravati. Its mixture would be used in capital city construction. The idea is to promote an emotional bond with the capital city among the people.\nStates: Andhra Pradesh Andhra Pradesh chandrababu Naidu Amaravati South Also Read Waste disposal is a mess Politicos stare at VHP-SNDP newfound love Siddaramaiah to Congressmen: Stand by me, let’s win the BBMP polls Windmills wipe out Rayalaseema’s green cover", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/chandrababu-naidu-and-naren_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/chandrababu-naidu-and-naren_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/ppp-model-may-drive-new-andhra-pradesh-capitals-development", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:56:13.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
