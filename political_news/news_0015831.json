Trump has dropped 2 percentage points among evangelical Iowans while Carson has gained 13 points.\nAccording to exit polls from the 2012 Iowa Republican caucuses, 57 percent of caucus-goers in the previous election cycle were born-again or evangelical Christians and 99 percent of participants in the first-in-the-nation caucuses were white.
