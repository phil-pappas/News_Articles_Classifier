(Published Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015) Vice President Joe Biden has decided not to run for president in 2016. After weeks of speculation about whether he would jump in, Biden announced on Oct. 21, that he would not make a third run for the presidency because he doesn't have enough time to pull together the necessary campaign.

Many analysts said that Hillary Clinton's strong performance in that debate, and her adherence to Obama Administration policies effectively closed the door for Biden. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Biden in third place behind Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
