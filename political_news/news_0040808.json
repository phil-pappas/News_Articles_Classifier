Good job girl. What a waste of time, and our money Location: Texas. Posts: 29,006 I wonder when they taped the different hearings so they could broadcast the different hearings to different outlets.

She is a seasoned attorney, executive officer, and diplomat. Did they think she would break down and cry? How mysoganistic are these clowns? And apparently politically dense to boot.

He is a former federal prosecutor the 7th Circuit Solicitor. This was a deposition and the questions and answers, at this juncture, were based on information he already has. Depositions can be fact finding and they can also put contradictions from past statements in the record and and testimony contrary to the facts in the record. It's just a piece of the puzzle.

Gotcha, thanks, and agreed. I don't like Hillary. Even so, she won. To the average person this session looked like a prosecution ring rather than an investigative committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:31:46.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
