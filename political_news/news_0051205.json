(AP) - The execution of a convicted serial killer was in limbo Thursday as a federal judge in Virginia considered arguments over the lethal injection drugs.\nAttorneys for Alfredo Prieto, 49, want his execution delayed as they seek more information about the drugs, which were obtained from Texas' prison system, to ensure they won't bring about a painful death.\nA lawyer for the Virginia attorney general's office said there was no evidence anything was wrong with the drugs and argued it was in the public interest, as well as the interest of the families of Prieto's victims, to go ahead with the execution at 9 p.m. Thursday.\nU.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson said after a hearing Thursday that he will issue a ruling shortly.\nPrieto, a native of El Salvador, was on death row in California for raping and murdering a 15-year-old girl when DNA evidence linked him to the rape and murder of Rachael Raver and the slaying of her boyfriend, Warren Fulton III. Authorities have linked Prieto to several other killings in California and Virginia but he was never prosecuted because he had already been sentenced to death.\nA federal judge approved an order Wednesday temporarily blocking Prieto's execution, and then the case was transferred to Hudson at the state's request.\nPrieto's attorneys asked the court to delay the execution until Virginia officials disclose more information about the supply of pentobarbital they received from Texas, saying they're concerned about the quality of the drugs and whether they would bring Prieto \"gratuitous and unnecessary pain.\"\nVirginia obtained pentobarbital from Texas to replace its supply of another sedative, midazolam, which expired Wednesday.\nPrieto's lawyers want to know the name of the supplier, confirming its sterility and potency and they want documents showing that the drugs were properly handled. Texas allows prison officials to shield where they get execution drugs and Virginia officials have not provided that information.\nMargaret O'Shea, a lawyer from Attorney General Mark Herring's office, urged the judge to dismiss the arguments, noting that Texas has used the same drugs without any problems in 24 executions over the past two years.\n\"It is time for this to end,\" she said, adding that Prieto murdered Raver and Fulton 27 years ago. \"It is time for the carousel to end.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is also weighing Prieto's last-minute attempts to block the execution on the grounds that he's intellectually disabled.\nPrieto's attorneys urged the high court Tuesday to delay his execution so he can continue to fight his death sentence in California, saying he would likely be deemed a person with an intellectual disability if granted the opportunity to pursue his appeal.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Alanna Durkin at http://www.twitter.com/aedurkin .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/aedurkin"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:27:12.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
