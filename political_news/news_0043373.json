Presented by Deb Merril and James Lewis , Co-CEOs at Just Energy, the award went to top-placing students for their achievements in robotics, engineering, science, and mathematics (STEM) while building an underwater ROV as part of a science and engineering technology curriculum.\nSeaPerch began as one project in a book entitled \"How to Build an Underwater Robot,\" by Harry Bohm and Vickie Jensen . Years later, MIT Professor, Thomas Consi , developed a curriculum around SeaPerch as a way to grow the Ocean Engineering Program at MIT . The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) then had the vision to manage the program and partner with ONR to take the SeaPerch Program from what was essentially a teacher-training program and develop it into a national program. Today, the SeaPerch Program is managed by the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation (AUVSIF). Expansion continues with well over 100,000 students participating in the SeaPerch program and over 6,000 mentors working with students.\n\"We're absolutely honored to support educational events and activities like the SeaPerch Challenge to help youth harness their vast potential,\" said Deb Merril . \"It is our privilege, through the Just Energy Foundation, to assist educational organizations dedicated to working with young people in offering innovative, inspiring and hands-on technology learning at an early age. By investing in our youth now, we invest in the future and the development of our science and energy leaders of tomorrow.\"\n2014 Energy Day Academic Program (EDAP)\nEDAP is presented by Consumer Energy Education Foundation, Consumer Energy Alliance, and corporate Energy Day partners. It is part of Energy Day's year-long initiative to engage students in energy and STEM education. The Program helps to amplify existing academic competitions and events through a series of seven unique, citywide, energy-related competitions aimed to motivate, challenge and inspire young minds to seek careers in science and technology. Winning students were recognized at the SEFH Awards Ceremony in February, as well as receiving recognition and an invitation to display their projects at Energy Day in October.\nAbout Just Energy Foundation\nThe Just Energy Foundation was established in 2013 by Just Energy Group Inc. to help registered Canadian and U.S. charitable organizations secure the resources required to promote the health and well-being of communities in need.
