Robert Mesner after a video surfaced of a Monday night arrest in northeast Baltimore in which an onlooker says the officer spit on the man. \nInterim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis says the video “appears to depict the police sergeant spitting on the arrestee.” Criminal and internal investigations are underway. \n___ \nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:19:35.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
