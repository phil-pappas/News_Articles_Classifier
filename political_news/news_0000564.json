(Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) September 30 at 5:22 PM Regarding the Sept. 27 news article “ Clinton on a blitz to surpass fundraising by Sanders ”:\nWhile Clifton Robbins has supported Hillary Clinton and may decide to do so again, he has not yet declared support for a candidate or made campaign contributions for the 2016 presidential primary cycle. The fundraiser mentioned in the article was hosted only by his wife.\nMoreover, some of the article’s conclusions were premised on mischaracterizations and misunderstandings of Mr. Robbins’s investment approach. In his 15-year private equity career, none of the leveraged buyouts and minority equity investments pursued by Mr. Robbins and the firms with which he worked was a hostile takeover, just as none was a short-term investment. Likewise, Blue Harbour Group, the firm Mr. Robbins founded more than a decade ago, is well known to invest exclusively on a friendly basis with company management teams, and it typically holds each investment for two to three years — far longer, in fact, than the investment periods of most actively managed mutual funds.\nAdam Weiner , Greenwich, Conn.\nThe writer is spokesman for Blue Harbour Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:22:35.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
