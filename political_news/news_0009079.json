No one operating a daily fantasy site has one.\n\"If you're licensed in Nevada, you're good to go,\" said A.G. Burnett, chief of the state's Gaming Control Board. That includes traditional sports books where gamblers generally wager on the outcome of a given game.\nThe decision comes amid growing backlash by regulators and investigators, including New York's attorney general, after it was revealed employees often played on competing sites, raising questions about possible insider information being used to win.\nNevada regulators govern the country's main gambling hub in Las Vegas, and their actions could hold sway with regulators elsewhere.\nIn less than two weeks, the two high-profile companies in the ever-growing industry had gone from being a seemingly unstoppable, untouchable force to facing intense scrutiny of their business practices and legality from investigators, lawmakers, regulators and even their own players.\nThursday night, DraftKings spokeswoman Sabrina Macias emailed a company statement that implied Nevada regulators acted to protect the gambling industry in the state.\n\"We understand that the gaming industry is important to Nevada and, for that reason, they are taking this exclusionary approach against the increasingly popular fantasy sports industry,\" the statement said. It mentions the company had thousands of customers in Nevada but didn't provide an exact amount.\nFanDuel said it was disappointed regulators decided that only existing casinos in Nevada could offer fantasy sports.\n\"This decision stymies innovation and ignores the fact that fantasy sports is a skill-based entertainment product loved and played by millions of sports fans,\" the statement said. \"We are examining all options and will exhaust all efforts to bring the fun, challenge and excitement of fantasy sports back to our Nevada fans.\"\nParticipants on the unregulated sites can compete in games involving professional or college sports, paying an entry fee that goes into a larger pool. They try to assemble teams that earn the most points based on real-life stats in a given period with a certain percentage of top finishers earning a payout.\nEntry fees on DraftKings range from 25 cents to more than $5,000. Some prizes top $1 million.\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board determined that daily fantasy sports, \"involves wagering on the collective performance of individuals participating in sporting events,\" making it a sports pool and requiring a gambling license in the state.\nThe decision didn't appear to affect season-long fantasy sports but the definition could be used to describe those sites, too, that accept wagers or fees to play.\nFantasy sports, both daily and season-long, are barred in five states: Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Vermont and Washington.\nThe fantasy sports industry has argued the sites provide games of skill and not chance and are therefore protected by the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which carved out a specific exemption allowing fantasy sports.\nThe distinction has been an important one for the industry, which has dodged the type of regulation that governs traditional casinos and sports books. Avoiding being labeled \"gambling\" also has made the contests palatable to professional sports leagues that have partnered with the sites or, in some cases, invested directly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:39:10.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
