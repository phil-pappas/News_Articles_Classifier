Republican incumbents Rich Caridi and Matt Osterberg are seeking another term on the three-seat board. The Democratic team of David Ruby and Steven Guccini are also seeking seats. The four candidates will participate in the debate. Democrat Karl Wagner is not seeking reelection. This election has the potential to shift the power in Pike County. In county commissioner races, the top three vote getters win seats. Currently, Caridi and Osterberg have a Republican majority over Wagner and are able to steer their agenda for the county. Osterberg has taken an interest in economic development during his time in office. Caridi has been interested in veteran’s affairs. If both Ruby and Guccini prevail in the election, strongly republican Pike County will follow their democrat agenda which includes holding Commissioners meetings in all areas of Pike County, non-partisan hiring practices, and self-imposed term limits - both candidates will seek no more than 2 terms. “More transparency is needed in Pike County government, and we are looking forward to this opportunity to answer questions from the public about our campaign platform and qualifications. We are grateful to the League of Women Voters for this opportunity,” Ruby and Guccini,said in a joint press release. Also in a joint press release, Caridi and Osterberg expressed their gratitude to forum organizers. “The issues that face our county’s families are our issues. Over the last three years, we put leadership that listens into action and instituted initiatives that are building a stronger community and strengthening our families and Pike County’s future,” the republicans said.
