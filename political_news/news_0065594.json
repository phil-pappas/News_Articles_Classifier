LOUIS – Why start Kyle Hendricks against the Cardinals in Game 2 of the Division Series on Saturday?\nBecause Cubs manager Joe Maddon likes the idea of the Cardinals seeing a pitcher they haven’t seen this year.\nHendricks (8-7, 3.95 ERA) faced the Cardinals May 5 (losing 7-4 at Busch Stadium), but that’s not anything close to the same Hendricks who surged down the stretch in September and finished the season with 13 consecutive scoreless innings.\n“It’s primarily really, really sharp strike throwing,” Maddon said of the difference. “His fastball was going better with that exceptional movement that he has. You’re going to theoretically see ground balls and then swings-and-misses on the changeup.”\nHendricks was in the midst of a rough start, with little command, when he faced the Cards in May, hitting the first batter of the game, walking two, eventually blowing a 4-1 lead and lasting just five innings.\nHe eventually rediscovered the mechanics and form that led to an impressive rookie season last year, with a 3.03 ERA in six September starts, the Cubs winning five of them.\n“I was finally getting the ball down with some angle,” said Hendricks, who went six scoreless innings in each of his final two starts, both 1-0 victories, over the Royals and Milwaukee. “I’m just trying to build off that, stay in the same zone, stay in my land and just make good pitches.”\nSoler Eclipse\nRookie Jorge Soler was the Cubs’ starting right fielder all season when he wasn’t on the DL for ankle sprain in June and oblique strain from Aug. 24 to Sept. 17.\nBut he has been back-burnered in the Cubs’ outfield since the club added Austin Jackson for the final month of the season and began rotating both Kyle Schwarber and Kris Bryant through the corner spots down the stretch.\nSoler said, “I feel good. I’m ready.”\nMaddon said he has not forgotten about the hulking slugger, who hit .262 with 10 homers in 366 at-bats – half of the homers coming in his last 18 games.\n“His attitude’s been fabulous,” Maddon said. “He’s just been staying ready. He’s been a good teammate. He knows what’s at stake. You’ll see him at some point.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:10:10.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
