The reality is this government has allowed private interests to limit environmental protection efforts, and this latest report shows their lack of any real strategy. \n\"Kiwis are sick of seeing their rivers contaminated and spoiled by a lax approach to resource management and a government that continues to ignore calls for our poor water quality to be seriously addressed. This Bill will reinforce the role of the EPA which is one of the cornerstones of conservation in Aotearoa,\" says Meka Whaitiri. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:52:44.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
