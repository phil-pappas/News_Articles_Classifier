As part of the Gold's Gym 50 th Anniversary celebrations, the organizations have launched the \"Gold Star Campaign\" to fundraise for the nonprofit founded by Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1992.\nHOW TO GET INVOLVED:\n1.

Similarly, afterschool programs provide a home, a family to our nation's youth who would otherwise be alone afterschool during the danger hours of 3-6pm , the peak hours for juvenile crime and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex. So I'm calling on my Gold's Gym family to support our nation's kids. After-school programs, like those provided by After-School All-Stars, are a wise investment for communities, but we are currently meeting only about one-third of the demand. We need philanthropists and businesses to step up, like Gold's Gym has done. I'm looking forward to seeing fantastic results.\"\nGold's Gym President Aaron Watkins echoed Schwarzenegger's call to action. \"We've rallied our Gold's Gym community, encouraging members, associates and fans at both the corporate and franchisee level to get involved with the Gold Star Campaign. We pride ourselves for having a rich history of giving back to the communities we are in, which is why this partnership is the perfect way for us to continue to celebrate 50 years of being a leader in the fitness community.\"\nASAS President and CEO Ben Paul said, \"Partners like Gold's Gym make our programs possible, and this partnership is particularly special to us because of our mutual passion for health and fitness as well as the rich history both our organizations share with Arnold Schwarzenegger . Funds from the campaign will power high quality after-school programs to kids from New York to Hawaii . Through our programs, kids stay fit and healthy, graduate high school and go on to college, find careers they love and give back to their communities.\"\nAbout Gold's Gym\nSince 1965 Gold's Gym has built a Legacy of Strength - a legacy that goes back to the very first Gold's Gym in Venice , California.
