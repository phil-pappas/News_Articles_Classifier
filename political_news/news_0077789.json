Not long ago, Joe Biden was a punch line. Still is, to lots of people. The guy who doesn’t drink has somehow, in the public imagination, become the nation’s drunken uncle (I say this as someone who’s been a drunken uncle at more than one family gathering).\nBut to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the prospect of a Biden campaign isn’t amusing. In 2008, she lost the mantle of inevitability — can we please ban that awful word for good? — to Barack Obama, and now the President’s good friend Joe could be coming for it.\nBiden doesn’t compromise Clinton’s front-runner status; oddly for a veep, he’d be the insurgent. Still, he challenges Hillary on multiple fronts.\nNOMIKI KONST: JOE BIDEN WOULD BE MOST AUTHENTIC CANDIDATE\nClinton’s favorability numbers are sliding. While Biden still trails her in a big way, his are steady.\nThe old white guy is better at connecting with blue-collar voters and crucial suburban Catholics than the slightly less old white woman is. As the name next to Obama’s on the ticket in two national elections, he could lay claim to a healthy chunk of the President’s formidable coalition of blacks, Latinos, young voters and white progressives.\nBiden would probably run pretty unabashedly as a continuation of Obama, much as George H.W. Bush ran as an extension of Ronald Reagan. In case you’ve been living on Earth 2 lately, you know things have been breaking Obama’s way of late. Some 46% of Americans now approve of him, which may not be stellar, but is roughly even with where Ronald Reagan’s approval ratings were at this point in his presidency, in 1987.\nJim Cole/AP Hillary is still certainly the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, but Biden has goten a lot of support to run lately, while Clinton has been dodging questions from her past. On a few issues, including gay rights and gun control, Biden’s become something of a liberal hero — campaigning passionately for left-leaning policies inside the administration. While that might weigh him down in a general election, it would help in the primary.\nRICHARD COHEN: AGING JOE BIDEN, A WALKING IRONY\nHe’s a learned hand on foreign policy, without the email server woes and (mostly trumped-up) Benghazi baggage that the former secretary of state brings to the table. His old plan to all but partition Iraq has worn well over the years.\nCarolyn Kaster/AP Biden would run, and get a lot of support, as a continuation of Obama, similar to how George H.W. Bush ran as a continuation of Reagan. His last name is not “Clinton,” which is a huge plus, especially since the other major party just might wind up nominating a man named “Bush,” a matchup that would leave some sizable slice of the electorate hungering for an alternative.\nAnd few people in big-time politics seem more human than Biden. When he laughs, people generally laugh with him. When his son Beau died, people wept with him.\nBut, but, but — there are always a few buts.\nView Gallery BIDEN FACES UNPHILL CLIMB IF HE DECIDES TO CHALLENGE HILLARY\nAt this early-but-still-late juncture, Clinton has locked down most big-money Democratic donors. Her campaign is not above sending strong signals that those who betray her in the primary will pay a price.\nBiden is 72. Were he to win the presidency, he’d be 73 on Inauguration Day , the same age Bob Dole would’ve been if he’d won in 1996 — and older than John McCain would’ve been if he’d won in 2008.\nCarlos Osorio/AP Republican presidential hopeful Sen.

The downside of Biden’s free-range candor is his tendency verging on a talent to say and do idiotic things that take a campaign off-course for days on end (He once shouted out to an old “butt buddy,” and he routinely gets gropey with women on camera).\nJOE BIDEN'S DYING SON BEAU URGED DAD TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT\nBrennan Linsley/AP One of the best things Biden's got going for him against Hillary? His last name is not Clinton. While some people think even the flubs are charming, the veep’s clinical logorrhea is unquestionably a problem in this gaffe-obsessed media age.\nAlso recall: Biden’s 1988 run for the presidency was derailed when it turned out he had plagiarized a speech by British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.\nThe last possible problem is something only Biden himself knows in his gut: Whether his son’s death would wear on him as a campaign progresses, or whether it has invigorated him by reminding him what public service is really all about.\nWe may actually get to find out.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
