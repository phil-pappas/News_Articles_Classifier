(Photo: DC) Hyderabad: Leaders of the three main Opposition parties, the Congress, TD and BJP, have appealed to the people of Telangana state to support their statewide bandh call on Saturday and ensure its success.\nIn yet another joint meeting on Thursday, TS PCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, and TS TD president L. Ramana, along with legislators reached the Assembly premises and held talks with BJP legislator Chintala Ramachandra Reddy for some time.\nThe leaders of the three parties later spoke to the media, appealing to the people to support the bandh.\nThe 10 Left parties, led by the CPI and CPM, who had met on Wednesday, called for bandh on Saturday.\nThey were joined by the Telangana state unit of the YSR Congress, which said that it would take part and ensure the bandh’s success.\nMr Uttam Kumar Reddy had earlier met Congress leaders from Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts, and asked them to actively involve themselves in ensuring success of Saturday’s bandh.\nState BJP president G. Kishen Reddy alleged that the policies of the TRS government were the root cause of the rise in farmer suicides in the state.\n“The government suspended us from Assembly instead of allowing us to discuss the burning issue. It’s unfortunate that the Chief Minister complained to Governor against the Opposition,” he said, appealing to the people of the state to ensure the bandh’s success.\nStates: Telangana South Telangana Congress TD BJP Also Read New flyover to clear bottleneck at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad Online passport verification across Andhra Pradesh from May 30 Congress on top in Karnataka GP polls, claims CM Siddaramaiah Karnataka farmers stage rail-roko for Mekedatu", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/09OPPOSITION.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/09OPPOSITION.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151009/nation-current-affairs/article/parties-call-bandh-success", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:39:51.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
