(1) I hooked up with a guy off Craigslist. It was lame, he wasn’t cute, I was bored. (2) I came home and went on Tinder (which says I’m looking for an LTR, despite that hookup). I saw a guy from the gym — but he didn’t swipe right, and I was devastated. (3) I went online and sold a pair of my used undies. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I could use some advice. I’m sure what you say won’t be nearly as bad as what the voice inside my head is yelling at me. \nWhat Is My Life? \n1. I hooked up with this dude once, and it happened so fast — and it was so sleazy — that I had to fish his driver’s license out of his wallet when he was in the shower because I couldn’t remember his name. And that sleazy hookup led to a relationship so good that I wound up marrying sleazy hookup dude. Twice. So in my experience, WIML, and the experiences of millions of other people in LTRs with people they fucked the first time they met, hooking up isn’t proof that someone isn’t looking for an LTR. So that underwhelming hookup doesn’t make you a hypocrite, okay? \n2. Gym dude isn’t into you — just like you weren’t into the dude you hooked up with last night. Are you into every dude you see at your gym? No. Do you swipe right on every dude you see on Tinder? No. So last night you got rejected quickly and impersonally — Tinder-style — but you’ve dished out that kind of rejection too. Don’t be a hypocritical baby about it, okay? \n3. You made an underpants perv very happy, WIML, and you made yourself a little money. Nobody was lied to or misled, no one got hurt, and the total amount of joy in the world ticked up slightly. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay? \nOne eventful night does not an out-of-control sleazebag make. But if you feel out of control, WIML, take things slower. Resolve to be a bit choosier about who you hook up with, remind yourself to be grown-up about rejection when it comes your way, and refrain from kink-shaming yourself the next time you make an underpants perv’s day. \nI’ve come into professional contact with a respected and successful artist. She is a woman in her 60s; I am a man in my 40s. I’m really attracted to women who are strong, talented, and smart. She’s all that, and funny. I’ve never been attracted to someone that much older than myself. Nobody bats an eye when a guy gets with a woman who is 20 years younger, but how do I pursue her without her thinking I have some creepy fetish? Am I a creep? I don’t think so. I’m pretty average, I have an unusual but boring job developing woodworking tools, and I don’t have any kinks or fetishes to speak of. I’ve gone out of my way to make her feel special on several occasions, but it has only caused her to remark on my great customer service — and not in a flirty way. How can I let her know that I want to move into something else besides a professional relationship without creeping her out? \nShe Makes A Real Turn-on \nSet aside the age difference, and how you met, and those sexist and dehumanizing double standards. (An older man with a younger woman is an attractive guy with game, an older woman with a younger man is a fetish object with no self-respect.) Set all that aside, SMART, and what do we have left? Person A is attracted to Person B; Person A doesn’t know how Person B feels, so Person A has to hit on Person B. Even if Person A does their best to mitigate the risks of creeping out Person B — Person A is polite, respectful, and does their hitting on by “asking out” not by “lunging at” — the risk cannot be entirely eliminated. \nYour best bet, SMART, is to be unambiguously direct with her (“I think you’re great, and I’d love to take you out on a date”) and to invite her to be unambiguously direct with you (“If you’re not interested, just say no — I’m a grownup and I can handle rejection”). And if she’s squicked out by the age difference or wonders if you’re a fetishist, urge her to google the term “sapiosexual.” \nEmail Dan at mail@savagelove.net or find him on Twitter at @fakedansavage.
