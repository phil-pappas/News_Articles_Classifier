Photo: AFP\nThe insularity of the United States in thinking it could manipulate the Arab mind and bend the will of Arab Islam has been exposed via spectacular repeated failures in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere. Now the US Congress appears inert when confronted with Islamic State wanting to obtain nuclear weapons to begin \"religious cleansing\" on a mass scale.\nPresident Obama, himself underwhelming in facing this threat, is now being stymied by the Republican-controlled Congress which is not granting him executive powers to authorise small, surgical ground operations against Islamic State.\nGiven this inertia, the Australian government should support Russia's military intervention in Syria in support of the Assad regime, as unpalatable as this may be. Australia should also provide material support to the Kurds.\nUS Congress appears inert when confronted with Islamic State wanting to obtain nuclear weapons: President Barack Obama. Photo: Pete Marovich\nIt is worth heeding someone who put his life on the line, Jurgen Todenhofer​, a former judge and federal politician in Germany, now journalist, who visited Islamic State-controlled territory late last year.\nAdvertisement After months of negotiations, via Skype, his visit was overseen by Mohammed Emwazi​, a graduate from the University of Westminster, who gained global infamy as the Islamic State terrorist with the English accent who decapitated western prisoners on camera.\nUnder supervision, Todenhofer interviewed leaders of the self-declared Islamic caliphate and was escorted to the IS-controlled cities of Raqqa​, in Syria, and Mosul​, in Iraq.\nHe returned deeply pessimistic: \"Islamic State now control land greater in size than the United Kingdom and are supported by an almost ecstatic enthusiasm.\"\nBased on this journey and further research, Todenhofer has written a book, Inside IS – Ten Days in the Islamic State , which states that Islamic State is seeking nuclear devices, in any form. It wants to kill hundreds of millions of people in the \"largest religious cleansing in history\".\nTodenhofer, 75, was a judge before he spent 18 years in the German parliament as a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union. In 2000, at age 60, he made a very late career change and became a war reporter.\nAfter returning from Syria, on December 22 last year, he published a blog which formed the basis for his book. He described his seven strongest impressions:\n1. The West is dramatically underestimating the threat from Islamic State. Many of its fighters are intelligent and there is a general enthusiasm for the cause and acceptance of casualties.\n2. The flow of new fighters joining Islamic State is not slowing. \"Not all of them were young men who had failed in their home countries… Many were successful and enthusiastic young people from the USA, England, Sweden, Russia, France and Germany.\"\n3. Islamic State is controlling its territory with roughly the same efficiency as other dictatorships in the region. Only the Sunni population remains. All Christians, Shiites or Yazidis have fled or been murdered.\n4. Islamic State wants to engage in the largest \"religious cleansing\" in history, killing non-believers and apostates and enslaving their women and children. This means killing Shiites, Hindus and atheists, and also moderate Muslims, because they put human laws above God's laws. Jews and Christians would be spared because they are followers of \"religions of the book [Koran]\", providing they paid an annual tax and accepted low status.\n5. Islamic State is a one per cent movement bent on subjugating the other 99 per cent of the world's Muslim population. Its doctrine is not compatible with the Koran.\n6. The movement cannot be defeated by warfare. Only the moderate Sunni population can defeat Islamic State.\n7. Fighters returning from the battlefield do not present a major risk. Some will be committed to jihad, but most would be disillusioned.\nTodenhofer describes himself as a pacifist. He may come from a conservative political party but he believes the Middle East and the West are now \"paying the price for George W. Bush's act of near-unparalleled folly, the invasion of Iraq\".\nI share that view but not his pacifism. Many measures, most of them nonviolent, are required to wear down and contain Islamic State, but must include constant harassment and attrition on the battlefield.\nAbove all, the leakage of nuclear devices into the region is the greatest disaster to avoid.\nIn this context, the Obama administration's decision to conclude a deal with the theocracy in Iran which empowers Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons – and duly noted with alarm by the Sunni Arab world - can be seen as the latest miscalculation by the Americans. Even now, they still do not seem to comprehend the obdurate, implacable threat they keep uncorking.\nTwitter: @Paul_Sheehan_", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:07:56.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
