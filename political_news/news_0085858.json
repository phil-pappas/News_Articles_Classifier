UN aid agencies which are helping the Syrian refugees are almost broke and the G7 countries together with the oil-rich Gulf States decided to give €1.6 billion aid to help the agencies carry out their important humanitarian tasks.\nThe Foreign Ministers of the G7 Group (consisted by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US) met with representatives from Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and decided to come in and help the aid agencies. “We have agreed to provide together $1.8 billion for the international aid organizations of the United Nations, especially the UN refugee agency and the World Food Program,” German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told reporters today.\nIn the meeting the foreign ministers of Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, also participated. The Netherlands promised to give $123 million, Switzerland $71.7 million and Austria $10 million. Separately, from the meeting, Japan also announced that it would provide around 1.4 billion euros to assist Syrians and Iraqis displaced by conflict and for building peace across the Middle East and Africa.\nThe aid announcements, came after the dramatic call for help by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who said that the UN humanitarian agencies were “broke.” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres thanked the donour countries for providing the much needed aid as he underlined that the UN agencies were unable to provide the “bare minimum” for refugees in countries neighbouring Syria.\n“This was one of the reasons why we were witnessing more and more refugees moving onwards because it was impossible to sustain their lives in their first countries of asylum,” Guterres stressed. Steinmeir said that the €1.6 billion funds will focus on Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which are hosting some 4 million refugees from war-torn Syria.\nDespite the billions of aid the escalation of conflicts all around the world creates great financial needs for the humanitarian agencies. The UNHCR chief noted that even though “the generosity of the international community has not diminished…the (financial) needs have increased in a much more dramatic way.”\nOverall, the UN is asking for a record $20 billion to meet this year’s needs — six times the level of a decade ago.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:53:35.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
