With a system that produces more hot water in the first hour than traditional commercial systems, has a 6 year heat exchanger and tank warranty and is built for longevity and saves energy, businesses achieve a reduced cost of ownership.\nThe Demand Duo provides a direct replacement for traditional standard and high-efficiency commercial tanks, and features direct vent, common venting options and single-unit/common vent room-air ability that can use the building's existing vertical vent penetration -- eliminating the need to core additional holes in walls and roofs to allow for external ventilation, which can lead to leaks.\n\"The Demand Duo Commercial Hybrid System was created with the priorities of commercial customers in mind. The unique system approach provides a direct replacement for their aging, existing systems with the latest technologies in one product,\" said James York , Vice President of Engineering for Rinnai America Corporation. \"Combining the high efficiency of the C199 with a 119-gallon storage tank creates a solution leveraging the benefits of both tankless and tank, meaning customers win.\"\nAccording to market research firm BRG Building Solutions, a majority of commercial water heaters are installed in existing buildings, signaling a tremendous replacement-driven market for water heaters in the coming years.\n\"With innovative products like the Demand Duo, Rinnai is leading the market by providing solutions that greatly surpass the capabilities of traditional commercial water heating products,\" added York.\nAbout Rinnai\nRinnai America Corporation, a subsidiary of Rinnai Corporation in Nagoya, Japan , was established in 1974 and is headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia .
