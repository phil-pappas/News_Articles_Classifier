That year, members said they turned in rusty and inoperable guns. The $100 MasterCard gift cards for each gun were used to buy ammunition for a National Rifle Association youth camp in Bloomington and bolt-action rifles for campers. \nBoch is vowing to return to Chicago with about 60 guns to turn in. \n___ \nInformation from: Chicago Sun-Times, http://chicago.suntimes.com/ \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:14:53.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
