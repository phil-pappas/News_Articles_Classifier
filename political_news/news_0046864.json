Bush and George W. Bush. To win, one can make a donation to the campaign or simply enter online. The more than 1,200 words of fine print clarify that contestants do not need to make a donation to win, but they also point out that the prize (the cost of airfare and a hotel, worth about $2,000) are taxable as income. \nBush, however, isn't the only candidate employing this fundraising tactic. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton earlier this year held a \"Dinner for Hillary\" sweepstakes with similar fine print. The conservative publication the Daily Caller called the contest \"totally rigged,\" since the campaign would choose suitable \"winners\" from 100 randomly-drawn finalists. The Bush contest similarly lets the campaign pick the winner from a group of random finalists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:43:31.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
