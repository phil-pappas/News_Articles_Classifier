The merger is part of a commitment from both authorities to collaborate more closely across public protection services and is expected to save each council about Â£30,000 this year. There will be no change to the public-facing side of the service and trading standards officers will be able to work across local authority areas to deliver a more resilient service to residents and businesses. Councillor Gwyneira Clark, executive member for housing, planning and public protection at Torfaen council, said: 'All local authorities are faced with making significant savings in their budgets and increasingly we have to deliver more with less. 'By merging our trading standards team with our colleagues at Blaenau Gwent we have found a way of saving money while also improving the service we offer to our residents. 'This is the first step towards a fully joint approach to delivering public protection services across both authorities in the next few years.' David White, executive member for environment at Blaenau Gwent said: 'We welcome the collaboration with our neighbours in Torfaen to enable us to deliver a sustainable long term service for Blaenau Gwent residents. We are committed to developing the partnership to help us deliver public protection services as we face further financial challenges in the coming years.' The merger is the first step in a wider commitment from both authorities to collaborate across public protection services. Licensing departments are set to merge later this month and environmental health teams in 2016. distributed by This content was issued by Torfaen County Borough Council on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.torfaen.gov.uk.
