The Minister of Treasury and the President of Poznań executed the agreement for transferring 60 per cent of shares in the company free of charge to the city by the Treasury. The agreement changing the ownership structure of MTP was signed by Andrzej Czerwiński, Minister of Treasury and Jacek Jaśkowiak, President of Poznań. Execution of the communalization agreement means that Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie shall be 100 per cent controlled by the City of Poznań. The fact that Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie returns to the city is a manifestation of trust of the Ministry of Treasury to the local government. Since 2007, when such a legal possibility emerged, the Ministry of Treasury transferred over 90 companies free of charge to cities and municipalities. MTP is the leader of the fair market today not only in Poland but in the whole region. Statistically, they organise exhibitions and events every third day thanks to which they attract over one million visitors a year to the city. I transfer the showcase of Poznań to the city but also an obligation to invest in that company and develop its operations, said Andrzej Czerwiński, Minister of Treasury. In the communalization agreement, the City of Poznań obliged not to sell MTP shares acquired as a result of communalisation, not to cause MTP liquidation or sell its crucial real properties, not to amend the Articles of Association, protecting its unique nature. The City obliged also to prepare a five-year development plan for MTP, the subsequent performance of which will help integrate MTP potential with the City needs even further. Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie is a leader on the fair and conference market in Poland and an important platform for exchanging economic thought in Poland. The communalization of Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie is beneficial for the local community comprising the inhabitants of Poznań and Greater Poland region, and it is likely to contribute to extending cooperation between the company and the City of Poznań. Thanks to the communalization, further integration of MTP with the city will improve dynamics of the company development and enable to expand the cultural and recreational offer also for the local community. Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie, with their over 90-year tradition, are one of the oldest operating fair companies in Poland. Since its beginnings to 1950s, they were a municipal company. Later, they became a unit of Polish Chamber of International Commerce, seated in Warsaw. In 1990, following the initiative of the authorities of the City of Poznań, in cooperation with the Minister of Economic Cooperation with Other Countries, the company called Międzynarodowe Targi Poznańskie sp. z o.o. was created. As a result of the arrangements, the City of Poznań became the company shareholder, acquiring the stake of 40 per cent of shares. The efforts to communalize MTP were started in 2010 but it was not possible pursuant to the regulations in force at that time. Only the amendment of the Commercialization and Privatization Act in 2014 enabled to accept the motion filed by the President of Poznań in this respect.
