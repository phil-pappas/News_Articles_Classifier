In this case, a fellow for the Brookings Institution received $40,000 from an investment firm to write a study that was critical of a proposal supported by Warren and the White House. The regulation in question would simply compel transparency by financial advisors, requiring them to disclose to investors if they or their firms would monetarily benefit from advice given to clients. According to a September 29 article in Boston.com, Warren tenaciously pursued the exposure of a financially compromised report co-author by writing a letter to Brookings: On Tuesday morning, the Washington Post reported that Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote a letter to the Brookings Institution, a prestigious Washington think tank, over a study that criticized a proposed Labor Department regulation on financial advisors. Warren wrote that the reports co-author Robert Litanwho was commissioned nearly $40,000 by an investment firm that also reviewed the reportwas highly compensated and editorially compromised work on behalf of an industry player seeking a specific conclusion. On Tuesday afternoon, The Hill reported that Litan, Brookings nonresident senior economic fellow, will resign.... It [the study] was also funded by the Capital Group, a investment firm that manages $1.4 trillion in American funds and had made opposition to Labors rule one of its top priorities, according to the Post. Brookings is often described by the corporate mass media as a liberal think tank. However, in reality, Brookings is not particularly \"liberal.\" It would be better described as a centrist and highly influential establishment think tank  whose analysis and research staff is composed primarily of careerists and academics - that is only \"liberal\" in contrast to the sharply right wing think tanks, such as the Heritage Foundation. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a leftist media watch dog organization, years ago described Brookings as more conservative than liberal. FAIR writer Sam Husseini stated back then that \"in fact, much of Brookings top brass has come from Republican administrations.\" Man, these groups. The media sure snarfs them up, don't they, continue the lie that they are actually unbiased and capable of research? What are we going to do to stop this corruption?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:42:17.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
