She lost her leg because of illness while in a refugee camp.\n\"I hope with Russian pilots' help, our military will advance and defeat terrorists so that we could return to our homes,\" said ??ahmad Attan who served in the Syrian military and was wounded in fighting.\nPutin on Thursday said that the Syrian government should join efforts against the Islamic State group with \"those opposition forces that are ready for dialogue.\"\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday Russia would be happy to cooperate with opposition forces in Syria but will base its decisions on who it should talk to upon consultations with the Syrian government, as well as with the West and countries from the Middle East which advocate Assad's removal from power.\n___\nNataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report from Moscow.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
