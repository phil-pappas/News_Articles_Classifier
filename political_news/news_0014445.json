(AP) - Dissolving the nonpartisan board that oversees elections and government ethics laws in Wisconsin is the subject of a public hearing in the Legislature. \nThe bill to be heard at a joint Senate and Assembly hearing Tuesday would replace the Government Accountability Board with a pair of commissions headed by partisan appointees. One would oversee ethics laws, the other would deal with elections. \nThe change is being pushed by Republicans who feel the current board, created in 2008, has been biased in favor of Democrats. They are particularly upset with its role in a now-closed investigation into Gov. Scott Walker’s recall campaign, and the activity of conservative groups backing him, in 2012. \nAnother bill being heard Tuesday would rewrite campaign finance laws and double how much can be given to candidates. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:29:20.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
