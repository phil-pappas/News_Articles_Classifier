Your Right to Know Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo Jim Cole | Associated Press Because Ohio Gov. John Kasich plays the “I’m the adult in the room” role during the GOP presidential debates, he gets little attention, supporters say. By Darrel Rowland The Columbus Dispatch • Monday October 26, 2015 5:08 AM \nCONCORD, N.H. — As Americans get ready to tune into Round 3 of the smash reality show known as the Republican presidential debates, what are we to make of facts such as these: \n• In the dozen national polls taken since the California debate about a month ago, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has performed the worst of any candidate who made the prime-time portion of the event. \n• At this point in the 2012 presidential campaign, the national poll leader was Herman Cain. \nHey, poli-sci prof Larry Sabato, you’re a smart guy who gets quoted a lot — what do you make of this? \n“No one knows, or could know, at this point where Kasich — or most of the others — will end up,” said the director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. \n“Actually, you can argue the odds are against every single candidate, even (business tycoon Donald) Trump. No one is a substantial favorite this early, and the picture is very confused.” \nSo, there you have it: Even the experts are clueless how a GOP race still boasting 15 candidates is going to play out. >> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

If you have no experience in it, they believe you,” he lamented. \nHe elaborated on the consequences of such thinking later at a gathering in Milford, N.H.: “I’m not convinced that the people that I see in this race know how to get to Washington and get this done. It’s really hard to do. The difference with me is that I’ve already done it, several times.\" \nKasich’s people say the September debate at the Ronald Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., did him no favors because the CNN moderators purposely provoked the candidates into confronting one another. Because the Ohio governor plays the “I’m the adult in the room” role, he essentially did not engage and got little attention. \nWhat about the upcoming debate on Wednesday night at the University of Colorado’s Coors Events Center, sponsored by CNBC? \n“Kasich should be who and what he is,” Sabato said. “He does need to be assertive about getting his fair share of time, without whining about not being called on enough, a la Jim Webb.” \nTrump — or those interacting with him — dominated the first two debates. \nWhile some have been writing the billionaire’s political obituary for months, he now has sustained a lead in national polls far longer than the 2012 quick-bloomers such as Cain, then-U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry. \nOf greater concern to Kasich than his standing in national polls is that he has tailed off in early voting states, especially New Hampshire, where he has made dozens of stops and his super-PACs have aired more than $5 million in ads and made tens of thousands of phone calls. \nJoe Scarborough, the host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe who served with Kasich in Congress, said the Ohio Republican still has a decent shot in an unpredictable election. \nEven the significance of debate performances seems muted this year; Scarborough pointed out that former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina rapidly ascended after good reviews for the GOP matchups in California and Cleveland, but she now is again lagging much of the pack. \nIf anyone has gained ground from the debates so far, it’s probably Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the morning-show host said. \nKasich insists that the ground team he has built plus the dozens of small town-hall and house gatherings he is hosting will pay off by the time New Hampshire holds America’s first presidential primary in about 3 1/2 months. \n“You know why I can win? New Hampshire,” he said at one such event last week in Newport, N.H. “I have total confidence in the people of this state.” \nScarborough said, “He’s exactly right about building a field team” being more important than early polling success. \nThe TV host recalled John Kerry being given up for dead before taking the 2004 New Hampshire primary, John McCain being counted out in 2008 before prevailing in the Granite State, Rick Santorum polling at 4 percent in the fall before he won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, and even his own campaign in 1994, when he won his GOP congressional primary in Florida after coming from far off the pace. \nOf course, there are far more examples of candidates who polled poorly and never caught on. Twitter trolls have urged Kasich to drop out the way Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker already have, and even the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers fired back at a Kasich crack about their lack of victories by noting at least they win more than 2 percent of the time — an obvious reference to Kasich’s standing in national surveys. \nThat’s the crossroads Kasich faces roughly halfway between his official declaration of candidacy and the New Hampshire vote: Will he spiral downward the way Walker, another Midwestern governor, did, or will he add his name to the history books of those who were once discounted but eventually succeeded? \nDuring a house party on Friday night on a quiet street a couple of miles from the state capitol in Concord, N.H., Kasich acknowledged an odd sentiment: “I’m not worried about a general election, to tell you the truth. My challenge is going to be in the primaries.” \nBut he also said: “I have confidence that at the end, things will settle down, and … people will decide they want somebody who understands them, who knows that change has to come, but somebody that can get it done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:11:44.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
