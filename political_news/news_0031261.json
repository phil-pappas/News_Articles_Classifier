The Democrat’s campaign is going up Tuesday with a new five-figure ad buy on national cable that will feature a 30-second video highlighting the House majority leader’s statement last week crediting the House committee investigating Benghazi with politically damaging Clinton, according to a campaign official.\nThe video, which will air on MSNBC and CNN in the days leading up to the first Democratic debate next Tuesday, opens by declaring, “The Republicans finally admit it.\"\nThe spot features the possible next speaker of the House's statement, which became immediate fodder for Democrats who have long maintained that the committee was more about hindering Clinton’s 2016 ambitions than looking into the 2012 attack itself.\n“Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee,” McCarthy said last Tuesday. “What are her numbers today?\"\nClinton commits to Benghazi panel despite partisan concerns By Nick Gass\nWhile many of Clinton’s supporters — and one of her associated super PACs — jumped on the remarks within minutes, she waited until Monday morning to deliver her harshest take.\n“The committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans,” Clinton said at a town hall in New Hampshire.\n“I would never have done that, and if I were president and there were Republicans or Democrats thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.\"\nWhile Clinton’s team has been eyeing the Democratic debate on Oct. 13 as a big moment, it has also been focused on her Oct. 22 Capitol Hill testimony in front of the committee as an opportunity to move past the controversy.\nThe ad suggests that Clinton’s team will keep pushing McCarthy’s message leading up to the testimony as a way of combating the panel’s Republicans. And it demonstrates that the team will likely take an aggressive stance heading into the middle of the month.\nAfter featuring McCarthy’s own words, the ad finishes by declaring, “The Republicans have spent millions attacking Hillary because she’s fighting for everything they oppose. From affordable health care, to equal pay, she’ll never stop fighting for you and the Republicans know it.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX8AAUOGKSg"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:11:44.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
