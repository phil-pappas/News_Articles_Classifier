She also claimed that while Government departments have overseen “major improvements” in water and service quality in recent years, industry regulator Ofwat still has work to do to achieve customer value for money. \nHer views have been echoed by public accounts chairman Meg Hillier who described companies’ efforts to reduce costs tohouseholds as “encouraging”, but warned the number of customers who would need help to pay their bills was set to rise. \n“I am concerned that in recent years higher water bills and falling incomes have meant that water has become less affordable, and those who can least afford it appear to have been worst affected,” she said. \n“Water is a basic human necessity and most taxpayers are unable to choose their supplier. \n“It is encouraging that most water companies have set up schemes to support those who struggle to afford to pay their bills and allow them to pay a reduced rate. But it is worrying that 1.8 million households are expected to need this support by 2020. \n“More work is clearly needed to ensure customers share in savings made by water companies and there may be lessons which can be learnt from regulators in other highly regulated industries.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:05:53.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
