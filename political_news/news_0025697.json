The market efficiency changes are estimated to save electricity consumers $815 million in transmission congestion costs and additional millions in reduced load payments and production costs.\nThe 11 authorized market efficiency projects are expected to cost approximately $59 million and will be constructed by the owners of the transmission facilities. The approved market efficiency projects will produce savings of $15 for every dollar invested.\nThe savings will be realized over a 15-year period. A market efficiency project is driven by the economic benefits it can deliver through lower congestion costs, production costs and reduced load payments.\n\"By utilizing a more open process, a greater number of market efficiency projects were offered for consideration,\" said Mike Kormos , executive vice president and Chief Operations Officer. \"The increased participation has led to significantly more proposals being accepted, providing substantial savings.\"\nAlthough no new major new lines were among the approved projects, the PJM Board also approved several smaller transmission projects to address grid reliability concerns.\nIn all, there were 93 proposals to address the market efficiency window for bids â€“ 58 from non-incumbent transmission developers.\nAll projects are now incorporated into the PJM Regional Transmission Expansion Plan. The transmission projects approved by the board were detailed in a recent Transmission Expansion Advisory Committee meeting.\nPJM Interconnection, founded in 1927, ensures the reliability of the high-voltage electric power system serving 61 million people in all or parts of Delaware , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maryland , Michigan , New Jersey , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia and the District of Columbia .
