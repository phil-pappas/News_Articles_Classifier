It should by now be compared to Tema, in terms of development, but has been ranked a third class residential area by the Ghana Statistical Service.' \nMr Kumadey, who described himself as a results oriented person, said with his track records he could achieve a lot for the area by lobbying for investors to create job opportunities, especially for the youth. \nHe said the municipality is noted for serious business activities, but it has been engulfed with filth and that 'the constituents will pass the verdict when it comes to the primary election as to what the MP, who is also the Deputy Majority Leader in Parliament, did right for them.' \nMr Kumadey promised the residents of an ultra-modern market centre, a car park and a spacious transport terminal. \nHe said in he gets the nod to be in Parliament, he would ensure that the youth are given skills training to be self-dependent and make education a priority by establishing a scholarship scheme for secondary and tertiary students. \nMr Kumadey said all these plans could be achieved through private public partnership, to ensure that the people live comfortably and asked the supporters of the NDC in Ashaiman to rally solidly behind him to win the primary. \nGNA Politics Follow Us For my mercy and compassion not to be shut, I do not have a good view on money.
