To date, no illnesses have been reported.\nKelley’s Kookies, of Stanton, California, initiated a voluntary recall of these products after a routine inspection by CDPH identified the labeling deficiency. The cookies are packaged in clear bags with a rectangle-shaped, white label on the front. The Shortbread is sold in seven-ounce Units; and the Chocolate Dipped Macadamia cookies in six-ounce units. The products were distributed to retail stores statewide. Pictures of the product labels are available here\nConsumers in possession of these products should return them to the place of purchase for refund, or dispose of them in the trash. Consumers that have experienced an allergic reaction after consuming this product should contact their health care provider.
