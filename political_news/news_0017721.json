At the windows, Show everyone my heart Which you set alight; Enclose within me The light you Encountered on the street. Time to say goodbye, To countries I never Saw and shared with you, Now, yes, I shall experience them, I’ll go with you On ships across seas Which, I know, No, no, exist no longer; With you I shall experience them. When you are far away I dream on the horizon, And words fail, And yes, I know That you are with me; You, my moon, are here with me, My sun, you are here with me. With me, with me, with me, Time to say goodbye, To countries I never Saw and shared with you, Now, yes, I shall experience them, I’ll go with you On ships across seas Which, I know, No, no, exist no longer; With you I shall re-experience them. I’ll go with you On ships across seas Which, I know, No, no, exist no longer; With you I shall re-experience them. I’ll go with you, I’ll go with you.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAiIQ91UPeo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunningcauseICantFly/~4/0BiS0bpLJDc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAiIQ91UPeo"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:12:52.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
