Because it’s so unfairrr. The universities will not allow students to bring their dildos to school.\nReally.\nShe has a Facebook page in order to protest the horror. It’s titled, “Campus (DILDO) Carry” .\nThe State of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it DOES have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence. You would receive a citation for taking a DILDO to class before you would get in trouble for taking a gun to class. Heaven forbid the penis.”\nFrom the comments section on her page:", "external_links": ["http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/whatever-toy-i-want.png", "http://therealrevo.com//blog/https://www.facebook.com/events/1686524198249678/", "http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jessica-jin.jpg", "http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/whatever-toy-i-want-420x274.png"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:33:13.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
