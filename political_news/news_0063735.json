Either of these campaigns could be successful on their own, but together we can put our best feet forward in 2016,” said Paul McCarrier, president of Legalize Maine. \nThe Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like is backed by the Washington-based Marijuana Policy Project, while Legalize Maine is a homegrown effort. Both groups had collected about 40,000 signatures, they said. \nThe groups are trying to seize upon momentum to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Maine after victories in Portland and South Portland in 2013 and 2014 respectively. \n“Joining forces is the best step forward, not only for our respective campaigns, but for Maine as a whole. We all agree marijuana prohibition has been a colossal failure,” said David Boyer, manager of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, who led efforts on behalf of the Marijuana Policy Project in South Portland and Portland. \nBoth want to create a taxed, government-regulated marijuana industry. \nBut there were differences in the proposals. For example, Legalize Maine’s proposals would create “marijuana social clubs” and allow cultivators to sell directly to consumers. \nRep. Diane Russell of Portland, a proponent of marijuana legalization, said the differences are small and are likely to be tweaked by lawmakers if the referendum is approved. \n“Right now the differences are pretty small. By the time it shakes out through the sausage-making process it’ll be robust, fleshed out policy,” she said. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:30:39.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
