School leaders say they like that. \nThey also like that the tests will be significantly shorter for students: from 2 to 21/2 hours shorter, depending on the grade level and subject matter. That’s a time reduction of 39 percent to 50 percent per test, according to the Ohio Department of Education. \nThe department released sample questions on Friday for the new third-grade English language arts test and for the high-school end-of-course exams, which will be taken in December. Officials hope to release samples for the rest of the new tests within a month. \nThe state didn’t have time to write its own questions for this year, said Jim Wright, director of the state Office of Curriculum and Assessment. Education officials chose from pre-existing questions in the test-maker’s “bank” that they felt would best align with Ohio’s Common Core standards. \nThose questions have been vetted and field-tested in other states, Wright said. Plus, during the past few months, about 300 Ohio teachers and administrators from school districts of all sizes and regions have been evaluating those questions. \nStudents and teachers should be adequately prepared in time, “as long as they’re teaching the standards,” Wright said. \n“I think without a doubt this is going to go more smoothly than last year,” said Machelle Kline, Columbus City Schools’ director of accountability and student support services. \nOhio has an established relationship with AIR. In 2007, AIR began authoring the Ohio Graduation Test, which is being phased out. It currently makes the state tests for science and social studies. \nLast school year, Ohio’s English and math tests were made by PARCC, or the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers. \nOhio teachers and parents were vocal in their displeasure with those tests. The state budget bill passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. John Kasich on June 30 contained a ban on continuing Ohio’s relationship with PARCC. \n“We either tested or did makeup days on 40 days last year,” said Brian Seymour, director of instructional technology for Pickerington schools. \nThat wasn’t every student testing on every day; they were staggered by grade level and subject matter. But it still was a disruptive atmosphere. \nLast year, PARCC’s exams were given in both February and April. This year, the testing is just in April. \nThe testing window this school year will be 15 days, Seymour said, a gain for Pickerington of 25 days of uninterrupted instruction. \n“Kids like routine. Teachers like routine,” said Sharon Caccimelio, Pickerington’s director of teaching and learning for K-6. “This just permits our students and staff to move through their days and then do the end-of-the-year test, the April test.” \nGarilee Ogden, director of accountability and professional development for Upper Arlington schools, estimates that her district should gain at least 10 days’ instruction under this testing regime. \nThe district is “elated,” Ogden said, over both the comparative ease of administering the AIR tests and the expected cost savings. Upper Arlington spent thousands of dollars last year renting tables so that high-school students could take the test all over the building during regular classes. She doesn’t expect that will be necessary this year. \nSchools had to buy a specific model of calculator for every child taking the PARCC math test, Ogden said. This year, the districts were given a list of acceptable calculators, some of which the students already own. \n“Better use of taxpayer dollars, for sure,” Ogden said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:11:16.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
