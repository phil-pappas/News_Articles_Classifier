Phil Bryant Appoints Buddy Bailey to State Board of Education JACKSON— Gov. Phil Bryant has appointed principal of Brandon High School Buddy Bailey to the State Board of Education. He will fill the unexpired term of Richard Morrison, who has resigned. “I am pleased to appoint Buddy to the State Board of Education,” Gov. Bryant said. “His passion for education spans more than three decades, and he has a proven record of dedication to students.” Bailey, a resident of Brandon, Miss., holds a bachelor’s degree in health and physical education, a master’s degree in health and physical education, and a master’s degree in educational administration, all from Mississippi College. He has served as principal of Brandon High School since 2008 and served as principal of Brandon Middle School from 2000-2007. Bailey has also served as an assistant principal at Brandon High School and a principal at Pelahatchie Attendance Center. He was named Rankin County School District Principal of the Year for the 2014-2015 school year and led Brandon High School to multiple years of Level-A accreditation. “I am honored and humbled to be selected to serve as a member of the Mississippi Board of Education. I am grateful to Governor Bryant for the opportunity to serve in this capacity,” Bailey said. “It is my hope to work with all stakeholders to establish a common vision and take on the challenges that face us today in education. I look forward to being an integral part of the Mississippi Board of Education Team as we work together to provide better opportunities for all students in Mississippi.” Bailey’s appointment is effective immediately. His term ends June 30, 2023. His appointment will be brought before the Mississippi Senate in the 2016 legislative session for confirmation. 10/16/15 Posted October 16, 2015 - 8:43 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
