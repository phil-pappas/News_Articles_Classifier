Advertisement More by this Author \nThe Council of Governors has blamed a bloated workforce in the civil service to the duplication of duties at the two levels of government. \nSpeaking in Naivasha on Friday, CoG chairman Peter Munya said the management of the wage bill was dependent on the restructuring of the national government ministries, departments and agencies. \n“The bloated workforce is exacerbated by the fact that even though functions like agriculture, health and water have been devolved, we still have duplication of duties,” he said. \nHIRING STAFF \nHe said the ministries continued hiring staff, yet they performed the same tasks that are constitutionally assigned to county governments. \nThe CoG members expressed their misgivings in laying off workers, saying a majority of them stood to suffer and called for other ways of rationalisation. \n“Although we agree The Capacity Assessment and Rationalisation of Public Service Programme (CARPS) is noble, we are of the opinion that a number of factors need to be addressed before the report can be adopted,” said Mr Munya. \nThe CoG members noted with concern the slow pace of completing transfers of functions assigned to the devolved units, with the timeline elapsing in March 2016. \nMr Munya said the limited transfer of the functions by the county government will inevitably culminate in a constitutional crisis if not done within the stipulated timeframe. \nHe said the undue delay had compromised the implementation of the functions, adding that they were now headed to courts to seek legal redress. \n“We urge the Transition Authority to gazette the remaining functions,” said Mr Munya. \nHe said the functions should be properly transferred through a recognised framework if they are to be effectively implemented. \nHe said unless the TA gazettes the transfers of the functions, county governments cannot proceed to undertake the duties. \nCoG welcomed the move by the National Treasury to release the 2015 disbursement, terming it a “little progress”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:09:20.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
