El Burrito Loco ranked third in last year’s city evaluations and second in 2013. (The cart’s owners opened a restaurant on the city’s west side in 2014.) \nEach September, a committee of 20-some Madisonians reviews each cart over a two-week period, evaluating them according to a number of set criteria. The crew is recruited by street vending coordinator Warren Hansen, drawing from city workers and other downtown/worker/student food enthusiasts. \nIn addition to the points from the committee review, seniority points (one is added for each year of vending, though these max out at seven years) are awarded and can go a long way toward putting a cart into the top ten. \nDeductions are made by the city for health or vending code violations. The “prize” all carts are going toward is their first pick of sites for the following year. If a cart's scores fall below 70, further work is deemed necessary before it is allowed to vend in the following year. The new vending season begins April 15, 2016. \nThis year, 52 carts participated, up slightly from last year's 50. \nHere are the top ten carts in the city's official scoring for 2015. \n1.
