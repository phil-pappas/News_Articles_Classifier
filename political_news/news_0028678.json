Promoted stories \nSouthampton Itchen MP, Royston Smith slammed the process saint many of his questions - about GP services and funding - weren't answered. \n\"I don't think the consultation has been handled well. I'm not happy with the result,\" he said. \nHe added: \"It takes away the only facility in the east [of Southampton]. It's wrong, fundamentally wrong. The reasons for it just don't stack up.\" \nNick Chaffey, of the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition, who campaigned against the closure, described the decision as \"shocking\". \nHe said: \"There's a consultation where 70 per cent of the people who took part say they don't want this service closed and the actions of the board have thrown their views away.\" \nSpeaking after the hour-long debate Dr Sue Robinson, clinical chair of the CCG denied that the views of the public were disregarded. \nShe said: \"I think we have taken on board the views of the public but we have a limited budget.\" \nShe agreed, along with John Richards, chair of the CCG, that more needs to be done to improve access to GPs and raise awareness of other services. \nShe added that the centre would not be reinstated. \n\"I wish we could provide everything that everybody wants, we have to make difficult decisions as a board for the health needs of the city as a whole,\" she said. \n\"We need to make difficult decisions that benefit the health of everybody in the city, not just those on one side of the city.\" \nMr Richards denied that they had failed the public in not informing them of the other services available and increasing awareness of how to access GP services. Share article \nHe said: \"We're part of a huge body that administers health. The CCG is a small body. We do need the help of our partners including the media to make people aware of what other services are available.\" \nHe added: \"The views of the public are extremely important to us. It's the public who we serve, we have responsibility to make the best possible use of the public money.\" Promoted Stories Southampton health chiefs have been slammed by politicians after deciding to close Bitterne Walk-In Centre Sorry, an error occurred.
