Quote: Scholars Call Bullshit on Netanyahu's Speech Blaming Palestinian for the Holocaust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu caused an uproar on Tuesday when he told the World Zionist Congress that a Palestinian leader from the mid-20th century bore responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust. Netanyahu said the former grand mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, planted the idea to wipe out European Jews when he met Hitler in 1941 in Berlin.\"Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews,\" he said. 'And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, 'If you expel them, they'll all come here.' 'So what should I do with them?' he asked. 'Burn them!'\" This version of events doesn't sit well with the world's leading scholars of the Holocaust, Netanyahu's political rivals, the mufti's own biographer, or for that matter the German government — which went out of it's way on Wednesday to claim sole responsibility for the extermination of Jews.\"We know that responsibility for this crime against humanity is German and very much our own,\" a spokesperson for Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \"This is taught in German schools for good reason; it must never be forgotten.\" Netanyahu's speech puts Palestinians at the center of the Holocaust – a version of events that's completely unfamiliar to the world's leading historians of Nazi Germany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:28.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
