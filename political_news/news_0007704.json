One Chinese group has announced plans to buy 50 farms, though it has just pulled out of the purchase of 10 in Northland. \n\"The KPMG report on dairy farm sales to foreigners is too narrow, focusing only on established dairy farms, and fails to take account of farms bought for dairy conversions, like the 355 hectares near Ashburton recently sold to a Luxembourg investment fund for $11 million. \n\"The report appears to have been done to ease fears of Chinese investors buying up New Zealand land. \n\"With the dairy crisis more farms are expected to go on the market and will be snapped up by foreign buyers unless we do something urgently. \n\"New Zealand First stands for a rigorous test to be applied when foreign interests want to acquire New Zealand land or businesses. \n\"We have a plan to reverse the losses of land over recent years. This will involve tight scrutiny of all potential deals from a national interest perspective. \n\"The current practice of rubber-stamping deals by the toothless Overseas Investment Office is a farce and needs to end,\" says Mr Peters. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:22:47.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
