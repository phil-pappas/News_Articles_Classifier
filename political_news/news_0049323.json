Picture: SUNDAY TIMES Related articles Leadership battle in starting blocs Mantashe deals the cards ANC is playing Shake-up ahead of key ANC meeting Brace for dirt digging in race for president In this article Companies and organisations: South African Communist Party | African National Congress People: Thabo Mbeki | Fikile Mbalula | Julius Malema | Jacob Zuma | Gwede Mantashe AFRICAN National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe can’t sing — certainly not as well as President Jacob Zuma. But in July 2012, an animated Mantashe belted out a passionate song from the stage at a South African Communist Party (SACP) congress in Richards Bay.\nClapping rhythmically when the beat dictated, he sang \"ungajarhi impi, impi iyabulala\". It means \"don’t rush into a skirmish, it may prove fatal\", or, metaphorically, \"don’t rush out thoughtlessly, sniffing for trouble\".\nIt was very clear to the SACP delegates why the secretary-general was so ecstatic. Something big had just happened in the ANC: its youth leader Julius Malema, who had caused the Zuma-Mantashe team so much trouble, was being given the boot. Mantashe was one of the instigators of his disciplinary charges.\nMalema had led a campaign to oust Mantashe from his position as the ANC’s third-in-command and replace him with current Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula, a former youth leader who was touted on the grounds of a \"generational mix\" in the ANC’s top leadership.\nAfter making small potatoes of Malema, Mantashe went on to humiliate Mbalula, who stood against him at the ANC’s December 2012 conference. Almost effortlessly, Mantashe garnered more than 3,000 votes — a ratio of three votes to one against Mbalula.\n...\nMANTASHE’s opponents wanted to weaken or remove him so that, ultimately, they could remove Zuma from office. \"I always used the metaphor that I was just the post box — from the outset, the target was Zuma and not me. I’m too small a fish to be targeted,\" he said at the time.\nFast forward to October 2015, and Mantashe is again in the thick of things as the ANC’s three-day, midterm conference starts in Midrand today. He is in somewhat familiar territory, with sharks baying for his blood. He is the target of the \"Premier League\" — a loose grouping dominated by North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza.\nThere have been murmurs that some of his critics are toying with the idea of raising a motion of no confidence in Mantashe at the gathering, effectively calling for his removal. But this is unlikely to gain much traction and could well boomerang against the Premier League.\nKgalema Motlanthe, who was ANC secretary-general for a decade, says that under normal circumstances, the secretary-general’s report to the national general council is approved by the national executive committee long before the gathering and there is no need for the presenter to fear egg on his face. \"On the eve of a conference, you are very relaxed,\" he says. \"All the logistical arrangements are in place, the reports are back from the printers.\"\nMantashe says he’s not prepared to talk about his role, the state of the ANC or the Premier League and its politics, \"in case people say I am campaigning, when in fact I’m not\".\nHe is aligned with a group dubbed the \"Mvela League\" (the second tier of local football), regarded as a meek group which has Mantashe and SACP boss Blade Nzimande as its most recognisable figures.\nMantashe’s report to the conference today is expected to be a source of fireworks. He is usually brutally honest about the ANC’s shortcomings. No doubt, he will comment on the factional games at play and possibly the rise of the Premier League — perhaps even mention it by name.\n...\nUNLIKE his predecessors, Mantashe prefers to deliver his organisational report in a closed session, away from the glare of the media and other guests. He argues that the frankness with which he delivers it requires that only delegates be present.\nThe word on the street is that the Premier League has sharpened its arrows for the commissions at the national general council, and will tear Mantashe’s report apart should they perceive it to be an attack on them. Delegates will also go through it with a fine-tooth comb to look for signs of Mantashe’s ambitions and his strategy to get into a higher office after the 2017 elections.\nMantashe is approaching the end of the road in his role as secretary-general. Currently serving his second five-year term, and despite the fact there is nothing in the ANC’s constitution that prevents him from serving a third, he is unlikely to want a single day more than 10 years in this role.\nHe is being tipped as a deputy president candidate for the Mvela League grouping, and the west wing of the Union Buildings is probably loaded on his GPS.\nMantashe is quite aware that history is against his rise to the number one position. \"In the history of the ANC, not many secretary-generals have become president,\" he once said. \"The only one was Oliver Tambo. (Walter) Sisulu ended up being deputy president. Kgalema Motlanthe was deputy president.\"\nBut while it has its place, history is not always the most reliable indicator of the political future.\nMantashe was elected a secretary-general at the ANC’s 2007 conference, yet five years prior to that, could not muster enough support to be elected on to the party’s national executive committee.\nThe former trade unionist and communist — he wears red socks every day, without fail — brought a frankness and brashness to Luthuli House. When ANC opponents bark at him, he barks back. He bullies journalists and editors, taking them to task about reports he finds unflattering.\nPeople who work at Luthuli House say he is just a big, scruffy teddy bear who often whistles and wanders around the building. His fashion sense — he often wears oversized and strange-coloured suits — are a source of much mirth at the ANC’s headquarters.\nBut he can be brutal in the application of power. Malema was one victim, as Mantashe connived with others to drive him out of the party. Before him, Joseph Mathunjwa, now leader of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), was suspended from the National Union of Mineworkers, when he was a leader there, and left the union acrimoniously.\n...\nMANTASHE’S hand has often been visible in the destruction of institutions supporting democracy and transparency, and when state-owned enterprises were turned into ANC toys during the \"Zumantashe era\".\nReports of his family’s business interests — built mainly on questionable state tenders — could snowball into an issue that could be used to discredit him, particularly because he moved up the ranks of the ANC on a ticket of clean administration and a plan to weed \"tenderpreneurs\" out of the party.\nMantashe’s ability to punch above the weight of his office came from exploiting — wittingly or not — the intellectual weaknesses in the president’s office. Zuma’s campaign for the top position was based on reclaiming power from the Union Buildings, where it was concentrated during the Mbeki years, and taking it back to Luthuli House.\nAn indicator of the success of this project will be a report from him today detailing an adequately staffed Luthuli House able to produce policies appropriate to the state of the nation and the economy; improved relations between the ANC and key bodies in society and success at the polls.\nHowever, none of this was really achieved as Zuma brought more shame to the ANC presidency than glory. In this space, Mantashe transformed his position to more than just a functionary who ensures that staffers are paid on time and the lights are on at the headquarters.\nHe will probably brag today about the growth in ANC support, which has doubled to about 1.5-million since the Polokwane conference in 2007.\nBut the party — by Mantashe’s own admission — has a problem of poorly prepared cadres and even ghost members.\nHis critics insist Mantashe is not in touch with the DNA of the ANC.\nMotlanthe who will attend the council this weekend says, \"Leaders must lead and vanish. If you overstay your welcome, you run the risk of choking on the ash of the fire you may have lit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:21:09.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
