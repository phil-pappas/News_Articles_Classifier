Meanwhile, Republicans took their share of the “pork.” \nThe result? \nFive members of the Independent Democratic Conference took nearly half of the money allotted back to the state senators, with Jeff Klein (D-Bronx) claiming a whopping $11.7 million. \nIn 2012, the IDC went into an agreement of equal partnership with the GOP to bring bills to the floor, and share the Senate president post. Under the agreement of 2014, although they are partners, they didn’t have equal power-sharing to bring bills. \nWith the earmark allocation announced, it’s possible the IDC was swayed by allocation considerations. \nCuomo, who was up for reelection in 2014, was pressured from the Democratic Party to help the State Senate gain Democratic majority and exert pressure on IDC leader Jeff Klein to join the Democratic Party as opposed to the Republicans. \nBefore the elections, Klein publicly stated that should the Democrats need his vote to win a majority, he would give the Democrats the vote, refusing to hand over Senate reigns to Republicans. \nAfter the elections, the Republicans won an out-right slim majority by one vote, which made yet another deal to expand the majority. \nThe deed paid off well. $11.7 million to be exact, which Klein brought back to his respective community. \nState Sen. Simcha Felder, a Democrat first elected in 2012 did not opt to join the IDC. Instead, he caucused with the GOP majority. He publicly acknowledged that he would give his vote if it was necessary to keep the GOP in the majority. \nHolding a much more loyal position to GOP than IDC’s Klein, Felder was stiffed when earmark money was made available, claiming $275,000 — a lowly award compared to other IDC members. \nWhile the majority of senators received over $1.5 million in funds, Felder was awarded one of the lowest earmarks. In fact, only three other senators earned less. \nState Sen. Neil Breslin, a Democrat from Albany, expressed his frustration, telling POLITICO New York he was “sad” to see that Klein was rewarded while he and his colleagues received no funds. \n“I’m disappointed that it appears as though nothing has changed,” he said. “When people tell you it’s not about the money, it’s generally all about the money.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:51:04.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
