It operated as a real funeral home for almost 100 years…It's not your typical haunted attraction,\" commented Jeff Borne , Owner. \"Paranormal Investigators from around the world have verified that our mansion is actually haunted. When you add that to the high end special effects, animatronics, theatrical sets and professional actors, our visitors get a world-class, haunted thrill ride ranked as one of the best in the country. This year's theme is centered on Seven Serial Killers, each with their own particular taste for producing the adrenalin rush of their victims and creating fear. We feel like it will be our biggest and best year ever.\"\nFor nine years, The Mortuary has teamed up with The Blood Center to save lives in the New Orleans area while supporting a season long blood drive where blood donors receive a FREE $45 VIP Ticket to The Mortuary when they donate blood. \"Since it opened, The Mortuary has helped The Blood Center to collect over 5,000 units of blood. This equates to helping over 15,000 patients. They have been a great partner while being awarded as one of the Most Productive Blood Drives in the nation.\" commented Valerie Mascorro , The Blood Center Donor Manager.\nEach year, The Mortuary takes pride in developing a new theme set within the three stories of the mansion. In addition, The Mortuary's haunted basement houses the original embalming room along with an underground burial crypt. Borne added, \"We sincerely thank the local and surrounding areas for consistently supporting us for nine seasons. We look forward to celebrating the Halloween season with our guest for many years to come.\"\nVisit www.themortuary.net for more information.\n releases/dare-to-visit-a-haunted-house-in-a-real-haunted-housethe-mortuary-haunted-mansion-opens-for-2015-halloween-in-new-orleans-300156101.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=AQ22852&Transmission_Id=201510080700PR_NEWS_USPR_____AQ22852&DateId=20151008", "http://www.themortuary.net/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dare-to-visit-a-haunted-house-in-a-real-haunted-housethe-mortuary-haunted-mansion-opens-for-2015-halloween-in-new-orleans-300156101.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:48:02.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
