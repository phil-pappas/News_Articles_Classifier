Unfortunately, the government squandered that under pressure from a few irresponsible employers. \n\"But this isn’t the way it has to be, and we are proud to see political leaders stand up for a better way of doing things.\" \nE tÅ« represents working people in industries like mining, aviation, aged care and manufacturing, which all have unique health and safety needs. We fight for strong health and safety laws for all working people. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:04:30.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
