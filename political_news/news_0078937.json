The status quo clearly is not working and people on both sides of this issue cannot simply continue shouting at each other. Nobody wants more mass killings, and serious people are going to have to engage in serious discussion.\"\nThe senator added, \"In my view, there are very concrete steps we can take to lessen the number of tragedies and to make those that happen less lethal, including ideas supported by a majority of gun owners.\"\nThe Democratic socialist's plan includes strengthening the background check system, closing the gun show loophole, making straw purchases a federal crime, banning semi-automatic assault weapons and fixing the mental health system. If Sanders' plan sounds familiar, that's because it is nearly identical to the plan laid out by Clinton on Monday morning, except it doesn't rely on executive power.\n  Report: Obama to meet families of Oregon victims Last week after the shooting took place, the president repeated his call for gun control.\nBy Daniel Chaitin â€¢ 10/05/15 10:01 PM While running to the left of Clinton in the Democratic primaries, as a senator from rural and gun-friendly Vermont, Sanders has occasionally broken with liberals on gun control.
