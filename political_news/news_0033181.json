Steve. Why doesn't he realize that nobody likes him? istolethetv The Twin Cities has never been the sort of place where hordes of starry-eyed young people move for fame and fortune. But as it climbs the ranks of every Top 10 list for quality of life, it’s becoming a harder pitch to ignore.\nWhat those lists don’t mention is the frequent insecurity these transplants know well, whispered with confessional despair in wood-panel dive bars after months of missed connections: “Is it just me? Or are Minnesotans total assholes?”\nThe second-guessing is a common trait. Small-town settlers wonder if they’re just misreading urban chic for frigidity. Transplants alighting from megalopolises like Buenos Aires and Berlin chalk it up to small-city small-mindedness. Folks from the South are quick to blame the isolating cold of northern winters, but that doesn’t explain how those hailing from other Midwest cities have a hard time cracking the icy Nordic shells of native Minnesotans too.\nThose born and bred here don't always see it, but to newcomers we're not very friendly, at least in a deep friendship way.\nIt took Jade Ross of Colman, South Dakota, no more than one college party to catch on that \"Minnesota Nice\" is a trademark best used sarcastically. At 18, when she reported for school at St. Cloud State, everybody talked up the Minnesota Nice phenomena ad nauseum, she says. \"I'd never heard of that before, and I didn't understand why you needed to talk about it,\" Ross says. \"In South Dakota, we were just nice, and we didn't need to brag about it.\"\nAt parties she'd describe home as a small farming town of 500. She got responses like, \"So do you have ... Internet? Do you ride a buffalo to go to school?\"\nContact: Susan Du Follow: @shijundu City Pages City Pages", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/shijundu", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:36:31.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
