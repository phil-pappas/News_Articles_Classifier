As a result, the family of four, who were asleep at the time, lost their two children, aged 3, and 9 months, to burn injuries. \nIn the photo feature, can be seen the father, who injured his palms, and has now been released from the hospital. Also evident is the suffering of the bereaved family members.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:27:40.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
