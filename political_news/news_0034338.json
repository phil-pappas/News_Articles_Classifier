My objective is to find a way to move what I think is the critical change that we need in American politics today, to address ... the corruption of representative democracy.\" \nHe initially announced his decision in an Atlantic Monthly essay published Saturday. \nDuring the one-hour interview, Lessig also continued his criticism of the Democratic National Committee over his being omitted from this week’s Democratic presidential debate. \n\"I don’t want to complain ... I don’t want to be the Jim Webb on this stage and whine about this,\" Lessig said, joking about Webb frequently lamenting about his lack of questions during the Democrats’ debate. \nBut, Lessig, said, \"the rules have the effect, whether intended or not, to make it almost impossible for someone who is not a politician or a billionaire to run for president.\" \nHe said that polling outlets take their cues from the DNC when deciding which candidate names to include on their surveys. He argued that his name was left off and as a result, he never met network polling thresholds to appear in a debate. \n“My political people have tried to talk to people at the DNC about it, but their view is, 'If we let Lessig on, then we have to let the 140 other people who have said they are running for president.'\" \nHe argued that even if he did not meet the polling threshold, the fact that he raised more than $1 million should be enough proof that he is a serious candidate. \nA DNC spokeswoman wrote in an email that \"each network host sets specific criteria,\" and \"Lessig and his staff were briefed by DNC staff, as offered to other candidates and potential candidates.\" \nLessig on Saturday questioned the motives for the DNC. \n“Now, maybe as the Democrats look at the politicians, they say 'Geez, the non-politicians on that stage are causing a lot of trouble. They don’t want us,’\" he said with a laugh. \n\"I guess I'm just so naive and such a believer in my party that I can’t really believe it’s conspiratorial in that sense. But the reality is here I am, I’ve raised more money than two, possibly three of the [Democratic] candidates [who were in the debate.]\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:54:24.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
