She then created a new account after her son, known as 'Abu Ubaidah', who was believed to have been involved in the IS group, went to Syria, the daily reported.\nAzizah, among others, uploaded her son's status in Syria on her Facebook accounts and social media.\nDefence counsel Suzalina Salleh told the court that Azizah's son had been confirmed killed in Syria.\nShe said her client had repented and regretted her actions. In mitigation, Suzalina said Azizah worked at various places, including a factory and a school canteen, to support her children.\n World islamic state Facebook Also Read Japan plans a space force Sikh-Americans ask Narendra Modi to resolve their passport, visa issues Facebook ready to spend billions to bring whole world online: Zuckerberg Mamata's FB popularity 2nd to Narandra Modi, Keriwal and Vasundhara", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151025/world-asia/article/mother-islamic-state-terrorist-jailed-supporting-sons-activities-facebook", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/islamic%20state%20-%20AP_3_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/islamic%20state%20-%20AP_3_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:57:14.800+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
