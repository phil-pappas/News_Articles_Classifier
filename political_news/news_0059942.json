Joseph Biden, D-Del., wearing a University of Delaware baseball cap, leaves Walter Reed Army Hospital accompanied by his son Hunter Biden in Washington. Biden had been in the hospital for 11 days so that surgeons could implant a small umbrella-like filter in a vein to prevent blood clots from reaching his lungs. Biden's storied political career will end much the way it started nearly half a century ago: shaped by crushing personal tragedy that shook his confidence in his own ability to lead. In deciding not to run for president, Biden has turned away from months of preparations and countless hours that had put him on the verge of a third presidential campaign.
