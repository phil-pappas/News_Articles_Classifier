By Travis Mitchell Oct. 15, 2015 | 8:30 a.m. EDT + More Putting together college applications can be stressful for even the most accomplished students, especially with competition on the rise . For those who have struggled with their SAT or ACT scores or haven’t earned straight A’s, the pressure to impress admissions officials can cause even more anxiety.\nTo help high school students who have strong academic transcripts but who aren’t at the top of their classes, U.S. News calculates a specialty list of A-plus Schools for B Students as part of the annual Best Colleges rankings. The list includes schools that perform well in the rankings and that admit students who don’t have perfect grades or test scores.\nU.S. News first evaluated schools' performance in the 2016 Best Colleges rankings, as well as their average freshman retention rate and incoming students' SAT or ACT scores. Finally, each school on the list couldn't have more than 50 percent of its freshmen come from the top 10 percent of their high school classes.\nThe following map showcases the 50 highest-ranked schools from the National Universities and National Liberal Arts Colleges categories that made the list of A-plus Schools for B Students, including ties. The rank shown for each school reflects its placement in the 2016 Best Colleges rankings. More schools can be found on the full lists , along with information on schools that placed in the Regional Universities and Regional Colleges categories.\nSearching for a college?
