It included details of the proposer’s consultation and evidence of support from the Lake Ferry Ratepayers & Residents Association, the Department of Conservation and the South Wairarapa District Council,” says NZGB Secretary Wendy Shaw. \n“Based on this information, and its own research into the history of the name, the NZGB agreed on 23 September to proceed to public consultation on the proposal.” \nConsultation will run from 29 October-4 December. Anyone can make a submission during the consultation period either in support of, or objecting to, this proposal. \nDetails of this proposal will be available on the LINZ website from 29 October. \nFrom 29 October submissions can be made in writing to the Secretary for the New Zealand Geographic Board, via the LINZ website or to nzgbsubmissions@linz.govt.nz , or via post to: Level 7, Radio New Zealand House, 155 The Terrace, PO Box 5501, Wellington 6145. \nVisit the LINZ website for information about general place naming and the New Zealand Geographic Board . \nEnds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
