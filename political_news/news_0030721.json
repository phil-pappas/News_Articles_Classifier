This makes our roads and highways safer, saves lives, and reduces costs resulting from collisions. We have substantial evidence that teenSMART works to reduce teen driver crashes by 30%, but that is just one of the reasons to use teenSMART. We hope our top 10 list will inspire others to think about ways to increase teen driver safety.\"\nADEPT Driver's Top 10 Reasons to become teenSMART:\nReason #1 to become teenSMART: It's award-winning. teenSMART has received awards for exceptional contributions to safety from the Governors Highway Safety Association and the National Safety Council , two highly respected leaders in the highway safety community.\nReason #2 to become teenSMART: The Big 6 . teenSMART identifies and addresses the six factors that cause more than 90% of all teen collisions. For example, after completing teenSMART, teen drivers increased safe gap choices by 62%, and decreased unsafe gap choices by 92.4%.\nReason #3 to become teenSMART: It's based on science . ADEPT Driver uses neurocognitive brain science to teach teen drivers how to avoid crashes, and draws on the latest crash avoidance research to continually improve teenSMART.\nReason #4 to become teenSMART: Parent-teen involvement. Teens build their skills on a home computer with point-of-view driving simulations, then apply and further reinforce their crash reduction skills through in-car, behind-the-wheel training with a parent. It comes with a guide for stress-free parent-teen conversations about building safe driving habits. teenSMART is a great resource to use when teens are fulfilling required hours of driving practice in states with graduated licensing laws .\nReason #5 to become teenSMART: The Risk-o-lator . The makers of teenSMART created a risk calculator app called the Risk-o-lator that teen drivers and parents can use to measure the increased risk of being involved in a collision based on choices made by teen drivers. The free app is available through iTunes and Google Play stores.\nReason #6 to become teenSMART: Proven crash reduction. teenSMART is the only crash avoidance training program to demonstrate a 51% reduction in costs for bodily injury to others caused by teen drivers, a 29% reduction in costs for property damage to others caused by teen drivers, a 27% reduction in medical costs for occupants of cars driven by teens, a 27% reduction in damage cost to vehicles driven by teens, and an overall 30% reduction in crash frequency.\nReason #7 to become teenSMART: It's fun and easy to use. Take a test drive .\nReason #8 to become teenSMART: Save money on teen driver auto insurance. Because of teenSMART's verified impact on reducing teen driver crash frequency, crash severity and improving profitability for insurers, many insurance companies offer discounts on auto insurance for teen drivers that have completed teenSMART.\nReason #9 to become teenSMART: It lets insurance companies compete for your business with discounts. Departments of Insurance in 49 states have approved insurance discounts for teens that complete the teenSMART program. Because of teenSMART's verified impact on reducing crashes, it is the only program approved by the California Department of Insurance that qualifies for a 20% insurance rate reduction.\nReason #10 to become teenSMART: Teen driver skills are improved = safer teen drivers. Based on evaluations conducted in 2014 and 2015, teen drivers that completed teenSMART showed a significant improvement in crash reduction skills after training, including a 61% improvement in the ability to identify and remember objects in blind spots, mirrors, and front and rear view zones. Overall performance in identifying clues that could require an immediate driver action improved by 51%, and overall performance in identifying changing risk in traffic improved by 32.4%.\nFor more information about teenSMART, we invite you to watch how it works .\nContact: Hilary McLean\nPhone: 916-441-2917\nEmail: hmclean@capimpactllc.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120823/SF62269LOGO\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121015/SF92741LOGO\n releases/in-celebration-of-national-teen-driver-safety-week-adept-driver-shares-top-10-reasons-to-become-teensmart-300161734.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF31399&Transmission_Id=201510190800PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF31399&DateId=20151019", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20121015/SF92741LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121015/SF92741LOGO", "http://www.adeptdriver.com/company/scientific-research/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NTDSW?src=hash", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120823/SF62269LOGO", "http://www.teensmartdriving.com/what/", "http://www.teensmartdriving.com/how/", "http://www.adeptdriver.com/news/tdsw-risk-o-lator/", "http://www.adeptdriver.com/partners/", "http://www.adeptdriver.com/leadership/leadership-team/", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/48393189", "http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/license_laws.html", "http://www.nsc.org/NewsDocuments/2012-Press-Release-Archive/10-18-2012-TDSLA.pdf", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/in-celebration-of-national-teen-driver-safety-week-adept-driver-shares-top-10-reasons-to-become-teensmart-300161734.html", "http://www.teensmartdriving.com/tsv4-test-drive/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20120823/SF62269LOGO", "http://www.ghsa.org/html/media/pressreleases/2015/20150901awards2015.html", "http://www.teensmartdriving.com/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:18:05.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
