Katherine Clark to aid babies born addicted to heroin, painkillers or other opioids. The Protecting Our Infants Act, which has already cleared the House, was approved by the Senate health committee on Wednesday without objection. After the vote, committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., called for its immediate passage in the Senate. Citing a tenfold increase in Tennessee babies born addicted to opioids over the past decade, Alexander said the legislation would help ensure that federal programs are more effective in helping pregnant women struggling with opioid use disorders, so that they get the help they need and have healthy babies. ”I urge the Senate to pass it immediately,” he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who introduced the Senate version, likely needs little prodding to bring the bill to the floor. His bill also enjoys strong bipartisan support. Clark, D-Melrose, built broad support for her bill in the House, which was approved unanimously. The bill would require the Department of Health and Human Services to address gaps and duplication in research and programs for opioid-dependent pregnant women and their babies born with “neonatal abstinence syndrome,” a health condition that arises when newborns exposed to addictive opioid drugs while in the mother’s womb withdraw from the drug after being born. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who serves on the health committee, commended Clark’s effort to address the issue, noting that more than 1,700 drug-exposed babies were born last year in Massachusetts. “She is leading this legislation in the house and has made neonatal abstinence syndrome one of her top priorities,” Warren said at the committee meeting. “We have a lot to do to address opioid abuse and to protect moms and babies. So, I’m pleased the committee has taken this step.” Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., also spoke in favor of the bill saying that it is “badly needed” to address the alarming rise in infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. The committee also approved by voice vote legislation that Alexander introduced to improve treatment for opioid addiction. It would have the Department of Health and Human Services raise awareness of new treatments for opioid addiction, work to remove roadblocks to treatment, and promote innovative approaches to treatment in prisons, community mental health centers and hospitals.
