However, at four months old he suddenly developed seizures. Two months later, the seizures worsened, with some lasting nearly two hours. In his first two years of life, Alex suffered from thousands of them. At 20 months old he was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI), is a rare and devastating form of intractable epilepsy that begins in infancy. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and have associated conditions, which also need to be properly treated and managed. The conditions include behavioral and developmental delays, movement and balance issues, chronic infections and more. One of the most serious aspects of Dravet syndrome is that it renders patients in the throes of a seizure, or about to be, unable to communicate.\nTo assist individuals and families affected by this devastating illness, Smart911 , the life-saving, national safety service that gives 9-1-1 extra intelligence when responding to an emergency, has partnered with the Dravet Syndrome Foundation (DSF). Families affected by Dravet syndrome are strongly encouraged to create a Smart911 Safety Profile that lists their child's medical conditions, medications, emergency contacts, as well as service animals. Because Dravet syndrome patients are unable to speak during a seizure, the Smart911 profile can \"speak\" for them, giving a 9-1-1 call taker the critical details needed to get emergency medical services to the patient as quickly as possible.\n\"Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy beginning in childhood, affects one in 17,000 people. We work aggressively to find a cure while assisting afflicted individuals and their families,\" says Mary Anne Meskis , executive director at Dravet Syndrome Foundation. \"A person with Dravet syndrome has highly specialized needs and can greatly benefit from providing 9-1-1 call takers and first responders their medical information through a Smart911 Safety Profile ahead of any emergency. We encourage the families we serve to be proactive about their emergency preparedness by signing up for Smart911 today. Children with Dravet syndrome do not outgrow this condition and it affects every aspect of their daily lives.\"\nThe Dravet Syndrome Foundation was founded by a group of parents with the purpose of expediting research to find a cure and better treatments for their afflicted children. Its missions are to raise research funds for Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies, to increase awareness of these catastrophic conditions, and to provide support to affected individuals and families.\nThrough Smart911's free Safety Profiles, citizens can provide any information they would want emergency services to have when responding to their call, such as identity of residents, medical conditions including medications taken, photos of children and pets, and location of bedrooms. Safety Profiles are kept secure and only appear when the associated phone number calls 9-1-1, allowing for a more effective and precise emergency response, saving time and lives.\n\"Dravet Syndrome is a devastating condition and we want to do anything we can to assist individuals and families affected by it,\" said Katharine Farrell , national marketing manager for Rave Mobile Safety, maker of Smart911. \"When someone, especially a young child experiences a critical medical situation such as a seizure, time is of the essence. Smart911 is a vital tool that can help get medical attention to a patient more quickly.\"\nTo learn more about the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, visit http://www.dravetfoundation.org/\nTo register for Smart911 and create your free Safety Profile, please visit: https://www.smart911.com\nAbout Dravet Foundation\nDravet Syndrome Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to aggressively raising research funds for Dravet syndrome, a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy beginning in childhood, and related conditions.
