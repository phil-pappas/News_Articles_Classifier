While the original song featuring Sanjay Dutt and Pooja Bhatt was full of innocence and pure love, this new version is all about sheer, hot, blush-inducing, temperature-raising love making scenes. Sharman Joshi and Zarine Khan's chemistry is both tender and incredibly erotic. There is love, but also a whole heckuva bunch of lust. Without divulging any more details, go ahead and watch the number here. Watch the orginial track Tumhe Apna Banane Ki Kasam' from 'Sadak'. entertainment Bollywood Hate Story 3 Also Read Kick 2 sooner than expected Sonam Kapoor dazzles Cannes red carpet in black Elie Saab gown Lea Michele dating former gigolo?
