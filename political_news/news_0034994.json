Biden shuts door on any candidacy \nIn his first TV interview since announcing he will not run for president, Vice President Joe Biden tells CBS's ‘60 Minutes’ about the reports ahead of his announcement and how his son's death affected his decision. The 72-year-old politician isn't leaving the door open for any further speculation. More \nIn an interview with CBS News that aired Monday, Biden said he didn't offer a definitive public stance before the 2011 mission in Pakistan to take out the terror leader. \nBut he suggested that afterward he told Obama privately to go for the raid -- and kept his advice secret to avoid appearing to take credit for the decision. \nPreviously, both Biden and Obama have suggested the vice president opposed the raid. Biden said in the interview those previous accounts didn't capture the whole story. \nHe said he avoided giving a \"go\" or \"don't go\" opinion in a meeting of Obama's top advisers ahead of the raid, but later told Obama to \"follow your instincts\" in a private conversation at the White House. \nLast week Biden told an audience that he did counsel Obama to go forward with the raid during that one-on-one session. \n\"As we walked out of the room and walked upstairs, I said, I told him my opinion that I thought he should go but to follow his own instinct,\" he said on October 20. \nBiden made those remarks as he was still deciding whether to mount a presidential bid. He said the next day he was sitting the 2016 race out. \nIn the CBS interview, Biden said a full accounting of his role in the bin Laden decision-making had never been aired before last week, leading to accusations he had altered his story. \n\"Everything I said was completely accurate,\" he said. \"I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story.\" \nHe said he hadn't disclosed his private advice to Obama to avoid any appearance he was boasting. \n\"Barack Obama made that decision knowing if it was wrong, his career was over. I wanted the public to know this is a man with a backbone of steel,\" he said. \"That's why I said it. And had I said, but, by the way, when I went up privately I told him to go, it would look like I was self-aggrandizing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:04:41.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
