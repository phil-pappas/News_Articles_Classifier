Under Jim Murphy, he served as the then-Scottish Labour leader's parliamentary liaison and link with the Trade Unions.\nHe has largely avoided controversy during his time at Holyrood, having consistently made the lowest expenses claims of Glasgow's 15 MSPs. However, he faced calls to resign in 2013 after he was pictured taking part in a trade union protest outside the home of an Ineos director during Unite's bitter dispute with the owner of the Grangemouth complex. Mr Smith was pictured standing alongside a giant inflatable rat at the protest, but many condemned the union's tactics of targeting homes as being designed to intimidate company bosses.\nPromoted stories In a statement, he said: \"It has been an enormous privilege to serve as an MSP for Glasgow over the last four and a half years. For me, being an elected representative has been a privilege more than a personal ambition.\n\"It goes almost without saying that it's been an exciting and challenging time in Scottish politics, representing Glasgow has been my highlight, but I am grateful for the other opportunities I have had too, particularly serving as Chair of the Trades Union Group of Labour MSPs since 2011 and especially to have had a small part in the campaign for equal marriage which was won in this Parliament.\nShare article \"I am thankful first of all to my brilliant staff team as well as to many party members, parliamentary colleagues and former parliamentarians for their support and the encouragement that I have had, including from friends in other parties. I'm looking forward to finding new challenges in 2016 with real gratitude for the privilege and opportunity which I have had.\n\"My office team and I will continue to do our very best for the remainder of the term, and I will continue to support my friend, Kez Dugdale, as she leads the campaign for a strong team of Labour MSPs in the next Parliament. I will do everything I can to fully support her and her plan to renew the Scottish Labour Party.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:27:04.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
