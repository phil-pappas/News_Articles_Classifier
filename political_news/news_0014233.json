Virgin Mobile RE*Generation was created to give Members and Canadians a chance to help at-risk and homeless youth gain skills to get jobs. Currently, there are approximately 225,000 Canadian youth out of work or not in school, and more than 6,000 of them sleep on the streets on any given night. Donations to Virgin Mobile RE*Generation, through programs like the RE*Generation phone campaign, support charities across Canada that train youth to develop the in-demand skills employers are looking for.\n\"By providing young people with the experience and training they need to get a stable and meaningful job, we can help break the cycle of youth homelessness,\" said Joseph Ottorino , managing director, Virgin Mobile Canada. \"We're excited to be partnering with Samsung, a company that shares our passion for linking youth with the skills, connections and opportunities they need to succeed.\"\nCanadians can purchase the RE*Generation phone at Virgin Mobile retail and online locations. The Universal Power Bank ($24.99) is available at Virgin Mobile Stores across Canada .
