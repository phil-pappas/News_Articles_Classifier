The area comprises 1.1 million acres, and is located in the Cohansey Aquifer which holds an incredible 1 trillion gallons of pure water. \nThe Pinelands Protection Act acknowledged different management areas of the Pine Barrens, and allows farming, cluster housing, in most acreage, with strict environmental standards to protect the aquifer. Several thousand acres are permanently protected from development. It is through this protected area that the proposed pipeline will travel. \nThe Act is clear, and no permission should be granted. In fact, last year the Pinelands Commission, an independent agency charged with protecting the Pinelands, voted no. \nBut this year, the executive director of the Pinelands Commission unilaterally issued a decision without a vote, stating that the pipeline had such a unique value to its residents, no vote was necessary. There is no unique value to the residents, and other routes can be planned. \nThe league urges residents to contact the Board of Public Utilities, which will have the final say on this pipeline, to object permitting the pipeline along this route, until a vote of the entire council is taken and proof of the unique value as well as proof that this is the only route possible. \nContact the BPU at www.state.nj.bpu, 800-624-0241, or 44 S. Clinton Ave. Trenton NJ 08625. \nJeanne K.
