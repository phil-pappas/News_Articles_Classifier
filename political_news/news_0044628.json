The graffiti, first spotted early Wednesday morning, has since been painted over. \nRabbi Kaplan said his synagogue is the most prominently placed of any in Portland, making it an easy target. \nPolice came to the scene and filed a report, according to Kaplan. Sergeant Pete Simpson, a spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said there are currently no suspects or reports of similar incidents. \nIn February 1989, anti-Jewish slogans were sprayed in red paint on the exterior walls of this synagogue, as well as Congregation Neveh Shalom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:08:56.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
