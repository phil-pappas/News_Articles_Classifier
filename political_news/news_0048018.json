Jim Webb speaks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines in August. Charlie Riedel/AP hide caption\ni toggle caption Charlie Riedel/AP Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb speaks at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines in August.\nCharlie Riedel/AP Jim Webb ended his Democratic campaign for president on Tuesday, leaving open the possibility he could still run as an independent.\nDecrying how far both parties had moved from the center, the former Virginia senator acknowledged that there was no path forward for him in the current 2016 field.\n\"I fully accept that my views on many issues are not compatible with the power structure and base of the Democratic Party,\" Webb said in an afternoon press conference at the National Press Club. \"For this reason I am withdrawing from any consideration of being the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidency.\"\nSaying he is still considering an independent run though — for which he said he was confident he could get more support than he did in his quest for the Democratic nomination — Webb pointed to an increasingly disillusioned middle in the country.\n\"Poll after poll shows that a strong plurality of Americans is neither Republican nor Democrat. Overwhelmingly they're independents,\" Webb said. \"Our political candidates are being pulled to the extremes. They are increasingly out of step with the people they are supposed to serve.\"\nAs a Democrat though, Webb never caught fire in the primary, running a shoestring campaign that was unable to compete with higher-profile candidates like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In last week's debate, Webb spent much of his time complaining he wasn't getting enough time (something lampooned this past weekend by actor Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live ).\nWebb's efforts at a White House run were, at best, meager. He only made nine trips to Iowa, one to New Hampshire and three to South Carolina, according to the National Journal. Last quarter, Webb raised less than $700,000 and was averaging about 1 percent in national polling.\nThe moderate Democrat, and former Republican who served as Navy secretary under Ronald Reagan, was increasingly out of step with the national party. That was clearly on display in last week's debate. He's more conservative than other Democrats on gun rights, environmental issues and affirmative action.\nPositions like that, and his background as a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, helped him to win in Virginia, now a swing state that was more conservative a decade ago. He rode anti-war sentiment and the backlash to George W. Bush's Iraq policy to a narrow victory in 2006, helping give Democrats a Senate majority.\nBut Webb often seemed disillusioned with Congress, and in 2010 announced he wouldn't seek a second term. He had remained mostly out of the political spotlight since until he announced late last year he was forming an exploratory committee for president; he made his bid official in July.\nWebb did bring military experience to the Democratic slate, and was the only combat veteran running in either party. A graduate of the Naval Academy, Webb was rifle platoon commander during the Vietnam War and was awarded the Navy Cross, the Silver Star Medal, two Bronze Star Medals and two Purple Hearts.\nIn addition to his later service in the Defense Department, Webb was also an accomplished journalist and novelist. He won an Emmy in 1983 for a report on the Lebanese civil war for the PBS NewsHour and had also written 10 books.\nWebb isn't completely out of the 2016 mix just yet. He said he is still considering an independent bid for president.\n\"How I remain as a voice will depend on the kind of support I'm shown,\" said Webb. \"Though I'm not going away, I'm thinking about all my options.\"\nThat would be an uphill climb for the underfunded former one-term senator. Raising money to fuel of run is only half of the problem; getting on the ballot in all 50 states would be an expensive proposition.\nHe should not be completely discounted, however — Webb's home state is Virginia. The swing state has been especially crucial in recent presidential elections, and if he peels off even a small percentage of the vote, that could be a problem for Democrats.\nAs for whether Webb still considers himself a Democrat, Webb paused and told a reporter, \"We'll think about that.\"\n2016 Presidential Race Vietnam War Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Democrats Jim Webb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:25:34.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
