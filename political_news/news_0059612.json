He was 86. \nEcker, who was born outside of Uniontown in 1928, returned to Carroll County in 2000 as interim superintendent following the retirement of former superintendent William Hyde under a cloud of controversy following a grand jury investigation on school construction funds. \nAfter two years as interim superintendent, Ecker was appointed to two four-year terms as superintendent, before announcing his retirement following the 2009-2010 school year. \nAt the time of his retirement, employees within Carroll County Public Schools said Ecker's integrity and effort to treat everyone equally created a lasting impact; sentiments that were echoed upon learning of his passing Thursday. \nCynthia Foley, who served as president of the Carroll County Board of Education while Ecker was superintendent, said he brought \"dignity and respect back to the school system after a time when it had been lost.\" \nFormer Carroll County Public Schools Superintendent and Howard County Executive Charles Issac \"Chuck\" Ecker has died. He was 86. \n\"I loved the man; what he did for the Carroll County public school system was amazing,\" she said. \nJim Doolan, the current president of the Carroll County school board, described Ecker as very vibrant, positive and outgoing. \n\"He was an icon for education in Maryland,\" Doolan said. \"He was always looking for ways to make improvements and make things better.\" \nDoolan first met Ecker in the 1970s when he was a pupil personnel worker for the Howard County Public School System, and Ecker was associate superintendent. They worked together again at Carroll County Public Schools when Ecker became superintendent in 2000. Charles Ecker \n\"He was a remarkable man who was respected and loved around the state,\" Doolan said. \nEcker's positivity made him a great mentor and the \"ultimate leader,\" said Jimmie Saylor, director of human resources at Carroll County Public Schools, who also worked in human resources in Howard County during Ecker's tenure as county executive there. \nBut Saylor said Ecker also knew how to have a fun. For example, she said, Ecker had a neck tie for every season, and sometimes it would play music. \n\"It broke the ice with the students when he visited the schools,\" Saylor said. \"The students loved to see him coming. He was just a wonderful person and a great leader for our school system.\" \nSteve Johnson, assistant superintendent of curriculum for Carroll County Public Schools, who worked with Ecker from 2000-2010 as director of curriculum and instruction, principal of Northwest Middle and in his current role, noted that Ecker also found time to serve on many charity boards. \nEcker served on boards for the Arc of Howard County, the University of Maryland Shock Trauma and the Council on Economic Education in Maryland, among others, and was a member of the NAACP. \nJohnson said if there is one lesson he took from knowing Ecker, it was the importance of doing things to help others. \n\"I just cannot say enough about the quality of person Dr. Ecker was,\" Johnson said. \"I've never seen a man with so much energy; it was all directed at doing things to help other people.\" \nEcker graduated from Westminster High School in 1945 and joined the Navy within the year. While Ecker served time in the military along with many other young men in his generation, his desire was to become a teacher. After serving in the military for two years, he enrolled in Western Maryland College, now McDaniel College, and graduated in 1951. \nEcker's first teaching job was at Taneytown Junior/Senior High School. He later taught physical education at North Carroll High School. \nEcker was promoted to the school system's central office as a supervisor of transportation and physical education in 1960. \nHis influence spread quickly beyond his job titles and brought many significant changes to the school system. He was part of the committee in the 1960s that started the Carroll County Outdoor School at the original location in River Valley Ranch. \nEcker also is believed to be the first person in the state to implement late arrival and early dismissal for inclement weather days. Ecker started the practice one winter day by calling the radio stations and simply telling them schools would open late. \nIn 1963, Ecker was promoted to assistant superintendent of the school system. He left in 1967 to take a position in Prince George's County Public Schools. \nEcker's career then took him to Howard County in 1974, where he served in the school system as Assistant Superintendent until 1980, Associate Superintendent for Business Management and Finance until 1987, then Deputy Superintendent until his retirement in 1989. That same year, he was selected as one of the top 100 U.S. School Administrators by American School Board Journal and Executive Educator in 1989 \nFrom 1990 to 1998, Ecker was Howard County Executive, an office that he campaigned for. \nIt was during that time that Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman, who served as chair of the Howard County Republican Central Committee from 1992 to 1997, met Ecker. \n\"He was a very, very special person... I was very fortunate to know him,\" said Kittleman, who later consulted Ecker for advice as a state senator represented District 9, which encompasses both Howard and Carroll counties. \n\"Sitting in his office now, it's really humbling. He just did some amazing things for Howard County, even if they were unpopular at the time. He did what he thought was right in the longrun and really stuck to his guns,\" Kittleman said. \nHe also ran for governor in 1998, but lost to Ellen Sauerbrey in the Republican primary. \nIn 1999, Ecker was inducted into the Carroll County Sports Hall of Fame. \nIn 2000, at the age of 71, Ecker made his return to Carroll County Public Schools as interim superintendent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:11:22.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
