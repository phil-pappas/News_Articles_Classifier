Carson also referred to the big bang theory as \"ridiculous\" and a \"fairy tale\" created by \"high-falutin scientists. \" \nIn most developed countries this brand of anti-science would disqualify a candidate from office. However in the US Carson’s views likely account for some of his success. A 2014 Gallup poll showed that 42 percent of Americans believe in a creationist view of human origins -- that’s four in 10 who think God created humans in their present form no more than 10,000 years ago. \n“They’re all creationists, which really is disgraceful,\" said Dawkins. \"The fact that one of the two major political parties, every single candidate except one says they don’t believe in evolution, they don’t even believe in the fundamental principle of biology, which is a fact.” \nRepublican presidential candidate Dr Ben Carson speaks at a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington \nWhen asked what would change his mind about the God, Dawkins said: “Just show me some evidence and I’ll change.” \nHoping to direct some of Dawkins' ire away from Christians, Colmes asked if one religious culture was “sicker” than the others. \n“I don’t think it’s unfair to say that, if we’re looking for the maximum toxicity in religions in the world, it’s got to be Islam,” replied the professor. “It’s partly that they are taught to believe that the Koran is literally true. The Bible itself is as toxic as the Koran, but most Christians are not taught to believe it literally.” Related on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:51:49.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
