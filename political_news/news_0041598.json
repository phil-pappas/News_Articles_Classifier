The former president is slated to headline several fundraisers before the end of the month to help fill his wife’s campaign coffers, according to a recent campaign email.\nClinton is kicking off the dollar dash with a trio of events in Maryland on Monday, including back-to-back fundraisers hosted by Pennie and Gary Abramson and then Mehul Sanghani. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Maryland state Sen. Thomas Mike Miller are co-hosting a reception later that day with Clinton.\nThe event invites ask for contributions of $1,000 per person to be a “friend” and $2,700 per person to be a “champion” of Hillary Clinton. Co-hosts are slotted to raise $10,000, which includes a photo with the former president. Hosts commit to raise $27,000 and enroll in the \"Hillstarter” program; they also get a photo with Clinton.\nThe Maryland push follows fundraisers in Hartford, Conn., and Philadelphia.\nBill Clinton isn’t the only one hitting the fundraising trail for the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate.\nSurrogates are also getting in on the action. Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, foreign policy adviser Laura Rosenberger and former Undersecretary of Defense Michele Flournoy are holding an event Friday in McLean, Va.\nMaryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are also headlining separate donor events billed as “conversations.” Former Ambassador Phil Murphy is holding a similar event in Frankfurt, Germany.\nThe events are in addition to fundraisers Hillary Clinton has planned in Birmingham, Ala., and Chicago and Evanston, Ill., over the next two weeks.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:25:08.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
