Life science professions include fields such as biology and environmental science, where the proportion of women jumped from 22 percent in 1991 up to 44 percent in 2013. \nThe report also highlights that women are now just as likely as men to have qualifications in the area of natural and physical sciences. In 2013, this was the only field of study that had no high-level sex segregation – this field includes most sciences such as biology, chemistry, earth science, and mathematics. \n“An even representation of men (51 percent) and women (49 percent) were qualified in natural and physical science. The proportion of women in this field is even higher for women aged 20–29 years,” labour and income statistics manager Mark Gordon said. \n“Given that today is World Statistics Day, it’s timely to see that in 2013 women were almost equally represented among mathematicians, statisticians, and related professionals – 47 percent were women,” Mr Gordon said. \nThe report also shows that the majority of employment growth in the higher-skilled occupations between 1991 and 2013 was for women. They are steadily increasing their representation in managerial and professional roles. \n“Female professionals outnumbered male professionals, increasing their representation from 54 percent in 1991 to 58 percent in 2013,” Mr Gordon said. \nWomen were still most heavily represented in clerical occupations, where they made up over three-quarters of all clerical workers in 2013. They were also over-represented in sales and service occupations and under-represented in all major areas of manual work – particularly in the skilled trades where they made up just 5 percent of the workforce in 2013. \nWomen at work: 1991–2013 uses data from the last 20 years to look at trends in occupational segregation – the clustering of female and male workers in particular occupations. \nThe report is part of Statistics NZ’s World Statistics Day Better Data – Better Lives celebrations. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:22:29.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
