In 2002, the then candidate Atta Mills of the NDC went into a tie with the then candidate John Kufuor of the NPP. The same fate repeated itself in 2008 among the same candidates. \nHistory Ghana's first Presidential and Parliamentary elections in 1992 were held on separate days in November and December respectively. \nFollowing a boycott of the December 1992 Parliamentary elections by the main opposition party, the New Patriotic Party, under allegations of malpractices in the presidential, there was a decision to hold both elections on the same day so as to be able to prevent a similar boycott in the future. \nThe move was also to help cut down cost.The 1996 Presidential and Parliamentary elections and all similar subsequent elections have been held on December 7, but there have been arguments that the process does not make ample room for the organization of a run-off and the subsequent handover on January 7. \nSource: Starrfmonline.com Politics Follow Us If a man takes money from someone to vote for the one,he(the money taker)will pay the money back.
