Ginther. Both candidates are Democrats, but only Ginther has been endorsed by the county party. \n\nNear the end of the ad, Pastor Frederick LaMarr, of the Family Missionary Baptist Church on the South Side, says: \n\n“Zach Scott is an endorsed Democrat supported by Democratic leaders, unions, businesses and us.” \n\nElder Michael D. Reeves, of the Corinthian Missionary Baptist Church on the East Side, is also in the ad. \n\nBill Anthony, chairman of the county party, said LaMarr’s statement implies to voters that Scott is the party’s endorsed candidate. Anthony said the ad needs to be taken off the air. \n\n“It’s a shame that Zach Scott has resorted to misleading the African American community by having a former office holder claim that he is an endorsed Democrat,” Anthony said in a prepared news release. “There are no Democratic organizations that have endorsed him, so this is an outright lie.” \n\nTracy Maxwell Heard, Scott’s campaign manager, said Anthony’s demand has no merit. \n\n“There is nothing in the ad that is false or misleading,” she said. “Zach is a Democrat and Zach is endorsed. It never says he is the endorsed candidate of a party or the endorsed candidate of the Franklin County Democratic Party.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:34:37.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
