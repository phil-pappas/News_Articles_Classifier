Palestine's President Mahmoud Abbas addresses the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday.\nBy Teresa Welsh Sept. 30, 2015 | 2:05 p.m. EDT + More UNITED NATIONS – Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Wednesday that the Palestinians are no longer obligated to abide by accord it signed with Israel because that country has continuously violated its agreements.\nSpeaking to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Abbas said Palestinians should not be bound by the Oslo Accord, which serves as the basis for negotiations toward a two-state solution.\nRELATED\nPalestinians Want Vote in U.N. on Middle East Peace Timeline “We declare that as long as Israel refuses to commit to the agreements signed with us, which render us an authority without real powers, and as long as Israel refuses to cease settlement activities and to release of the fourth group of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with our agreements, they leave us no choice but to insist that we will not remain the only ones committed to the implementation of these agreements, while Israel continuously violates them,” Abbas said. “We, therefore, declare that we cannot continue to be bound by these agreements and that Israel must assume all of its responsibilities as an occupying power, because the status quo cannot continue.”\nIt’s unclear what practical effect the statement will have on the situation on the ground in Israel, although the rhetoric will significantly escalate already-heightened tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Several isolated incidents have occurred in recent holiday weeks over a holy site in Jerusalem, but violence so far has not risen to a level requiring coordinated government response. Last summer, tit-for-tat attacks between Israelis and Palestinians culminated in a full-fledged war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, killing over 2,000 people.\nAbbas’ remarks come as a growing number of countries have recognized Palestinian statehood, and even U.S. allies in Europe have expressed frustration with the lack of progress toward a negotiated political settlement. The Palestinian leader has increasingly agitated for the United Nations to take a greater role in forcing a solution and threatened to join the International Criminal Court in a bid to hold Israel accountable for what Palestinians describe as war crimes.\nIn his speech, Abbas said Israel had intensified its settlement activities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem by 60 percent, a violation of the agreement signed in 1993. It was reached between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and then-President Bill Clinton. Abbas said the current situation is “unsustainable,” but that “my hands remain outstretched for the just peace that will guarantee my people's fights.”\nRELATED\nNetanyahu's Win Could Be Positive for Palestinians\nSecretary of State John Kerry pushed for a resolution to the ongoing conflict after he took his post as the Obama administration’s chief diplomat, but the issue quickly took a backseat to the global fight against the Islamic State group. In addition to waning international bandwidth for the issue, Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have little political will to reach a two-state solution.\nAfter gaining observer status to the U.N. in 2012, the Palestinians have increasingly turned to the international body in recent months to spur action on the stalled peace process. The last round of formal agreements collapsed in April 2013 and have shown no signs of resuming. In late 2014, the Palestinians attempted to pass a resolution in the U.N. that would guide parameters for a future peace process, but it was opposed by the U.S. and was not adopted.\nNetanyahu is set to address the body Thursday.\nTAGS: Abbas, Mahmoud Palestine Israel Middle East Mideast peace", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Says%20Palestinians%20No%20Longer%20Bound%20By%20Accord%20With%20Israel", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Says%20Palestinians%20No%20Longer%20Bound%20By%20Accord%20With%20Israel", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Mahmoud%20Abbas%20Says%20Palestinians%20No%20Longer%20Bound%20By%20Accord%20With%20Israel&summary=The%20Palestinian%20Authority%20president%20told%20the%20United%20Nations%20that%20Israel%20has%20failed%20to%20honor%20its%20obligations%20to%20pursue%20a%20two-state%20solution.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrkyj%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:02:20.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
