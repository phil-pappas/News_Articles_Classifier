Opportunity Scholarship program, which provides low-income families with vouchers to attend private schools. \n\"It is the only program in America where the federal government allows low-income families to choose the schools that are best for their kids,\" Boehner said in a video released Saturday. \"The program has truly made a difference.\"\n\nPlay Video Face The Nation Rep. John Boehner wants to be remembered as “a good man” House Speaker John Boehner says in the wake of his resignation announcement, he’d like to be remembered as a “good man” by his colleagues and fri... \nThe retiring House speaker is a longtime proponent of the program, first started in 2003, which grants federal funds to Washington, D.C. residents for tuition at private and parochial schools. His latest bill extending the scholarship program, which the House voted to reauthorize earlier this week, allocates $60 million to the vouchers over the next five years. \nIn his last weekly GOP address before leaving Congress, Boehner touted the program's record of elevated graduation rates. Nine in 10 high school seniors in the program graduate, according to the Ohio Republican -- higher than the city's average. \n\"These are the kind of results parents dream of for their kids,\" Boehner said. \nBut according to a 2010 Department of Education study, though children did graduate from high school at higher rates under the program, they did not necessarily perform better in standardized tests. \nThe Obama administration has a record of opposing the vouchers , arguing that the program has not yielded satisfactory results and that the funding should go to public schools rather than to the top few students. \n\"Instead of using federal resources to support a handful of students in private schools, the federal government should focus its attention and available resources on improving the quality of public schools for all students,\" the White House said early this week.\nLocal Democratic leaders have also raised concerns that the bill infringes on the self-governance of the District. \nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's non-voting House representative, said Wednesday that the program, for Boehner, was only ever \"a capstone to his own political career. The D.C. voucher program is his pet project, not D.C.'s.\" \nBoehner fired back at his opponents, saying that \"the unions and the education establishment in our country see school choice as a threat.\" \n\"To me, that's just fundamentally unfair,\" he continued. \"Your zip code shouldn't decide your fate. Education can and should be the great equalizer -- lifting up kids who would otherwise slip through the cracks.\"\nThe District of Columbia is the only city in the country that receives federal funds allowing students to attend private or parochial schools. \nIn a separate address, President Obama slammed Congressional Republicans for expiring the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses royalties from gas and oil projects for conservation initiatives. \n\"For more than half a century, this fund has protected more than 5 million acres of land - from playgrounds to parks to priceless landscapes - all without costing taxpayers a dime,\" Mr. Obama said in a video out Saturday. \"Nearly every single county in America has benefited from this program.\" \nThe president added that, especially with the its bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, \"Republicans in Congress should reauthorize and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund without delay.\" \nHe invoked Pope Francis, who visited Capitol Hill last month , adding that \"this planet is a gift from God -- and our common home. We should leave it to our kids in better shape than we found it.\"\nCongressional Republicans sunset the funds at the beginning of October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:10:17.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
