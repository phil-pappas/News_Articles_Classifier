But Biden let it be known that the ad hit too close to home.\nThe new ad instead uses archival audio of Biden campaigning for President Barack Obama and touting the importance and dignity of jobs.\nBiden has been considering a 2016 run for months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:51:20.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
