The investigation has been directed at Abhisit Vejjajiva, the prime minister at the time, his then deputy Suthep Thaugsuban and a then director of the Centre for Resolutions of Emergency Situation. They are alleged to have been responsible for the crackdown order being issued. NACC commissioner Vicha Mahakhun said all the witnesses in the probe had testified and the anti-graft agency was now only waiting for additional documents from the Department of Special Investigation. NACC chair Panthep Klanarongran said the investigating fact-finding committee would submit its report for the principal NACC committee to determine if any wrongdoing took place. 226 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:53:04.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
