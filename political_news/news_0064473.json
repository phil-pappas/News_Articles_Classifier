Videos Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \n[Previous story] \nJim Webb will end his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination at a press conference Tuesday, according to two sources with knowledge of the decision. \nThe former Virginia senator who launched a longshot presidential bid earlier this year is considering an independent run, according to his campaign. Craig Crawford, Webb's spokesman, declined to comment on whether the senator was dropping out of the Democratic race, however. \n\"Jim will have the first word at 1 p.m.,\" Crawford said, referring to the senator's press conference at the National Press Club in Washington. \nAfter a prolonged exploration of a presidential bid, Webb used a more than 2,000-word blog post to announce his run. \nHis campaign, however, never really got off the ground and was seen by even some close Webb aides as more of a vanity play than an actual presidential bid. In total, Webb spent four days campaigning in New Hampshire and 20 days in Iowa, far fewer than the senator's challengers. \nWebb also expressed outright frustration with the Democratic Party during his run, questioning their strategy and the support they were providing him. During the first Democratic debate earlier this month, Webb spent considerable time complaining about the amount of time he was given to speak. \nMudcat Saunders, Webb's close friend and informal adviser, says he last spoke with Webb this weekend but the senator never said he planned to drop out of the Democratic contest. \n\"We were just b----ing about the way our party has moved. They have given up on the South, they have given up on the heartland, on rural America,\" Saunders said, expressing both his and Webb's view. \"It is a math game and the math is not going to work. It might work once and it might work twice. We just don't like the Democratic Party's strategy.\" \nHe added, \"I feel confident that Jim would say that same thing. Just to take a whole group of people and throw them out of the equation is wrong. That is what the party has done throughout small towns and rural America.\" \nWebb's exit leaves four contenders for the party's nomination still in the race: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. \nVice President Joe Biden has been considering a possible bid behind the scenes, according to aides, but has yet to declare his intentions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:36:01.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
