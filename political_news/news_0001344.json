And while it is less than the $45 million Clinton's campaign raised in the second quarter, it appears the campaign is likely to reach it's $100 million goal by the end of 2015.\nSanders' fundraising is closing in on Clinton, however, despite only ever headlining seven fundraisers as a candidate. Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman, said Wednesday night that the campaign has $25 million cash-on-hand after raising $15 million in the second quarter.\nClinton and Sanders raised their money in very different ways.\nA bulk of Clinton's haul came from events she personally headlined across the country, a labor intensive process for the candidate that has required her to spend considerable amounts of time on the fundraising trail.\nClinton personally headlined 58 fundraisers from July 1 to September 30, a pace identical to the 58 fundraisers she headlined in the second quarter. In the last week she has personally headlined over dozen events.\nAnd based on CNN's analysis of figures provided by the Clinton campaign, the 2016 candidate likely raised well above $22 million at the events she personally headlined.\nSanders, on the other hand, rarely personally headlines fundraisers. At an event earlier this summer in Seattle, the candidate joked that he was a little uncomfortable speaking at a packed bar where people paid to see him.\nAlmost all of Sanders' haul came from the campaign's sizable online fundraising operation. Briggs said the campaign has received 1.3 million donations from 650,000 donors since launching earlier this year.\nWhat's more, since most of Clinton's fundraisers asked donors to pay $2,700 -- the primary campaign maximum -- many of Clinton's donors are likely maxed out. Sanders average campaign donation was $24.86, meaning the candidate can go back to many of his supporters again and again.\n\"We are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country, helping us raise a record $75 million in the first two quarters,\" Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement.\nAfter releasing their fundraising haul on Wednesday night, hours before the quarter officially closed, Clinton aides touted their number as the largest off-year third quarter haul by a non-incumbent.\nClinton aides said Wednesday that 93% of their third-quarter donations were $100 or less.\nFundraising totals are both practically and symbolically important. Money is the lifeblood of any presidential operations, but campaigns quarterly fundraising hauls are regularly used to show signs of strength and weakness.\nAnd for Clinton's campaign, a sizable and expensive operation, quarterly fundraising is even more significant. Clinton's campaign spent 40% of the money it raised in the second quarter.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:56:43.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
