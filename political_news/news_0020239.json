If I am wrong, tell me that but don’t insult me because I will not insult anyone one. You can agree to disagree without descending into abuse.” \nThe daughter of former President John Jerry Rawlings said, being the first female to contest the Korle Klottey NDC seat, she is very optimistic of wining the primaries. \n“I will urge all women in the constituency to come together for a course.
