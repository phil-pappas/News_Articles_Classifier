DAILY GUIDE learnt that he died yesterday morning after battling with an ailment for some months now. \nInitial reports were that Mr Gyetuah died at a hospital in the constituency. \nHowever, DAILY GUIDE later gathered that he passed on to glory at his residence. The wife of the late MP, Veronica Gyetuah, told Adom Fm that the MP was found unconscious in the morning when the family went to call him for breakfast. \n'We had finished serving and we went to call him to come for food…that was when we realised he had fallen unconscious so we rushed him to the hospital…and he was confirmed dead…,' the wife said while weeping on Adom Fm . \nShe continued that Mr Gyetuah was encouraged to sleep for a while when his driver, whom he (Gyetuah) was set to go for a walk with in the morning, discovered that he (MP) didn't look healthy. \nMr Gyetuah entered Parliament in 2004 and was a minister of state during President John Atta Mills' tenure as president. \nThe Amenfi West MP was in 2008 involved in a fatal accident near Tarkwa in the Western Region that claimed the life of his driver. \nHe has been unwell for some time now and looked very frail anytime he attended parliamentary proceedings. \nDespite his ill health, he filed his nomination to contest the upcoming parliamentary primaries of the NDC. \nHe was seeking re-election to represent his people in Parliament and was among those vetted by the party recently. \nMr Gyetuah, a teacher by profession, left behind seven children and a wife. \nHe was a member of the Committees on Members Holding Offices of Profit and Roads and Transport. \nHe held a BA (Sociology) from the University of Cape Coast and EMGL from GIMPA. \nFrom Thomas Fosu, Jnr &Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:26.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
