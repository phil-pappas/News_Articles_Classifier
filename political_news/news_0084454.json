Starbucks has the answer to all of your problems. Well, all of the ones pertaining to a caffeine deficiency. \nThe coffee giant is finally testing a delivery service that many customers have been clamoring over for years. \nPicture that: coffee delivered right to your desk. \nStarbucks said on Tuesday it would pilot its “Green Apron Delivery” service at New York City’s iconic Empire State Building — a skyscraper that’s responsible for holding 12,000 workers on a daily basis — offering Starbucks the density it needs to make the service work logistically, financially and some buzz given the building’s historic aura. \nThe coffee company had said in the spring that it would test delivery in New York in the latter half of 2015, as part of a plan to spur growth to eventually be worth $100 billion one day. At the time, Starbucks’ market cap was $75 billion, and is already up to $90 billion in just six months. \nAs it pertains to workers at the Empire State Building, they can place orders from a limited drink and food menu via a specific Starbucks website. Orders are capped at 15 items and a $2 delivery charge. Delivery from a green apron-clad barista occurs within 30 minutes of an order. \n“I cannot think of a better location to launch one of the most frequently requested services,” said Cliff Burrows, Starbucks group president, U.S. and Americas in a statement. \nStarbucks previously announced plans to allow customers to order via their mobile app and get on-demand delivery in certain areas, a strategy that will pilot in Seattle in the second half of 2015 in the coming weeks. \nThese are just the latest efforts by the coffee chain to provide customers with more options and a on-the-go coffee experience. Last month, Starbucks rolled out a new mobile feature to 7,400 stores nationwide that let customers place their order and pay for it on their phones, then just arrive at the store to pick up their purchase when the order is ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:10:04.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
