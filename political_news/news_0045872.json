That is guaranteed,\" Kejriwal said. \nClaiming that \"jungle raj\" was prevailing in the capital, Kejriwal urged Modi not to remain \"stubborn\" and hand over law and order control to city government for at least one year, a demand he had made yesterday as well. \n\"The Prime Minister must understand that I am not (previous Chief Minister) Sheila Dikshit. I will not remain silent,\" he said. Dikshit had yesterday accused Kejriwal of indulging in blame game. \nWithout giving details, the Chief Minister said his government was exploring all options to ensure safety of women and improve overall law and order situation. Sources said Delhi Government was contemplating approaching the Supreme Court \"to fix accountability\" of the Delhi Police.

Around 31,000 cases of crime against women were recorded. \nOut of these, chargesheets were filed in only 13,000 cases. In 18,000 cases, there was no charge sheet. \nOnly 146 people were punished overall. So you can see how safe our women are,\" the Chief Minister said. \nBJP attacked Kejriwal over his jungle raj comments, saying his outburst on the city's security scenario was a mere \"political skulduggery\". \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:21:06.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
