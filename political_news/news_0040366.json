(Photo: KUSA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDENVER – In less than two weeks, Colorado voters will decide whether the state can keep about $66 million in marijuana tax revenue or they'll have to refund it to taxpayers. \nProposition BB, up for approval next month, would allow the state to retain and spend $66.1 million in excess pot tax revenue. \nGov. John Hickenlooper cast his vote in support of Proposition BB on Thursday. He said passing the proposition would help education and regulation efforts. \nIf the measure is passed, state officials said $40 million would go to school construction and $12 million would fund marijuana education. \nThe remaining chunk of marijuana tax revenue has yet to be allocated. \n\"All the pot revenue that comes in -- our goal is to regulate marijuana, to make sure our kids don't get access to marijuana and, as the voters originally intended, that we build buildings to improve our K-12 education,\" Hickenlooper said. \nOpponents to the measure have called it a tax hike. They say approving it would mean Coloradans would take home less money. \nIf the proposition fails, $25 million would be refunded to tax payers, amounting about a $6 to $8 refund for most Coloradans. \nAs for the rest of the money, $24 million would go to marijuana cultivators and $17 million would be refunded to marijuana purchasers through a temporary sales tax reduction. \n(© 2015 KUSA) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LPZNs5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:52:32.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
