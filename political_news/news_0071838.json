You’d do that?\" \nMr Little responded with this \"yes. We will. It comes down to this in the end - that the fundamental moral obligation of every government is to act in the best interest of its citizens.\" \nFull interview here http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/tpp-done-deal-labour-responds-video-6400126 \nQ+A, 9-10am Sundays on TV ONE and one hour later on TV ONE plus 1.
