Wayne Simmo ns, a 62-year-old who lives in Annapolis, Maryland, was arrested by federal authorities following his indictment by a federal grand jury for allegedly committing major fraud, wire fraud, and making false statements to the government. Simmons claims to have worked for the CIA from 1973 to 2000, and \"used that false claim in an attempt to obtain government security clearances and work as a defense contractor, including at one point successfully getting deployed overseas as an intelligence advisor to senior military personnel,\" according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. In court documents, federal prosecutors alleged that Simmons had a \"significant criminal history, including convictions for a crime of violence and firearms offenses, and is believed to have had an ongoing association with firearms notwithstanding those felony convictions.\" They successfully petitioned a judge to keep Simmons' indictment sealed until his arrest today, noting that Simmons \"has a history of acting in an aggressive manner, and is likely aware of the imminent nature of the charges in this case.\" roflmao", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:43:53.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
