In the interests of her constituents and her party she thought it best if she voluntarily withdrew from the party whip.\n\"There was no requirement for her to do so, even though she knew it would automatically lead to her suspension from the party. She did so in order to clear her name and return as quickly as possible to the front line politics.\nPromoted stories \"To that purpose we have contacted Police Scotland at Mrs Thomson’s request advising them of her wish to assist with their investigation if or when they wish to speak to her.\"\nPolice Scotland launched an investigation on the directions of the Crown Office, after Ms Thomson's solicitor, Christopher Hales, was struck off for professional misconduct following by the Scottish Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal (SSDT).\nMs Thomson built a property portfolio often by purchasing homes at below their market value from people in financial distress. All 13 of the deals examined by the SSDT were closely related to Ms Thomson, with the ruling stating Mr Hales \"must have been aware that there was a possibility he was facilitating mortgage fraud, whether or not this occurred\". Police sources have stressed that Ms Thomson is not under investigation personally at this stage.\nMr Anwar's statement added: \"In the meantime we would strongly advise those who should know better, to tread extremely carefully and not prejudice a live investigation.\nShare article \"We have in the meantime advised Mrs Thomson that it is important that no further comment is made on these matters until the investigation is concluded.\n\"The last week has been an extremely difficult one and Michelle is grateful for all the messages of support. She maintains her commitment to the ideals of the SNP and will continue to work on behalf of her constituents.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-01T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:55:26.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
