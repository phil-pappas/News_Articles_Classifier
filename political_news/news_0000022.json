Bobby Jindal's administration are headed back to federal court Oct. 16, the second time the two sides will square off on the organization's Medicaid contract.\nBut if a recent court decision in Arkansas is any indication, the Jindal administration could face some difficulty in convincing a judge the administration shouldn't be temporarily blocked from canceling Planned Parenthood's contract. Arkansas was in a very similar position as the Jindal administration, having terminated Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's contract on Aug. 14.\nAccording to court documents, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the Planned Parenthood contract was terminated because \"this organization does not represent the values of the people of our state.\" Also similar to the Louisiana case is the fact that three unnamed Planned Parenthood patients were listed as plaintiffs.\nIn the Arkansas case, The Washington Post reported U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker issued a ruling that blocked the state from terminating benefits for the three women in the case only. But that may prove to be a technicality; Planned Parenthood is now seeking class action status to expand Baker's ruling to cover all Planned Parenthood patients who are eligible for Medicaid in Arkansas, according to The Associated Press.\nPlanned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which bills the state for Medicaid reimbursement for about 5,200 patients in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, appears to have learned a lesson from the Arkansas case. The most recent filing in Louisiana was filed as a class action injunction that seeks to cover all the Medicaid patients Planned Parenthood treats in Louisiana.\nPlanned Parenthood's chapter in Alabama is seeking a similar injunction.\nAll three states moved to cut Medicaid funding for the organization after a series of videos were released over the summer depicting Planned Parenthood Federation of America discussing a fetal tissue donation program. Republicans in Congress are seeking a similar measure that would affect the organization nationwide.\nPlanned Parenthood has argued before in Louisiana that its patients have a right to choose providers, and that the state doesn't have the right to cut off funding and force those patients to go to other providers. In this case, Planned Parenthood will try to convince a federal judge that Louisiana's termination is \"highly irregular\" and the state's standards \"have not been applied to any other Medicaid provider.\"\n. . . . . .
