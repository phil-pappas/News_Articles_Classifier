The image of Ginther is revealed as words in red and white appear as a narrator speaks. \n\nScript: Narrator: “Shady contracts. FBI investigations. Ethics violations. Scandals involving Andy Ginther. \n\n“Here’s how it works. Hire lobbyist John Raphael, Ginther’s close friend who just pled guilty to extortion. And Raphael takes care of Andy...and he did. \n\n“Ginther accepted a lavish trip to OSU’s Big Ten championship game from Raphael and a government contractor complete with a party bus, luxury seats and booze. Now Ginther is under investigation by the Ohio Ethics Commission. We can’t trust Andy Ginther.” \n\nAnalysis: This is Scott’s second TV ad since the May primary. The entire piece is a political attack on Ginther and his association with lobbyist John Raphael. Scott’s name appears only in the “paid for” line at the end. \n\nThe spot starts out with a narrator talking about scandal and wrongdoing as words appear on the screen. The words “shady,” “investigations” and “violations” appear in red. As the word “ scandal” appears, so does Ginther’s face, out of a dark silhouette. \n\nThere are questions about contracts, and there is an FBI investigation into the city’s red-light-camera contract. The narrator also says “ethics violations,” but Ginther has not been charged or found guilty of any ethics violations. He, along with two other council members and a former council member are the subjects of an Ohio Ethics Commission investigation of a trip they took with lobbyist Raphael to the Big Ten Championship in December. \n\nGinther’s campaign paid $250 toward the trip, but experts say the face value of a seat in a luxury box, a bus trip, food and drink was about $750. Ginther said last week that he turned over records about the trip to the ethics commission. \n\nGinther’s campaign said the ad was another misleading attack. \n\n“Zach Scott is betting on another false ad, but Columbus voters know Andy Ginther paid his own way to cheer on the Buckeyes,” said Bryan Clark, Ginther’s campaign manager. \n\nGinther, along with Mayor Michael B. Coleman and former council president Michael C. Mentel have all turned over records to the FBI after being subpoenaed as part of an ongoing federal investigation into the city’s red-light-camera contract with Redflex. Redflex’s former CEO pleaded guilty to passing money for bribes to Columbus officials through the company’s lobbyist. \n\nRaphael was Redflex’s lobbyist. \n\nGinther has said he is not the target of an investigation and that he was vindicated when Raphael agreed to plead guilty to extorting campaign donations from Redflex, not to bribery. The U.S. Department of Justice has said Raphael’s agreement says nothing about the guilt or innocence of anyone else and that its investigation continues. \n\nIt is accurate that Raphael and Ginther are friends. The two live on the same street in Clintonville and have been friends for more than a decade. \n\nThe ad is inaccurate when it states Raphael has “pled guilty” to extortion. He has not entered a formal plea before a federal judge, but has signed paperwork that states he plans to plead guilty to a charge of extortion by threats. \n\nFederal prosecutors said Raphael extorted Redflex “on behalf of elected officials” and funneled campaign contributions from the company to elected officials through the Ohio Democratic and Franklin County Democratic parties. The timing of those donations matches a $21,000 donation that Ginther’s campaign received from the state party in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:42:56.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
