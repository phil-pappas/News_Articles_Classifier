The bill would fund the Energy Department through the end of the next fiscal year as well as the water programs under the purview of other government agencies.\n\"Although the bill supports key national security items, the bill drastically underfunds critical investments that develop American energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future,\" the formal veto threat issued by the White House reads.
