(Brian Nicholson/Associated Press) By Editorial Board October 5 at 8:01 PM YOU’VE PROBABLY seen the ominous TV ads: The Obama administration is recklessly upsetting federal regulations on ozone — a primary component of smog — that are working fine already. All the nation has to do is sit back and keep improving its air under current rules, the commercials argue. “Common sense,” a concerned narrator frets in one spot , “does it exist in our nation’s capital?”\nThe answer, thankfully, is yes. The Obama administration, for example, has enough common sense to ignore these misleading ads.\nOzone in the upper atmosphere is a good thing, blocking harmful ultraviolet rays. When pollutants from cars, power plants and other sources cause ozone to accumulate closer to the ground and human lungs, however, it can have negative health effects, particularly on people with asthma and other pulmonary problems. That’s why, under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency must reevaluate its ozone regulations every five years and update them according to current science.\nBy that measure, the Obama administration’s push to change ozone regulations isn’t precipitous, it’s late: the existing regulations, which set an upper limit on ozone of 75 parts per billion, were established in 2008 . Since then, it’s become only clearer that this level doesn’t reflect the current understanding of ozone’s wide-ranging health effects. The Obama administration flirted with issuing a new rule in the president’s first term but pulled back — probably to avoid accusations that he was issuing more “job-killing” regulations — pushing reality off until now.\nThe EPA finally released its new standard on Thursday, dropping it to 70 parts per billion. At that level, health complications from dirty air would still occur, but they would decrease. The number of children whose asthma is exacerbated will go down, along with the number of days adults can’t perform strenuous activity or have to take off work. Overall, the EPA estimates the net annual benefits between now and 2025 to be $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion, significantly outweighing the regulatory costs. It may take many years for some places — particularly in smoggy California — to meet the new standards, and regulators recognize that. But that’s no reason to avoid setting goals based on science instead of wishful thinking.\nIn fact, the level the EPA chose is at the high end of the range of options it was considering, which is a significant concession to industry. An EPA scientific advisory committee warned that keeping the standard at 70 parts per billion may not be protective enough, particularly for people with breathing conditions. Industry groups still criticized the announcement but admitted that it was better than it could have been. Environmentalists insisted the Obama administration wasn’t tough enough.\nThe environmentalists have a point, and industry should be on notice. When the rules are up for review again in five years, companies should expect standards to tighten again. Working to meet that goal would be more productive than hoping that an ad campaign will bail them out.\nRead more about this topic:\nThe Post’s View: Volkswagen should suffer the consequences of its cheating\nThe Post’s View: Addressing climate change — the Reagan way\nThe Post’s View: Can science solve climate change?", "external_links": ["http://www3.epa.gov/ozonepollution/pdfs/20151001ria.pdf", "http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/5EFA320CCAD326E885257D030071531C/$File/EPA-CASAC-14-004+unsigned.pdf", "http://www3.epa.gov/ozonedesignations/faq.htm", "http://www3.epa.gov/ozonepollution/actions.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOdsEZzIm_k"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:52:18.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
