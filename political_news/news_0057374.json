The search for remains is not limited only to victims of the FARC but also to those killed by members of the country’s armed forces.\nThe total number of unaccounted for victims is based on a complete registry of declarations made by family members of those missing to agents and officials working for the Unit for Attention and Reparation of Victims. This Unit believes more than 114,000 families are indirect victims of the armed conflict due to forcibly disappeared family members.\nAccording to Gaviria, of the 45,646 missing, 88 percent are male and the majority of cases occurred in the departments of Antioquia, Meta, Valle del Cauca, Cesar and Caquetá where fighting was heaviest.\nWith a staggering 14,094 victims registered, 2002 was the year with the most recorded forced disappearances.\n“This is a transcendental step in the dialogues, because it is working towards satisfying the interests of the victims,” said the head of the government’s negotiating team was also present at the press conference.\nColombia and the FARC have been involved in peace talks since November 2012 and agreed last month to sign a final accord next March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:31:13.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
