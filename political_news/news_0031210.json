Other newspapers had similar reports.\nHatz declined comment through a spokesman and neither of the other two responded to emails seeking comment. VW spokesman Eric Felber on Monday refused to comment on \"various public speculation.\"\nBild reported that VW's internal investigation had turned up contradictory information on Hackenberg's possible involvement, while Hatz denied knowledge.\nFrom 2002 to January 2007, Hackenberg was in charge of concept development, superstructure development and electronics at VW subsidiary Audi. In 2007 he was appointed a member of the VW brand's board for development, and has been a member of Audi's management board since July 2013. He had responsibility for technical development of all of the VW group's brands.\nHatz joined the VW group in 2001 and served as head of engines and transmissions development at Audi until 2009, assuming the same function at VW in 2007. In February 2011 he became a member of Porsche's board of management in charge of research and development and is also head of engines and transmissions development for the Volkswagen group.\nVW and Porsche merged in 2012 after years of wrangling.\nNeusser was in charge of drivetrain development of Porsche from 2001 to 2011 before joining VW to head powertrain development there, taking over the job for the whole Volkswagen group in 2012. The next year, he was named management board member for the Volkswagen brand in charge of development.\nVW's top manager in the US, Michael Horn, is to testify before Congress on Thursday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:47:12.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
