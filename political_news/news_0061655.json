Going forward we will consider more such acquisitions to complement our portfolio,” said RCAM CEO Sundeep Sikka. \nReliance Capital is the financial services arm of Anil Ambani -led business conglomerate, Reliance Group and is involved in insurance, brokerage and wealth management among others. \nGoldman Sachs was given the mandate last year to manage CPSE ETF through which the government has raised Rs 4,000 crore by selling part of its stake in 10 central PSUs as part of its disinvestment programme. \nIt may be noted Goldman Sachs Asset Management is one of the biggest fund managers with AUM of $1.19 trillion across countries. \nReliance Mutual Fund is the largest asset manager in India with total AUM of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore in areas of MF, pension funds, managed accounts and offshore funds. Goldman Sachs entered the Indian MF fund 2011 after acquiring Benchmark MF for Rs 120 crore. \nInitially, HDFC MF was in the race to acquire Goldman Sachs’ India MF assets, but lost out to Reliance MF. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:55:22.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
