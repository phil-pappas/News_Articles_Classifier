Romain said months ago that his clients will force a public vote on any statewide hike in fuel taxes unless lawmakers revisit the fuel mandate. \nIf state and local officials aren't gnawing their fingernails over the possibility of such a campaign, they should be. Fuel-tax increases tend to be unpopular among voters, and Portland residents already pay a 3-cent-per-gallon tax levied by Multnomah County. Meanwhile, everyone who receives a ballot is capable of factoring in the inflationary effect of the low-carbon fuel standard, which will do nothing for either roads or the environment. The contribution of Oregon's cars and trucks to global carbon dioxide emissions is vanishingly small . \nHere, then, is the math Portland voters will be doing next spring: 10 cents (the local gas tax hike), plus up to 19 cents within several years (the carbon standard) plus an unknown statewide tax hike. That's right, there's more to come, at least if Oregonians value well-maintained roads everywhere, as they should. Democrats in the Legislature chose to save the low-carbon fuel standard this year knowing that doing so would undermine any effort to pass a road-funding package during the same session. The plan now, it seems, is to do it in 2017 , by which point legislative leaders seem to believe Oregonians will have forgotten about the fuel standard. Good one, right?

Without their support, a statewide gas tax has little chance of passage. But many of them will wonder why they should pay more at the pump when they've already raised taxes to fix local roads. For this reason, Novick's proposal would make a statewide hike in the gas tax less likely even without the added complication of the low-carbon mandate. \nIt would be tempting to chastise the Legislature at this point for creating such unnecessary headaches for Portland. But a couple of facts get in the way. One is that most Democratic legislators representing Portland and surrounding areas voted for the fuel mandate. The other is that Novick and his four colleagues on City Council sent lawmakers a letter in support of the mandate, calling it \"part of the City of Portland's commitment to promoting a prosperous, low-carbon economy.\" \nSpeaking of prosperous, guess who really, really, really likes the mandate? Chemical giant DuPont, which explained in a recent guest column that it needs requirements like Oregon's to generate business for its new cellulosic ethanol plant ... in Iowa. So much for keeping Oregonians' fuel dollars from flowing out of state, which was a favorite argument of mandate supporters. \nBut we digress. \nA good way for lawmakers to ease the paths of both local and statewide hikes in the gas tax is to pull the plug on the low-carbon fuel standard during the 2016 session. Novick and his colleagues would do their constituents a service by sending legislative leaders a letter to that end. Alternatively, they should prepare to explain why Portlanders ought to support a local gas tax knowing that a statewide tax hike is on the horizon and an effective climate-change tax headed for the pump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:39:14.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
