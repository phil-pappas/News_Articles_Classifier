The Amended Collective and Class Action Complaint alleges that Bank of America regularly requires these hourly Information Technology workers to work more than 40 hours per week but fails to pay them any wages for work beyond 40 hours per week.\nOne of the emails Quote: d in the Amended Complaint states: \"I told him [Bank of America manager] I worked 56 hours and he said that was fine, but that I couldn't put anything more than 40 in, 8 hours each day max. That it's understood and no one can put more in.\" The Amended Complaint further alleges that Bank of America uses the third party recruitment program as a cover to dodge or avoid paying hourly Information Technology workers for all hours worked.\nPlaintiffs Scott Federman and James Leone were both hourly Information Technology workers at Bank of America's corporate center in Pennington , NJ. They both regularly worked over 40 hours per week but were only paid for 40 hours, as they could only get paid after their time sheets were approved and their Bank of America managers would only approve time sheets limited to 40 hours per week. Plaintiff Federman was recruited and placed by Mitchell Martin , Inc. Plaintiff Leone was recruited and placed by TEKSystems. Both placements were made through Fieldglass, which is the Internet tool Bank of America uses to recruit Information Technology workers through third party recruiters.\n\"We want to make sure Messrs. Federman and Leone and everyone who works hourly in Information Technology at Bank of America receives full pay for all hours worked,\" says Tracy Hunt of Timby Hunt, LLC.\nThe case is Scott Federman , et al. v.
