If that doesn’t scare you, I want all of you to imagine waking up on January 8th and having someone else besides myself sworn in as Mayor.” \nDyer faces opposition from Businessman and Veteran Paul Paulson , and Medical Student Sunshine Linda Grund . Paulson has launched major self-funded campaign operation that has included billboards, robocalls, and high profile television commercials. \n“One of my opponents has loaned his campaign $600,000 and that makes it competitive, Oh’ but he did raise $500″ continued Dyer, drawing a laugh from the crowd “I am proud to have support from both the Business and Labor Groups.” \nDyer’s staff then showed his “Orlando Proud” campaign video, before handing out yard signs, and asking supporters to call their friends to make sure they make it to the polls on November 3rd. \n“I’m just as passionate about Orlando today, as I was the day I took office. And whether I’ve known you 25 years or 25 minutes, I’m glad your on board” said Dyer.
