The revenue that would be generated through the reform would be dedicated to transportation spending.\nRyan, a top policy voice among Republicans who is currently considering a run for House speaker, has strongly promoted that approach. The odds against a major tax deal during President Obama's last year in office, however, are slim.\nIcahn wrote that \"the time has come to also hold senators and congressmen accountable for the current gridlock in Congress that prevents important legislation from being passed.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Treasury, IRS lay out tax rules for same-sex couples following court ruling With the rules, a marriage of two people of the same sex will also be recognized for federal tax purposes.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/21/15 5:22 PM \"Not passing this legislation now will be recorded in history as a greater blunder then 'Custer's Last Stand,'\" he added.\nIn the past, Icahn has not been majorly involved in politics. Earlier this year, however, he was mentioned by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a possible selection for Treasury secretary. In turn, Icahn spoke favorably about some of Trump's proposals on businesses and taxation.\nTop Story GOP lawmakers: Has EPA fired anyone for toxic mine spill?
