If that deadline weren't met, the law would automatically be changed to put in place the sequester relief plan offered in President Obama's budget plan.\n  Seth Rogen to Ben Carson: 'F--- you' Rogen expressed his exasperation about Ben Carson's recent string of controversial comments.\nBy Joshua Axelrod • 10/09/15 5:19 PM That budget plan called for about $74 billion more in discretionary spending in fiscal year 2016, which started on Oct. 1. That's about a 7 percent increase in spending.\nIt seems unlikely the GOP would agree to support the Democratic bill that ensures more spending either way. But Republicans are expected to enter into negotiations this fall with Democrats that could result in higher spending.\nDemocrats have opposed Republican efforts to boost defense spending around the sequester caps, while leaving in place those caps for social spending that Democrats want to see increased. That opposition has prompted Democrats to oppose all spending legislation that fails to boost non-defense spending above the caps.\nGetting Democrats to end their opposition is expected to involve some spending hikes, although it's not known exactly what the GOP will have to propose to get a deal.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner House passes bill lifting oil export ban Lifting the oil export ban has become a major GOP priority.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/09/15 2:58 PM Top Story Book: Valerie Jarrett got Joe Biden 'psychiatric help' for 2016 Ed Klein's book claims   hard for Biden to enter the race.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/09/15 1:43 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:02:59.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
