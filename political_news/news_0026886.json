Bill Flores , (R-Bryan,) announced to an oil and gas group on Monday morning that he will seek the gavel of the United States House of Representatives.\nFlores announced his intentions to a Texas Oil And Gas Association meeting in Las Colinas, according to two sources in the room.\nThey added that Flores said his interest in a run for the speakership is conditional on the decision of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin lawmaker many are asking to run.\nThe political world is holding its breath as Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, reluctantly considers those Republican entreaties. He has expressed little interest in serving in that position in this moment of Republican turmoil, but he is generally considered the lone Republican who can unite the fractious House Republican conference.\nIf Flores runs, his biggest strength is that he chairs the largest voting bloc of conservatives, the Republican Study Committee.", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?a=ywm-qZi4tVA:l-8sce84bfk:dnMXMwOfBR0", "http://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/01/21/004_Flores_jpg_312x1000_q100.jpg", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?a=ywm-qZi4tVA:l-8sce84bfk:qj6IDK7rITs", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AmericanFreedom/~4/ywm-qZi4tVA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?a=ywm-qZi4tVA:l-8sce84bfk:yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/12/bill-flores-run-speaker-us-house/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?d=l6gmwiTKsz0", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?a=ywm-qZi4tVA:l-8sce84bfk:l6gmwiTKsz0", "http://www.texastribune.org/directory/bill-flores/?utm_source=texastribune.org&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=Tribune%20Feed:%20Main%20Feed", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?d=qj6IDK7rITs", "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/12/bill-flores-run-speaker-us-house/?", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/AmericanFreedom?d=dnMXMwOfBR0"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:48:50.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
