Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson If there's one job worse than being a federal politician, it's got to be being a politician's spouse.\nConsidering the job description involves long hours, performing menial duties beneath your ability, frequent sole parenting and the ever-present threat of ill-informed abuse from complete strangers, our future politicians would be wise to hide their aspirations when they swipe right on Tinder to meet the love of their life.\nConsider the case of investment banker Melissa Babbage who sure knocked back a well-deserved gin and tonic or two on Wednesday night after putting up with almost two decades of being Joe Hockey's plus one in support of his political career.\nBabbage, a self-made multimillionaire who famously predicted the timing of the global financial crisis, is the \"most impressive person I've ever met\", Hockey told parliament during his valedictory speech.\nJoe Hockey embraces his wife Melissa Babbage after his speech. His children were also present. Alex Ellinghausen Yet she - like other political spouses - has faced the ignominy of her appearance publicly criticised (remember the outrage of 2014 when she dared to wear a new Carla Zampatti dress to her husband's 2014 budget address?) and the insult of having commentators ignore the fact that she - not the Treasurer - was responsible for most of her family's good fortune.\n\"For more than 20 years Melissa has earned the majority of the income, paid the bills, paid the mortgage, given birth to our children and raised the family. I suppose she's probably asking `why did I bother'?\" Hockey said, prompting laughter from both the government and opposition benches.\nA conscript to politics\n\"She ran a global business and suffered my long absences from home. My wife, like all of your wives, husbands, partners, well, my wife was a conscript to politics.\"\nFormer treasurer Joe Hockey leaves the House after his valedictory speech with son Iggy and daughter Adelaide at Parliament House in Canberra. Andrew Meares It doesn't stop there. Anyone who has spent an hour or two at a political event will witness the politician's spouse shouldered aside, forced to sit with frozen smiles through conversations that exclude them, as others court their more famous spouse.\nIt's a hell made even worse for those rare partners of gay politicians from conservative parties who find it easier and more palatable for their partner's political career if they simply do not exist.\nIt's why departures like that of Hockey - who has three young children including one six-year-old whose father has missed every birthday - trigger an outburst of empathy from even his most strident political opponents.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten, who also has young children, seemed to empathise the most and gave a more heartfelt speech than Malcolm Turnbull who had taken the prime ministership and Hockey's job because of a lack of economic \"leadership\".\nIllustration: Rod Clement \"As a father, I understand that you have the benefit of more time with your family,\" Shorten said, following the Canberra protocol of pretending not to know the Hockey-Babbages are headed to live in the Australian ambassador's residence in Washington.\n\"No-one with a family in this place or a partner enjoys those Sunday departures from your family back here but our families enjoy it even less. No-one enjoys cruel and mean things being written about you but your families have even less capacity to protect themselves against it and you will be free of some of that.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:43:04.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
