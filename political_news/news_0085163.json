(AP) â€” A man sentenced to at least 20 years in prison in one Pennsylvania courtroom has followed that up by walking into another courtroom to marry his girlfriend.\nThe Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports ( http://bit.ly/1KR1CmH ) 47-year-old Greg Howard was sentenced Thursday in Westmoreland County Court for robbing and assaulting an elderly woman during a home invasion.\nProsecutors say the Monessen man and two other people got into the woman's house by pretending to be delivering furniture. Witnesses say they took $13,000 and jewelry and left her on her bed with her ankles and wrists bound.\nHoward's closing argument had referenced Santa Claus, the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny. But he was silent at sentencing.\nHe was allowed to wear civilian clothes instead of a prison jumpsuit. He remained shackled during a brief wedding attended by five deputies and the bride's baby.\n___\nInformation from: Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://pghtrib.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1KR1CmH", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:30:25.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
