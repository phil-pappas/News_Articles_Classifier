In its second year, the Comforts From Home Project invites consumers to support USO Operation Celebration™, a program dedicated to celebrating holidays and other special occasions for service members and military families who are missing the comforts of home during these special times. The program brings food, decorations and games to USO locations around the world so that our nation's military community can celebrate special occasions no matter where they are serving.\nFrom September 1, 2015 through January 29, 2016 , consumers can help give to USO Operation Celebration by entering the on-pack code from one of the more than approximately 55 million specially marked packages of Marie Callender's frozen meals or desserts at www.ComfortsFromHome.com . Marie Callender's will donate $.50 to USO Operation Celebration for each code entered[1].\n\"Last year, with consumers' overwhelming support, Marie Callender's brought care packages to a very deserving group of servicemen and women stationed overseas through a $250,000 donation to the USO2GO program,\" said Christiane Brocky , vice president and general manager, ConAgra Foods. \"This year, we're proud to support USO Operation Celebration to help bring a taste of home and its comforts to our troops when their service takes them away from family and friends during the holidays and other special occasions.\"\nIn addition to the on-pack promotion, the 2015 Comforts From Home Project will partner again with Scripps Networks to highlight military families and their service through three popular television shows: Guy's Grocery Games (Food Network), Kitchen Crashers (HGTV and DIY Network) and Travel Channel's American Heroes (Travel Channel). Each television program offers a unique way to give back to those who defend our homes every day and will feature a social media integration to engage consumers online. Scripps Networks will also re-air the one-hour program, A Hero's Welcome, which features a heartwarming homecoming event for one retiring soldier, on Veterans Day on Food Network.\n\"By supporting the USO's Operation Celebration program, Marie Callender's is helping us bridge the gap between home and our troops,\" said Lisa Anastasi , USO Chief Development Officer. \"From the Fourth of July to Thanksgiving , the USO is dedicated to helping troops enjoy every holiday with the comforts of home that can often be taken for granted, such as seasonal meals, entertainment and a chance to relax away from the stresses of military duty.\"\nIn addition to the on-pack promotion and television integrations, the Comforts From Home Project will be supported with a robust marketing campaign that includes in-store signage, a free standing newspaper insert, a magazine outsert in the November issues of Allrecipes, Better Homes & Gardens, Every Day with Rachael Ray , Martha Stewart Living and Taste of Home, as well as digital and social media support.\nVisit www.ComfortsFromHome.com to learn more about the on-pack promotion, the USO Operation Celebration program and the Scripps Networks TV specials airing this fall.
