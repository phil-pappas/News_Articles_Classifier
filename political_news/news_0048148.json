A bill that gets five votes prevents the county executive from issuing a veto on the measure. \nSchuh's proposal would ban all marijuana operations, but not prohibit patients from possessing valid prescriptions inside the county. \nHe has said his proposed ban would prevent Anne Arundel County from being a \"guinea pig\" on how medical marijuana was implemented and was an effort \"to exercise the utmost caution.\" \nThe alternative bill proposed by the councilmen adopts some of the same measures passed by Baltimore's County Council, including a provision that dispensaries not be within 2,500 feet of each other and must be located at least 500 feet from a public or private elementary, middle or high school. \nSchuh said he hoped his own bill would be amended rather than the one sponsored by the three council members because the legislative body took an \"extreme\" approach. That's the same term Walker and others have used to describe Schuh's effort. \nThe council will begin the first round of public discussions on the bills at a work session in Annapolis Tuesday. A hearing on the bills where the public may testify will be held Oct. 19 at the Arundel Center. \nThe Maryland chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws is planning a rally before the public hearing outside the Arundel Center starting at 5:30 p.m. to protest Schuh's proposal. \nSeveral council members said they have been inundated with emails and phone calls from people supporting the regulation of medical marijuana in Anne Arundel County — not the prohibition. \nDuring this year's General Assembly session, state legislators passed the latest version of the law that allows medical marijuana operations in Maryland. State law allows local jurisdictions to implement the program through local planning and zoning laws. \nA letter signed by Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Rowe Sept. 22 states counties cannot attempt to ban business operations allowed under state law. At the time, Schuh's administration vowed to press on with the bill as is. \nSmith said the final version of what is passed by the council might be a combination of what is currently before it. \n\"You will see some sort of limited version of what (Trumbauer) wants to do and certainly not a ban based off of what (Schuh) wants to do,\" Smith said. \"It's just a matter of how do we implement it into the county — how wide will the doors open?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:04:47.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
