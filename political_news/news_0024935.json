This is a serious breach of their duty of care,\" says Mahesh Bindra Corrections Spokesperson and former Senior Corrections Officer. \n\"The alert was on the alleged perpetrator after a previous incident. Had the appropriate Shared Accommodation Cell Risk Assessment (SACRA) been done these two prisoners would not have been put in a cell together. \n\"Clearly Serco has no regard for the Integrated Offender Management System (IOMS), which in this case has led to an avoidable assault. \n\"The failure of Serco to follow due process is yet another major failure proving they are unfit to run our prisons. \n\"The Government has no option but to terminate Sercoâ€™s contract and put the management of our prisons back in state hands\", says Mr Bindra. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
