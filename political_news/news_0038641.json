That ideologies are being used against us. I don't deny that certain ideologies are better than others, TPTB herd us into one side or the other, then herd us into their definition of the ideology we've chosen. We don't have to choose between the two. It reminds me of spectator sports fans. It's \"my team\" against \"their team\". Nothing \"my team\" does is wrong. Anything that hurts or damages members of the other team is good. This kind of \"yay teamism\" is killing America. One example of weaponized ideology at work is the Bolshevik Revolution. The end result reveals the original intention. The implementation did not help the little guy or poor people as it's stated intention suggested. Divide and conquer. The politics of envy against the politics of greed. Class warfare. What the Bolshevik Revolution really accomplished was a transfer of power. Cui bono? So do we believe politicians stated intentions or the end result of implementation of their policies? How often does history have to repeat itself before the dimwitted television watchers wake up? As long as their is envy there will be socialism. Socialism's main fuel is envy. Every socialist inspired revolution has been the same theme. Destroy the rich, take from them. The government gets the spoils. Then a bureaucracy reaps the reward, and the people get shit and end up as subjects. Take note of the wealthiest part of the United States. It is Washington D.C. and surrounding area. Transfer of wealth is already going to the bureaucratic class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:38:00.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
