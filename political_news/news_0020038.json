If we could tell where he was, I'm certain that they knew where he was.\" \nStephanopoulos responded: \"But at that point, we had some idea but we didn't know for sure. I simply don't understand how you think this would have worked.\" \nThen, Carson brought up Iraq. \n\"Well here's the point -- here's my point. My point is, we had other ways that we could have done things. I personally don't believe that invading Iraq was an existential threat to us. I don't think Saddam Hussein was an existential threat to us. It's a very different situation right now. Now, we have global jihadists who want to destroy us and our way of life,\" he said. \nStephanopoulos noted that he'd been asking about invading Afghanistan, not Iraq. \n\"Well, I was primarily talking about Iraq,\" Carson said. \nThe United States launched military attacks in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 in an effort to track down bin Laden and destroy his al Qaeda organization. The war in Iraq was not related to those terror attacks; it came as a result of (ultimately inaccurate) expectations that the country had weapons of mass destruction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:32:27.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
