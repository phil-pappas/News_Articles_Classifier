Apologizes for Saying \"World Ain't Ready\" for U.S. to Have Female President T.I. by Hilary Lewis 10/13/2015 12:01pm PDT In a recent radio interview, the rapper prefaced his remarks with \"not to be sexist,\" before saying, \"I think you might be able to get the Loch Ness monster elected before you could [a woman].\" \nRapper and actor T.I. apologized on Tuesday for saying, in a recent radio interview, that \"the world ain't ready\" for the U.S. to elect a female president because women make \"rash decisions.\" \n\"My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong,\" T.I. said in a statement posted to Twitter. \"I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended.\" My comments about women running for president were unequivocally insensitive and wrong. I sincerely apologize to everyone I offended. — T.I. (@Tip) October 13, 2015 \nT.I. is apologizing for comments he made in an interview with DJ Whoo Kid for his show The Whoolywood Shuffle, during which the rapper said he \"can’t vote for the leader of the free world to be a woman,\" prefacing his remarks with \"not to be sexist.\" \n“Every other position that exists, I think a woman could do well,” the rapper said. “But the president, it’s kind of like, I just know that women make rash decisions emotionally — they make very permanent, cemented decisions — and then later, it’s kind of like it didn’t happen or they didn’t mean for it to happen. And I sure would hate to just set off a nuke. … [International leaders] will not be able to negotiate the right kinds of foreign policy. The world ain’t ready yet.\" \n\"I think you might be able to get the Loch Ness monster elected before you could [a woman]. It’s not right, but I’m just saying I don’t think,” T.I. concluded. \nIn addition to his music career, T.I. also acts under his birth name of Tip Harris , appearing in movies and TV shows like Ant-Man, Get Hard, Identity Thief, House of Lies and American Gangster . His upcoming films include Ride Along 2 and Sleepless Night . \nEarlier in the interview, T.I. talked about Republican front runner Donald Trump . He praised the real-estate mogul turned candidate, calling him \"the best showman of them all.\" \n\"And I do feel that if he is sincerely concerned about the economy of America and the working public, he would be the best person to flip the money that we have, take it and flip it,” he added. \nBut the rapper said he wouldn't vote for Trump either. \n“His racist remarks and all of his off-color statements … it makes it impossible to be like completely supportive of him,” T.I said. “But just knowing what he’s done for business, for himself, if he intends to do that for America, it would be beneficial. But I can’t cast no vote for him.” \nWatch T.I.'s full interview below. His comments about Trump and the possibility of a female president begin around the 11:50 mark.",
