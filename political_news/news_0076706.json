The railways has finally decided to go ahead with the construction of a road overbridge (ROB) at the spot where the station's level crossing was shut in 2011. The level crossing was closed after the railways and local residents realised that it was one of the spots where the maximum number of track deaths were taking place on the suburban system.\nThis week, Central Railway's (CR) construction department gave the green signal to build a ROB there at a cost of Rs2.15 crore, the work on which is expected to be completed by around mid-2017. The closure of the level crossing and the non-existence of an ROB meant that vehicles in adjoining areas had to take a detour of anything between 5 to 7 kilometres to go from east to west. They had to either take the ROB at Ghatkopar in the south of the station or at Kanjurmarg in the north. To make matters worse, the ROB at Ghatkopar and the one at Kanjurmarg are highly congested during most times of the day.\nThe decision to go ahead with the ROB comes amidst the deadlock between CR and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) over how to go about building the ROB. According to officials, the ROB — connecting Pirojshah Godrej road in the east to the station road beside St Joseph's Church in the west — can be built exactly at the same spot where the level crossing existed only if a proposed 60 ft road is built to run parallel to the 5th and 6th line on the eastern fringe of the station. This 60 ft road, to be built by the BMC, would be essential for people living in the buildings along Tagore Nagar — a settlement running along the eastern side of the station — to get to Pirojshah Godrej Road and then onward to the Eastern Express Highway.\nThese people currently use an 18 ft road close to the 5th and 6th line but the land on which this road runs belongs to CR and the latter wants to build a wall along the road and close it permanently. However, the plan to wall this road and close it without making the proposed 60 ft road would have left several buildings as well settlements in the Tagore Nagar area without a proper access to Pirojshah Godrej Road or to the Eastern Express Highway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:26:22.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
