(By Matthew Cole / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Rema Rahman Contact Reporter rrahman@capgaznews.com What did Steve Schuh tell south county residents about legalized pot? \nCounty Executive Steve Schuh brought his anti-marijuana message to south county Wednesday, calling cities here and abroad where pot is legal \"a nightmare.\" \nSchuh was talking to about two dozen members of local home improvement associations in Galesville. He also took questions on taxes, schools and roadways. \nHe told the crowd about his intent to prohibit medical cannabis operations in the county through legislation. When it was apparent there wasn't enough votes on the County Council to pass, Schuh said his administration offered a compromise that would instead strictly limit where such businesses could locate. \nSchuh said he wants to prevent \"pot shops\" from popping up all over the county as they have in other areas where medicinal and recreational use of the drug is legal. \nAs a traveler, Schuh said he's been to cities where \"marijuana culture has taken over\" such as Boulder, Colorado; Amsterdam; and Kingston, Jamaica. \n\"It's not paradise on earth,\" he said. \"It's a nightmare and I don't want that for our county.\" \nLater, Schuh brought up coffee shops where people can publicly consume marijuana in Amsterdam and suggested that mirrors what's allowed in the state â€” even though public consumption would still be illegal here. \n\"That's what we're talking about. That's what they're bringing to Maryland,\" Schuh said. \nAt one point, the notion of marijuana being illegal under federal law came up. \nSchuh then took the opportunity to point out that it also meant it wasn't approved for medicinal use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \n\"When was the last time anybody took a drug that wasn't approved by the FDA?\" Schuh asked the crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:12:07.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
