The Treasury already came close to missing payments in 2011 and 2013 when Congress delayed increasing the borrowing limit.\n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange ; Editing by Peter Cooney , Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:29:09.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
