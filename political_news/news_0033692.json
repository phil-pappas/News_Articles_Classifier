A bill to lift the ban passed in the House, but the White House has threatened to veto it.\nBackers of repealing the 40-year-old ban on U.S. crude oil exports in the Senate need at least six Democratic senators order for a bill to pass. At the moment, they only have one who has voted for legislation in a committee, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, from oil-producing North Dakota.\nSome backers have said that including sweeteners in the legislation, such as a permanent tax breaks for wind and solar power, could help win more Democratic support.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner ; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:14:43.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
