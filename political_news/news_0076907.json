The reality is that Whanau Ora has not been able to inform or have impact on DHB funding decisions. \n\"It’s time for the Maori Party to admit Whanau Ora isn’t anchored on solid foundations and has failed to bring fresh health opportunities for Maori,\" says Nanaia Mahuta. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
