He said a working model was being designed to ensure the Constitution Drafting Commission (CDC), the National Reform Steering Assembly (NRSA) and the NLA could co-ordinate and work together to achieve reform results. He said CDC chairman Meechai Ruchupan wanted to heed public opinion in drafting the new charter through the NLA's public hearings. The NLA's 10th hearings would be organised from October 31-November 1 in Yasothon and Ubon Ratchathani. NLA deputy president Peerasak Porjit said the CDC would dispatch representatives to seek community opinion during the NLA's public hearing. He said they would seek opinions on political topics such as elected and non-elected PM issues, the eligibility of MPs and Senators and the election system. PM's Office Minister Suwaphan Tanyuvardhana said to achieve results, the reform agencies must prioritise their work. \"In order to achieve speedy reform results, the government, NLA and NRSA must work together to drive reforms. We have results of reform studies that we must prioritise, reform issues and complete the tasks with the remaining time we have,'' he said. He said Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said he would soon call a meeting of the five core agencies to make all core agencies - especially the newly established NRSA - understand the government's work philosophy and direction. Suwaphan said the NRSA was obliged by the interim charter to effectively bring about reform results. The NLA, NRSA and the government must work together to address urgent issues. There were 20 national strategies being written to link with the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said the NLA and NRSA must commit to the timeframe of the roadmap to democracy as the government had set it. \"We must follow the roadmap so that the National Council for Peace and Order can work for another 20 months the most. It is ok if they can complete the work sooner,'' he said. 146 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:54:12.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
