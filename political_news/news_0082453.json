Built as a temporary fix in northeast Dallas’ Vickery Meadow neighborhood, its multiple modular, prefab units wound up as a hardly adequate long-term solution.\nFor a decade or so, Stone has struggled with drainage and erosion flaws outside its buildings and student overcrowding within. Pity the 350 students squashed into its haphazard space.\nVoters are about to get the chance to help the children at Stone — and many more like them — by supporting the Dallas school district’s proposed $1.6 billion bond program.\nReplacing obsolete campuses is just the start. The bond package is designed to ensure not just enough decent classrooms, but the kind equipped to support high quality and innovative teaching.\nThe best news? The proposal requires no tax increase. Yes, you read that correctly. All those improvements without hiking the tax rate one bit.\nThe district’s last bond vote was in 2008, when voters approved a package that focused on southern Dallas needs. This time around, the fix-ups are more evenly spread, with a focus on high-growth areas.\nWhile DISD takes its share of deserved criticism, the district has a track record of making the right calls when it comes to bond elections. Led by architect Craig Reynolds, who helped put together the 2002 and 2008 packages, the diverse 27-member Future Facilities Task Force worked for nearly a year on this plan.\nJust as important as studying the Parsons Report , which assessed the condition of every district facility, the task force gave neighborhoods across Dallas a chance to be heard.\nThis package is not about any single individual’s vision for the district but rather reflects a methodical and transparent process that supports long-term strategic goals with appropriate infrastructure.\nSchool board president Eric Cowan puts it like this: “Our district has $4 billion worth of needs, so $1.6 billion is a good first step. ... This bond program addresses universal educational goals that we support as a board and should embrace as a city.”\nA big chunk of the money is for basic stuff that has worn out with age: roofs, plumbing and air conditioning/heating systems. Hard to argue with those kind of nuts-and-bolts costs.\nAnother big-ticket item is the construction of nine schools to replace outdated facilities or to relieve the crowding of so many students into too small campuses. At other sites, where space is available, the district proposes classroom additions.\nThe descriptor “over-capacity” is a fair label for other parts of schools as well.\nFor instance, proposed cafeteria expansions would put an end to elementary students being forced into early-morning lunch periods. Right now, some young pupils are eating their midday meal within two hours of breakfast in order to get all students fed. How would you like to try concentrating on new math concepts over a growling stomach because lunch was at 10 a.m.?\nFinally, a relatively small pot of money in the overall plan is earmarked for some of the most intriguing educational ideas:\n-- Expanded pre-kindergarten classes across the district.\nFor instance, if the bond is approved, Wilmer Elementary, which has documented huge pre-K success, will be just one of the primary campuses expanding its operations for the community’s youngest students.\nA recent Dallas Morning News report noted that when school opened this year, DISD officials saw a 10-point gain in district kindergartners starting at grade level. Alan Cohen, an assistant superintendent who oversees early childhood education, said, “We have a long, long way to go. But our efforts in pre-K are definitely starting to yield results.”\n-- The opening of three more “transformational schools,” similar to magnet campuses but without academic entry requirements.\nWe’re talking about innovations like what’s happening at Bonham Elementary in East Dallas. Seeded with funds from last spring’s interim financial plan, the school will reopen next fall as an all-girls K-8 campus focusing on sciences and the arts.\n-- New career and technical education programs tailored to the fastest-growing employment fields in North Texas.\nThese curriculums, which partner with core classes, range from business and marketing to engineering and education. For example, bond money would purchase the expensive high-tech hospital equipment that instructors need for health-sciences training.\nOur analysis of the bond package leads us to strongly support it. We hope we’ve persuaded you to back it, too — and to make sure your support counts.\nFewer than 5 percent of eligible voters turned out for the last DISD bond program. That 2008 package barely squeaked through, by only 1,485 votes. Don’t let an issue this vital to Dallas schoolchildren — decent facilities and enhanced academic options — die because you didn’t show up for them.\nWhat would $1.6 billion bring?\nRoofs, HVAC, plumbing, façade and interior improvements: $500M\nNine new or replacement schools: $465M\nImprovements related to technology, libraries, science labs, gyms, auditoriums, cafeterias, arts and athletic facilities: $233M\n326 new classrooms through campus expansions: $195M\nLand acquisition and clearing for new campuses: $105M\nInfrastructure supporting new educational programs such as career/technology education, pre-kindergarten and transformation schools: $92M\nTotal cost: $1.6 billion", "external_links": ["http://www.dallasisd.org/futurefacilities", "http://www.dallasisd.org/cms/lib/TX01001475/Centricity/Domain/1/ParsonsReport.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:03:34.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
