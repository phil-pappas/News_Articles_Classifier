He said the ceiling was not about spending more, but rather paying bills we’ve already incurred.\nHe said raising the ceiling is “a way for the U.S. to maintain its good credibility.\"\n“If it gets messed with, it would have profound impact for the global economy and put our financial system in tailspin,” Obama said during a press conference on Friday.\nThe president said while House Speaker John Boehner’s decision to step down will complicate things, he’s confident there will be a path forward before the U.S. hits the ceiling, roughly on Nov. 5.\nObama: Putin hasn't won anything By Michael Crowley\n“It will complicate the negotiations, but when it comes to the debt ceiling, we’re not going back there,” he said.\nObama also called on Republicans who wanted to defund Planned Parenthood to pursue other methods rather than shutting down the government.\n“They want to defund Planned Parenthood, there’s a way to do it, pass a law, override my veto,\" he said.\n“You can’t have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy, any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence. I feel just as strongly about that, and I think I’ve got better evidence too,\" he said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:43:47.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
