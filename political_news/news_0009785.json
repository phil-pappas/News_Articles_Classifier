Photo: Nan Goldin/Courtesy of Bottega Veneta\nSince 2002, shortly after he took over as creative director of Bottega Veneta , Tomas Maier has been recruiting world-renowned talent for his label's ad campaigns. A longtime photo collector himself, Maier has worked with artists and photographers like Annie Leibovitz, Peter Lindbergh, Steven Meisel, Nick Knight, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, and dozens more. \"It's always someone who I admire greatly,\" Maier told the Cut, describing the working process as \"very clear and direct.\" After deciding on a collaborator, he describes the collection, sees what ideas it provokes, and moves quickly from there: \"I like to get the campaign shot without any outside intervention, so that the results can be as pure as possible.\"\nThey may be pure, but they're also cinematic — mostly atmospherically, but sometimes literally, like Alex Prager 's spring/summer 2011 campaign swarming with Hitchcock birds. Those photos and over 1,000 more are packed in Maier's 656-page tome Bottega Veneta: Art of Collaboration , which Rizzoli published just this month.
