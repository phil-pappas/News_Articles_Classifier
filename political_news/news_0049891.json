Within the past year, did the food you bought not last, and you didn’t have money to get more? The answers could be a key way of gauging hunger, the AAP says, an endemic problem that has not gone away with the improving economy. This year 14 percent of U.S. households were considered “food insecure,” according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, compared to 11.1 percent were in 2007, before the Great Recession began.\nThe majority of food-insecure households do manage to get enough to eat, but not without sacrificing the quality or variety of their meals. In one-third of food-insecure families, someone—usually an adult—actually goes hungry because there is not enough food to eat.", "external_links": ["http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/media-resources.aspx#gettingitright", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2015/10/20/peds.2015-3301", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-food-insecurity_55f04524e4b093be51bcea0e"], "published": "2015-10-26T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:38:27.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
