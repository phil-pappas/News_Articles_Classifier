His speech comes in the aftermath of a warning from the European External Action Service (EEAS) calling on them to respect human rights and allow for free speech and political dissent within the country. A few weeks ago, a constitution proposed by the government itself was rejected by a government hand-picked council which led to an extension of the military junta’s rule through at least the end of 2016.\nResistance from international community\nMany, such as ASEAN Human Rights Chairperson Charles Santiago of Malaysia have been highly critical of Thailand’s appearance at the UN this week commenting:\n“Representatives of Thailand’s junta have been allowed to strut around the international arena as if they are the legitimate representatives of their people, A clear message must be sent to Prayuth and his ilk that prolonged military rule will not be tolerated”\nA further 100 Thais known as the Red Shirts USA were seen protesting outside the United Nations in solidarity with Thaksin Shinawatra’s (former PM of Thailand) Red Shirts who have been cracked down on by the Junta and prevented from protesting due to bans on political activity.\nBan Ki Moon , Secretary General of the UN, also expressed concern over the lack of free speech in Thailand in a sit-down meeting with Chan-Ocha. Ocha apparently laid out his plan to re-institute democratic elections in July 2017 and to continue to reinforce sustainable development and human right with Thailand’s new seat as chair of the G-77.\nRunning for a non-permanent seat\nDespite push back from the European Union, the UN Secretary General, and the world at large Thailand remains unintimidated and is preparing to run for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2017-18. Whether the presence of the junta will negatively impact Thailand’s bid remains to be seen, but as Thailand’s economy and human rights records continue to slide it begs the question of when the international pressure will begin to take its toll.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52057#.Vgz9cnh0u0t", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-30/thailand-s-prayuth-avoids-coup-in-un-speech-lauds-human-rights", "http://www.nationmultimedia.com/politics/Ban-expresses-concern-over-democracy-to-PM-30269755.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:50:17.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
