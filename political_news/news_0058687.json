Share article \nAlong with producing paper maps the lion’s share of OS business comes from digital map data, online route planning along with sharing services and mobile apps. \nAs a result of a deal with the government public organisations, including the emergency services, councils and highways agencies, can access the data held by OS for free.

It's not rocket science Ms Noakes, you are a Tory MP and by definition privatisation of everything and anything is in your DNA.
