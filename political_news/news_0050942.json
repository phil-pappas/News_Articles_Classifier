Trey Gowdy and the six other Republicans on the panel were expected to be equally measured, considering the partisan onslaught that followed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggestion last month that their investigation had hurt Clinton’s poll numbers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:31:37.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
