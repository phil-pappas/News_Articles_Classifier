The mystery of how hundreds of identical, brand-new ISIS-owned Toyota trucks have made it into Syria is solved.

While previous admissions to supplying the vehicles implicates the West directly, that nothing resembling interdiction operations have been set up along any of these borders implicates the West as complicit with other parties also supplying vehicles to terrorists inside of Syria. What else has Obama given them? Location: Chicago Posts: 6,628 It's another stupid CIA plan, they have obviously planted homing devices in these trucks so we can have drones obliterate them. The could have at least bought American. No joke. Toyota? That'll upset the Unions....

What else has Obama given them? The New Eastern Outlook is a propaganda arm of Russian government. Throughout the article, all Syrian opposition groups are referred to as \"terrorists.\" That makes sense only if you're Russian and support Assad. It's a damned mess in Syria, but the Free Syrian Army allied with a number of other groups are the \"moderate\" force. Read up: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Syrian_Army In addition, Russian aircraft have been pounding FSA positions around Homs, Latakia, and Aleppo, and thus weakening the opposition to Assad AND ISIS. Here's what happened. You got snookered ol' boy. Russian propagandists know they can count on ill-informed people, and in the US, those who are infected and blinded by the anger and fear that are the primary symptoms of Obama Derangement Syndrome, you know, boys like you. They gotcha. The mystery is solved.
