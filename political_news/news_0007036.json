Nigro also did not confirm the termination but in a statement said his department has made \"significant progress\" during the last year towards becoming more inclusive. \n\"Our commitment to becoming a more diverse and inclusive Department has never been stronger and will continue to be a key strategic initiative,\" Nigro added. \nNo one answered the phone at Lassiter's office on Thursday and voicemails were not returned. \nLassiter's position was created after the city paid nearly $100 million to settle a federal lawsuit charging that the FDNY's hiring process was discriminatory against minority applicants. \nAt the time the suit was filed in 2007, 3.4 percent of city firefighters were black and less than 7 percent were Hispanic, according to reports. \nThe federal lawsuit against the city was filed in 2007 by the Vulcan Society , a fraternal organization of black firefighters. \nThe agency has since increased its diversity numbers . As of 2013, 10 percent of the department is black, 12 percent is Hispanic and 2 percent is Asian, according to a department report .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:52:01.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
