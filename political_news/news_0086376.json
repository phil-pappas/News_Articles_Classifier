More Scottish Tory leader eyes Holyrood gains \nMr Osborne will say that the body will start immediately to work out “calmly and dispassionately what the country needs to build for its future and to hold any government’s feet to the fire if it fails to deliver”. \nLord Adonis, a zealous advocate of improved rail links in the north of England and the completion of a new north-south Crossrail 2 in London within a decade, will quit the Labour whip in the upper house and sit as a crossbench peer. \nMr Osborne’s aides say the chancellor was impressed by the way in which Howard Davies’s review of London airport capacity focused political minds and wants to replicate the model on a national scale. \nThe move has intriguing implications for the Davies proposal for a third runway at Heathrow. The question arises that if Mr Osborne values the Davies model so highly and is using it as a national template, can the government ignore his recommendation? \n“That is a quite separate matter and it’s being handled by Number 10,” said an aide to the chancellor. \nMr Osborne will tell the Conservative conference in Manchester that he wants to build maximum political consensus behind a national infrastructure plan, which would be delivered at the start of each parliament. \nLord Adonis and a small team of commissioners have been asked to produce a report early in this parliament, a strong signal of intent by Mr Osborne to press ahead with Crossrail 2 and the so-called HS3 northern rail link. \n“I’m not prepared to turn round to my children — or indeed anyone else’s child — and say: ‘I’m sorry, we didn’t build for you’,” Mr Osborne will say. “We have to shake Britain out of its inertia on the projects that matter most.” \nAlthough ultimate decisions will remain with ministers and parliament, business leaders are likely to welcome a longer-term cross-party approach to infrastructure planning. \nLord Adonis, who has been a member of the Social Democratic party, Liberal Democrats and Labour, has now completed a remarkable political journey by accepting a job from a Conservative chancellor. \nHowever, he has always been regarded as something of a technocrat, whose sheer force of will as Labour’s transport secretary helped to propel the HS2 high-speed line from London to the north through a thicket of political opposition. \nMr Osborne will also announce the pooling of 89 local authority pension funds into six “British Wealth Funds”, with assets of more than £25bn in each, in the hope they will then have the scale to invest in infrastructure schemes. \nThe chancellor has long been frustrated that the pension funds of Canadian teachers are being invested in UK projects but he has struggled to hit his target of raising “up to £20bn” over a decade from pension funds in this country. \nInfrastructure investment is a sore topic for many UK investors. The potential long-term returns are an appealing match for the long-term liabilities of life insurance companies and pension funds. \nBut UK insurers complain that incoming Solvency II rules, imposed by the EU, oblige them to hold uneconomic levels of capital against such commitments.
