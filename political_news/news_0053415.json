Since its launch at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 2004, TETWP will have raised over 22 million dollars by the end of 2015. The money, raised through the grassroots efforts of rodeo committees and events across the U.S. and Canada , stays primarily local, raising awareness about early detection and supporting families who are facing the disease. Monies raised also go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, dedicated to helping doctors, scientists and researchers discover new treatments and a cure. A portion of the annual sales of Purple Cowboy wines are donated to Tough Enough To Wear Pink?, a cause close to the heart of wine executive Terry Wheatley , creator of the brand.\n\"Outside my professional life as Executive Vice President of Vintage Wine Estates, I'm proud to be born and raised in the western ranching community,\" says Wheatley. \"I'm married to a former professional rodeo cowboy, my son is a former professional rodeo cowboy and now rodeo broadcaster. We have a small ranch in Central California where my family raises and trains quarter horses. We have deep ties to the rodeo and western communities.\"\nWhat's more, Terry Wheatley is a breast cancer survivor. In 2004, when she was dealing with her own diagnosis and her son Wade was competing in the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas , she came up with an idea to raise awareness about breast cancer in the western community.\n\"Cowboys are tough,\" she explains, \"but like everyone else, they are profoundly affected by breast cancer when it strikes a family member.\"\nTo bring attention to the issue, the idea was cowboys should wear pink on one night of the rodeo. Enlisting the help of her son Wade, he convinced his fellow competitors to prove they were \"Tough Enough To Wear Pink\" for an important cause. The arena was awash in pink that night, rodeo fans quickly embraced the idea, and the Tough Enough To Wear Pink? campaign was born.\nFunds are raised in grassroots fashion at rodeos and other western community events through the sales of Tough Enough To Wear Pink? gear. Corporate partners such as Wrangler, PRCA Rodeo, Las Vegas Events, Montana Silversmiths, Twisted X Boots and Purple Cowboy wines share their support in financial and in-kind donations.\n\"I've created many wine brands in my career, but Purple Cowboy wines is the closest to my heart. When I started in the wine business many years ago, I was inspired by the story of a band of winemakers who rodeo'd on the weekends. They drank so much wine that it turned their teeth purple and everybody knew them as the band of the Purple Cowboys,\" recalled Wheatley. \"I'm proud that this wine gives back to a cause that is very personal to me and the western community family.\"\nDuring the month of October, visit Tough Enough To Wear Pink? on Facebook for news on Tough Enough To Wear Pink? events.
