Biden to join the Democratic presidential field is low after this week’s first debate, according to a new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released Friday that found only about a third of New Hampshire primary voters want to see him take the plunge. \nMr. Biden garners just 11 percent of the vote in a match-up, while former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton leads with 37 percent and Sen. Bernard Sanders is close behind at 35 percent, the poll of 500 Democratic primary voters found. \nOf those who watched Tuesday’s debate, 54 percent gave Mrs. Clinton the win, while 24 percent said Mr. Sanders got the best of the affair. Not a single voter said Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of nearby Rhode Island, won. Two voters apiece picked former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Sen. Jim Webb as the winners. \nThe voters by-and-large were not worried about Mrs. Clinton’s email situation, which has landed her in hot water in Washington, where the FBI is probing her handling of classified information on a server she kept at her home in New York. She declined to use the State Department’s regular system, saying it was inconvenient for her. \nWhile Mr. Sanders didn’t win the debate, Democrats do rank him the most trustworthy of the field — though they don’t believe he’s the most electable candidate in a race with the GOP. That honor goes to Mrs. Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:52:12.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
