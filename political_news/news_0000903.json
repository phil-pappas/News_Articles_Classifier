FILE PHOTO | DIANA NGILA | NATION MEDIA GROUP. Advertisement More by this Author \nController of Budget Agnes Odhiambo has told the Public Accounts Committee she did not approve the expenditure of Sh53.2 billion to pay off a syndicated loan last year from the proceeds of the Eurobond. \nMs Odhiambo said this was because the money from the Eurobond was deposited in an offshore account, which is a special account, which is one of several she doesn't have control over. \nShe said Parliament needs to come up with laws to guide the management of this and similar accounts. \nShe said the rest of the $2 billion bond issued last year is paid into the exchequer when needed and has been spent on infrastructure projects. \nWhile Treasury had said that the bond would result in the strengthening of the shilling and the lowering of interest rates, the Parliamentary Budget Office said it had no such effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:09:30.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
