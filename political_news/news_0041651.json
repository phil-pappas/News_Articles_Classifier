Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann are partnering to fight the epidemic of tax-forfeited properties in Mississippi. “Tax-forfeited properties lying dormant with the State benefit no one—especially not the taxpayer,” says Secretary Hosemann. “By purchasing these properties at drastically reduced rates, Mississippians perform a service to their communities by paying taxes on these parcels and rehabbing what is often a dilapidated property.” Fifty-nine parcels with an estimated value of $817,444 are included in the auction. Overall, there are 566 parcels of tax-forfeited property in Warren County, with a value of approximately $3.7 Million. “The City of Vicksburg is excited to be partnering with the Mississippi Secretary of State’s Office on an auction of state-owned property in our city,” says Mayor Flaggs. “We are hopeful that many of these properties can be sold to individuals or companies for development that will enhance our city. I would like to thank Secretary Hosemann for this great opportunity for the City of Vicksburg.” Sealed bids must be received by 5:00 pm, Thursday, October 29, 2015 in the Secretary of State’s Office. 10/5/15 Posted October 6, 2015 - 4:57 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
