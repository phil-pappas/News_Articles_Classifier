Unique to 2015 is the campaign's focus on carbon monoxide education.\nThe Foundation aims to raise $675,000 during the month of October to help fund the non-profit's life-saving mission and increase public awareness of carbon monoxide dangers. Firehouse Subs is encouraging guests to support this initiative by purchasing a $1 , $5 or $25 paper medallion as a donation during the month of October. Each $25 medallion will buy one family a carbon monoxide detector.\nCarbon monoxide is a silent, invisible and odorless toxic gas.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is simple to prevent. To learn more about carbon monoxide safety, visit www.savinglives.firehousesubs.com .\nFirehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was founded in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Firehouse Subs co-founders, Chris Sorensen and Robin Sorensen , traveled to Mississippi where they fed first responders as well as survivors. As they traveled back to Florida exhausted and exhilarated, they knew we could do more and the Firehouse Subs Public Safety Foundation was born with the mission of providing funding, life-saving equipment, and educational opportunities to first responders and public safety organizations. The Foundation is celebrating its 10-year anniversary in 2015 and at the conclusion of this year's Public Safety Month campaign, the non-profit organization will have given more than $15 million to hometown heroes in 44 states and Puerto Rico .\nConnect:\n@savinglives\nwww.savinglives.firehousesubs.com\nFor More Media Information\nTori Andrews\nThe Zimmerman Agency\n(850) 668-2222 • firehousesubs@zimmerman.com\n releases/firehouse-subs-public-safety-foundation-cant-keep-quiet-about-a-silent-killer-300153017.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://savinglives.firehousesubs.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/firehouse-subs-public-safety-foundation-cant-keep-quiet-about-a-silent-killer-300153017.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CL18164&Transmission_Id=201510011719PR_NEWS_USPR_____CL18164&DateId=20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:50:34.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
