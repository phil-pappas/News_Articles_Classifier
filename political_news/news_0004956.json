They've now given up on the case, despite the family's long-standing appeals for assistance.\n\"I'm going to run in Frankfurt to raise money for Missing People because families can only rely on themselves, or on charities like this, if their loved ones go missing abroad,\" David Dixon , Michael's brother said.\n\"Michael's case was grossly mishandled. So I'm also running to raise awareness of the issue. The British government needs better procedures to protect people when they travel.\"\nThe Frankfurt Marathon takes place in Germany on 25 October.\nMissing People is a registered charity in London , where David lives. Sponsors can donate via JustGiving .\nMichael, who worked as editor of a US business magazine, walked out of his hotel one evening in Tamarindo and never came back.\nSome 45,000 British people a year go to Costa Rica , considered a safe destination.\nBut at least 20 foreign nationals disappeared or were murdered in the country in past six years, prompting official UK and US travel warnings.\n\"It's never too late for someone to come forward if they know what happened to my son,\" Lynn Dixon , Michael's mother said.\n\"Things sometimes feel normal after all this time. But then, every day, I realise that nothing is normal. I don't want anybody else to go through what we're going through.\"\nMedia professionals:\nFor more information on the Michael Dixon case, go to Help Find Michael Dixon Website\nFor Quote: s or comments from David Dixon , contact him via info@helpfindmichaeldixon.com\nFor information on David Dixon's travel security app, Ten20, go to Ten20 Website\nFor David's Facebook campaign, The International Missing People Group, go to IMPG Facebook Group\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277716\n releases/brother-of-missing-british-journalist-in-frankfurt-marathon-campaign-300161288.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.justgiving.com/David-Dixon16", "http://ten20app.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brother-of-missing-british-journalist-in-frankfurt-marathon-campaign-300161288.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277715", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277716", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.helpfindmichaeldixon.com/", "https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/costa-rica/safety-and-security", "https://www.facebook.com/InternationalMissingPeopleGroup?fref=ts", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=MM30561&Transmission_Id=201510161315PR_NEWS_USPR_____MM30561&DateId=20151016", "https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17191", "http://www.missingpeople.org.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:25:48.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
