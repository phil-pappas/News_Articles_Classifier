Williams News Director Related Articles Hall Co. board holds final public discussion session on E-SPLOST prior to Nov. vote Small crowd attends first public meeting for E-SPLOST V Hall County School District adds E-SPLOST public meeting to schedule Bomb threat found in bathroom of North Hall High \nGAINESVILLE â€” A new campus for Mountain Education Charter High School (MEC) may be coming to Hall County. Hall County School Board members discussed the possibility at a work session last week and are expected to approve the move at a meeting Monday afternoon. Hall County School Board Chairman Nath Morris said the two entities have tried to come up with a plan in the past, but usually financial issues have kept MEC from finding a home in Hall County. \"What we'll probably do is use some space at LCCA, since we already have evening school there and it would be some of those students anyway [who need the program],\" said Morris. Lanier Charter Career Academy (LCCA) is located off Atlanta Highway on Tumbling Creek Road in the Oakwood area. Both LCCA and MEC offer high school students the opportunity to learn in non-traditional environments. Morris said the goal is to have students earn a high school diploma in a timely manner, whether they need one class or whether they work a job that keeps them from the classroom during typical hours. \"These are folks that have figured out how to get it done,\" said Morris. \"The resources that might be available - they know how to direct those resources to the kids - to work with the kids.\" Mountain Education Charter High School currently has 11 campuses in north Georgia, according to its web site. The Hall County School Board meets at 5 p.m. Monday, October 26 at school board headquarters on Green Street.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:07:37.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
