Critics fear the Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield plans could hurt some patients and hospitals. \nDemocratic Sens. Nia Gill and Joseph Vitale say the state should first set up a way to oversee how health insurers rate health care providers when they set up tiered systems. Here’s a look at the issue. \nTHE BIG PICTURE \nThe business of health care has changed in the five years since President Barack Obama signed the insurance overhaul legislation. Hospitals and doctors’ offices have gone through consolidations and created partnerships. More emphasis has been placed on finding savings, largely through changing the incentives for providers. Increasingly, doctors and hospitals are being paid for getting better results rather than the traditional fee-for-service system. \nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield says its new plans, announced last month, are a way to work with providers to save money. But some advocates, along with Gil and Vitale, who chairs the Senate’s health committee, say the state needs to take a more active role in regulating changing insurance plans. \n___ \nTHE PLAN \nAll the details have not yet been released on Horizon’s new plans and the OMNIA Health Alliance. The company says it can’t make all the specifics public until later this month under the federal Affordable Care Act. \nThe offerings use a tiered provider network. Under it, patients will have low or no copays or deductibles for using preferred hospitals and higher out-of-pocket expenses for using other ones. \nHorizon says the average premium will be about 15 percent lower than current plans it offers and copays and deductibles will also be lower. The company says that, factoring in premiums and out-of-pocket costs, patients would at worst have the same health care costs as they do now if they use non-preferred hospitals. \nThe insurer expects 250,000 people to be enrolled next year through their employers, by buying coverage on their own, or by choosing a plan on the federally run insurance exchange. State government is among the employers offering the Horizon Blue Cross plans; the public school employees benefit system is not. \nHorizon says it anticipates 40,000 people who are currently not insured at all to sign up. \n___ \nTHE OBJECTIONS \n“None of the legislators are opposed to changing the status quo in health care,” Vitale said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s the way that Horizon has designed and produced this product.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:58:12.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
