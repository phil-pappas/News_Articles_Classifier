It was finally passed in 2011, taking effect the following year. During that entire period and until its repeal, IPA served as a consistent and leading voice of caution, educating lawmakers and the public about its shortcomings as environmental policy. The repeal, which ultimately succeeded in 2014, ended this poorly conceived and costly law that had barely reduced emissions and could not have possibly made an impact on global temperatures.\n\"Free societies protect the environment best,\" said James Paterson , IPA's deputy executive director. \" Australia's carbon tax would have made next to no difference to the world's temperature. Australia was imposing a significant economic cost on itself for no environmental benefit - something few other nations appeared willing to do.\"\nAs the only major organization in Australia to publicly and consistently oppose the tax, the IPA's work against the carbon tax was instrumental in fostering sentiment against the tax, which, in addition to its economic drawbacks, wouldn't have achieved any environmental goals.\nIts successful 2014 carbon tax repeal campaign integrated traditional and digital media strategies, produced consistent and robust content, and demonstrated that the tax was not only costly, confusing, and ineffective, but that it actually prevented innovation in the energy industry.\nWhat : Institute of Public Affairs' Repeal the Carbon Tax campaign named one of six finalists for Atlas Network's prestigious $100,000 Templeton Freedom Award\nWhen : Nov. 12, 2015, 7:30 p.m.\nWhere : Liberty Forum & Freedom Dinner closing ceremony â€“ Capitale, 130 Bowery, New York, NY 10013 (Bowery and Grand St.)\nPress Contact : Daniel.Anthony@AtlasNetwork.org or (202) 449-8441\nAwarded since 2004, the Templeton Freedom Award is named for the late investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton.
