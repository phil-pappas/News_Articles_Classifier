This means New Zealand businesses will be able to compete for government procurement contracts in TPP countries on an equal footing with domestic suppliers \n\"TPP also includes chapters on environment and labour that will promote sustainable development and higher standards of environmental and labour protection, says Mr Groser.\" \nThe full TPP text needs to be legally verified, which involves confirming the exact technical drafting. New Zealand supports the release of the text before it is signed by TPP governments but arrangements are yet to be finalised. \nFurther fact sheets are being finalised based on the outcome of negotiations, and will be released in the coming days covering: \n- Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Purchasing (Reimbursement) \n- Government Procurement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:40:44.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
