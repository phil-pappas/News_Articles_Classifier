Col. Michelle Baldanza said the forces were deploying at the invitation of the government of Cameroon, and would coordinate their actions with the Cameroonian military. \n\"The combined activities conducted at this location are designed to better enhance the capability and capacity of our partners in the Cameroon defense forces to promote stability and security within Cameroon and the surrounding region,\" Baldanza said. \nThe surveillance flights flown by the United States are meant to help Cameroon and other partner governments in the region to better secure their borders from attack by Boko Haram and other extremist groups in the region according to Pentagon officials. Most of the surveillance flights provided by the United States would be conducted by \"unarmed remotely piloted aircraft,\" Baldanza said. \nIn a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the deployment announcement was not made due to a change in any threat assessment, but rather to assist in the regional struggle against terror groups operating there. \n\"This is obviously a unique capacity that the United States has to bring to bear to this effort and it will be used in support of the ongoing regional counter-extremist efforts that are ongoing there,\" Earnest said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:06:10.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
