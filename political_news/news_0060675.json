We recognised that in 2007 when we became a minority government.\" \nMs Hyslop said she wanted \"a bold and radical alternative to the out-of-touch structure and decision making of the BBC\". \nShe told the conference: \"The BBC is barely playing catch up with devolution, let alone leading from the front, and they know it. Promoted stories \n\"Their news and current affairs does not satisfy the audience, with over 50% saying it doesn't reflect Scotland properly. \n\"We propose a federal structure for the BBC, for governance, for editorial and management and commissioning, internal transfers of decision making and budgets can and should happen. \nThe Culture Secretary stated: \"Scotland needs a better service from the BBC, Scotland demands a better service from the BBC and Scotland must have a better service from the BBC.\" \nJohn Nicolson, a former BBC news presenter who is now SNP MP for East Dunbartonshire, said he saw the corporation as \"like a lover that has strayed\", adding: \"I want to see it return, I want to see it be faithful, I want to remember the old days and look forward to promising new ones. \nThe current charter review process presents a \"golden opportunity at the moment to change the BBC\", he said. \nMr Nicolson continued: \"We have a chance to shape it, and we're demanding some changes. We want to see the full devolution of broadcasting to Scotland, we need more investment, we need more jobs, we need a separate Scottish six o'clock news.\" \nDoug Thomson, an SNP activist from Edinburgh, said the BBC \"lies at the heart of so much of civic life\" in Scotland and the UK but added that \"in recent times the Beeb has lost its way\". Share article \nHe said: \"With devolved assemblies governing successfully in the three Celtic nations, we have in the BBC an institution with a structure, governance and commitment to regional programming which has remained Londoncentric, metropolitan and lacking in accountability to the people of Scotland that successful institutions must have in a post-devolution world.\" \nHe continued: \"The BBC isn't broken but it isn't fit for purpose, and instead needs to be rehabilitated. It is time for Scotland to have full control over broadcasting.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:06:06.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
