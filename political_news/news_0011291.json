United States . This report summarizes U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, explains the methodology, discusses how approaches of other researchers to the study of sentencing practices differ from this approach, and defines disparity as used in this study.\nThis working paper was prepared by Abt Associates for BJS in response to a request by the Department of Justice's Racial Disparities Working Group to design a study of federal sentencing disparity. Data are from BJS's Federal Justice Statistics Program, which annually collects federal criminal justice processing data from various federal agencies, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission.\nTITLE: Federal Sentencing Disparity: 2005–2012 (NCJ 248768)\nAUTHORS: William Rhodes , Ryan Ling , Jeremy Luallen , and Christina Dyous\nWHERE: http://www.bjs.gov\nThe Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Assistant Attorney General Karol V.
