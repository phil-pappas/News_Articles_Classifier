Shortly afterward two high-level managers fled, one bare-chested and the other with his shirt and suit jacket shredded.\nRoad access to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris was briefly disrupted, and some flights suffered delays.\nAlthough Monday's scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage — or \"boss-napping\" — to make a point.\nAir France denounced the violence and said it will push ahead anyway with its restructuring plans, after failing to reach an agreement with pilots.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, said the company is being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday's meeting was intended to detail the cuts.\nAirline executives told reporters Monday the plan involves laying off 2,900 staff, abolishing five routes and 35 weekly long-haul flights, primarily in Asia and the Middle East.\nAmong those at Monday's protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:41:32.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
