The first location in Kentucky will open on Friday, October 16 in Fayette Mall at 3401 Nicholasville Road off of Nicholasville and New Circle Roads. Kentucky franchisee Mark Mehrizi is set to open a second Pie Five on South Broadway before the end of the year and have up to 10 in development.\n\"We're bringing Pie Five to the Commonwealth because it's fast, fresh and fun, and this is a family and college community that we feel will love the brand,\" said Pie Five franchise partner Mark Mehrizi . \"The residents of Lexington will enjoy the farm-fresh ingredients for one low price, which makes it ideal for everyone.\"\nMehrizi, whose career spans more than two decades of food service and franchising experience, set his sights on Pie Five after learning about the trend-setting chain's rapid growth across the country. Having been a successful franchise owner of Frankfort's Pizza Inn restaurant since 1991, it didn't take Mehrizi long to determine that Pie Five Pizza – a subsidiary of Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: RAVE) – would be the perfect fit for the local marketplace.\nPie Five is sharing the whole pie with the central Kentucky community by donating all proceeds from its pre-opening events to the one of the 100 charities participating in the Bluegrass Community Foundation's 2015 GoodGiving Guide Challenge for the most creative social media post about Pie Five's grand opening. Pie Five will also donate $5,000 to the challenge's charity whose supporters visit Pie Five the most from October 19 to November 12 . The winner will be announced November 13 at the launch of the GoodGiving Challenge.\nAt Pie Five, guests can choose from more than a million combinations of farm fresh ingredients, artisan sauces and handcrafted crust varieties. Pie Five pies bake in just 145 seconds in a custom-designed, state-of-the-art oven. By the time the guest arrives at the register, their hot, bubbly, pizza perfection is ready. Additionally, they can add one of Pie Five's freshly-tossed handmade salads served in a baked pizza dough bowl or a decadent home-baked brownie or cookie pie to their meal. The rapidly expanding chain is capitalizing on growing consumer demand for fresh dining options and artisan pizzas without the wait.\nABOUT PIE FIVE PIZZA CO.\nDallas -based Pie Five Pizza Co. is a subsidiary of RAVE Restaurant Group, Inc.
