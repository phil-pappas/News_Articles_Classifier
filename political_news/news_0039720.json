(Sergey Guneyev/RIA-Novosti, Kremlin Pool Photo via Associated Press) (Sergey Guneyev/AP) By David Ignatius Opinion writer October 20 at 8:23 PM Follow @ignatiuspost The godfather of Russia’s military intervention in Syria is Yevgeny Primakov , a former prime minister and intelligence chief and for decades his nation’s leading Arabist. A hint of Primakov’s influence on Russian President Vladimir Putin came in the unusual eulogy that Putin delivered at his friend’s funeral in Moscow four months ago.\n“Primakov had global vision and was open and bold in his thinking,” Putin told mourners . By asserting Russia’s interests and power, Primakov “got the country through a very serious crisis” after the fall of the Soviet Union. His understanding of the Middle East was “tremendous,” and his influence beyond Russia was “undeniable,” Putin said.\nDavid Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.

By sending Russian warplanes, troops and tanks to Syria, Putin has launched one of Russia’s boldest military moves since 1945. He has begun to restore Primakov’s dream of Russian influence in the Arab world, but at a cost of assuming the burden of fighting Muslim extremism, an effort that has been so draining for the United States.\nPrimakov symbolized the idea that Russian power was not dead in the post-Soviet era, and that Moscow was not a permanent junior partner to Washington. His defining moment came in 1999, when as prime minister he turned around his plane on the way to the United States and flew home after learning that NATO would be intervening militarily in Kosovo, against Russian wishes.\nRussians called the mid-Atlantic course reversal “", "external_links": ["http://en.special.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/49782", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/world/europe/yevgeny-primakov-former-premier-of-russia-dies-at-85.html", "https://www.facebook.com/davidignatiusbooks", "https://twitter.com/@ignatiuspost"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:57:08.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
