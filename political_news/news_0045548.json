This is a big deal in Hawaii, where sovereignty is a controversial issue—and one that I often encountered during my time as a reporter covering politics in Honolulu. \nI ’ ve always been surprised by how little is taught in American history—in my Pennsylvania high school and Michigan college courses, anyway—about the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom, and the subsequent U.S. annexation of Hawaii in 1898. This moment in colonial history is revealing in ways that 10 extra textbook chapters about the founding fathers (seriously, enough already) could never be. \nThe New York Times covered the annexation ceremony in 1898, but I always preferred the account by Mabel Clare Craft Deering in Hawaii Nei , published in 1899.\nShe writes of the scene outside ʻIolani Palace—where Hawaii’s queen had been imprisoned after the overthrow of her monarchy—as the transfer of sovereignty took place, making Hawaii a territory. (It became a state in 1959.) Deering’s description is agonizing, and underscores the emotional intensity of outliving one’s country: \nBy this time it lacked but six minutes of noon, and the quavering strains of [Hawaii’s national anthem] “Hawaii Ponoi” were heard, coming up with but half the usual volume... There was a sob and a heartbreak in it, and before the end came an almost complete breakdown. Even the leader's baton was moving through a mist of tears; for he had written the music years before, and the memory of these times when he had played it rushed over him with irresistible force.\nHandkerchiefs were out on the platform now, and ministers' wives and cabinet ladies who had been born under this flag, with its eight stripes of red, white, and blue, and the English jack in the corner, were not ashamed to wipe their eyes. The men were frowning fiercely and trying to wink back the tears, but some of them wept audibly and forgot to be ashamed... There were twenty-one guns, the last national salute of the Hawaiian flag...\nThe bugles rose and fell in the ever-melancholy \"taps,\" and while every one held the breath, the beautiful flag of Hawaii trembled for an instant, then started, and slowly, gracefully sank down the halyards to the ground, where it was caught by loving hands and reverently folded. Just as it started in its descent, the clouds broke away, and a square of the blue Hawaiian sky showed itself as if in farewell and blessing. A great sigh went up from the thousands of upturned faces, and many upon whom the flag had no claim wept for sympathy.\nA century after that ceremony, the Hawaiian flag was again raised over ʻIolani Palace. It remains there today, a symbol that is both sacred and painful for those who understand its meaning. And yet sovereignty for the people who trace their roots to the Islands remains a complicated and unresolved question.\nMore Notes From The Atlantic What We're Following This Morning 6:00 AM ET If You're in D.C.

The growing season in New Hampshire is spectacularly short—sometimes only eight weeks—but my mother tried to take full advantage of it, growing dill, thyme, sage, mint, rosemary, and at least six varieties of basil, as well as tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, squash, beans, peas, peppers, broccoli, chard, and zucchini.\n\r \r She would harvest the herbs throughout the summer, tying small bundles together with twine and drying them along a clothesline that ran the length of the basement. The vegetable plants produced less regularly, but from mid-July onwards we could reliably eat fresh produce every evening, and by August we had a surplus. At that point my mother would begin canning what we couldn’t eat, storing the vividly colored contents in transparent Mason jars that would reappear throughout the fall and winter—like a bit of summer preserved in amber.\n\r \r Continue Reading AP The Slave-State Origins of Modern Gun Rights Saul Cornell and Eric M. Ruben The idea that citizens have an unfettered constitutional right to carry weapons in public originates in the antebellum South, and its culture of violence and honor.\nGun-rights advocates have waged a relentless battle to gut what remains of America’s lax and inadequate gun regulations. In the name of the Second Amendment, they are challenging the constitutionality of state and municipal “may issue” regulations that restrict the right to carry weapons in public to persons who can show a compelling need to be armed. A few courts are starting to take these challenges seriously. But what the advocates do not acknowledge—and some courts seem not to understand—is that their arguments are grounded in precedent unique to the violent world of the slaveholding South.\n\r \r Claims that “may issue” regulations are unconstitutional have been rejected by most federal appellate courts—that is, until last year, when a court in California broke ranks and struck down San Diego’s public-carry regulation. This year, a court did the same with the District of Columbia’s rewritten handgun ordinance. Both decisions face further review from appellate courts, and perhaps also by the Supreme Court. If the justices buy this expansive view of the Second Amendment, laws in states such as New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Hawaii with the strictest public carry regulations—and some of the lowest rates of gun homicide—will be voided as unconstitutional.\n\r \r Continue Reading Andrew B.
