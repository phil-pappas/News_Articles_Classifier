But, back then, human rights activists pointed out that the policies contained in this legislation would erode basic freedoms while, at the same time, entrenching a view that British Muslims were by default guilty until proven otherwise.\nUK's Muslims and the debate over their 'Britishness'\nA new way of community policing\nNow, operating without their former coalition partners, the unencumbered Conservatives have seemingly taken things even further down that path.\nHard though it is to pinpoint the stupidest part of the government's new policy proposals announced earlier this month, let's start with the idea of revoking the citizenship of people who \"reject our values\". Since one of our core values as a nation-state is in fact citizenship, maybe we can start by taking citizenship away from the government officials proposing this distinctly undemocratic idea.\nNext up is the framing of this new policy itself, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling on Muslim communities to \"own\" the problem of Islamist extremism. Way to alienate and demonise the very community whose help and trust you are trying to gain, Cameron. Violent Islamist extremism is a collective problem, one we need to collectively \"own\" if we are to stand a chance of combating it.\nThe thing that counter-extremism advocates and community workers consistently urge is that we try to stop conversations from going underground and into the dark corners of the internet. Radicalisation is most effective when the people being targeted are cut off and isolated.\nA core and deeply worrying component of these new proposals (building on suggestions in that February counterterror Act) is that universities, schools, the health service and other public bodies start to monitor for extremism . Leaving aside the obvious point that doctors and nurses really shouldn't be recruited as intelligence officers, what exactly is it that they are supposed to be looking for?\nThe government hasn't adequately defined \"extremism\", so what is it that public officials are supposed to use as cues? Is it being critical of the government's Middle East policy - since that sort of stance, while being Muslim, will already get you on a watchlist?\nIs it that someone might be an advocate for Islamic law, even if that person has no intention of using violence to make that belief a practical reality? Really, it's anybody's guess - and guessing is the last thing we should be doing here.\nBut it's even worse than that when it comes to education: Never mind the massive encroachment on free speech, although that is bad enough. So bad, in fact, that not just free speech advocates, but also security officials have voiced concern.\nSir Peter Fahy, chief constable of the Greater Manchester Police, just days ago said the government's proposals could turn the force into \"thought police\". He went on to say, \"There is a concern that efforts to control extremist narratives will limit free speech and backfire if we don't get the balance right. The efforts to control extremism and limit protest ... may undermine the very rights and British values you seek to protect.\"\nAnd so, even according to a police chief, we've properly tipped over the edge, using security as a pretext to come down on free speech.\nPushing extremism underground\nThe thing that counter-extremism advocates and community workers consistently urge is that we try to stop conversations from going underground and into the dark corners of the internet. Radicalisation is most effective when the people being targeted are cut off and isolated.\nSo what does the British government go and do? Propose measures that will make students worry that what they say is being monitored and could be reported to the authorities. In other words: Take extremist talk out of public forums - where it can be exposed, challenged, confronted - and put it in the dark, where it can fester and mutate. Exactly the thing we're supposed to be trying to avoid.", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11939380/David-Cameron-Extremists-and-hate-preachers-to-be-treated-like-paedophiles.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/mar/02/counter-terrorism-duties-schools-need-to-know", "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/6/contents/enacted/data.htm", "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/19/government-extremism-crackdown-hurt-uk-values-peter-fahy-manchester", "https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/sites/default/files/Liberty"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:57:52.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
