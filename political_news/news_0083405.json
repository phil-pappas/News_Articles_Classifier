In effect, privy counsellors - which included noblemen, the clergy and officers of the crown - were the chief governing body and fulfilled the role that the Cabinet performs today.\nIn legal terms, the Cabinet is a committee of the Privy Council.\nIn terms of political influence, the Council was perhaps at its most influential in Tudor times - when it comprised of about 40 members and was used by monarchs for a variety of different purposes, both to advise on matters of war and peace and on occasions to circumvent Parliament and the courts.\nThere were separate Privy Councils in England and Scotland prior to the 1707 Act of Union between the two countries.\nWith the development of a constitutional monarchy in the 18th and 19th Century, under which the sovereign acts on the advice of ministers, the Privy Council has adapted to become an administrative link between the monarch and the government of the day with limited, formal functions.\nWho sits on the Privy Council?\nThere are about 600 privy counsellors at the moment, including all former prime ministers and cabinet ministers as well as leaders of the opposition.\nOther members include Prince Philip and Prince Charles, the current and former Speakers of the House of Commons, Archbishops, senior Bishops, senior courtiers, senior backbenchers and and senior judges. In practice, its regular meetings are only attended by Cabinet or very senior ministers.\nMPs who are privy counsellors are referred to as right honourable members in the House of Commons.\nHow often does it meet?\nThe body convenes, on average, about once a month and its meetings - known as councils - are presided over by The Queen.\nIt has met six times so far this year. The last meeting was on 15 July at Buckingham Palace , attended by Lord President of the Privy Council Chris Grayling, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Leader of the House of Lords Baroness Stowell and Culture Secretary John Whittingdale.\nThe quorum required for each meeting, with a few exceptions, is three plus the Lord President.\nThe government rejects suggestions that the Privy Council is a secretive body, pointing out that details of all its meetings, attendees and the matters discussed are published in the Court Circular. Its decisions are also published on the Privy Council website.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14E59/production/_85939558_85939557.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34471813", "http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Orders-in-Council-15-jul-15-part-1.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:03:58.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
