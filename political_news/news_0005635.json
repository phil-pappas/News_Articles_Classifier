Only 335 city voters had cast absentee ballots by mid-week — less than half a percent of all registered voters. About 800 other voters had requested absentee ballots but had not returned them by Wednesday, according to Joe Debney, director of the Charleston County Board of Elections and Voter Registration. “It’s been light, and I’m kind of surprised,” he said. “My surprise is because Mayor (Joe) Riley is not running, I had expected a little bit more push.” The story is similar with other municipalities. In North Charleston, which has a contested mayor’s race and many contested City Council races, 287 had cast absentee ballots, or about 0.7 percent. In Mount Pleasant, which has four council races and a recreation referendum, only 92 of 58,636 registered voters have voted absentee. And 313 more have requested absentee ballots. South Carolina doesn’t have early voting per se, but the state allows voters to cast early, absentee ballots for one of many reasons. Some of these include that the voter is older than 65, has a disability, has to work on Election Day or will be out of town. Absentee voting has been an indicator of turnout in general elections, where the lines can be long. But there also may be less of a push this year because there are fewer races and areas involved in municipal elections. Reach Robert Behre at (843) 937-5771 or at twitter.com/RobertFBehre.
