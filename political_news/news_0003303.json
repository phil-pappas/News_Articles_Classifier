The Government has been involved in long negotiations with China to stop this fumigation process. \n\"This is depressing news especially for New Zealand which is the most affected by a hole in the ozone layer. \n\"The world banned aerosol CFCs 25 years ago with the landmark Montreal Protocol. This averted an epidemic of skin cancers and food shortages in New Zealand. \n\"Now in spite of Montreal we are faced with a further increase in HCFCs when this gas was supposed to be largely phased out by the end of 2014. \n\"The Government must act to ensure we are eliminating the use of these ozone depleting gases before the ozone layer is damaged again,\" says Megan Woods. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:27.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
