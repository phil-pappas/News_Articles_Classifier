Photo: Pool/Getty Images\nMalia Obama emerged from her first Snapchat “scandal” as a perfect-haired high-achiever who is maybe too cool for freshman dorm parties. And now there's an Instagram making its way around the internet that people believe depicts Sasha Obama with her homecoming date. If it is her, this image only confirms that the Obama daughters are navigating teenhood with impressive style.\nHere, she strikes the classic “Pre-Homecoming in Mom’s Living Room” pose. While my homecoming outfits tended to be a horror show of Cache dresses and Aldo platform sandals (the uniform of a teen who made zero good decisions), Sasha has opted for a simple, on-trend oxblood dress and '90s inspired K-Swiss sneakers. She looks adorable, comfortable, and cooler than everyone else. Also — and I say this with a reporter’s objectivity — her date is very adorable and looks like a “nice boy.” Sound decisions all around, Sasha.", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/p/89mWN1oNne/embed/"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:48:20.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
