Pope Francis blessed Michael, who has cerebral palsy, during his visit to the United States. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) October 23 at 4:53 PM I had tears in my eyes by the time I finished reading The Post’s extraordinary article “ A sense of awe ” [front page, Oct. 13].\nThe Keatings’ story is an incredible testimony to the power of faith and love. How blessed they are to have one another. And how wonderful it was that the pope’s moment with Michael Keating added a special endorsement of what it truly means to be a child of God and to be loved completely and unselfishly by an entire family.\nThe pitch-perfect writing set the tone for the lessons that were contained within this article and for the message that should resonate with each one of us every day.\nThis article made a difference in my life and, I hope, in the lives of many others, regardless of their faith. May God continue to bless Michael and his family as they continue to live the pope’s message to the world.\nBeth L. Veihmeyer , Potomac\n●\nThe Oct. 12 Style article “ Bubble-free (and loving it) ” seemed curious about, or even bemused by, Ann Romney’s use of the phrase “eternal perspectives.” Members of the Mormon Church know what it means, as do other people of faith.\nEternal perspective lifts people such as the Keating family [“ A sense of awe ,” front page, Oct. 13] above the stresses and strains of difficulties by keeping them connected to the God who loves them. They know that interacting with the least-able person can bring great joy, that love and commitment to family surpass individual agendas and that one can feel honored to put another’s comfort ahead of one’s own.\nEven people such as Romney who can afford Valentino shoes are able to appreciate those types of life lessons and perspectives.\nAmy Henderson , Leonardtown", "external_links": ["http://xml.apache.org/xslt"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:24:07.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
