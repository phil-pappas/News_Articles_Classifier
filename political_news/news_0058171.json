The United States and Israel have both heightened their attention and commitment to advancing neuroscience research over the last decade.\n\"For years the United States and Israel have worked to promote and support joint research efforts and scientific advancement. This bill will strengthen that relationship by funding new and existing research and technology development with the potential to accelerate our understanding of the human brain,\" Congressman Fattah said. \"We know that in order to make significant neuroscience advancements we must work together with other nations who share our goal of finding cures and treatments to brain disease. The US-Israel Global Neuroscience Partnership Act will unleash a new era of cooperation and collaboration between two great nations already leading in neuroscience and neurotechnology.\"\nThe bill will direct the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in conjunction with Israel's Ministry of Science and the Office of the Chief Scientist, to award grants that support neuroscience-related research and technology development. Eligible entities will include any combination of U.S. or Israeli universities, researchers, or private companies invested in neuroscience projects. The legislation will also establish a U.S.-Israel Neuroscience Advisory Committee under NIH.\nThis legislation will build on successful partnerships like the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), but with a greater focus on bringing similar success to brain science.\nIn two successive visits to Israel , Congressman Fattah has discussed his efforts to increase joint neuroscience ventures between the two countries. Last March, he joined leaders of brain initiatives around the world in Tel Aviv to stress the need for increased international collaboration as a means of developing new technologies and tools to explore and repair the human brain.\nCongressman Fattah is leading efforts in Congress to elevate neuroscience as a national priority. In 2011, he established the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative that works both within the U.S. and around the globe to enhance cooperation and collaboration amongst researchers, doctors, government officials, and other stakeholders in the brain research and technology fields. Earlier this year, Fattah successfully increased neuroscience funding for the National Science Foundation to a record $146.9 million in the FY 16 Appropriations Bill .\nwww.fattah.house.gov\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275438\n releases/fattah-introduces-legislation-to-strengthen-us-israel-neuroscience-partnership-300156964.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://fattah.house.gov/press/congressional-science-appropriator-stresses-international-neuroscience-collaboration-in-israel/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fattah-introduces-legislation-to-strengthen-us-israel-neuroscience-partnership-300156964.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.fattah.house.gov/fattah-neuroscience-initiative/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151008/275438", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275438", "http://www.fattah.house.gov/", "http://fattah.house.gov/press/fy16-commerce-justice-science-appropriations-bill-includes-40-million-increase-for-neuroscience/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24103&Transmission_Id=201510081601PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24103&DateId=20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:59:20.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
