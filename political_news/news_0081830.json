The seminar was held on 26 September 2015 in Brvenica, Tetovo. Recreational activities were organised with women shown with their domestic products and skills. These activities were of great importance for SGIP members. The interest of women to join the union is large, and the rights of employment is almost equal as men. SGIP will continue to work this way in order to improve workers' conditions in these sectors and increase its members. distributed by This content was issued by BWI - Building and Wood Worker's International on the 2015-10-04 and was initially posted on www.bwint.org.
