It is possible that the Government could preference foreign and corporate interests. \n\"The sale of SOEs, foreign ownership of sensitive lands like Crafar farms, watered down first right of refusal provisions are all examples of the Government failing to meet Maori obligations. \n\"Australia can still restrict foreign buyers of its homes. Malaysia can still ban foreign ownership of affordable housing but now it seems the Government has negotiated away our rights to protect our land. \n\"Maori are in a stronger position to partner and co-invest in a range of opportunities that would support economic growth for all of New Zealand while retaining our greatest resource - land. \n\"The Government is treating all New Zealanders with contempt. Our sovereignty is utmost when signing up to trade deals and access to markets should not be at the cost of our ability to legislate in our own interests. \n\"Sadly the Government will be calling on its band of Maori cheerleaders to sing the praises of the TPP. We are yet to see those same people front up to explain,\" says Nanaia Mahuta. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
