But party elders worry that escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric could cost Republicans the White House in 2016. \nThe aggressive words, in particular from front-runners Donald Trump and Ben Carson, have exacerbated a widening rift between the GOP’s pragmatic and ideological wings as the party tries to avoid losing a third-consecutive presidential election. \nHis relationship with the nation’s Hispanic community already strained, Trump vowed Wednesday to deport any Syrian refugee taken in by the U.S. Most likely would be Muslim, and Trump warned they could be Islamic State militants in disguise. \n“If I win, they’re going back,” the billionaire businessman said. \nCarson, a retired neurosurgeon, launched a petition Thursday challenging the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy group’s tax-exempt status, escalating his ongoing rift with the U.S. Muslim community. \nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations last month called for Carson to quit the presidential race after he said a Muslim should not serve as president. He has since clarified his position, stating he wouldn’t support a radical Muslim who did not support the Constitution. And in a Thursday radio interview, Carson said the same standard should apply to a Supreme Court justice. \nHe said Islam is “a lifestyle” that he’d “need to know about” before making an appointment to the nation’s highest court. \n“If I were the one nominating such a person, I would spend a good deal of time looking at their background and seeing if it is consistent with the kinds of standards that we expect from such a position,” Carson told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, adding that a nominee would have to publicly reject Islamic law. \nThere are currently no Supreme Court vacancies, and no presidential candidates adhere to Muslim law, although some conservatives have repeatedly tried to link President Barack Obama to Islam. He is a Christian. \nThe focus on Islam comes as Republicans work to repair a strained relationship with the nation’s surging Hispanic population, a critical voting bloc in presidential elections. The U.S. Muslim population is a fraction of the size of the Hispanic community, yet the party’s overall tone could complicate broader outreach efforts. \nPolitical observers in both parties agree, among them, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. More than anything, he said of his lessons from his failed campaign, is that Republicans must do a better job at connecting with minority voters. \nForeign policy analyst Rula Jebreal cited a sharp shift in the GOP’s present-day tone compared to 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and former President George W. Bush, who visited a mosque shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks to demonstrate religious tolerance. \n“Islamophobia is now an industry,” Jebreal said. “In the long run it will hurt the Republican Party, and it will hurt the country in general.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:09:46.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
