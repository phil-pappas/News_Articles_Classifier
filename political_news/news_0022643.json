The Chief Ombudsman ticked the Prime Minister off over this. \n\"The Government should treat the Court’s decision as a sharp reminder that it has an obligation to weigh the public interest when it decides whether there are legitimate reasons to withhold information from the people of New Zealand. \n\"Tim Groser needs to realise that’s he’s not a KGB agent and we live in an open democracy with rules and standards about the free flow of information. \n\"The Court’s decision shows that Tim Groser wouldn’t let democracy stand in the way of his TPPA crusade. \n\"It’s important that we acknowledge the groups and people who successfully challenged the Government’s unlawful approach to the OIA - Consumer New Zealand, Ngati Kahungunu, Oxfam NZ, Greenpeace NZ, the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists, New Zealand Nurses Organisation, the Tertiary Education Union, and Professor Jane Kelsey - because they have fought to uphold New Zealand’s democracy. \n\"This a somewhat hollow victory as the TPPA has now been finalised, so Tim Groser’s unlawful behaviour has served its purpose of keeping vital TPPA information secret from New Zealanders during the TPPA negotiations,\" Dr Norman said. \nBackground note: \nEight applicants challenged a decision by Trade Minister Tim Groser not to release any information about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement that was requested under the Official Information Act. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
