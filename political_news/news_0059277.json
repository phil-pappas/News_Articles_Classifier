Calling it a “natural reaction,” he said leaders ‘need to change their mindset or get beaten up by the people in public view”. \nHe warned the Naveen Patnaik -led Odisha government over “rising cases of religious conversion” in the state. \n“We don’t want to intervene in the matter. But, if Odisha government doesn’t stop it, we have to intervene,” he said, demanding Hindu temples and mutts must be protected in the state. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:48:20.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
