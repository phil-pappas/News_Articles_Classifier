A SEPTA mechanic was able to dismantle the seat, allowing a transit police officer to retrieve the snake and return it to Riley.\nSEPTA policy allows riders to bring service animals or small, contained pets onto trains or buses.\nPolice say they haven't decided if charges will be filed.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
