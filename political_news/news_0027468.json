The National Association of Manufacturers and other groups had lobbied the White House in recent months and spent millions on a TV ad campaign decrying the pending ozone rule as an overreach and a job killer. \n\"We know that this regulation could have been worse, but it still feels like a punch in the gut,\" said Tom Riordan, president and CEO of the Wisconsin-based Neenah Enterprises Inc. and task force leader for the manufacturers group. \n\"Manufacturers are tough and resilient, but when Washington puts politics above job creation, we still pay a price,\" Riordan said in a statement. \nManufacturers across the country, especially smaller companies, \"will be forced to choose between navigating this rule and hiring new workers, between complying with Washington's mandates and giving raises to their employees,\" he said.
