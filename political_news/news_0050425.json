Although it was widely publicised in the media, the letter was passed to police only on 2 June, after the former home secretary was questioned.\nMr Watson has refused to apologise for his role in the Brittan case, telling MPs earlier this month that he was right to demand that guidelines were adhered to and said abuse survivors had been \"belittled for too long\".\nImage copyright Crown Prosecution Service Image caption Director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders will give evidence about the Crown Prosecution Service's response The MP, who as a backbencher led parliamentary calls for a public inquiry into child abuse allegations against public figures, has been criticised by Conservative MPs - one of whom said he had appointed himself \"witchfinder general\".\nEarlier this month, the Met published the key findings of a report into the handling of the Brittan case.\nIt revealed investigating officers told the complainant in April that there would not have been a prosecution for rape had Lord Brittan still been alive - a move which a Met spokesman says was \"premature\", as the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June.\nHowever, Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time as the complainant was. Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case.\nThe Met has accepted that Lord Brittan's solicitors should have been informed at the same time as the complainant.\n'Helpful updates' Relatives of people who die while under investigation would not normally be contacted after their death and would not be told what the outcome would have been, or whether charges would have been brought, it said.\nBut the Met said it recognised that the public interest in the case required \"a different approach\" and that, as a result, it would ask another force to carry out a review of its handling of the case \"to ensure it was thorough, properly conducted and to identify good practice\".\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is abroad and will not attend Wednesday's hearing although Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan and Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse will appear.\nAn independent public inquiry into child abuse started work last year, although it has faced a series of setbacks after its first two proposed chairs were forced to quit before taking up their duties and one of its panel members stood down.\nKeith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the home affairs committee, said the public inquiry - now chaired by Judge Lowell Goddard - remained the \"most appropriate channel\" for criminal allegations to be examined and Wednesday's hearing would not cover operational matters.\nHe added: \"Our evidence session is therefore intended as a continuation of the regular series of very helpful regular updates which the committee received from the Metropolitan Police in the last Parliament and to hear evidence on a particular case.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/81C8/production/_86242233_watsonepa.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34521873", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15DBE/production/_86243598_86243597.jpg", "http://news.met.police.uk/news/lady-brittan-apology-mps-publishes-key-findings-from-report-133664", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34509582"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:49:32.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
