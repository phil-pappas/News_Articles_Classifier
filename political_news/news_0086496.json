With the saturated ground, flooding is also anticipated to be problematic. Dominion reminds customers to avoid driving through flooded areas where downed power lines and other submerged hazards may be hidden. Remember to keep at least 30 feet away from downed wires and call 911 if there is an immediate threat of danger. Flooding in low-lying areas could also hamper the restoration process as crews try to gain access to make repairs.\nBecause Dominion began preparations early in the week in anticipation of severe weather, the company is fully staffed with line and tree crews and other personnel ready to respond to outages if they occur.\nCustomers can report their outage and track the restoration progress online at www.dom.com/outages , or by calling 1-866-DOM-HELP .
