In their platform, released earlier this week, the party proposed placing a cap on how much can be claimed through the deduction. Justin Trudeau makes Innovation announcement 2:05 \nBy capping the amount, the Liberals estimate they can realize $560 million a year, although unlike the NDP, they haven't specifically targeted where that money will go. The counter-spin \nAt first glance, eliminating or capping the stock option deduction is low-hanging fruit for any party looking for a reliable source of revenue to pay for campaign promises. After all, why should rich CEOs get a tax break on their compensation package that none of the rest of us get on our paycheques? \nBut it turns out that it is not just bank presidents and industrial tycoons who take advantage of this deduction. \nStock options are also a popular form of compensation for high tech startups that don't have much cash on hand to compensate senior managers and engineers. Those people are in high demand, and stock options are one important way of attracting and retaining them. \nNot surprisingly, the tech industry did not respond well to the NDP's plan to eliminate the stock option deduction. \nTobi Lutke, the CEO of Shopify Inc., an Ottawa-based retail merchant software firm that went public last spring, warned \"there will be a lot less technology startups\" if stock options are made fully taxable. \nCanada's burgeoning tech industry is a big source of well-paying, non-polluting jobs, many of them in electorally sensitive areas like southwestern Ontario and B.C.'s lower mainland. \nNo politician wants to be seen doing anything that might get in its way. So when the tech guys scream during an election campaign, their voices tend to get heard. \nWhich is why Mulcair, in a letter written on Sept. 25, declared that contrary to his announcement last spring, his plan to fully tax stock option deductions \"excludes options granted by early stage companies.\" \nAnd it's why the Liberal platform calls stock options \"a useful compensation tool for startup companies,\" and promised that employees with up to $100,000 in annual stock option gains would be unaffected by any new cap. The rinse \nThere is widespread agreement among people who study this issue that eliminating stock option deductions is wise public policy. \nLindsay Tedds, a professor in the School of Public Administration at the University of Victoria, calls employee stock options \"a poor, indeed perverse, form of executive compensation,\" and their preferential tax treatment \"only exacerbates the problem.\" \nA report issued earlier this month by Jack Mintz and V. Balaji Venkatachalam of the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary declared that \"the NDP and the Liberals are onto a good idea in proposing a more efficient way to tax stock options. Regardless of who wins the election, it is the right approach.\" \nBut having the right approach doesn't necessarily mean it will achieve the desired result, Mintz and Venkatachalam point out. And there are several reasons to believe that all that new revenue the opposition parties hope to generate by fully taxing stock options will never materialize. \nThe NDP says its plan will yield $500 million in each of the next four years, but that assumes companies will continue to issue as many stock options after the tax advantage has been removed as they did before. \nBut in fact, the popularity of stock options as a form of compensation has been in decline for several years, even with the tax break. \nEmployees have increasingly been opting for other forms of compensation, like receiving actual shares of companies rather than options because there is less risk involved. \nIn 2014, grants of stock options to the CEOs of Canada's 100 largest companies fell an average of 40 per cent, while grants of share units rose by 37 per cent. Removing the tax deduction on stock options will likely only accelerate that trend, making less money available every year for the NDP's fight against child poverty. \nAnother problem, as Mintz and Venkatachalam point out in their report, is that while employees currently benefit from the stock option deduction, the companies issuing them are actually penalized because they don't get to deduct their value from their corporate income tax as they would if they paid that compensation as salary. \nThe authors argue that if the personal deduction were removed, employers would have to be allowed to take the same deduction as they do with any other form of compensation. And once you do that, there is no net gain to be realized from fully taxing stock options. \nIn fact, they calculate that there would be a net loss to provincial and federal governments of about $12 million. \n\"Moving to full taxation of stock option compensation is appropriate with respect to efficiency and equity,\" they conclude, \"but there is little money to be gained.\" \nAnd that means the opposition parties will have to find money somewhere else to fund their war on child poverty and other election promises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:36:49.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
