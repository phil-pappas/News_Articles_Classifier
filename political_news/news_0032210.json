(AP) - Wisconsin Republicans are moving at breakneck speed to abolish secret investigations into political corruption, do away with the state’s unique nonpartisan elections board and loosen campaign finance rules. \nThe moves come after Republicans were angered by a secret investigation of Gov. Scott Walker that was approved by the elections board and focused on coordination with conservative issue advocacy groups. \nRepublicans deny they’re seeking retribution for the probe, which the state Supreme Court in July ended as unconstitutional. But Democrats and independent observers say the changes will transform the state’s elections and regulatory process, making it more difficult to investigate politicians for wrongdoing in office. \nWalker on Friday signed a measure eliminating the so-called John Doe investigations and he is generally supportive of the other two proposals. \n___ Flags lowered for Wisconsin airman killed in Afghanistan \nMILWAUKEE (AP) - Flags are flying at half-staff across the state for a Wisconsin airman killed in Afghanistan. \nTwenty-one-year-old Airman Quinn Johnson-Harris was a 2012 graduate of Homestead High School in the Milwaukee suburb of Mequon.
