All have strong evangelical support. \nAlso appearing will be former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina . \nFiorina saw a surge in the polls following her debate performances, while Bush has relied on strong fundraising. But both are looking to woo Christian conservatives, and could do so at the forum. \nTexas moved up its presidential primary, and is scheduled to be the largest of 13 states voting on \"Super Tuesday\" March 1. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:15:54.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
