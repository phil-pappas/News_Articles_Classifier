(AP) — An 18-year-old who shot another teenager to death during an altercation in a Taco Bell parking lot has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.\nThe Aurora Sentinel reports (http://goo.gl/J6v2WZ ) Sterling Dillon Hook was sentenced Tuesday for the June 4, 2014, death of Mark Chalfant. Hook pleaded guilty in August to second-degree murder.\nHe was one of four teens arrested in connection with the slaying, which police say stemmed from a marijuana deal gone bad.\nThree of the teens, including Hook, were arrested two weeks after the shooting and were later charged as adults. The fourth teen, a 15-year-old boy, was arrested almost a year after the shooting.\nPolice say the drug deal involved a small amount of marijuana.\n———\nInformation from: The Aurora Sentinel, http://www.aurorasentinel.com/\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/J6v2WZ", "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:34:01.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
