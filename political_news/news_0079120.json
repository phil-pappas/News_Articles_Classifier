Second, they want the Department of Energy to reverse a decision to stop spinning the uranium centrifuges at the proposed American Centrifuge Plant, which has operated under a research and development test site for the past few years. It has struggled for years to secure federal funding in a quest to become the only domestic source of enriched uranium in the United States.\nIn meetings with Reps. Bill Johnson, R-Marietta, Brad Wenstrup, R-Cincinnati, and Steve Stivers, R-Upper Arlington; and Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the group urged lawmakers to continue to fight for the cleanup and the uranium-enrichment plant.\nThey argue that because the government used the land, it is obligated to clean it up so that the community can use it again. The government has spent at least $2.6 billion on cleanup but in June sent a letter to Portman moving back the targeted completion time for the project from 2024 to between 2044 and 2052.\n“Enough is enough,” said Adams County Commissioner Steve Caraway. “Clean it up.”\nThe group also worries about losing a skilled workforce and wasting taxpayer dollars by closing the American Centrifuge Plant yet still paying to keep its contents safe and secure.\nThe visit to Washington came after notices warning of potential layoffs went out in August to 500 employees working on the cleanup — and then, weeks later, 235 more were sent out to those working at the American Centrifuge Plant.\nMoney for the cleanup was eventually extended through Dec. 11, when the current federal funding bill expires.\nDoug Coleman, a Scioto County commissioner who also made the trip, said: “We can’t afford any more job loss.”\njwehrman@dispatch.com \n@jessicawehrman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:03:57.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
