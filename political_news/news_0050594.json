Israeli media later reported the toddler was lightly injured.\nPolice Spokeswoman Luba Samri said the Palestinian attacker took a gun from one of the wounded men and opened fire at police and tourists.\nThe Palestinian attacker was then shot and killed by an Israeli police officer who rushed to the scene. Police later identified him as Muhannad Halabi, a 19-year-old from Al Bireh, near Ramallah.\nHamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza, issued a statement praising the attack which it called, \"heroic.\"\nIt was the latest in a series of deadly Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians.\nOn Thursday, suspected Palestinian gunmen killed an Israeli couple in front of their children as they drove in the West Bank.\nMultiple shots killed Eitam and Naama Henkin, residents of the Jewish West Bank settlement of Neria. Their four young children, including a four-month-old infant, were in the back seat of the car during the shooting but were unharmed.\nHamas welcomed that attack as well, but no Palestinian group immediately claimed responsibility for it. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has not commented on the latest attacks.\nIsrael forces were later deployed in the West Bank hunting for the gunmen.\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said earlier that eight people were wounded by gunfire early Saturday in the northern town of Nablus. A Palestinian security official said seven members of the Islamic militant group Hamas were arrested. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.\nThe Israel military said troops operated in the area but would not elaborate further.\nThe attack Saturday night follows a recent spike in Palestinian attacks and a hard-line speech at the United Nations by Abbas, the last of several that Israeli leaders have condemned as incitement. Abbas has said that Israelis desecrate the Jerusalem holy site with their \"dirty feet.\"\nJerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said the \"ruthless and cruel terrorism aimed at innocent civilians that attempts to disrupt our lives and hurt us is a direct result of incitement by the Palestinian Authority and routine incitement in mosques.\"\nHe called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"act decisively against those who incite and encourage terrorism.\"\nNetanyahu is set to convene a meeting of top security officials when he returns to Israel on Sunday from the U.S.\nTensions have flared between Israelis and Palestinians in recent weeks, with much of the unrest focused on Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, site of the Al-Aqsa mosque.\nThe hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City is a frequent flashpoint and its fate is a core issue at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, site of the two biblical Jewish temples. Muslims revere it as the Noble Sanctuary, where they believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.\nNon-Muslim visitors are only allowed to enter the site at specific hours and are banned by police from praying there. Many Muslims view these visits as a provocation and accuse Jewish extremists of plotting to take over the site. Israel has promised to ensure the delicate arrangement at the site and insists it will not allow the status quo there to be changed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:05:25.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
