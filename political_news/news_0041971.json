A source familiar with the investigation told Fox that the FBI contacted Connecticut-based Datto, Inc. in September and asked them to preserve all data they had which may be connected to Clinton. Datto was hired to help back up data in May 2013 by Platte River Networks, the Colorado-based tech company that managed Clintons server and has already been cooperating with the FBI investigation. The cooperation of a second tech company raises new questions about whether the FBI is now obtaining any of the emails that Clinton says she and her attorneys deemed to be personal and deleted, as Republican critics have demanded to know if any of those emails were really work-related emails that should have been turned over to the State Department along with other federal records. Datto's cooperation also raises more questions about whether anyone at the company, where employees do not have security clearances, had access to classified information that was in Clintons server. The source familiar with the investigation said that like all major tech companies on the front lines, Datto has faced cyberattacks, another subject of great interest to the FBI in its probe of Clintons server. The FBI investigation gathered new steam this past Friday when officials at Datto received written consent from both Platte River and Clintons camp to turn over relevant data to the FBI, a process that is now underway as Clinton struggles in the polls just days before the first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. However, the source familiar with the investigation stressed its not clear whether Datto has in its possession all of Clintons personal and officials created while she was Secretary of State -- or new emails or other data created after she left office", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:24:01.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
