Ginther has set a record for raising money in a Columbus mayor’s race and continues to dominate his opponent, Zach Scott, in the contest for cash.\nGinther, the Columbus City Council president, has raised $962,766 since the May primary, while Scott, the Franklin County sheriff, has raised $420,260, according to the reports they filed with the Franklin County Board of Elections this afternoon.\nBut Scott’s 2-to-1 disadvantage in the latest filing period is an improvement from the nearly 6-to-1 advantage Ginther held in the primary campaign.\nGinther has raised more than $3 million, a record that beats Mayor Michael B. Coleman’s 1999 tally. Scott has raised about $1 million.\nBoth Ginther and Scott are Democrats.\nGinther reported having about $305,500 on hand to spend less than two weeks before the Nov. 3 election, while Scott reported having about $75,900.\nStill, Scott has made up considerable fundraising ground since the primary election, when his campaign was outspent by a wide margin, said Melissa Barnhart, his campaign adviser. Ginther’s links to lobbyist John Raphael, who recently agreed to plead guilty to one felony count of extortion by threats, affected fundraising, she said.\n“It clearly has an impact,” Barnhart said. “Zach’s a great candidate and has a vision for Columbus.”\nGinther’s continued strong fundraising is a sign of his continued support, said Bryan Clark, his campaign manager.\n“It shows that the voters of Columbus trust Andy Ginther,” Clark said.\nDeveloper Frank Kass was Ginther’s largest contributor, donating $50,000 in two donations in the past month.\nMembers of the Scantland family, owners of Orange Barrel Media and CoverMyMeds, gave Ginther $37,500.\nGinther reported that several donors gave $25,000, including the political-action committee for Nationwide, the AFSCME public-employees union and developers Don Casto and Doug Borror.\nMark Kvamme, the former head of JobsOhio and now the head of the venture fund Drive Capital, gave Ginther a total of $20,000.\nScott also received several large donations in the latest reporting period.\nThe family of developer George A. Skestos gave a total of $88,600. The Skestos family was also Scott’s largest supporter during the primary.\nScott also landed $25,000 donations from William Lager, the president of online charter school ECOT; from Scotts Miracle Gro chief executive James S. Hagedorn; and from Superior Die, Tool and Machine President Richard W. Holstein.\nSeveral donors chipped in $10,000 to Scott’s account, including Virginia “Ginni” Ragan, who is listed as a philanthropist. Ragan has been a prolific contributor to the campaigns of Republican state legislators.\nIn the field race for Columbus City Council, in which the top four among the eight running will win seats, the slate of four endorsed Democrats holds a commanding money lead.\nCombined, they have raised more than $700,000 since the primary. Incumbent Zach Klein led the way with $380,170. Elizabeth Brown, who joined the slate when Michelle M. Mills resigned in August, was second to Klein with $163,875.\nAnd they’re sharing their money. Klein spent more than $300,000 on in-kind contributions to his fellow Democrats.\nKlein, Brown, state Rep.\nMichael Stinziano and Jaiza Page have been appearing together in ads for the slate.\nDimitrious Stanley led the slate of endorsed Republican candidates, raising just under $15,000. Republican John Rush raised $5,000, while Ibrahima Sow and Besmira Sharrah both reported raising less than $500.\nKlein also shared some of his funds with Shannon Hardin, who is running against Republican Ashley Wnek for a fifth seat on the council.\nWnek has said she is not raising money.\nlsullivan@dispatch.com \n@DispatchSully \nrrouan@dispatch.com \n@RickRouan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:38:02.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
