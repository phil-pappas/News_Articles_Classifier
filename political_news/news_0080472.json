The Partners are united in the fight against cancer and are dedicated to solely raising funds for research at Karmanos Cancer Institute through the signature two-part fundraiser known as the Annual Partners Events.\nFor more information on Partners Events, visit www.karmanos.org/partners .\nAbout the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute\nLocated in mid-town Detroit, Michigan , the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, a subsidiary of McLaren Health Care, is one of 45 National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the United States .
