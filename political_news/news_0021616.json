I think we’re a little too uptight as a nation,\" the former Florida governor said in an interview with \"CBS This Morning.\"\nHe added, \"I admire the fact that he doesn't feel embarrassed about his wealth.\"\n\"What else do I admire about him? Let me think,\" Bush said with a grin. \"I'm running out of things. He's got a great family.\"\nAt the same time, Bush said, people need to know the temperament and foreign policy views of their potential leaders, something he said Trump has not shared with the American people.\nAsked whether he would feel unsafe with Trump as commander in chief, Bush said he had \"no clue.\"\n\"These are serious times, and I think you need a person who has the temperament and the leadership skills to fix the things that are broken and do it with passion and conviction but also have the skills to lead. And over the long haul, I think that's the lane I'm going to stay in, and I believe I'm going to be effective in doing it. I don't know about Donald Trump's views on leadership because he talks about himself the whole time rather about what he would do,\" he said.\nOn whether he saw his brother, former President George W. Bush, coming out on the campaign trail with him, Bush said he did not know.\n\"He's been helpful raising money, he's been giving me advice. He's the last Republican to have been elected and the one before that [his father], so he's the one guy that I rely on the ebbing and flowing of politics, because it's pretty wild, and he's done it,\" he went on to say.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:43:10.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
