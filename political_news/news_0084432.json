Alright, so let me give you that answer right now: I respect women incredibly.\" Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey skipped a speech and went right to questions from the crowd. He took more than a dozen questions.

What we need are answers to the problems, not just campaign rhetoric,” Sanders said via teleconference. \nPresidential hopefuls Ohio Gov. John Kaisch, Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia and former Gov. George Pataki of New York also spoke. \nDemocratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who are likely to face-off in Ayotte’s reelection bid next year, were also in attendance. This is the first major appearance the two candidates have had since Hassan announced she would run last week. Sen. Kelly Ayotte fires up the crowd as she talks about her bipartisan efforts to address heroin epidemic.
