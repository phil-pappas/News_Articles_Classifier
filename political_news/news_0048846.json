Instead, a preliminary hearing in the case that had been set to begin Oct. 30 is now scheduled to start Dec. 1.\nAG’s office attorneys argued against the motion today, saying Duran had not shown sufficient cause for an extension to be granted.\nIn all, Duran is charged with 65 violations by the Attorney General’s office. Although the amounts allegedly withdrawn at eight casinos run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, the counts against her revolve around 19 transactions totaling about $13,000.\nIn brief remarks after today’s hearing, Duran’s attorney claimed the Republican secretary of state has already been “convicted by the media” but looks forward to fighting the charges against her. Duran was present for today’s hearing, but did not speak to reporters.\nCheck tomorrow’s Journal for a full story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:10:20.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
