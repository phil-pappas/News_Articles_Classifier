The lawsuit sought to stop the roundups and secure federal protection for the animals as \"wild\" horses. \nUnder state law the Forest Service considers the horses \"feral.\" \nThe first part of the suit was dismissed by a judge after the Forest Service agreed to postpone any removals. The management group has dropped the second part of the suit without prejudice, which means they would refile in the future. \nInformation from: The Arizona Republic, http://www.azcentral.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:38:04.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
