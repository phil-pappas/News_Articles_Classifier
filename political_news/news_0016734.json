Steve Beshear has filled a vacancy that was created due to the lack of racial minorities on the University of Louisville's Board of Trustees.Beshear appointed William E. Summers IV to the governing board on Wednesday.Summers is African-American. The 72-year-old Summers, who is retired, served as deputy mayor and chief administrative officer for Louisville Metro government from 2003 to 2012.Summers replaces Steve Wilson, who is white. Wilson resigned last month to make way for a minority appointment to the board.Attorney General Jack Conway's office issued an opinion last month that said Beshear's administration violated state law with his appointments that left racial minorities underrepresented on the UofL board.The controversy arose this past summer when the school's only African-American board member was replaced.
