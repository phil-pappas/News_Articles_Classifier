The Brown University graduate student was one of about 50 people at the bar, watching the first Democratic debate in the 2016 presidential race. Asked if she was rooting for anyone in particular, Barber said, “I wish the candidates would live up to my expectations.” “Voting is an important responsibility, and it’s even more important to do it in an educated way,” she said. The stage for the CNN debate was far less crowded than the two Republican debates that captivated the nation. Tuesday night’s debate also included a local candidate: Lincoln Chafee, the former R.I. governor. The four other candidates on stage in Las Vegas included front-runners Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent senator, as well as former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and Jim Webb, a former Virginia senator. The debate watch at Mirabar was co-hosted by Joseph M. McNamara, chair of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, and Anthony DeRose, chair of the party’s LGBTQ caucus. Other caucuses also joined the debate watch, Ann S. Gooding, director of communications for the party, said before the event. They included the Latino, African American and People with Disabilities caucuses. The LGBTQ caucus is “one of our most active caucuses,” she said, when asked how the two groups became involved in organizing the event. During the debate, issues ranged from gun control, to Russia’s role in Syria and the economy, with Clinton and Sanders monopolizing the cameras early on, and receiving most of the applause at Mirabar. People laughed when Anderson Cooper told the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Chafee, “You have been everything but a socialist.” Answering Cooper, Chafee said he has been a “block of granite” when it comes to the issues, and added, “I open my record for scrutiny.” Brandon Miller, of Warwick, said Chafee “represented the the state well,” but the 29-year-old is rooting for Sanders, who he said was offering the best opportunities for young people entering the work force. Early in the debate, Clinton also received a round of applause in the bar when she told Cooper she was a progressive, but added she likes to “get things done.” That’s attractive to 27-year-old Drew Milligan, of Providence. Although he said he agreed on more issues with Sanders, Milligan said he believed Clinton had a greater chance of being elected and getting things accomplished.
