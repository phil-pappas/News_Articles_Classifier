The problem isn't the developers and we don't generally land bank. The problem is the land owners and the process attached to planning. (although I don't blame the landowners)15yrs ago you could apply for planning and get it in 13wks and start building immediately with no pre commencement conditions. Now you apply for planning get planning in 13wks then negotiate your S106 which could be anything with no target date, (I know of someone who is at 2yrs!) then once you have that you have to apply to remove your precommencement conditions (our record is 45!!!!) this then takes a further 6-12 wks. Once this is done you can then start contacting our frankly laughable utility providers to get approvals for drains etc this can be another 6mths easy. [I will say though Western Power are excellent, STW are st)So that is a big issue and you have to look at risk and exposure when buying land with these timescales....Now you come to one of the bigger issues - LANDIt is all privately held you therefore have to pay what someone wants to buy it to then develop it. There are huge swathes of the ex nottinghamshire coal fields that you can't afford to pay ANYTHING for the land as you can't afford to build the house, pay the planning gains( S106) and make a profit, ANY profit. these areas therefore do not get developed. The Southern orientated people don't see this the south east land is circa 50-70% of sale value my average in a normal area in the midlands can be as low as 12%Even if the government gave planning every where landowners are in for the long haul generally as once they have sold they can't sell it again, it is the family silver. If they don't think they are getting enough they just won't sell as they can pass it to the next generation... hence no land.Hope people find this interesting, but I do get fed up with developers generally be accused of land banking etc etc. We at the end of the day just buy stuff and build houses on it and sell them on as quickly as we can to reduce risk.The best thing for the industry would be to get rid of all precommencement conditions and ensure when you get planning you can start the build, scrap Section 106s and just charge a new build tax based on sq ft rather than plots, even this would encourage starter homes which are currently actively discouraged because of the S106 calculation....", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:49:18.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
