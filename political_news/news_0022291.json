This creates an extensive and targeted approach to protecting and enhancing our region’s beautiful natural assets.\" \nShowcasing Nelson to the world is another focus, says Mayor Reese. \n\"We successfully hosted three ICC 2015 Cricket World Cup games earlier this year, which not only showcased our city to the world but proved our sports facilities are world class. I look forward to hosting two further international Black Caps games this summer.\" \nOverall, Mayor Reese says a strong Council performance has been achieved this financial year. \n\"A sincere thanks to everyone who is working to make Nelson an even better place to live.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:26:37.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
