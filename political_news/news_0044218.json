It was not immediately clear if the Gulf country would buy all four ships approved for sale at once.\nThe sale is part of a larger modernization of the Royal Saudi Navy's Eastern Fleet, and will replace older U.S.-built ships with new ships based on the Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) that Lockheed currently builds for the U.S. Navy together with its major supplier, Italy's Fincantieri.\nThe Saudi Naval Expansion Program II, or SNEP II, has been under discussion for years, but U.S. sources say Saudi Arabia's concerns about Iran have accelerated the effort.\nThe sale marks the first major export of a newly built U.S.-manufactured surface naval vessel in years. It will allow the U.S. military to operate more easily together with those of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\n\"This sale demonstrates the enduring U.S. commitment to building robust diplomatic and security partnerships essential to promoting peace and stability in the Gulf region,\" said the official.\nThe sale is expected to include training, radar and sonar systems, and munitions and fire-control systems.\nLockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a United Technologies Corp unit, hope to finalize another key part of the modernization effort, a $1.9 billion order of 10 MH-60R helicopters, by the end of the year, said one of the sources. Lockheed expects to complete its takeover of Sikorsky this month.\nU.S. lawmakers were notified about the MH-60R deal in May.\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:27:23.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
