The automaker’s public relations black eye lasted for years,” the magazine said. The problem, as PM explained, was that tests revealed that in low-speed rear-end crash testing, the fuel tank, just in front of the back bumper, was subjected to a series of potential problems that “combined to create a serious risk of fire.” \nThey exploded in even low-speed crashes with other cars. But the company opted to pay damages to victims rather than pay for the fix. \nHe wasn’t hit by a car. \nHe was hit by a train. \nRevealed now is the life story of Jonathan Cahn, known as “The Harbinger Man.” This stunning movie reveals his history as a Reform Jew, a hardened atheist, survivor of a near-death experience and now “America’s Prophet.” \nAnd he emerged without a scratch. \nOf course, the train hit the car from the side, but they usually are able to demolish vehicles no matter how they hit. \nHe figured God was, perhaps, sending a message. \nCahn describes the encounter in the new “The Harbinger Man” movie. \nCahn’s testimony is about how he had felt God’s calling on his life, before the crash. Jonathan Cahn preaches a message at the Capitol earlier this year. \n“Lord, I know you’re there. But I don’t want to serve you … How about we make a deal? If you give me a long life, I’ll accept you when I’m on my deathbed,” he recalls thinking. \nHis reasoning was simple. \nFollowing God, he believed, meant “You give up everything that’s good. You join a monastery and that’s the end of your life.” \nHe remembers coming to the railroad crossing, and looking left to see a light that “isn’t moving, or doesn’t look like it was moving.” \nIt was because he had stopped on the tracks, and the train was bearing down. \n“The train plows into the Ford Pinto. The Pinto goes up, literally, like aluminum foil. The only thing I could do at that moment was call out to God.” \nHe continued, “The car was destroyed. I didn’t get a scratch.” \n“I’m in a police car and I’m thinking, ‘God, that was close.’ I said, ‘Can we renegotiate that deal?’” \nThose Pintos eventually were recalled. \nCahn’s amazing life story has been untold until the soon-coming release of “The Harbinger Man,” which is ready for order now from the WND Superstore. \nBut millions know of his work, from the stunning “The Harbinger,” which was on the New York Times bestseller list for close onto two years, the movie version called “The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment” movie and his followup, “The Shemitah.” \nHe’s been called “America’s Prophet” and is one of the most influential – and controversial – Christian leaders today. He’s bestselling author, a biblical teacher and a fiery pastor and preacher. He’s scolded the Supreme Court for presuming to redefine what God has said marriage is, and even has taken on President Obama. \nOther Christian leaders have praised his work. \n“Jonathan Cahn has been one of the voices in the wilderness who is calling the nation to repent,” said documentary filmmaker and biblical teacher Joel Richardson. \n“I stand with him in that. I know Jonathan to be a truly humble, genuine and very sincere brother. I have seen few men with an anointing to preach repentance as Jonathan has.” \nRevealed now is the life story of Jonathan Cahn, known as “The Harbinger Man.” This stunning movie reveals his history as a Reform Jew, a hardened atheist, survivor of a near-death experience and now “America’s Prophet.” \n“I fully understand that the United States is not Israel, and we are most certainly not under the same covenantal obligations as Israel,” explained Richardson. “But few Christians will deny that the United States is rapidly becoming a post-Christian nation. And with this, there is indeed a great danger.” \nCarl Gallups, a pastor and author of the new book “Be Thou Prepared,” agrees with Richardson about the importance of Cahn’s call for America to repent and pray. \n“Jonathan Cahn is calling our nation to repent and to turn back to God,” Gallups told WND. “At the same time, he calls individual people to turn to Jesus Christ for salvation. As Christians living in the post-Christian – perhaps anti-Christian – America of 2015, how can we disagree with this message?” \nPastor Dan Cummins of Bridlewood Church in Texas had his life and ministry dramatically affected by Cahn. \nHe told WND: “It has been my privilege to know Jonathan over the past five years. Hearing his message on television was the impetus God used to bring my wife, JoAnn, and me to Washington, D.C., to begin our ministry to Congress on Capitol Hill. \n“Jonathan has participated the past three years in our annual ‘Washington: A Man of Prayer’ event held in the Capitol’s Statuary Hall. This past April 29, he delivered a nine-minute prophetic word to America that has now been seen and heard by over 14 million people worldwide. \nSee the “Harbinger Man” trailer:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:52:08.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
