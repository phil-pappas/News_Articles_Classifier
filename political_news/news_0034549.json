In a rare moment of combativeness in the candidates' debate where nearly all the Democrats echoed one another in the need to fight climate change, Martin O’Malley cited Clinton’s stance on the proposed pipeline as one of “a lot of reversals.”\nIt’s an argument often cited by Republicans — and one Clinton will almost certainly face if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\nBut Clinton said she is no flip-flopper. “I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone,” she said.\nClinton ended months of speculation in September when she announced her opposition to a project that is still under a review by the Obama administration, a process that began during her tenure as secretary of state.\nClinton: Republicans demonize and insult immigrants By Nick Gass\nIn October 2010, then-Secretary of State Clinton told the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco that the U.S. is \"inclined\" to approve the pipeline, arguing that until the country has a clean-energy policy in place, \"we’re either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada.”\nDuring her tenure, the State Department also issued favorable environmental assessments on the pipeline, which drew protests from green activists who said the assessments didn’t properly account for the climate impact of the crude from the oil-sands that the pipeline would carry from Alberta to Texas.\nBut in announcing her opposition in September, she said the project was “a distraction from important work we have to do on climate change.”\nOn Tuesday night, she quickly pivoted to tout her climate record, saying she has been “at the forefront of dealing with climate change.” And twice she cited a story described in her book \"Hard Choices\" about when she and President Barack Obama stormed uninvited into a private meeting hosted by Chinese officials at the 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference \"and got them to sign the first international agreement to combat climate change that they'd ever joined.\"\n\"So I'm not taking a backseat to anybody on my values, my principles and the results that I get,\" she added.\nAll the major Democratic presidential candidates touted their stance on climate change, while refraining from criticizing each other on an issue they all agreed needs to be addressed.\nWhen asked whether he would be better on the issue than Clinton, Bernie Sanders bypassed the comparison and cited Pope Francis' characterization of climate change as “a moral issue.” He cited legislation he offered years ago with Sen. Barbara Boxer putting a tax on carbon emissions and also called for campaign finance reform because “the fossil fuel industry is funding the Republican Party.”\nHe described the measure that they introduced in 2013 as “the first piece of climate legislation which called for a tax on carbon,” although other similar proposals date back to the 1990s.\nMartin O’Malley perhaps went the furthest in promising in his “very first order in office” to move toward the goal of having a “100 percent clean electric grid by 2050.” O’Malley is the only one of the candidates to officially sign on to a 2050 fossil-free goal posed by billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer. He also called for extending tax credits for solar and wind and spurring green building design.\n“We did not land a man on the moon with an all of the above strategy,” O’Malley said, referring to calls to develop oil, gas, and coal resources as well as renewables.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the candidates were pressed by Steyer and green groups to use the debate to give details on how they would not just tackle climate change and clean energy, but how it could be integrated in an economic and jobs strategy. Steyer’s NextGen Climate is also running full-page print ads in the Las Vegas Review Journal and USA Today in an effort to get an entire Democratic primary debate focused solely on climate and clean energy.\nClinton and Sanders spar over who's tougher on Wall Street By Nick Gass\nBut another big question was whether Clinton — in announcing opposition in recent weeks to Keystone XL pipeline, Arctic drilling and the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal — had done enough to close any daylight between her and her two main primary opponents, Sanders and O’Malley, who had been using issues like climate change and the Keystone pipeline to challenge her from the left.\nSanders has long been one of the greenest lawmakers and strongest advocates for addressing climate change. He has also featured his longtime opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline on the campaign trail, though he hasn’t done much to detail his green platform during the campaign.\nBut Sanders was the only one of the five candidates at the debate that referenced climate change when asked by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper what the greatest national security threat was to the U.S.\n“The scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change, transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, the planet that we are going to be leaving our kids, our grandchildren may well not be inhabitable,” Sanders said. “That is a major crisis.”\nO’Malley also cited climate change, along with ISIL. “Climate change of course makes cascading threats even worse,” he said.\nClinton said the greatest national security threat “has to be” the spread of nuclear weapons and material to terrorists.\nDarren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:53:20.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
