Though Israel has pushed back against the rumors as untrue, violence has spread across Israel and into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nEight Israelis have died in a series of stabbings, shootings and the stoning of a car, while 29 Palestinians, including 12 dubbed by Israel as attackers, have been killed.\n\"Israel will settle accounts with the murderers, those who attempt murder, and all those who assist them,\" Netanyahu said. \"Not only will they not enjoy their privileges, but we will exact from them the full cost. Anyone who raises his hand to harm us — will pay dearly. And we will not hesitate to use all means at our disposal to restore peace to the cities of Israel.\"\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday he would soon travel to the Middle East to help calm the situation, though it wasn't immediately clear when he planned to go.\n\"I will go there soon, at some point appropriately, and try to work to reengage and see if we can't move that away from this precipice,\" Kerry told an audience at the Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner 'Disgrace': Kasich rips Clinton for boasting of GOP enemies \"She bragged that she made enemies out of Republicans?
