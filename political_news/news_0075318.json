The comprehensive market access for meat is nowhere to be seen. And yet the concerns of the so-called ‘breathless children’ of New Zealand, around investor-state dispute settlement provisions, access to medicines, rules controlling the operation of state-owned enterprises and other chapters that amplify the power of foreign investors, have hardly been addressed at all.” \n“Key and Groser will be beginning their public relations push to try and dress this up as a major win. They know there is still time for us to back out of this toxic deal.” \n“No more excuses, release the text NOW.” \n-Ends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:55:21.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
