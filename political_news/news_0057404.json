Top Ayurveda Remedies: Triphala\nby Andrew Pacholyk, MS L.Ac\nTriphala is a traditional Ayurvedic Indian herbal compound used for constipation and poor bowel tone and is designed to support the body’s natural cleansing process. It is one of Ayurveda’s most important herbal formulas for thousands of years. Triphala is a balanced blend of three Indian Herbal Fruits: Harada (haritaki), Amla (amalaki) and Behada (bibhitaki). Each balanced to vatta, pitta and kapha respectively.\nHaritaki is healing to all tissues of the body. It supports the excretory, digestive and nervous system. It is a nutritive tonic laxative that is calming. It corrects constipation and loose stools. It is astringent and salty and is balancing for the vatta dosha.\nAmalaki is cooling, highly nutritious, tonic, and astringent and is a mild laxative. It is sour and clears heat and inflammation in the stomach and intestines. It is the highest known source of Vitamin C in nature. It is balancing for the pitta dosha.\nBibhitaki is a strong laxative and is astringent, therefore, it can cleanse the intestines and tonify at the same time. It is hot and sweet and is beneficial for the digestive, respiratory and urinary systems and can treat loose stool, parasites, mucus, bronchitis and kidney stones. It is balancing for the kapha dosha.\nTriphala can be used on all body doshas (kapha, vata and pitta) types. Therefore, it is “tridosha” meaning it can help in restoring balance. Triphala is neither a harsh expellant nor a laxative, but a mild and gentle cleanser. Triphala cleanses the body tissue, reduces cholesterol, high blood pressure, improves circulation and regulates elimination.\nThis combination of fruits is unique because the astringent qualities of the fruits serve to tonify the colon therefore promoting internal cleansing naturally. This is highly recommended for anyone doing a detox program.\nTriphala is available in capsules now in health food stores. There is no known interactions between herb and allopathic drugs. No safety warnings. Triphala may be used up to six months. Adults can take two tablets two to three times a day between meals. Children under ten can take the same dosage. Best used regularly to improve bowel health.", "external_links": ["http://omtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/triphala_OMTimes_shutterstock_256817554-s.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:48:54.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
