Ms Thomson then received “cashback” from Mr Gilbride of around £28,000.\nPromoted stories The deal was one of a number of “back to back” sales that are now the focus of a police investigation.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied all knowledge of Ms Thomson’s property deals.\nMr McKee, like Ms Thomson, was a board member on the pro-independence Business for Scotland.\nHe purchased three properties to let out in Edinburgh during 2013 and 2014, using the services of Ms Thomson’s company, which no longer provides any services for him.\nIt is understood no mortgages were involved in the purchase of the properties and they have not been resold.\nAn SNP spokesman added that Mr McKee hired Ms Thomson’s Your Property Shop Ltd to identify properties and find and manage tenants.\nThe firm’s website is no longer available but a retrieved web-link is clear about some of the services on offer: “Here at Your Property Shop we regularly source some wonderful deals for our investors. Wonderful to an investor means obtained at significantly below the current market value. But is it wonderful for the vendor? Well, you know what – it should be.”\nIt continued: “Sometimes we come across people who have found themselves in difficult and trying circumstances. We hear some truly tragic stories about sudden deaths, messy divorces and terrible debt.”\nThe website also flagged up the company’s ethics: “Trading and selling is part and parcel of humanity. The best know that having ethical drivers really works, and that it makes for good business. Challenge your sourcers to see how their behaviour stacks up.”\nThe MP is listed as the sole director and shareholder of the firm, which was incorporated in May 2013.\nMs Thomson, who has denied wrongdoing and has said she is happy to co-operate with the police, gave Mr McKee a fulsome testimonial ahead of his successful selection for Glasgow Provan in August.\nQuote: : “Ivan’s support for the SNP team at Westminster has been invaluable. He’ll be a tremendous asset to Holyrood and to any seat fortunate enough to have him as their MSP.”\nHowever Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: “I note Mr McKee still owns these properties. He should now publish full details of these transactions including what services he received from Michelle Thomson’s companies.”\nShare article Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: “Given the severity of the accusations, the SNP should explain at once exactly how Ms Thomson’s services helped this budding MSP in the Edinburgh property sector.”\nMs Thomson declined to comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-05T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:20:51.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
