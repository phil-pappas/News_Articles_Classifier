Republican support for Governor Christie’s White House bid has dropped by 50 percent in New Jersey over the past two months, while an increasing percentage of the state’s conservatives is backing national front-runner Donald Trump, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Thursday.\nAnd on Wednesday, Trump announced the endorsement of a Republican state senator, Michael Doherty, who said he thinks the business mogul’s views on foreign affairs can, as Trump’s campaign slogan goes, “make America great again.”\nDoherty, a Warren County conservative who has openly clashed with Christie, is among the growing number of New Jersey Republicans and “GOP-leaning” registered voters backing Trump’s nomination for president. The poll reported 32 percent of those voters support Trump, up from 21 percent in August. Those conservative voters also put contenders Dr. Ben Carson and U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas ahead of Christie for the nomination.\nIn the August poll, Christie had the support of 12 percent of conservative voters in New Jersey. Now that support is down to 5 percent, even with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was the national front-runner until Trump entered the race, according to Thursday’s poll.\nAlthough Trump’s sustained popularity with voters is at least partly contributing to Christie’s sagging poll numbers, 12 percent mentioned Christie’s performance as governor and 11 percent mentioned his overall attitude and character as the main reasons he’s lost favor. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll earlier this week said Christie’s job approval hovers at his all-time low.\n“The voters who know him best blame not his competition but what Christie himself is doing — or not doing — for New Jersey,” Ashley Koning, assistant director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said in a statement.\nThe poll found that 67 percent of registered voters think Christie should end his campaign for president. Doherty isn’t among them, even though he said he finds Christie’s hawkish views on foreign affairs inconsistent with his domestic message of “compromise is not capitulation.”\n“I do admire his tenacity and his courage,” Doherty said. “I would say Donald Trump is resonating with the voters and he’s saying things that people want to hear him say.”\nThe poll of 935 adults was conducted from Oct. 3-10 with a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.\nEmail: racioppi@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:53:26.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
