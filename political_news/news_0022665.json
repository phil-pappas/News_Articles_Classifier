B.C. key to NDP's fortunes \nMulcair was to be in both British Columbia and Saskatchewan on Monday, provinces where his party hopes to make gains. \nThe NDP sees B.C. as an important battleground, where it has tried to frame the election as a fight between New Democrats and the Conservatives. \n\"Only the NDP can beat the Conservatives here in British Columbia,\" Mulcair said. \nNew Democrats are expecting tight three-way fights in Vancouver. \nBut they believe they can pick up three seats on Vancouver Island and are confident of adding two others on the mainland, including the newly created riding of Pitt Meadows Maple Ridge, a scenic, largely blue-collar community east of high-priced Vancouver. \nPart of the NDP strategy seems to hinge on making gains in areas where the economy is under strain or has been hammered by globalized trade. \nMulcair pointed out his campaign swung last week through a vast swath of southwestern Ontario, once the manufacturing heartland of the country. \n\"Six towns in six Conservative ridings,\" he said. \"You knew, and I knew in those ridings the NDP was going to be winning, and everything that's been published since then is proving that. So, when we went from Brantford to Waterloo to Stratford to London to Sarnia to Essex, we knew that the only party that was going to be defeating the Conservatives in those blue ridings was the NDP.\" \nIt's not the first time party has made the same bet. The NDP concentrated on those same economic hard-luck regions in previous campaigns, only to come up short. Harper 'got played for a chump' on TPP, Mulcair says \nA different dynamic is at play in this campaign with the Conservatives signing the multi-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the NDP has seized upon as a potential lifeline for the campaign. \nThroughout his campaign stops over the holiday weekend, Mulcair hammered the \"secret\" agreement, which he says Conservative Leader Stephen Harper tripped over himself to achieve before the election. \n\"Everybody saw him coming. He got played for a chump,\" he said. \nThe NDP repeated its demand Monday for the government to release the full text of the agreement so the public can decide for itself whether it's a good deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:34:51.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
