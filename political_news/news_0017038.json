Clinton, at a Latinos for Hillary rally in San Antonio, promised her support for immigrant rights. Clinton’s bond with South Texas Latinos was forged when she registered voters there in 1972. \nHillary Clinton received the endorsement of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro on Thursday, and said she would consider him as a running mate if she wins the Democratic nomination for president. \nAt a rally crackling with energy, Clinton described a bond with South Texas Hispanics first forged when she was registering voters in the summer of 1972, promising the midday throng of a couple of thousand people, “Your fights are my fights; they always have been, they always will be.” \n“San Antonio, come join me on this journey,” said Clinton, who was introduced by Castro, the city’s former mayor. This Hillary Clinton campaign poster hangs at a San Antonio rally Thursday. Clinton said Thursday she would consider HUD Secretary and former San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro as a running mate if she is the Democratic presidential nominee. \nIn a pre-rally Q-and-A with Javier Palomarez, the head of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Clinton said Castro would get a close look as a potential number two. \n“I’m going to really look hard at him for everything, because that’s how good he is,” said Clinton, describing how impressed she is with Castro and his twin brother, Joaquín, a Democratic congressman from San Antonio. \nJoaquín Castro, in introducing his brother at the rally, noted that he is used to “playing second fiddle to my older-by-one-minute twin brother.” Eric Gay Mariz Anita Monsivaiz shows off the likeness of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton shaved on her head during a Clinton campaign rally Thursday in San Antonio. (Associated Press) \nClinton first came to South Texas in the summer of 1972 — two years before the Castro brothers were born — with her then-boyfriend, Bill Clinton, to register voters as part of Sen. George McGovern’s doomed presidential campaign. \nShe recalled arriving, blond, Midwestern with little Spanish, with the future president — tall and shaggy-haired, looking “kind of like a Viking” — and being enveloped in welcome, a signal moment in a life of politics. \nComing off what was widely considered a strong performance by her in the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday in Las Vegas, the rally was intended to showcase Clinton’s deep support among Latino voters, with whom she performed very well in her long nomination battle with Barack Obama in 2008. In Texas, she received 66 percent of the Latino vote to 32 percent for Obama.

I am with you.”) \n“I love being ‘La Hillary’” Clinton exulted. “But I am not just La Hillary. I am also tú Hillary (Your Hillary).” Eric Gay Esther Alvarado, left, and Maria Anita Monsivaiz, right, hold portraits they created of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a camaign rally Thursday in San Antonio. (Associated Press) \nDecrying the insults hurled at Mexican immigrants by Donald Trump, she told the overwhelmingly Hispanic crowd, “You are not strangers, you are not intruders, you are our neighbors, our friends, our families.” \n“Unlike the Republicans, she respects the Latino community,” Julián Castro said in Spanish in presenting Clinton, who to the surprise of none he formally backed. \nEight years ago, in her campaign against then-Sen. Obama for the Democratic nomination, Clinton waffled on the question of issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.

(Associated Press) \nThis time she firmly supports allowing states to provide driver’s licenses to such immigrants, and on Thursday she offered a vigorous, unambiguous defense of immigration and immigrants, saying that, contrary to the common complaint, they raise wages and make America both more prosperous and “more interesting.” \nClinton promised to defend the right of states to provide in-state tuition at state colleges and universities for undocumented immigrant residents. \n“I will fight for Dreamers,” she said.

Joaquín Castro, left, at a campaign rally Thursday in San Antonio.(Associated Press) \nShe said that she would keep the executive orders President Obama issued — but that are now on hold as a result of a lawsuit brought by Texas and other states — to extend protection from deportation, and that “if Congress won’t act” on comprehensive immigration reform and if she becomes president, “I will go even further.” \nHer nod to Julián Castro as a potential running mate pleased the hometown crowd. \n“Oh come on,” said Clinton supporter Vivian Gonzales, who attended the rally with other members of the Red Hat Society of San Antonio — all properly adorned — when asked whether she liked the idea. “Of course. Of course.” Eric Gay Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, right, stands with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, left, after she was introduced at a campaign rally Thursday in San Antonio. (Associated Press) \nCésar Acosta, a 64-year-old social worke r who was disappointed that Clinton didn’t win eight years ago, said he believes the former secretary of state could prevail this time, “especially if Julián Castro joins forces with her.” \nEdward Mungia, a freshly minted political science graduate of Loyola University in New Orleans, back home and looking at a career in politics in San Antonio, said he liked Clinton for precisely the reason she outlined in Tuesday’s presidential debate in Las Vegas. \n“She’s a progressive who knows how to get things done,” Mungia said. “Republicans respect her and don’t see her as some crazy liberal.” \nClinton’s support with Hispanic and black voters, both critical Democratic Party constituencies, is considered her firewall if Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders does as well as polls now indicate in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where the electorate is overwhelmingly white.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:50:24.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
