Chandrasekhar Rao of behaving like a “Nizam” and dictator by throwing out the entire Opposition from the Assembly for raising farmer suicides and failure to implement his poll promises.\n“Is the Nizam back? KCR’s behaviour suggests so. He is behaving like a dictator when questioned about the failure to implement his election promises and the failure to come to the rescue of farmers who are taking their lives. KCR should immediately waive the remaining loans at one go and provide relief to farmers,” Mr Singh said.\nCiting several pro-farmer measures taken by the government of neighbouring Karnataka state, he asked the CM to take up relief measures and implement his election promises. “UPA waived farm loans of Rs 82,000 crore at one go,” Mr Singh said.\nWinding up his two-day tour of TS, he also slammed the PM for failing to grant special category status to AP as promised by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the floor of Lok Sabha during the passage of AP Reorganisation Act, and repeatedly reminded by AICC leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.\n“Why is AP CM Chandrababu Naidu not demanding the PM to provide special status to AP on the lines of Uttarakhand which got thousands of crores in investments? Why is Jagan Mohan Reddy silent?” he asked.\nMr Singh said that it was only the Congress which was fighting for special status since it was promised on the floor of the House.\nHe also slammed Shiv Sena for smearing Sudheendra Kulkarni with ink and other incidents involving Sangh Parivaar men.\nStates: Telangana nation Current affairs Telangana AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh Also Read Maoists trigger landmine blast in Gadchiroli, kill 7 policemen M Karunanidhi opposes genetically modified crop trials Amit Shah to visit kerala next month Liquor destroyed at Alipiri", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Digvijay_Singh%20_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-current-affairs/article/modi-failure-kcr-dictator-says-digvijay-singh", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Digvijay_Singh%20_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:25:45.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
