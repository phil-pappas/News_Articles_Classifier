The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested that figures for 2013-14 would increase, but the number fell according to official statistics published in June. \nThe Resolution Foundation analysed the effects of several policies announced in the Budget, including the new higher minimum wage, a four-year freeze of working-age benefits and an increase in the rate at which tax credits are withdrawn as a worker’s earnings increase. \nAs well as increasing the numbers of households in poverty, the think-tank also argued that the welfare changes reduce financial incentives to work. \n“Many of those looking forward to a pay rise this April [from the higher minimum wage] will soon learn that those gains will be dwarfed by reductions to tax credits”, said David Finch Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \n“And by weakening work incentives in the benefits system, the government has made it even harder for families to earn their way out of poverty.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:18:23.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
