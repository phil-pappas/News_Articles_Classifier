Some Biddeford residents are still calling for change. Parenteau wonders whether long-time Police Chief Roger Beaupre needs to go. \n\"I just think that we really need to be able to make a fair assessment as to whether or not this is still the direction that we want to go into,” Parenteau said. \nCasavant said Beaupre has modernized the city’s police force. \n\"He always, always, always did things properly and all of the paperwork documents that, so in terms of changing leadership, I don't believe there's a need whatsoever,” he said. “It's just political talk at this juncture.” \nCasavant said he did not think there were any issues with the Police Department right now. \nHe said the ordeal involving the accusations has been trying. \n\"I have to bite my tongue and take my punches to the head, but I keep getting up and the proof in the pudding is: I'm running for reelection,” he said. “I could have easily said, 'No, I'm not going to do it anymore,' but I ran because I believe in what I've done and I ran because I believe in the people of Biddeford.” \nCasavant said his biggest failure has been not publicizing enough positive things in Biddeford. He said he hopes to showcase more of that work with the help of the new city manager. Show Transcript Hide Transcript \nSTRIMLING DO NOW WHAT HE COULDN'T DO THEN? THE MIDDLE CLASS CAN SURVIVE IN THE CITY. PAUL: SO FAR A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS FOCUSED ON THE NUMBER OF CITY OFFICIALS TURNING AWAY FROM MAYOR BRENNAN TO SUPPORT STRIBLING. I WOULDN'T BE IN THE RACE IF IT WASN'T FOR ALL THESE FOLKS CALLING FOR CHANGE. PAUL: HE SAID HE WANTS TO BE THE LISTENER IN CHIEF. BUT RENTED SEES THAT IS TOO PASSIVE. HE SAID THE CITY'S MAYOR SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD EVEN IF IT MEANS RUFFLING FEATHERS. I THINK THE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A MAYOR, AND HAVE A FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN THE CITY THAT WAS INTENDED BY THE CHARTER. REPORTER: HE SAYS HE HAS GIVEN PORTLAND A STRONG BASE IN AUGUSTA. IN A SECOND TERM HE HAS PLANS FOR IMPROVED ROD BEEN ACCESS AND A STREAMLINED PERMITTING PROCESS. WE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE THE STAFF BE MORE RESPONSIVE, MORE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE PERMITTING NEEDS AND TO TALK TO PEOPLE PROACTIVELY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY AND WHAT'S REQUIRED.\" PAUL STRIMLING SAYS THAT PROCESS : IS STILL TOO SLOW AND IS IMPEDING GROWTH. HIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD FOCUS ON UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND PROPERTY TAX RELIEF. HE SAYS HIS YEARS OF HELPING AT-RISK KIDS AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES AT LEARNING WORKS HAVE GIVEN HIM THE RIGHT TOOLS TO FIGHT POVERTY. ETHAN STRIMLING: YOU BUILD HOUSING AND YOU CREATE JOBS AND YOU SHIFT PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY INTO A LIFE OF STABILITY. THAT'S HOW YOU GET PEOPLE OFF OF MEDIANS. THAT IS HOW YOU MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF SHELTERS. PAUL: ALSO IN THE MIX: TOM MACMILLAN WHO WANTS TO CREATE A RENT-STABILIZATION BOARD AND TELLS US HIS GOAL IS STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF PORTLAND. MACMILLAN IS CRITICAL OF HIS OPPONENTS' FUNDING. TOM MAC MILLAN. : IT COMES FROM LAWYERS, LANDLORDS, AND DEVELOPERS. IT COMES FROM THE POWER STRUCTURE IN THE CITY. I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE POWER STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN PORTLAND, NOT JUST AGAINST THE TWO CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR.
