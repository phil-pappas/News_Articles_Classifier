Planned Parenthood's national president, Cecil Richards, notified the National Institutes of Health on Tuesday that the group would stop accepting payments, even though she said in a letter that the current policy \"exceeds the legal requirements,\" the Associated Press reported. \nOregon Rep. Bill Post , R-Keizer, said the announcement doesn't erase questions over whether Planned Parenthood and Oregon Health & Science University broke state or federal law. \n\"I think we still don't know the answer to that question,\" Post said. \nOregon is one of only a few states that permits the transfer of fetal tissue for scientific research. In a recent letter to House Republicans, Oregon Health & Science University said it gave Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette $19,000 to cover facilities and personnel costs for two studies involving donated placental tissue. The university has said the studies are related to still births and pregnancy complications. \nCross, in the statement, said the new policy will apply to future research contracts. The current contract will expire in September 2016. \nIn the letter, Oregon Health & Science University said it did pay Advance Bioscience Laboratories, a Maryland-based research group, for 123 fetal parts that run $230-$340 apiece. Post said that information is bound to inspire more questions from Republicans, although they haven't decided how to proceed. \n— Ian K.
