She says the program will accomplish its goal by bringing together law enforcement, parents, school officials, community leaders, and citizens. \nIn a news release today, Hartzler said, “As a former teacher who was also a co-director of a program for at-risk teens, I have seen the devastation drugs can cause in the lives of our youth, their families, and our communities,” Hartzler asserted. “I am saddened to see that the scourge of drugs continues to devastate too many lives in our counties. This has got to stop. It’s time to unite and take action against this menace to set a new path for individuals and families in our district—one that is drug-free.” \nCongresswoman Hartzler has scheduled the start of the “Take Back the District” anti-drug initiative with a conference, scheduled for October 19th, 2015, at Camp CUMCITO in Warsaw, Missouri. It is open to the public. \nRepresentative Hartzler will be our guest for “This Week,” Friday on ABC 17 News at 6:30 on KMIZ, and on ABC 17 News at 9:00 on FOX 22, KQFX. \nCopyright © 2015 KMIZ - The Networks of Mid-Missouri.
