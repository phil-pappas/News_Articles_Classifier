Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's top Democrat, said the report shows that no witness has substantiated what he called \"wild Republican conspiracy theories about Secretary Clinton and Benghazi,\" including a widely debunked claim that Clinton or other top officials issued a \"stand down\" order during the September 2012 attacks.\nClinton, a Democratic candidate for president, is set to testify Thursday at a public hearing.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:31:20.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
