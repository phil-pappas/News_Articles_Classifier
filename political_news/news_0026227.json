Videos A timeline of Hillary Clinton's email... \n\"I'm fairly upset he said that. Nobody could truly understand what actions they would take like that in a situation unless they lived it,\" Mathew Downing told CNN via Facebook. \nDowning was referred to by the shooter as \"the lucky one,\" during the deadly attack last Thursday. After shooting three people, the gunman paused, turned to Downing and said, \"You, with the glasses, you're the lucky one. If you give this envelope to police, you'll live.\" \nDowning was then forced to go to the back of the classroom and watch his classmates get executed. \nCarson, a Republican presidential candidate, said on Fox News after the shooting in Oregon that he would've done more to prevent the gunman from going on a killing spree. \n\"Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me,\" Carson said. \"I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'\" \nThe presidential candidate has since looked to clean up his remarks, saying that he was \"not judging (the shooting victims) at all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:12:41.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
