Here's an idea for a simple-but-chic weekday outfit that you can pull together quickly in the morning. Begin with a crisp white shirt tucked into gray trousers. This pair is high-waisted and features a slightly thicker waistband, a subtle detail that differentiates the pair from every other low-slung cropped style. With flats (instead of high heels) and a scarf knotted at the neck, this ensemble offers that nonchalant Parisian feel without feeling like a French-girl stereotype.\nTo really tie it all together, add on another basic: the classic trench coat. Should you prefer the same look at a lower price point, here's a great option . Finish the outfit with a roomy, practical work bag and you're ready for another day at the office.\nPhoto: Jody Rogac\nA.P.C.
