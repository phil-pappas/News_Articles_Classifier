I made the meme and was pretty shocked,\" she said. \"I had been a bit frustrated with having a newborn and locked on the couch, so it was a kind of a nice way to be able to participate in the conversation and support while still being able to be with my son.\"\nRead More To help the Sanders cause, she created a website, www.babiesforbernie2016.com , that sells onesies, as well as kids and adults' shirts that feature a drawing of her son dressed as the candidate with \"Babies For Bernie\" printed in large letters. Siegel said she began selling the onesies because the Sanders campaign doesn't offer them in its online store.\nShe said all proceeds from the sales are given directly to the Sanders campaign and/or are used for grassroots efforts.\nIn addition to the website, Siegel created a Facebook group titled \"Babies For Bernie 2016\" in August. The group describes itself as a place where people can share Sanders-related articles, thoughts and photos.\nHer trend has caught on Instagram , where other parents have also been sharing photos of babies dressed or photoshopped with glasses, white hair and a hand up in the air, tagging #BabiesForBernie.\nSiegel said she identifies with Sanders' progressive message.\n\"I think he's a good person and he has the best interest of the nation at heart, not the interest of the uber wealthy,\" she said. \"I want the best for my son, and I think Bernie Sanders will get us there.\"\nCheck out more photos here .\nA photo posted by ✨Tiffers McGee✨ (@trogdor_theburninator) on Sep 27, 2015 at 5:44pm PDT\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-small-11.jpg", "https://instagram.com/explore/tags/babiesforbernie/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-medium-plus-169.jpg", "https://instagram.com/p/8J5TdXTS5Q/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151017095846-babies-for-bernie-large-169.jpg", "https://instagram.com/p/869_xsxasr/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/1625585661022536/", "http://babiesforbernie.myshopify.com/"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:57:05.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
