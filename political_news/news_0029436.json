While some thought that the show will only have real life couples, we had exclusively revealed that this time, the 14 contestants will be paired up on the show, notwithstanding whether they are a real life couple or not. And that's what happened!\nThe show's concept which is starkly similar to US Big Brother 9 will also have a Power Couple theory into play soon. That's for a story later.\n#BB9 comes with a twist & more double trouble! Which is your favourite jodi among these? Tune in tomorrow at 10.30pm! pic.twitter.com/pgPazUnLA7\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nBut as of now, the 14 inmates who will be spending the next 105 days locked up inside the Bigg Boss 9 house has already been paired. Which one's your favourite? Here are all of them.\nAnkit Gera and Arvind Vegda:\nOur final jodi for today is @ankitgera001 & @ArvindVegda ! Now that you know about #DoubleTrouble , what do you think? pic.twitter.com/8DyrxbtTN5\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nThe last people to enter the show, Ankit and Arvind were paired up, much like in default mode. The TV actor is known for his flamboyant casanova moves while the Gujarati musician is famous for his chartbusters that rock all dandiya festivals. Will they match up to each other? They might, they might not! After all, this is the only two-guy pair in the house.\nKeith Sequeira and Mandana Karimi:\n. @manizhe and @keithsequeira enter the house! RT with your thoughts on this jodi! #BB9 pic.twitter.com/UsOyhCw8MF\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nMandana seems quite besotted by Keith but the dashing VJ already informed her he's taken. Possibly the most good looking pair of the lot, we can already see sparks flying!\nPrince Narula and Rochelle Rao:\n. @princenarula88 selects @rochellemrao in a #BB9 twist! #BB9 pic.twitter.com/b0oTFenaOv\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nShe missed the chance by a whisker and Prince chose her over Mandana. After being dumped four times already, Prince didn't quite take a chance and the two, despite Rochelle unwilling, is now a rather odd pair.\nYuvika Chaudhary and Vikas Bhalla:\n3 jodis are in the house already! @yuvikachoudhary chose #vikasbhalla as her partner! #BB9 @BeingSalmanKhan pic.twitter.com/HceQesDrmR\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nThe best word to describe this pair would be adorable. Bboth of them - sweet and coy - make for a nice pair. Now what happens in the future needs to be seen later!\nRimi Sen and Suyyash Rai:\nMoving on to the next jodi! @suyyashrai and #RimiSen are entering the house! #BB9 pic.twitter.com/eYT2xzLlnm\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nBoth are poles apart but hopefully like they say, opposites attract. Rimi chose Suyyash over Prince but it doesn't look good for the couple as the first promo for Monday's episode hints at the brewing tension between the two over the luggage fiasco.\nAman Verma and Kishwar Merchant:\nOur second jodi for the evening is @KishwerM and @AmanYatanVerma ! What do you think?! pic.twitter.com/YL6WlZOVYN\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nThey've known each other for quite some time and when it came to Kishwar to make a choice, it was a cakewalk. They are an interesting pair, given that it's hardly been a few hours inside the house and the two have already started bitching about the other contestants. We heard you call the others boring!\nDigangana Suryavanshi and Roopal Tyagi:\nWhat do you think about our 1st #DoubleTrouble Jodi? @DiganganaS and @roopaltyagi06 #BB9WithSalmanKhanTonight #BB9 pic.twitter.com/DDewhleAyd\n— Bigg Boss (@BiggBoss) October 11, 2015\nPretty faces and innocent demeanour, Digangana and Roopal might not look like strong contenders but you never know! They might just be the underdogs as well, given that they are the only two-girls pair inside the house.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KishwerM", "https://twitter.com/ArvindVegda", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653248951479439360", "https://twitter.com/roopaltyagi06", "https://twitter.com/DiganganaS", "https://twitter.com/RochelleMRao", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653252203331780608", "https://twitter.com/keithsequeira", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653265346036535296", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BB9?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BB9WithSalmanKhanTonight?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653261967717625857", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/vikasbhalla?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653240588943298560", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653237652091637760", "http://t.co/DDewhleAyd", "https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://twitter.com/suyyashrai", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/DoubleTrouble?src=hash", "http://t.co/HceQesDrmR", "https://twitter.com/BeingSalmanKhan", "http://t.co/UsOyhCw8MF", "http://t.co/8DyrxbtTN5", "http://t.co/eYT2xzLlnm", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653256371853332480", "https://twitter.com/manizhe", "https://twitter.com/ankitgera001", "https://twitter.com/princenarula88", "http://t.co/pgPazUnLA7", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RimiSen?src=hash", "http://t.co/YL6WlZOVYN", "http://t.co/b0oTFenaOv", "https://www.google.com/+nayandeeprakshit", "https://twitter.com/AmanYatanVerma", "https://twitter.com/BiggBoss/status/653271575525875712", "https://twitter.com/yuvikachoudhary"], "published": "2015-10-11T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:33:31.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
