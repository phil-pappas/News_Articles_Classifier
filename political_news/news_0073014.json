It said the new missile is precision guided and can be controlled until the moment of impact.\nSince 1992, Iran has emphasized a self-sufficient and indigenous military production industry, producing missiles, tanks and light submarines. The government frequently announces military advances which cannot independently verified.\nThe Islamic Republic already claims to have surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) that can hit Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Report%3A%20Iran%20test%20fires%20long-range%20ballistic%20missile&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Report%3A%20Iran%20test%20fires%20long-range%20ballistic%20missile", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe3cvu%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Report%3A%20Iran%20test%20fires%20long-range%20ballistic%20missile"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:58:18.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
