Many transportation options are on the table for Knowledge Park, even a street car. \nCity leaders believe Knowledge Park will be the economic hub of Rock Hill. It includes the downtown core area, City Hall, the former Bleachery property and The Cotton Factory. Thursday, city leaders met with the community to get feedback on how to make transportation smooth through the corridor. Options on the table include rubber-tired trolleys, buses, a street car and a pedestrian mall. \n\"I like the connection of Winthrop students being able to connect to our downtown. Having been a Winthrop student many years ago, I think anytime we can engage the students in the community it will maybe keep them here in the future it will be good for our downtown and for others,\" said Rebecca Melton, of Rock Hill. \nNo matter the mode of transportation the city settles on they hope to connect Winthrop University with Fountain Park. \nFor more information about Knowledge Park and the transportation plans: http://knowledgeparkrockhill.com/transportation/  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/local/rock-hill/2015/10/22/rock-hill-debating-transportation-options-for-knowledge-park/74432744/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:56:55.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
