\nMaria Eagle, who has consistently supported the renewal of Trident, finally agreed to take the post. \n• How Jeremy Corbyn's first conference descended into mutiny \nIt subsequently emerged that Mr Corbyn had told Miss Eagle, and the MPs who took junior defence minister roles, that it would not become Labour policy to scrap Trident. \nThey were also reportedly assured that MPs would be given a free vote on the issue in the House of Commons. \nHowever, those assurances quickly began to unravel. \nIn the following days Mr Corbyn again repeated his desire to see a nuclear-free Britain despite anger from members of his own shadow cabinet. \nMr Corbyn insisted that his party would “debate” the issue as part of his brand of “new politics”. \nHowever, Mr Corbyn’s opposition to Trident faced criticism from the union bosses who had helped him sweep to power so convincingly just weeks earlier. \nBoth Unite and the GMB said that Labour must back Trident because hundreds of thousands of jobs rely on its presence in Britain. \nSpeaking ahead of this week’s conference, Paul Kenny, the leader of the GMB, said: “We won't be supporting the scrapping of Trident for a whole variety of reasons, not least of which nobody can come up with how we're going to deal with the tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people who rely on that defence industry's jobs. \n\"People need to get real - this is not coffee bar politics - this is the real world.\" \nMr Corbyn listening on the stage Photo: Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph \nOn the opening day of the conference, Mr Corbyn risked angering his ministerial team as he used a BBC interview to reiterate his opposition to Trident and to insist that he would seek to “persuade” his shadow cabinet that Britain should not have nuclear weapons. \n“A nuclear-free world is a good thing,” he said. \nLabour was due to hold a potentially divisive vote on the issue at the conference. If Labour activists had backed a motion to scrap Trident, Mr Corbyn would have been able to argue that the party’s members favour abandoning the deterrent. \nHis opponents feared that he would use the vote to change Labour party policy “by the back door”. \nHowever, in his first defeat as Labour leader, the unions managed to persuade party members that the issue was not a significant enough priority for debate, forcing the party to abandon the vote. \nThen on Monday Miss Eagle used her conference speech to openly challenge Mr Corbyn over Trident and later suggested she could resign over the issue. \nMaria Eagle openly challenged the leader Photo: Ray Tang/REX Shutterstock \nShe said: \"My position on this has always been clear, let’s have the debate and let’s see what happens, at the appropriate stage something will probably have to give at some stage or another.\" \nBut the threat of a mutiny did not deter Mr Corbyn. \n• Jeremy Corbyn's Labour conference: Five things we learnt \nIn his conference speech, Mr Corbyn declared that his “mandate” gave him the right to oppose Trident regardless of the views of his shadow team. \n“There is one thing I want to make my own position on absolutely clear, and I believe I have a mandate from my election on it,” he said. \n“I don’t believe that £100billion spent on a new generation of nuclear weapons taking up a quarter of our defence budget is the right way forward.” \nWhile many on the shadow cabinet were quietly seething following the remarks, they decided to keep their counsel in the name of party mutiny. \nHowever, all that changed when Mr Corbyn appeared on BBC Radio 4 at 8.10am on Wednesday and declared that he would effectively disarm Britain if he was ever elected prime minister. \nAsked if he would ever authorise the use of nuclear weapons, he said: “No.” \nWithin hours Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister, came out to criticise Mr Corbyn. \n\"Labour party policy on Trident, endorsed by conference, is clear,” he said. “It would appear that as leader he is acting in the same way he was when he was on the back benches - picking and choosing what he supports.” \nHe was quickly followed by Miss Eagle and then four of her colleagues. \nThe Trident issue had suddenly become a full-scale rebellion. \nWith rumours of plots to oust Mr Corbyn ahead of the 2020 election, it would appear that Trident looks set to be the “pinch-point” that could come to define his leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:00:28.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
