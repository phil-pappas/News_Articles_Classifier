House leadership argued in its suit that money was never fully appropriated in Congress for the cost-sharing reductions, which pays insurers back for reducing the out-of-pocket health costs for low-income residents.\n  Florida Senate votes to remove Confederate flag from seal The new seal will replace the Confederate flag with the flags of ally nations, including France and Spain.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/19/15 5:31 PM House Speaker John Boehner said the court would hear the merits of the case this fall.\nThe latest ruling was \"another important step towards holding the president accountable for his unconstitutional actions,\" he said.\nThe White House was disappointed with the decision, saying that the House can't sue the executive branch for actions it disagrees with.\n\"The House lawsuit undermines centuries of historical practice and the fundamental principles of our system of democratic government,\" White House spokeswoman Katie Hill told the Washington Examiner. \nShe added that the administration is confident the courts will ultimately dismiss the lawsuit as a \"political stunt.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama lets China off the hook for currency manipulation Treasury admits that the near-term trajectory of the China's currency is 'difficult to assess.'\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/19/15 5:42 PM One legal expert was \"quite surprised\" by the ruling, since the case raises constitutionality concerns about whether the House can sue the executive branch.\n\"If the appellate court decides later, as it likely will, that Judge Collyer's court had no jurisdiction to hear this dispute, she has proceeded unconstitutionally in deciding the case on the merits,\" said Timothy Jost, legal professor at Washington & Lee University. \"Yet she has decided that she alone can decide whether to proceed, without seeking the guidance of the appellate court.\"\n\nTo be sure, Boehner's lawsuit has a ways to go, and even if it is successful it would not completely dismantle Obamacare.\nIt would require Congress to fund only the cost-sharing reductions. But that would be no easy task in a GOP-controlled Congress where opposition to the law remains high.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Senate considers bill to lighten mandatory minimum sentences Legislation aims to curb overcrowding in prisons.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/19/15 5:22 PM This year the government plans to pay $5 billion in subsidies, and that number is projected to balloon to $13 billion in the next five years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nIf insurers suddenly don't receive any subsidies, they may cease to provide marketplace coverage. Those that remain would have to raise rates to maintain solvency, experts have said. And those rate increase could force healthy people to drop out and make the Obamacare insurance markets unsustainable.\nBut insurers do have other ways of getting the subsidies. They could go before the Court of Claims, which oversees money claims against the federal government.\nTop Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:58:59.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
