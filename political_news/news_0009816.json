People need to trust that when they contact their MP or MSP, they can do so safely and securely.\n\"Following allegations of police spying on journalists, the Tory snooper's charter and the SNP's super ID database, this ruling is further evidence that our right to privacy is under serious threat.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-18T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:04:48.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
