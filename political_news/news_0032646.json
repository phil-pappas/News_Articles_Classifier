The Traditional Authority of Krobo in the Techiman North District of the Brong-Ahafo Region, has honoured Mr. Alex Kyeremeh, an indigene, for his dedicated and meritorious services towards the development of the town. \nMr. Kyeremeh, the current Member of Parliament (MP) for Techiman North and a Deputy Minister responsible for pre-tertiary education, first entered Parliament on January 2005, after retaining the seat for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Election 2004. \nHe, however, lost the seat to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Election 2008, but remained in government from January 2009 to January 2013, because of his appointment as the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Techiman by the late Professor John Evans Atta Mills. \nAt a grand durbar organized by the chiefs and people of the town to mark the occasion, which also coincided with the climax of their annual yam festival, Oyeadeeye Asa Akompanin, 'Krobohene,' his sub-chiefs and elders, gave Mr. Kyeremeh a citation of honour for bringing an unparalleled development to the town. \nThe glass-framed citation measured about four feet wide and six feet long, with his portrait and the Ghana Coat of Arms embossed on the right and left top corners respectively. \nAddressing the durbar, Oyeadeeye Akompanin who is also the Kyidomhene of the Techiman Traditional Area, explained the occasion was to express their appreciation to Mr. Kyeremeh, for endearing himself as an 'illustrious son of the town through politics.' \nQuoting from the citation, the Krobohene stressed the socio-economic development that had given a face-lift to both the Techiman South Municipality and the Techiman North District, under the instrumentality of Mr. Kyeremeh since his entry into active politics is unprecedented and unrivaled in the two areas' social and economic development history. \nHe stated trhat projects initiated and completed by Mr. Kyeremeh in his capacity as MP, an MCE, and a Deputy Minister, were unsurpassed in the Techiman Traditional Area, citing that they numbered over 100, pertaining to educational infrastructure, other facilities and scholarships to students, water and sanitation, roads, electricity and agriculture. \nOyeadeeye Akompanin praised Mr. Kyeremeh for raising the development profile of the Krobo township, and cited among others, that the community could now boast of a modern information communication technology (ICT) centre, a health training and nursing school, and a Community Day Senior High School, now under construction. \nHe however, debunked allegations by Mr. Kyeremeh's political detractors in the Techiman North that all developmental projects initiated by him had been brought to Krobo. \nThis, the Krobohene explained, was because virtually every community in both Techiman North and South constituencies has had its share of the numerous development projects through the initiative of Mr. Kyeremeh. \nOyeadeeye Akompanin advised Mr. Kyeremeh to practise open-door policy as a politician by promoting peace and tranquility in the Techiman North and also urged his supporters to pursue the path of peace and reconciliation but not the use of invective and vituperative language to create bitterness and rancor to result to violence. \nOseadeeyo Akumfi Ameyaw the fourth, Paramount Chief of Techiman asked people in the traditional area to emulate the commitment, sacrifices and efforts of Mr. Kyeremeh as a politician, because services performed for the general good of community and country would not go unrewarded. \nMr. Kyeremeh, an accountant by profession and the 10th of 11 siblings of his parents, in response admitted emotionally that 'I have been humbled by the occasion and what is contained in the citation as all those achievements was not by my power and might but through divine grace and empowerment'. \nThe Techiman North MP disclosed what he had politically achieved for the people of Techiman North and South, did not come without cost to his personal and family well-being, because not only his professional and academic development and progress that had been affected, but had it not been divine intervention, he could have even lost his life. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:53:13.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
