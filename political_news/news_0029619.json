That rekindled memories of teachers’ demonstrations before the reform was passed two years ago. More Eight ministers axed in Rousseff reshuffle \nHowever, in Tabasco police with shields and batons used tear gas to disperse teachers blocking a motorway toll booth. Mexico’s federal police chief vowed to use “rational force” wherever needed. \nWhile Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto has made liberalisation of the energy sector the cornerstone of his plans for economic growth and prosperity , it is his plans to improve the country’s nearly century-old public education system that he is now billing as the most transformational. \nAurelio Nuño, the president’s former chief of staff, took over the ministry a month and a half ago, with the task of enforcing a divisive reform under which teachers will in November start sitting tests to weed out non-performers. \nThat is a sea change for a system in which jobs were bought or inherited, and union bosses were untouchable. \n“This is a gigantic challenge,” Mr Nuño told the Financial Times in his fresco-lined office, where Mexico’s first education secretary set up the public system in 1921. At that time, only 10 per cent of children went to primary school. \nNow, elementary school attendance is near universal, but performance is poor. Roughly 13 per cent of schools have physical problems, lacking necessities such as water, roofs or floors. What we have to do in the 21st century is boost quality . . . I think in a decade — less — we’ll have big results \n- Aurelio Nuño \n“The great achievement, this great utopia, the great dream of the 20th century, was creating [the system],” Mr Nuño said. “What we have to do in the 21st century is boost quality . . . I think in a decade — less — we’ll have big results.” \nOxford-educated Mr Nuño speaks quietly with an academic air and seems more at home lost in a history book than fighting one of Mexico’s most powerful political lobbies. Yet he orchestrated the ousting in July of the dissident teachers’ union, CNTE, from its 22-year stranglehold on the Oaxaca state education ministry, IEEPO — a move he sees as crucial to smashing opposition to the reform. \nThat change is already bearing fruit, he said. Teachers in Oaxaca still belong to the CNTE, but its pulling power has been weakened. While in the past unions enforced mandatory teacher attendance at demonstrations, at a protest earlier this month 70 per cent of schools were closed, and on Monday 62 per cent were shut, according to IEEPO. \n“It’s still a process . . . a lot [of teachers] are still afraid of [CNTE] reprisals,” acknowledged Mr Nuño. But he hailed as progress the fact that he had been allowed to visit a school in Oaxaca, where parents dared to speak out against the union. \nNovember’s evaluations, designed to introduce a meritocracy, will be the next big test. The reform gives underperforming teachers three strikes at the exam before they are out of the classroom. But those who excel can expect pay rises over the next 10 years, of some 220 per cent, Mr Nuño said.
