That commitment to supporting hungry families, combined with a donation from Meijer, raised the fall campaign total to more than $3 million , making it the most successful campaign since Simply Give began in November 2008 .\n\"We cannot thank our customers, team members and food pantry partners enough for continuing to rise to the challenge and help us feed hungry families in the communities we serve,\" Co-Chairman Hank Meijer said. \"It's inspiring to see this level of engagement.\"\nThe Grand Rapids, Mich. -based retailer began its Simply Give program as a way to help local food pantries throughout the Midwest achieve their mission of feeding hungry families.\nThanks to the fall campaign that ended in mid-September, Simply Give has generated more than $18.6 million for those partners to restock their shelves and feed hungry families. That total includes an estimated $750,000 donation from the Meijer LPGA Classic to the Simply Give program.\nBut, more importantly, those donations stay local, said Janet Emerson , executive vice president of retail operations for Meijer.\n\"We know how important it is to our customers that their generous donations remain local,\" Emerson said. \"That's why each of our stores partner with a food pantry in their community during the Simply Give campaigns.\"\nDuring each Simply Give program, which runs three times a year, customers are encouraged to purchase a $10 Simply Give donation card upon checkout. Once purchased, the donation is converted into a Meijer Food-Only Gift Card and donated directly to the local food pantry selected by the store.\n\"Hunger is a problem that continues to increase in all of our communities,\" Hank Meijer said. \"The Simply Give program gives everyone a chance to work toward ensuring no one has to live without food.\"\nTo view a video the further explains the Simply Give program, and other Meijer hunger relief efforts, please visit http://newsroom.meijer.com/meijer-simply-give-video .\nAbout Meijer Philanthropy: Meijer is a family-owned retailer based in Grand Rapids, Mich. with a fundamental philosophy aimed at strengthening the communities it serves.
