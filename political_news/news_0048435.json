But there are ambitious plans to build on what is in place over the next 20 to 30 years to \"create a new city, and an outstanding living environment for all of us\", said Mr Lee.\nIn the interim, there is still the need to improve standards and remedy shortcomings, he added.\nThe clear mandate for the ruling People's Action Party at the Sept 11 polls was a sign of continued political stability that has attracted multinational firms to invest here.\nOne such company increased its stake with another billion-dollar investment after the poll results.\n\"I have no doubt that the election result boosted this investor's confidence that they were making the right decision, and that they could be confident Singaporeans would keep our fundamentals strong. I am sure that our neighbours noticed too, as have others,\" he said.\nThe mandate also allowed PM Lee to \"reinforce my team and pursue renewal vigorously\".\n\"The clock is ticking, we have no time to lose,\" he said, noting that there were new appointees in almost all ministries.\nThe younger leaders \"have to be tested, learn the ropes, prove themselves, and shake down as a team\".\n\"Increasingly, they will carry the Government's programme - initiating, explaining and executing policies, and persuading people to support these policies, which will increasingly be their policies.\"\nThe older ministers will provide the team with depth and breadth, as well as guidance and mentorship.\nTo Singaporeans, Mr Lee said: \"You have entrusted Singapore to me and my team, not just because of what we have done, but also because you are confident of what we will do. You trust that we will act on our words and live up to our promises, and we will.\"\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on October 02, 2015, with the headline ''Steady hands and fresh perspectives' in new Cabinet'.
