A run-off is normally organised 21-days after December 7 on December 28 as stipulated by law. \nPaul Abrampah Mensah believes that if the elections are held early it will help the EC and the political parties to resolve any disagreement after the elections. \nContributing to the discussions on the proposal by the EC, a Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Ghana, Dr. Poku Adusei also noted that if elections are held on time it will help the out-going government for instance to properly account for state properties. \nHe said the proposed date would also allow enough time for the outgoing government to hand over notes on national policies to the in-coming government. \n“I support the proposal that we should change the current election date because the elections are not always won by one-touch victory by a political party looking at the things” Dr. Poku Adusei also asserted. \nSharing his views on the current controversial debate surrounding the Ghana’s voter’s register, Dr. Poku Adusei stated that democracy is very expensive and for that matter the nation must consider the interest of Ghanaians to prevent any possible mayhem that may occur after the elections.
