So, what is adversely affecting the world, is helping us,\" Jailtey said, while addressing Pune's top 20 industrialists here.\nJaitley further said that the export-led China is now transforming into domestic consumption-based economy and has moved from manufacturing to service sector as a result of global slowdown.\n\"In the last 30 odd years, China grew at an average of 9% plus. No other country in the world has done that. And that is how they transformed the entire economy. Their current situation is that they were export-led. The world economy is weak, so the world can buy less. So their exports are going down. It impacts on their manufacturing. Their salary bills are going up,\" Jaitley said.\n\"China has now changed its strategy. New Chinese normal is a 7% growth. The IMF believes it may be lower to 6% or even lower. Their model is now changing from export-led growth to domestic consumption, from manufacturing to services. In the last decade China has shouldered the world economy because 50% of the global growth came from China,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:12:51.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
