It will take the total value of the cruise industry for Northland to $29 million so it is significant economic contributor. \n\"We applaud the community-led Cruise Ship Ambassador programme that personalises the experience. That is helped by our sheer physical beauty, but as we noted at a recent industry forum, there is still room for improvement and for much growth. \n\"One thing highlighted by the cruise industry is the challenges thrown up by infrastructure. \n\"This will not surprise Northlanders but it shows how regions need investment so they can grow. Infrastructure is central to the development of many of our industries here, which is why the Prime Minister must deliver on his copious promises. \n\"Otherwise, not just Northland voters but those in other cruise ports, like Tauranga and Napier will wonder what the Minister of Tourism is doing,\" says Mr Peters. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
