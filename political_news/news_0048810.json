The movement honors Native American culture; it is also a counter-celebration to Columbus Day and protest of the European conquest of North America (which had been \"discovered\" centuries earlier by native peoples). \nA Facebook page lists many Twin Cities events on Monday, including a sunrise ceremony at Bde Maka Ska, also known as Lake Calhoun. It's at 7:15 a.m., at 3700 Thomas Av. S., Minneapolis. \nSome other events: Red Shawl Round Dance, 9 a.m., followed by brunch and panel discussion, American Indian Center, 1530 E. Franklin Av., Minneapolis St. Paul Indigenous Peoples Day, 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m., Crowne Plaza, 11 Kellogg Blvd. E., St. Paul The Indigenous Peopleâ€™s Day Hip Hop Show, 5-8:30 p.m. Augsburg College, 2211 Riverside Av., Minneapolis Get MinnPost's top stories in your inbox First Name: *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:53:49.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
