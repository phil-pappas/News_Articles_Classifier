A jury was picked Monday.\nThe Swiss national has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges.\nProsecutors say the guard-forward was combative and ignored their orders to clear an established crime scene following an earlier stabbing outside the trendy 1Oak Club in Chelsea.\nHe suffered a season-ending leg fracture in the struggle.\nSefolosha's attorney Alex Spiro suggested during jury selection that his client may have been mouthy in the confrontation but said no crime was committed.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
