I don't believe that Abu Mazen is capable of negotiating an agreement now,\" Ross said, using Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's familiar name, when asked about the prospects for a deal during Obama's tenure.\nRoss said Obama could reassure Netanyahu by offering to set up a consultative committee to address Israeli concerns about Iran and to weigh options together to counter Iran's support for Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia opposed to Israel.\nFor Netanyahu, who spoke against the nuclear deal in March at the invitation of Republicans in the US House of Representatives, Ross said, \"I don't think there's anything more important than that Israel has to be an American issue, not a Republican or Democratic issue.\"\n\"Within the White House there's clearly a sense that they see him as playing a partisan game, and I think it would be important for him to make it very clear in words and deeds that that's the last thing on his mind right now,\" Ross said.\n\"The reality is we've seen these periods before and afterwards we've also seen efforts to mend the fences,\" he said, citing previous Israeli tensions with the administrations of presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.\nRoss said Netanyahu would help matters if he took three steps: working with Israel's allies Britain, France and Germany to help them better understand his country's concerns, opening his coalition to more moderate political parties, and proving his interest in a two-state solution by saying no to building further Jewish settlements on land he envisions as part of a future Palestinian state.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:42:27.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
