The median base salary for a PA in 2014 rose to $93,800 a year, a $3,800 increase from 2012. The survey found that in addition to salary, more than half (54%) of all PAs received monetary bonuses and more than 75 percent of PAs receive some other form of additional compensation, such as research stipends, profit sharing, student loan repayment, paid relocation, tuition reimbursement or signing bonuses.\n\"PAs are a dynamic and driving force across all of healthcare. This survey is invaluable to those who are looking to change specialties or geographic location, or who just want to understand their position in the marketplace,\" said Jennifer Dorn , CEO of AAPA. \"It's also a key tool for employers, as they recognize and reward the crucial role PAs play in reducing costs, increasing access for patients and delivering quality care.\"\nThe AAPA survey provides high-quality, detailed information on PA compensation and benefits, including base salary, hourly wages and bonus, by region, specialty, employer, setting and experience. Highlights of the AAPA Salary Survey 2015 include:\nPAs at critical access hospitals ($115,000) , industrial facilities ($115,000) , and hospital emergency departments ($101,920) reported the highest median compensation levels. PAs in the cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgery specialty reported the highest median base salary ($117,000) followed by interventional radiology ($105,500) , emergency medicine ($102,960) and pediatric surgery ($102,500) . PAs with less than one year of experience had a base salary of $85,000 , which rose to $89,000 for those with 2 to 4 years, and $96,000 for those with 5 to 9 years' experience. AAPA administered the online survey between February and March, 2015. More than 10,000 AAPA members and nonmembers responded. The sample closely resembles the PA population, with an overrepresentation of responses from AAPA members. The margin of error for the survey was +/1 <1 percent. Survey responses were de-identified and analyzed in aggregate form.\nMore information on the AAPA Salary Survey 2015 can be found at: https://www.aapa.org/research/salary-report .\nAbout the American Academy of Physician Assistants\nAAPA is the national organization that advocates for all PAs and provides tools to improve PA practice and patient care.
