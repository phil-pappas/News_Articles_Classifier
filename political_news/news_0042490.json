(AP Photo/Richard Shiro, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 3, 2015 | 3:00 a.m. EDT + More By BILL BARROW, Associated Press\nGREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) â€” For two weeks, Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina has been repeating an erroneous description of videos secretly recorded by anti-abortion activists.\nAgain on Friday, Fiorina said she \"absolutely\" stands by her criticism of Planned Parenthood.\nAt the second GOP debate, she described a video as showing a fully formed fetus on a table, with legs kicking, while someone talks about keeping it alive to \"harvest its brain.\"\nBut that detailed scene does not occur in the videos.\nIn one, a woman discusses harvesting the brain of an aborted fetus. But video producers say the image shown is stock footage of a stillborn baby, not from abortion, and comes from a hospital procedure unconnected with Planned Parenthood.\nStill, Fiorina has dug in, making her stance against Planned Parenthood a campaign centerpiece.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
