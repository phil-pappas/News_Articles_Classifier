(TWSE: 2325, NASDAQ: SPIL) (the \"Company\") has formally received a Preliminary Injunction Petition on yesterday afternoon from the Taichung District Court (Year 2015 No. 101) (the \"Petition\") filed by Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (TWSE: 2311, NYSE: ASX) (\"ASE\") seeking to enjoin the convening on October 15, 2015 of an extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the Company.\nSince receiving the Petition, the Company has convened internal meetings and had discussions with outside counsels, and will duly file a response to the Petition to the court in accordance with law.\nThe Company regrets that ASE, which has repeatedly claimed that it is making a \"financial investment\" in the Company, and who is not yet a formally registered shareholder of the Company, abruptly seeks to prevent the Company from holding the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. ASE is obstructing the opportunity all shareholders of the Company to attend and express their views at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. ASE had made numerous public statements urging shareholders of the Company to attend the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on October 15, 2015 , but now ASE seeks to prevent the Company from calling this meeting on October 15, 2015 . ASE's positions are apparently contradictory.\nThe Company will in accordance with the law protect our shareholders' attendance of the lawfully-convened extraordinary shareholders' meeting, and concurrently urges our shareholders to attend the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on October 15, 2015 , and support the Company's proposals.\nContact:\nJanet Chen, IR Director\nSiliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd.\njanet@spil.com.tw\nNo.45, Jieh Show Rd.\n+886-3-5795678#3675\nHsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu\nByron Chiang, Spokesperson\nTaiwan, 30056\nbyronc@spil.com.tw\nwww.spil.com.tw\n+886-3-5795678#3671\n releases/response-to-ases-filing-of-preliminary-injunction-300153723.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/response-to-ases-filing-of-preliminary-injunction-300153723.html", "http://www.spil.com.tw/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=HK19162&Transmission_Id=201510030331PR_NEWS_USPR_____HK19162&DateId=20151003"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:50:20.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
