Clinton rallied her supporters with a shouted “We are geared up and ready to go!” at a rally here Saturday afternoon -- at a parking-lot pep rally featuring her husband and pop star Katy Perry. That phrase echoed Obama’s “Fired up! Ready to go!” call-and-response chant that tore through the room then -- and shocked a less organized, less fired-up Clinton campaign that was based on experience and competence.\nOn Saturday, the sting of the 2008 J-J Dinner -- and Clinton’s determination to capture some of the energy that became a feature of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgency -- was at the forefront of the campaign’s planning. Hours before the dinner, the campaign announced an endorsement from David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager. “To be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this,” Plouffe wrote. “And I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me … She’s the right person to protect President Obama’s legacy on health care and so much else.”\nThe campaign also seemed to have learned its lesson about being out-organized. More than 100 volunteers and staffers, at points joined by campaign manager Robby Mook, started marching in the streets of downtown Des Moines before 7 a.m. on a chilly fall Saturday. The campaign headquarters in Des Moines was filled by the afternoon with hundreds of volunteers attending a training session, dressed in royal-blue T-shirts that read “I’m Fighting for Her.” The campaign also brought out the big dog for his first official appearance on the trail: Former President Bill Clinton gave a 15-minute speech Saturday afternoon, appearing to relish being back on the campaign trail and in the spotlight.\n\"The American people in the last six weeks have learned a lot about Hillary — what she’s for, why she’s running, and what kind of president she’d be,\" he told a large crowd that had lined up and waited for an hour-and-a-half for a short set performed by Perry. \"If they watched 'Saturday Night Live,' they know she’s a pretty good bartender, too.\"\nBill Clinton rallies Iowa crowd with talk of emails By Annie Karni and Glenn Thrush\nThe dinner also marks a critical moment for Sanders, who needs to show he can maintain the enthusiasm that buoyed him all summer even as Clinton grows in strength after the one-two punch of her debate performance and her testimony Thursday in front of the House Benghazi Committee. At Clinton’s rally, a single-engine plane flying a banner “Revolution Starts Now: FEEL THE BERN,” flew over the modest stage set up in front of the Hy-Vee Hall, a sign of the challenge Clinton still faces, even as she benefits from the boost of a ten-day winning streak.\nSanders’ campaign also planned a rally before the dinner, with alumni of the band Guster getting the crowd amped up. “Our allotted 1,950 seats will all be full,” said Robert Becker, Iowa State director for the Sanders campaign. “Bernie will address the rally, and then we’ll march across the Des Moines River. We’re going to be a diverse and rowdy bunch.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:08:34.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
