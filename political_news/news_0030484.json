Michele Mossip Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Extending the goods and services tax to education would be the fairest way to raise additional revenue, according to new modelling that suggests the burden would fall largely on wealthier households.\nIt would also raise an extra $3 billion from 2019-20, rising to $14 billion a year in 2049-50, according to research by accounting firm PwC.\nPwC tax partner Paul Abbey estimates that broadening the GST to include education would cost the nation's top 20 per cent of individuals, who earn more than $88,000 a year, an extra $221 a year.\nBy contrast, the poorest 20 per cent, living off just over $17,000 a year, would pay $19 a year extra, while those in the middle income quintile, who earn on average $32,000, the cost would be $65.\nThe findings support the case for expanding the GST's reach in a way that wouldn't increase the burden on lower-income families and potentially lessen the need for compensation.\nFair reform GST reform is increasingly seen as a change that could be part of a broader package of reform that would support fairness across the tax system by reducing the government's heavy and rising reliance on company and income taxes.\nPwC argues in its report that the impact on Australians on the lowest 20 per cent of the population would be far less than broadening the GST to include food or healthcare, or hiking the rate.\n In essence, while the exemption on education helps poorer families, it effectively provides a significant subsidy to the wealthiest.\n\"Providing relief by constraining the base of the GST is a very poorly targeted revenue measure,\" said Mr Abbey, who will appear in Melbourne at a tax conference hosted by the Tax Institute on Friday.\n\"If you constrain the base of the GST so certain categories of expenditure are excluded then, sure for lower income earners you relieve the burden, but most of it is enjoyed by higher income earners.\nMr Abbey said the benefit to high income households of the exemption is so great that removing it would actually be progressive â€“ or target those with greater capacity to pay while shielding those who don't.\nSound revenue base He said such a move would be consistent with recommendations over more than three decades of tax reviews, including the 1975 Asprey report and the 2010 Henry Tax Review that the GST should be as simple, efficient and broadly-based and set on as low a rate as possible to provide a sound revenue base for the delivery of services.\n\"This has always been a feature of the tax reform debate but we have never properly embraced it.\n\"Trying to deliver equity through the GST system is really inefficient and poorly targeted,\" he said, arguing that fairness should be ensured through income taxes and welfare measures.\n\"For equity outcomes, the GST is a shotgun, whereas the income tax system is a rifle.\nPwC's modelling shows that measured as a proportion of disposable income, the GST exemption provides a greater fillip to wealthier families, who also tend to spend more of their incomes on schools and universities.\nThe budgets of those in the lowest quintile would be reduced by 0.1 per cent, those in the third or middle quintile would be 0.2 per cent lower and those in the top quintile would also be 0.2 per cent lower.\nThe same pattern is apparent when households, as opposed to individuals, are looked at.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:07:48.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
