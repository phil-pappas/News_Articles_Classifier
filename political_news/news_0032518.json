Republicans on Friday launched a new attack on President Obama ’s handling of the Libyan consulate killings, trying to undermine his national security credentials before a presidential debate on foreign policy.\nTwo top Republican congressmen and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan accused the Obama administration of providing inadequate security at the consulate before the killings — and inadequate information afterward.\n“Your administration has not been straightforward with the American people in the aftermath of the attack,” read a letter to Obama from Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).\nThe pair said their House oversight panel uncovered requests from U.S. personnel in Libya asking for increased security before last month’s attack, when Islamic militants stormed the consulate in Benghazi and killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\nThe letter claimed the call for more protection was rejected because the administration was eager to show improving conditions in Libya after the revolution that toppled Libyan dictator Moammar Khadafy.\n“These critical foreign policy decisions are not made by low or mid-level career officials — they are typically made through a structured and well-reasoned process that includes the National Security Council and the White House,” wrote Issa and Chaffetz.\nVice presidential candidate Paul Ryan reinforced the attack, telling a Wisconsin radio station, “Look around the world, turn on your TV.\nAnd what we see in front of us is the absolute unraveling of the Obama administration’s foreign policy.”\nWhat happened in Libya and the administration’s response is expected to be a flashpoint in Monday’s debate between Obama and Mitt Romney — their third and final debate of the campaign.\nElisa Miller for New York Daily News Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama address reporters on Sept 12, a day after Libyan attacks on U.S. consulate.\nThe White House has said that any requests for additional security for diplomats in Libya never reached the Oval Office, and that all security decisions were made by the State Department.\nOn Monday, Secretary of State Clinton said that she accepted responsibility for the security failures in Libya. The next day, at the second presidential debate, Obama said the buck stopped with him.\n“I’m the President and I’m always responsible,” he said.\nDuring an appearance Thursday on “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” the President went further, acknowledging mistakes by the administration, and adding, “We’re going to fix it.”\nThe administration’s shifting characterizations of the attack — initially calling it a protest that got out of hand, then calling it a terror attack — also have been under scrutiny, and came up on “The Daily Show.”\n“I would say and even you would admit it was not the optimal response — at least to the American people as far as all of us being on the same page,” Stewart said.\nThe President replied, “Here is what I would say: If four Americans get killed it is not optimal. And we are going to fix it. Fix all of it. And what happens during the course of a presidency, you know the government is a big operation at any given time, something screws up and you make sure you find out what’s broken and you fix it.”\nSome Obama critics have seized on the President’s use of the phrase “not optimal,” saying it showed insensitivity to the victims.\nThe mother of Sean Smith, a State Department employee killed in the consulate attack, told the Daily News Friday that she was not upset by the President’s comment.\n“It did not (bother me),” Pam Smith, 72, of San Diego, said. “It’s all politics. it doesn’t matter. All I am interested in is finding out what happened to my son.”\njlemire@nydailynews.com\nTags: benghazi controversy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:22:24.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
