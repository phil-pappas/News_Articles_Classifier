A Supreme Court news release Friday says an appeal to the high court was denied.\nTwo people had filed a challenge saying Crawford failed to file a 2012 tax return and a judge ruled in their favor. But the 4th Circuit reversed the ruling and dismissed the appeal on procedural issues. Those issues stemmed from a mistake in the original challenge: The candidate was misidentified as Raymond instead of Ray Crawford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:40:52.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
