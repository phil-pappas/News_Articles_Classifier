McCarthy | News Political Reporter | @bobmccarthybn on October 19, 2015 - 6:00 AM Tweet ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter years of efforts to transform the busy Scajaquada Expressway into a much slower parkway, a powerful Washington advocate is adding his voice. \nSen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., is endorsing state Department of Transportation studies aiming to permanently slow speeds on Route 198, where an accident claimed the life of a 3-year-old boy in May when he was hit by a car in the park. \n“The horrible accident this past May was an absolutely preventable tragedy, and if we don’t act quickly, it could happen again,” Schumer says. “That’s why I am urging the federal Department of Transportation to work with New York State and local officials to quickly approve this plan, which would pump the brakes on cars that speed through this area and add greater protection for families and children living in the neighboring Parkside community.” \nSchumer had been scheduled to appear in Delaware Park on Monday to unveil ways in which the federal government can expedite the process, with an eye toward improvements to discourage the speeding vehicles that remain a problem. However, a spokesman said late Sunday that the appearance has been canceled because the senator wasn’t feeling well. \nNevertheless, his voice is being added to those calling for the high-speed road to be permanently reduced to a parkway. \nThe Buffalo News reported Friday that roughly 1,200 vehicles have been stopped on the Scajaquada over the last four months for exceeding the 30 mph speed limit imposed after the death of Maksym Sugorovskiy, 3, of Buffalo, who was killed May 30 when a car jumped into the park from the expressway (whose posted speed limit at the time was 50 mph). \nIt is also expected that Schumer will urge the state to move quickly on its study of how to best change the road from expressway to parkway and integrate it with adjacent Delaware Park. \nSchumer notes that while the state must approve the changes, “federal approval is a critical step in making this plan a reality.” He adds that federal authorities “should work with state and local officials to ensure the safety analysis that is needed to keep the process moving is done without delay.” \nAssemblyman Sean M. Ryan, D-Buffalo, another parkway advocate, said Sunday: \n“I thank Sen. Schumer for his strong support of the effort to downgrade the Scajaquada Expressway and create a parkway. … We need the Federal Highway Administration to sign off on this important change of designation to move forward on short-term and long-term changes to the Scajaquada.” \nHowever, Schumer may not encounter total support for his plan. The News received substantial comment on its website or in emails following its Friday article on speeding citations, much of it critical of the slower speeds. \nMany people remain unhappy with the congestion that the slower speed limit has generated on Route 198, or question its necessity on the western portions that traverse an industrial section and not the park. \n“I have people driving down my street residential areas faster than 30 mph,” one reader said. “This is a joke and will not prevent anything.” \nAnother reader called the increased rate of issuing tickets “a joke and waste of taxpayer money.” \nNevertheless, the DOT revealed during a September public meeting its short-term plans for the road, including installation slated for this month of pedestrian crossings at Hoyt and Mirror lakes, and another at Delaware Avenue. \nThe “raised table” crosswalks will feature a gradual ramp on each side and a flat middle that rises to curb level, along with high-visibility markings. DOT spokeswoman Susan S. Surdej explained then that the crossing just west of the Delaware Avenue bridge will be controlled by a conventional three-color traffic signal, while the lakes crossings will be controlled by a HAWK, or high-intensity activated crosswalk beacon. \nNew pathways will also be built to connect the crossings to nearby roadways. \nIn addition, the DOT will replace the galvanized “box beam” guide rail installed this summer between the expressway and Delaware Park with an “ironwood” guide rail, which will be “more in keeping with the setting of the corridor,” Surdej said. \nThe combination wood-and-iron product looks like timber logs and has a more natural appearance, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:29:35.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
