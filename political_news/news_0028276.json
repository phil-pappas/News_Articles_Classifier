I am the next president of this great country,' Nana Akufo-Addo stated to a rapturous applause from party faithful in Kumasi. \nHe said irrespective of how the NDC would perform, in terms of votes accumulation, the 2016 presidential elections would be a done deal for the NPP if the party was able to secure 80 percent of votes cast, urging the NPP fans in the region to work towards the 80 percent target. \nNana Akufo-Addo was addressing NPP constituency executives from New Edubiase, Adanse Asokwa, Asante Akyem South, Bosome Freho, Sekyere Afram Plains, Ejisu, Juaben, Effiduase, Asokore and Ejura Sekyeredumase in Kumasi on Thursday. \nThe historic meeting at Georgia Hotel formed part of activities of Nana Akufo-Addo's famous 'Rise and Build' tour which has seen the astute politician visiting about nine regions in the country, healing party wounds and boosting NPP unity ahead of the 2016 general elections. \nEvery Vote Counts Nana Akufo-Addo indicated that the NPP needs every vote in the Ashanti Region in order to win the 2016 presidential election at a go, indicating that the party ought to maximise its votes in all the constituencies. \nHe tasked the NPP executives and the teeming members to intensify their campaign so that they could win new souls to the party, reminding them that the NPP is going into the 2016 polls with a single motive of winning hands down. \nLamentation The NPP standard bearer expressed grave concern over how the country had been mismanaged by the Mahama-led National Democratic Congress (NDC) government, leading to its retrogression in terms of development. \nHe openly decried how the local currency (cedi) is depreciating against the major international currencies, which has led to the collapse of private businesses, created poverty and high unemployment rate, adding that he felt uncomfortable to see his dear country being plunged into such difficulties. \nUnity Nana Akufo-Addo hammered on the need for the NPP members, notably the winners and losers in the party's parliamentary polls, to unite as one people with a common destiny and purpose, stressing that without unity the party's dream of winning the next election would be a mirage. \n3 rd Time Lucky Nana, who sounded confident, stated that he was sure that his third attempt at annexing the highest seat on the land would be a success. He indicated that he was prepared to give off his best so as to ensure that the NPP emerge winners in next year's polls. \nHe said the NPP, like any human institution or group, has internal problems and that he would team up with the party's major stakeholders to resolve all the perceived internal wrangling soon so that the party would enter the 2016 polls with a united front. \nParty gurus like Dr Kwame Addo Kufuor, Alan Kyerematen, Sammi Awuku, Bernard Antwi Boasiako aka Wontumi, Otiko Afisa Djaba, SK Boafo, FF Anto, John Boadu, Sam Pyne, Joe Ghartey, Dr Konadu Apraku and Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto were present at the function. \nFROM I.F.
