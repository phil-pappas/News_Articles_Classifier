Roseman University is the only institution to be awarded the grant in the Intermountain West region.\n\"The College of Nursing at Roseman University is pleased to help our service men and women transition from soldiers to students, and ultimately to registered nurses,\" said Brian Oxhorn , BS, MS, Ph.D, dean of the College of Nursing. \"Not only does this provide great career opportunities for our veterans, but it helps address the need for highly skilled professional nurses in Southern Nevada and the region.\"\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration projects that grants awarded to Roseman University and 30 other institutions across the country will enable more than 1,000 veterans nationally to obtain baccalaureate nursing degrees. Under the grant, Roseman University and other recipients will recruit veterans and prepare undergraduates for practice and employment in local communities and also develop career ladders that include academic and social supports, career counseling, mentors and linkages with veteran service organizations and community health systems.\nWorking closely with the Department of Veteran's Affairs, Roseman University's nursing program will provide veterans the opportunity to receive academic credit for prior military training, experience and leadership. The program will also address the physical, emotional and environmental issues that may be unique to veterans that could potentially impact learning, completion of the program, and the ability to gain employment once they graduate. This includes faculty development activities to enhance faculty understanding of military culture and teaching strategies that address the unique needs of veterans both in and outside of the classroom.\n\"Studies have shown the difficulty for veterans assimilating back into civilian life, getting a job and using the medical skills they developed in the military,\" said Jene Hurlbut, RN , MSN, Ph.D., professor and Roseman's grant program director. \"The grant enables Roseman University to build on the foundation of their military experiences with the nursing education curriculum and clinical experiences to develop them into nursing leaders.\"\nRoseman's College of Nursing offers an 18-month Bachelor of Sciences in Nursing and a 15-month Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The programs, accredited by Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, are taught using Roseman's highly effective teaching model that is unique to health professions education. The Roseman Educational Model is immersive and incorporates mastery learning, problem-based and active learning, cooperative or team-based learning, and a block system model of curricular design specifically engineered to support attainment of learning outcomes and the highest level of achievement for all students.\nRoseman assesses students based on its mastery learning philosophy, rather than the traditional testing and letter grading system. Students are assessed regularly on their knowledge and skills, and must score 90% or higher on assessments of their programmatic knowledge and clinical skills. This model has been employed from the inception of the university and is utilized in all academic programs. Throughout the institution's history, the Roseman Educational Model has been proven to produce competent, high-quality health care professionals.\nFor information about the Veterans to Bachelor of Science in Nursing at Roseman University, call 702-968-1651 or email vbsn@roseman.edu .\nAbout Roseman University of Health Sciences\nFounded in Henderson, Nevada in 1999, Roseman University of Health Sciences is a private, non-profit institution of higher learning with campuses in Henderson , Summerlin and South Jordan, Utah .
