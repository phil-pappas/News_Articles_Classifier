Other regions can promise 50% but we are going to give you 80%”. \nBut speaking on Peace FM’s Krokrokoo show hosted by Wednesday, Kwaku Baako who is also the Editor -in-Chief of the New Crusading Guide Newspaper roundly condemned the praise singing attitude of the chiefs, describing it as pure sycophancy. \nHe cautioned the chiefs to avoid sounding political in their utterances as they are barred by the constitution to engage in partisan politics. \nHowever speaking to Kwaku Owusu Adjei on Si Mi So on Kasapa 102.3 FM , Koku Anyidoho took strong exception to the position held by Kwaku Baako. \n“Yesterday on Peace FM, I heard two of your colleagues, Kwaku Baako and Sefa Kayi ridiculing chiefs for giving the President Mahama thumbs up for bringing development to their area. These are two gentlemen who had fun under the eight years of President Kuffour and bloated their bank accounts. If Journalist during the regime of President Kufour can be rewarded with big gold chains around their neck for singing the praises of President Kuffour, what is the crime in chiefs respecting President Mahama for bringing development to their area, are the journalists better and more important than the chiefs”. \nWhen pushed further to substantiate his claim of the two gentlemen having bloated their accounts he pleaded with the host that ” I won’t go there again”. \nKoku noted that the chiefs were not pressurized to praise the President but spoke out of their own volition in recognition of the good deeds of the President. \n“We never put chains around the necks of the chiefs, all what they said was to express their gratitude for the roads, schools and hospitals provided. So when journalists sit on air and condemn such chiefs for praising the President, meanwhile these journalists in their good time had big chains around their neck just for singing the praises of a certain president and being sycophantic to his course, should they be allowed to go away with it? …….The Chiefs are only being thankful. If President Kuffour had sent development to those communities, The Chiefs wouldn’t be thanking President Mahama because the facilities would have been there already. So what is the problem and business of some journalists who benefited under President Kufour to condemn those chiefs?
