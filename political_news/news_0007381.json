If they join forces with the left-wing pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy party, which won 10 seats, they will have the 68 seats needed to push forward their plan to make Catalonia independent from Spain by 2017.\nBut CUP had insisted that it would only join an independence bid if secessionist parties won more than 50 percent of the popular vote. They won only about 46 percent because of a quirk in Spanish election law that gives a higher proportion of legislative seats to rural areas with fewer voters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:54:23.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
