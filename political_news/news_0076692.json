It only implements a fraction of the issues already agreed by all parties years ago through the Silk Commission report. Effectively, the Bill as it stands, enshrines Wales’ status as a second class nation in the UK. Throughout this process, Plaid Cymru has sought consensus on issues that all parties have signalled agreement on previously. We’ve worked constructively and have been prepared to meet others half way in order to do so. Sadly, the UK Government is unwilling to facilitated that sort of outcome and the Labour Welsh Government have proven that they are not taken seriously at UK level.\n– Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood AM Last updated Tue 20 Oct 2015 Read more 7 updates Draft Wales Bill Politics Plaid Cymru Leanne Wood Cardiff Wales Newport Swansea North Wales South Wales Gwent Mid and West Wales", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:40:11.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
