To date, she has headlined 22 fundraisers in the state, second only to the 30 that the former secretary of state has headlined in New York.\nBefore the Aguilera event, Clinton will headline a $2,700-a-ticket fundraiser in Sacramento hosted by Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis, the former ambassador to Hungary during Clinton's time as Secretary of State.\nRead More Clinton will then travel to the Bay Area for an event in Los Altos hosted by Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of the personal genomics company 23andMe, Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, and Esther Wojcicki, the vice chair of the Creative Commons board of directors. Tickets for this fundraiser run between $500 and $2,700.\nOn Nov. 5, Clinton will headline a fundraiser in Los Angeles hosted by Rob Reiner, the actor, producer and political activist.\nRELATED: Clinton's Golden State dash for cash\nClinton last visited California in late September for a series of fundraisers ahead of the close of the third fundraising quarter. Her presidential campaign raised more than $28 million in that quarter, slightly more than the $25 million raised by Bernie Sanders.\nIt is likely that Clinton's November trip through California will include additional fundraisers, too.\nAnd it's not in California and it's not a fundraiser, but it does involve a celebrity - Iowa Democrats announced Saturday that on Oct. 24, Katy Perry will rally Clinton supporters in Des Moines before the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. The event is free and open to the public. Perry is a Clinton fan and her songs are played at the former first lady's campaign events.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:03:57.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
