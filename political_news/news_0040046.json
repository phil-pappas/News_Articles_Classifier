It will be effective from this fiscal year 2015-16, tax officials said.\nA senior I-T official told dna, \"The government has decided to tax 'notional rent' on the unsold inventory lying with the developers. This will certainly induce builders to sell flats and not to hold them awaiting price escalation in future. Such tax will force builders to sell property in competitive price.\"\ndna had reported on June 6 that Income Tax department is planning to impose fresh tax on unsold flats on estimated annual rentals.\n\"A lot of big investors are hoarding inventories in expectation of price rise. With the new mechanism, it will be at a cost,\" said the official.\nThe move comes after a thorough study on why property prices, especially in mega cities like Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bangalore, Chennai continued to remain stubbornly high despite the government records showing dismal registrations, said a government officials on the condition of anonymity.\n\"Many investors and developers with money power hold on to high rates and have formed a cartel in creating artificial shortage. So long, they have been escaping the tax net by classifying the unsold property in their books as 'stock-in-trade',\" said an official.\nThe tax rates will depend on the ownership of the property. If the property is on the name of investor/builder, they will be liable to pay tax based on the income slabs. For instance, the rental worth up to Rs 10 lakh should be liable for 10% tax. If the property or unsold stock is held in the name of company, a flat 30% tax will be levied.\nThe real estate companies should have to pay tax based on Annual Letting Value (ALV) on unsold flats as they are the owners of the flats and it does not matter whether the properties are rented out or not.\nThe real estate consultants view this as a productive step. As several developers hold apartments to benefit from the price appreciation that will accrue a few years after the project is complete.\nPankaj Kapoor, managing director of Liases Foras told dna, \"In country where we have housing shortage the rising inventory is a big paradox which clearly suggest that we are abusing a need rather then fulfilling it.\nInventory has increased drastically across the country. According to the data available for August, all-India average stood at 37 months of inventories. While in major property markets such as Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, it will take 72 months and 46 months respectively to clear the inventory.\nHowever, a property market expert said he does not really see any change with the introduction of the tax.\n\"The way the government has increased the ready reckoner rates and the taxes, the builders have very little margin to reduce. It has curtailed the scope of correction.\"\nHe further said, \"If the government really wants to make the property price affordable, they should focus on land price and the cost of capital. Both the prices should go under correction.\"", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/113800119999469295610/posts"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:47:15.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
