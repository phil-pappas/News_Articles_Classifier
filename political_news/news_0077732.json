Being that Colorado is a purple state, the candidates will be coming through here frequently.\"\nPresident Barack Obama visited the campus in November of 2012 during his re-election bid. The university is hosting the third Republican presidential debate on Oct. 28 at the Coors Events Center.\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/sarahkuta"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:58:46.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
