When asked early whether fliers should continue with those precautions, an airline spokesman said customers should expect a normal day Monday.\nSouthwest used backup systems around the country on Sunday to check-in travelers lacking printed or mobile boarding passes.\nAirline representatives have not said what was causing the problem, but a spokesman has said there was no indication that hackers were behind it.\nThere were about 450 delays out of 3,600 flights scheduled Sunday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
