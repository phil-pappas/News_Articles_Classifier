Hassan signs bills to restore Great Bay oyster reefs Conservation officials, politicians praise bipartisan legislation Comment Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 12:38 PM Updated at 6:52 AM Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 12:38 PM Updated at 6:52 AM • UNH oyster project: Cooperation on the half shell » Social News NEWMARKET — Highlighting Great Bay as an important natural resource to the Granite State, Gov. Maggie Hassan appeared at the Nature Conservancy in Newmarket Tuesday morning to sign House and Senate bills related to oyster reef restoration. “I’m very happy to be here in this stunning location … as we take another step towards strengthening our Great Bay, general environmental quality and quality of life,” Hassan said before signing Senate Bill 168 and House Bill 354. “Our natural resources are part of what makes us so special as a state … a healthy environment and good economic development go hand in hand.” Co-sponsor of House Bill 354, state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, explained the bill requires the Department of Environmental Services and state Fish and Game to make recommendations on the leasing of submerged state-owned property in the Great Bay estuary. She said this will assist in the restoration of the reefs. “(The oyster reefs) are critical to reducing the nitrogen in Great Bay,” Fuller Clark said. “Then perhaps we wouldn’t be having all of these EPA requirements to invest millions in wastewater treatment.” Oysters, according to conservation officials at the bill-signing, filter “a tremendous amount” of water naturally. Senate Bill 354 allows the executive director of Fish and Game, after a hearing, to close clam or oyster areas for the purpose of restoration of the area for a period of up to five years. Jim O’Brien of The Nature Conservancy said the bill will provide “consistency in oyster reconstruction” by allowing the areas to be closed during reconstruction. “It takes a long time, so you need consistency,” he said. “We recognize the importance of natural infrastructure to help us solve our environmental challenges.” O’Brien said SB 354 will also enable access to additional federal funds that require more control over the restoration process. Both bills had bipartisan support in Concord. State Rep. Adam Schroadter, R-Newmarket, another bill co-sponsor, praised “the teamwork and partnership that you find with these bills.” “Like everything that happens in New Hampshire, it takes a lot of oars in the water,” said Mark Zankel, state director of The Nature Conservancy, as he introduced Hassan. “As the recruiter in chief for the state of New Hampshire, I can say that it really makes a difference for businesses and people looking to move (to New Hampshire),” Hassan said, adding Great Bay is “magnificent and fragile.” “It’s important that we do everything we thoughtfully can to protect this wonderful resource that protects all of us,” she added.
