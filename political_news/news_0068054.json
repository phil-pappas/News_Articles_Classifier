The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the meeting by name. \nKerry, who will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday in Jordan, has said he wants clarity about the status quo about the site, but officials say he doesn't believe that needs to be in writing. \nWith only a general outline of goals in these discussions, Kerry arrived here intending to listen as much as talk, as he steers attempts to restore relative calm in Israel and the Palestinian territories. \nAfter Kerry meets Netanyahu he will see German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, and then travel to Vienna, where he will meet the foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia about Syria on Friday. He will then visit Amman, where he will see Jordan's King Abdullah in addition to his talks with Abbas. He plans to wrap up the trip in Saudi Arabia. \nComplicating his already delicate tasks, the situations in both hotspots have taken recent unexpected and potentially dangerous turns. Netanyahu blamed a former Palestinian leader for inspiring Hitler's Holocaust and new Palestinian stabbing attacks on Israelis have threatened to further inflame the combustible atmosphere. \nAnd, on the Syria front, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Syrian President Bashar Assad in Moscow, suggesting that Putin's support for Assad's government will not wane. \nAlthough State Department spokesman John Kirby wouldn't criticize Netanyahu for incitement, he said of the Holocaust comments, \"The scholarly evidence does not support that position.\" He took a similar constrained approach on Assad's trip to Russia, saying it was not surprising given the two countries' expanding military relationship. \nU.S. officials have yet to detail any American plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian unrest that erupted a month ago over Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site. During that time, 10 Israelis have been killed by Palestinian assailants, mostly in knife attacks, while 47 Palestinians — including 26 labeled by Israel as attackers — have been killed by Israeli fire. The remainder died in clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters. In addition, an Israeli mob killed an Eritrean migrant after mistaking him for an Arab attacker. \nThe site in question is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism and home to the biblical Temples. For Muslims, it is the Noble Sanctuary, home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam and a key national symbol for the Palestinians. The site, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, is a frequent flashpoint of violence. \nThe Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to change the longstanding \"status quo\" at the site, which allows Jews to visit but not to pray. They point to a growing number of Jewish visitors who seek an expanded Jewish presence and prayer rights at the site. \nNetanyahu says there are no plans to change the status quo, and that the Palestinian allegations are slanderous incitement. He says the hostile rhetoric, and incendiary videos making the rounds on social media, are fueling the violence. Then he said the mufti of Jerusalem during World War II, noted Nazi sympathizer Haj Amin al-Husseini, told Adolf Hitler to exterminate the Jews. \nInto this volatile mix, Kerry is now wading.
