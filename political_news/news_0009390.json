Matt Tilly resigned Tuesday in a letter to Gov. Mary Fallin. Tilly was appointed earlier this year to a six-year term. \nIn his letter, Tilly said he is resigning \"to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\" \nAttorney General Scott Pruitt called for an investigation after inmate Richard Glossip's execution was called off at the last minute on Sept. 30 when officials discovered a pharmacist had sent potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride for use in the lethal injection. \nAlso, autopsy results released earlier this month revealed that Oklahoma used potassium acetate to execute inmate Charles Warner in January.
