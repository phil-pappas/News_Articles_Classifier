They also point out that there was a change in methodology used to estimate areas of poppy cultivation, and while there was certainly a decrease, the percentage may not be exact.\nDue to the lower levels of cultivation, there was also a 48 percent reduction in the potential production of opium this year.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
