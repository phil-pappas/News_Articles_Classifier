The whale was first seened Saturday with netting all over its face and head, according to media reports. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rescuers tried to free the whale, but the netting caused it to become agitated, which posed a risk to the crew. “It’s heartbreaking when we come across a whale who’s suffering,” Capt. Dan Salas of Harbor Breeze Cruises told KCBS. Anyone who sees the whale today is asked to call the U.S. Coast Guard.
