(Photo: PTI) New Delhi : Terming Zaheer Khan's ability to read a match situation as \"one of the best\" among contemporary Indian cricketers, former India batsman VVS Laxman feels that the just-retired left-arm pacer would prove to be a \"great bowling coach\" because of his vast knowledge on the subject.\nEven the BCCI top brass have already started thinking as to how they can use Zaheer for the benefit of Indian cricket and it will only be a matter of time when he takes over the mantle of India's current bowling coach from Bharat Arun.\nLaxman, who is a member of BCCI's high-powered Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), spoke about how good Zaheer can be as a bowling coach.\n\"I think because of Zaheer's vast knowledge and experience and more importantly his communication skills, he will prove to be an excellent bowling coach, who can help in the development of young fast bowlers. His reading of the game is probably one of the best I have seen. I am sure he will contribute immensely in the growth of fast bowlers in the country,\" Laxman told PTI-Bhasha on Thursday.\nRead: Zaheer Khan reveals why he retired from international cricket\nTowards the end of his career, Zaheer also became a mentor to the next crop of fast bowlers. \"I would say that a lot wickets of other fast bowlers, who have played for India along with Zaheer, they have to give credit to him for some of the wickets that they took. He was fantastic with young fast bowlers,\" Laxman said.\n\"I would like to congratulate Zaheer for his outstanding career. For me his greatness was not only that he was skilful but he had the ability to plan a dismissal. His greatness lay in the fact that he became a world class performer despite not having great facilities at the start of his career,\" said Laxman.\n\"Having normal background and coming from a small town like Shrirampur and going through a tough time in Mumbai but still persevering and was determined to play at the highest level so he is an inspiration for a lot of youngsters,\" said the stylish batsman from Hyderabad.\nLaxman then fondly recollected that Zaheer was his roommate when he scored that epic 281 in Kolkata and how he inspired him before the start of the second innings against Australia.\nAlso Read: The most clever fast bowler I know, says MS Dhoni\n\"Since 2001, I became very close with Zaheer. He was my roommate when I played the 281 knock against Australia at Eden. I still remember him saying that it's an opportunity for me to do something special for the country before the start of the second innings. He is one of the closest friend I have got in my life,\" said the veteran.\n Cricket Team India Zaheer Khan VVS Laxman bowling coach BCCI Also Read Zaheer Khan: A performing artist with combative skills Zaheer Khan reveals why he retired from international cricket Indiaâ€™s World Cup hero Zaheer Khan announces retirement from international cricket", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Zaheer01_PTI.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Zaheer01_PTI.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/sports-cricket/article/zaheer-khan-will-prove-be-excellent-bowling-coach-vvs-laxman"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:22:15.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
