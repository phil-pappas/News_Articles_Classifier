It describes the press conference as not planned, not structured, not scripted and too long. It came across as a lecture. In opting for a lengthy argument rather than a soundbite Cage was unsuccessful in clearly articulat[ing] its distance from Emwazis actions to prevent any portrayal of them as apologists for terrorism, the it states. ~ The review was undertaken by Communica, an independent consultancy specialising in Muslim public opinion, which was provided with Cages confidential internal paperwork and allowed to interview key staff. Link. Sorry but saying \"Mohammed Emwazi\" had a beautiful mind and showing absolutely zero interest or sympathy for his innocent victims and instead trying to blame UK security for Emwazi ending up beheading westerners in the desert showed this group for what they really are. Any of the groups and individuals associated with CAGE should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves - certainly the \"charity\" licence CAGE operates under should be revoked. Worse still is that bodies like the National Union of Students has become associated with CAGE . So, the question is - what and where next for CAGE? Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:02:54.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
