It is hardly surprising that the majority of these refugees are determined not just to get into Europe but specifically into Germany or Sweden , the countries that offer the most benefits. Below is a description of what is happening in Germany.\nhttp://tapnewswire.com/2015/09/germany-chaos-descends/\nAnd the Obama administration wants to bring some 200,000 of these people into the US. Never mind that our intelligence services have already stated that we cannot adequately do background checks on all of them. Never mind that ISIS has already stated that they will infiltrate their terrorists into these so-called refugees. It just doesn’t matter to the Obamas and Merkels of the world.\nGod protect us from our leaders-both in Europe and the US.", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Fousesquawk/~4/qTSEl3luDIA", "http://tapnewswire.com/2015/09/germany-chaos-descends/"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:35:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
