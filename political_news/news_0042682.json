To encourage residents to get composting, Calderdale Council has teamed up with Getcomposting.com(external link) to offer home compost bins at special prices. Bins are available from only £17.98 (RRP £39. There's also a buy one get one half price offer, adding extra value for residents with larger gardens or for those who team up with a friend or neighbour to buy a bin. The warmer weather this summer with the odd torrential rain storm has encouraged gardens to flourish, creating an abundance of surplus garden waste. With autumn almost upon us, the time has come to prune, trim and prepare the garden for next year, but what should you do with all the debris? Instead of seeing it as waste, think of it as the important ingredient that with very little work can be recycled to give you a free supply of top quality compost. Simply throw it into a compost bin and over the winter months it will rot down to produce environmentally friendly compost that when added to the garden will suppress weeds and retain moisture in the drier months. Home composting has many benefits: It's easy to make and use Produces a free continual source of the very best compost Improves soil structure Maintains moisture Helps the soil PH balance Suppresses plant disease Reduces the need for polluting bonfires Reduces carbon emissions Helps to divert organic waste from landfill Reduces refuse collection costs Calderdale Council's Cabinet Member for Regeneration and Economic Development, Cllr Barry Collins, said: 'Home composting is an easy and effective way to not only help the environment, but also to produce some top quality compost to use in your garden. 'On average, around one third of all household rubbish and garden waste can be recycled at home in a compost bin, meaning it's a really efficient way of directing waste away from landfill and therefore reducing carbon emissions.' Getcomposting also have some very special offers on a range of other green goodies including special offer water butts with buy one get one half price and a selection of accessories.
