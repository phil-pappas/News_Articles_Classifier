Nirenberg believes putting municipal elections on the same ballot as federal and state elections will result in higher voter turnout. \n\"We know that in cities where they have unified elections, there's much better participation,\" Nirenberg said. \"Frankly, we should all be tired of the fact that really 1 out of 20 registered voters participates in municipal elections.\" \nVoter turnout was abysmal in the May election despite a handful of hotly contested races, including Ivy Taylor's run-off with Leticia Van de Putte. The marquee matchup and several ballot initiatives could not push turnout past 15 percent. \nNirenberg said moving the elections to November, when voter awareness is at its peak, would also save money. \n\"The more elections we have, the more personnel we have to put out there and fine tuning the equipment. When we have unified elections, it is more efficient on our election department,\" Nirenberg said. \nThe city of Austin recently moved its municipal elections to November, and Nirenberg said the results have been astounding. \n\"Their turnout went from 10 percent to 40 percent turnout,\" Nirenberg said. \nMoving the elections to November would require action from the state legislature and a change to the city's charter. Nirenberg said, were his efforts to succeed, the first unified elections in San Antonio wouldn't take place until 2018 at the earliest.
