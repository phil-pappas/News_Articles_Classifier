Obama also consulted with U.S. military commanders on the ground in Afghanistan as well as his entire national security team, officials added.\nAccording to the new White House plan, the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan would drop to 5,500 by early 2017, as Obama prepares to leave office. At that point, U.S. forces would be based in the Afghan capital of Kabul, as well as in military installations in Bagram, Jalalabad and Kandahar.\n\"Afghan forces are still not as strong as they need to be,\" Obama said in making the announcement.\nRetired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst and former intelligence officer, said Obama's decision is simply \"kicking this can down the road\" for the next president. Obama will be out of office by the time troops are set to be drawn down again.\n\"This is this administration pushing this off to the next administration because the next time they have to make this decision, it will be a different president in the White House,\" Francona said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:15:54.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
