John Kasich is returning to Michigan Monday for the fifth time this year, the most of any of the 16 Republican presidential hopefuls.\nKasich, the former U.S. House Budget Committee chairman, is scheduled for an early afternoon visit to the Lacks Enterprises Inc.’s factory in Grand Rapids that makes plastic plates.\nHe will then travel to New Hampshire, according to his campaign, where he is scheduled to attend a “No Labels Problem Solver Convention” in Manchester.\nKasich last visited Michigan on Sept. 19 for the two-day Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference on Mackinac Island, where he was one of five presidential candidates who addressed the gathering’s participants.\nThe Ohio governor finished third in The Detroit News/Michigan Information & Research Service straw poll of the conference’s nearly 2,200 party activists. He had 13.8 percent of the 785 voters, behind winner Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky with and second-place former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 15 percent.\nKasich met with Gov. Rick Snyder at Mackinac Island. Snyder, who hasn’t endorsed in the presidential race, has said he would favor backing a governor for the party’s nomination because a governor has run a large operation similar to the federal government.\ngheinlein@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:26:16.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
