(AP) - A review by a Raleigh newspaper shows that more than a dozen companies who receive state Medicaid funds have failed to properly pay employees. \nThe News & Observer of Raleigh reported that a review of cases involving private companies that receive funding through Medicaid showed that 17 companies were paid $72 million dollars since 2006. \nThose companies had a number of workers who were not paid for some of their work last year. \nThe newspaper reported that mental health agencies, home health care companies and group homes accounted for more unresolved wage payment cases than any other single industry in North Carolina. \nDave Richard with the Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Medicaid Assistance says he's evaluating whether his agency can do anything about the payment issue.  //www.wcnc.com/story/money/2015/10/12/report-many-companies-getting-state-funds-dont-pay-workers/73811736/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:42:12.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
