Israeli security forces run during clashes with Palestinians in Beit El, near the West Bank city of Ramallah on Oct. 9, 2015.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 13, 2015 | 6:40 a.m. EDT + More HERZLIYA, Israel – Israelis and Palestinians are accustomed to violence. They grow up with it. It is all around them. It is a regular part of life. And every time there is an attack, each person prays the finger of death will not land on them. Each person prays they and their families will be spared in the shootings, the stabbings, the car bombs.\nRami Elhanan describes the day that finger of death pointed squarely at him.\n\"At first, when you hear about the explosion, you keep hoping that maybe this time this finger will not turn towards you. Then, gradually, you find yourself running in the streets trying to find her. She completely vanished.\n\"You go from hospital to hospital, from police station to police station, many long and frustrating hours. Until eventually very, very later that night you find yourself in the morgue and this finger stares right between your eyes, and you see this sight which you will never ever be able to forget for the rest of your life.\"\nRELATED\nNetanyahu Blames Abbas for Increased Violence in Israel On Sept. 4, 1997, the 65-year-old Jerusalem native joined the thousands of others who have been so unlucky as to be singled out by the finger of death. This time, it was his turn to lose a loved one.\nHis daughter was killed in a suicide bombing on Ben Yehuda Street, a popular shopping area in the city. Three Palestinian attackers detonated bombs , killing 13-year-old Smadar Elhanan and four other Israelis, including two other little girls. Nearly 200 people were injured.\n''We cannot continue in this way,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the attack, which came five weeks after another suicide bombing that had killed 15.\nAlthough he spoke those words nearly 20 years ago, the sentence could just as easily have been uttered in the last week, as Israelis and Palestinians continue losing their lives to attacks. The death count of both Israelis and Palestinians continues to climb as fatal shootings and stabbings escalate in Jerusalem, the West Bank and Tel Aviv. The tit-for-tat attacks threaten to destroy the precarious status quo in Israel since the war between Hamas and Israeli Defense Forces last year.\nIn 1997, Netanyahu accused then-Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat of inciting terrorism. The Israeli prime minister made starkly similar accusations against current PA President Mahmoud Abbas last week in his speech at the United Nations and in public remarks condemning the recent violence. His words show that, unfortunately, the situation has indeed continued, just as it did after the bombing that killed Smadar.\nAmid the ongoing violence, Elhanan's story continues to be all too familiar for many in Israel. Thousands and thousands of lives have been lost over decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in one of the Middle East's most sustained and seemingly infuriatingly permanent wars between peoples, religions, ethnicities and cultures.\nYou wouldn't expect this Israeli Jew, who'd lost his daughter in a Palestinian suicide bombing, to call another Palestinian, who had spent seven years in jail for attacks against Israeli soldiers, his \"brother.\" You wouldn't expect him to call this Palestinian \"the closest person to me on earth.\"\nBut that's what Elhanan said of Bassam Aramin, an Arab who admits he spent his childhood trying to make Israeli soldiers \"crazy\" by raising the Palestinian flag on trees surrounding his school. Aramin described himself as \"a fighter, a warrior\" as a child, forming a group with friends to target Israeli soldiers.\nA Palestinian protester holds fire as he clashes with Israeli border police on Oct. 9, 2015 in Shuafat refugee camp in Jerusalem, Israel.\n\"In jail, I learn[ed] that if you know your enemy, you can defeat him or you can kill him. If you just hate him, you will kill yourself,\" Aramin said. \"So I said, 'I want to kill my enemy, not myself.' For that, I study Hebrew because my enemy speaks Hebrew.\"\nHe was released from jail in 1992, still believing armed struggle was the only way for Palestinians to liberate themselves. But years later, after further study of the Holocaust and after viewing the film \"Schindler's List,\" ​Aramin's opinion of the best tactic to achieve liberation began to evolve. He said the film's graphic images depicting the treatment of Jews showed him they were human beings just like himself. Some of the abuse reminded him all too hauntingly of what he endured while in prison.\n\"Our goal – we will never change it – it's to end the Israeli occupation and to free the Palestinian people, but I believe that we need to change our way to achieve this goal,\" he said. \"To kill Smadar is not a message of peace from the Palestinians.\"\nThe Palestinian originally met Elhanan in 2005 at the first meeting of what would become Combatants for Peace, a group of former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian combatants who had previously addressed their differences using arms but were now determined to work together to end the conflict by dialogue. Elhanan served in the Israeli Defense Forces, fighting in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which he says left him \"very angry and very bitter.\"\n\"You can imagine the first meeting between the real enemies. We hate each other. We did our best to kill each other physically form both sides,\" Aramin said of Combatants for Peace. \"Then we discovered that we are the same. We want to kill each other to achieve the same thing: peace and security.\"\nBut it's not membership in that organization and shared vision of peace for their homeland that makes the men brothers. Two years after they met, Aramin became Elhanan's brother in the most terrible way possible: Their connection was cemented by the shared experience of losing a daughter.\nRELATED\nNetanyahu Condemns Killing of Palestinian Child as 'Terrorism'\n\"On the 16 of January, 2007, an Israeli border police shoot and killed my 10-year-old daughter, Abir, in front of her school. She was with her sister and two other girls,\" Aramin said. \"From a distance of 15 to 20 meters, in her head, from the back.\"\nAccording to witnesses, Israeli police fired rubber bullets in response to a group of Palestinian boys throwing stones. They initially denied Abir was hit by stray fire, saying instead the blow to her head was from a stone. She died two days later in a hospital. No one was prosecuted for her killing, although the soldier who shot her was identified. The Israeli court determined too much time had passed – more than four years – to try those responsible in criminal court, but the family was awarded $430,000 in compensation.\nAramin said it would have been easy for him to take what he called the \"easy way\": revenge. But the father of six quickly learned that would do nothing to bring his young daughter back to life.\n\"I don't want revenge. I want justice,\" Aramin said. \"I want to prove we are not animals. I don't find the answer to kill a 10-year-[old] Israeli daughter. It doesn't work. As I said, you will invite the next victim. And if you create more pain, other pain to another family, … it's not going to ease your pain.\"\nElhanan said after his daughter was killed two weeks shy of her 14th birthday, he, too, knew he had to make a decision. He came to the same conclusion as his Palestinian brother.\n\"What are you going to do with this anger that eats you alive from within? There are only two options to choose from and the first one is obvious: When someone kills your 14-year-old little girl, you are so angry you want to get even. This is natural. This is human. This is the way more people choose, the way of revenge and retaliation, this endless cycle of violence which never stops.\n\"And then after awhile you start asking yourself questions,\" Elhanan said. \"You ask yourself, 'Will killing anyone bring her back? Will causing pain to someone will ease this unbearable pain?' Well, the answer is certainly not.\"\nRELATED\nIsraeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon: Peace With Palestinians Not Possible in My Lifetime Elhanan and Aramin are members of the Parents Circle-Families Forum, an organization of about 600 Israeli and Palestinian families who have lost loved ones to the conflict. They work to spread the message of peace and reconciliation and demonstrate the importance of dialogue with one another rather than violence against one another.\nElhanan said the message is simple:\n\"We are not doomed. This is not our destiny to keep on killing each other and dying in this holy land of ours. It's not written anywhere. We can change it. We can break once and for all the endless cycle of violence and revenge and retaliation.\nBut, he warns, \"This is a very long and bumpy road. There are no short cuts. But this is the only way possible, because the other way leads to nowhere and the price of the other way is really too heavy.\"\nBoth men's wives and other children are also active in promoting dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, although Aramin says his wife, Salwa, and his son were initially resistant to his efforts following Abir's death. Nurit Peled-Elhanan, whose father, Mattityahu Peled, was a famous Israeli general, peace activist and member of the Knesset, is a professor known for her research conducted on the negative way Palestinians are portrayed in Israeli textbooks.\n\"Whatever you believe, the Israelis and the Palestinians have no other place. We must live and exist on this land. To share it as one state, two states, five states.\" Aramin said. \"Otherwise, we will share the same land as two big graves of our kids and our families because the Israelis will never give up their existence and the Palestinians will never give up their freedom.\"\nWhen asked if the men believed they would see an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in their lifetime, Aramin responded with a smile.\n\"We are still young.\"\nTAGS: Palestine Israel Best Countries", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Israeli%20and%20Palestinian%20%27Brothers%27%20Push%20for%20Dialogue%20to%20Solve%20Conflict", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Israeli%20and%20Palestinian%20%27Brothers%27%20Push%20for%20Dialogue%20to%20Solve%20Conflict", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Israeli%20and%20Palestinian%20%27Brothers%27%20Push%20for%20Dialogue%20to%20Solve%20Conflict&summary=Two%20men%20work%20to%20use%20their%20tragic%20losses%20to%20prevent%20other%20Israeli%20and%20Palestinian%20families%20from%20enduring%20what%20they%20have.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/05/world/3-bombers-in-suicide-attack-kill-4-on-jerusalem-street-in-another-blow-to-peace.html?pagewanted=all", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzl83%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:54:44.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
