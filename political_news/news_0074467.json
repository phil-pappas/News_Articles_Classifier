Photo: Kate Gerghty\nIt was a compelling and principled position. In 2004, Bill Shorten's Australian Workers Union was locked in a turf war with a small rival union over coverage of aviation workers at Avalon in Victoria.\nBefore the Industrial Relations Commission, the AWU argued the rival engineers' union was hopelessly compromised because it had accepted a hefty \"consultancy\" fee from the employer.\nIn a statement an AWU organiser vowed the union would never allow itself to be so conflicted; to allow bosses to have such \"undue influence on the conduct of its affairs\".\nThe reality was very different. The young, entrepreneurial Bill Shorten was building a political brand and career on his preparedness and ability, Bob Hawke-like, to accommodate workers and bosses, and find consensus where there appeared to be none.\nAdvertisement Just how far Shorten and his union went with this entrepreneurial approach has been, in essence, the focus of the trade union royal commission's last two weeks ahead of its final December report.\nIts findings are set to be an important moment in federal politics in the lead up to the looming federal election against an ebullient Malcolm Turnbull.\nThrough two weeks of the sort of probing a $60 million royal commission can afford, AWU officials and employers faced a grilling on a slew of questionable deals ranging from the treatment of mushroom pickers to secret employer payments to Bill Shorten's first parliamentary campaign.\nBut it gave special prominence to the AWU's negotiations with Thiess John Holland over the $2.5 billion road project Eastlink in Melbourne's south east.\nAround the time the AWU was taking the high moral ground against the aircraft engineer's union, Bill Shorten and the AWU were deep in talks over Eastlink.\nOver the coming years, the builder would pay the AWU $300,000 in effective kickbacks as part of a secretive \"side deal\", allegedly based on sham invoices.\nQuestions around criminal fraud, conflicts of interest and who the deal really benefited swirl around the arrangement.\nSo too are there questions about Shorten's role and judgement.\nBut unlike much of the \"he said, she said\" testimony of the inquiry the evidence of veteran building executive Julian Rzesniowiecki was telling. He had detailed diary notes and emails of his dealings at Thiess John Holland with the AWU and Shorten.\nAs someone central to the negotiations he was disarmingly frank; so much so he was prepared to make admissions around sham invoicing, clearly against his own self interest.\nNearly three hours of cross-examination by Shorten's lawyer, Neil Clelland, QC, failed to rattle Rzesniowiecki or divert him from his view that the builder paid bogus invoices issued by the AWU as part of a pre-arranged deal to pay the union $100,000 a year, or $300,000 overall.\nWhile other witnesses had different recollections, most were either peripheral to the talks or had no written records or much to lose.\nThe AWU invoices were issued for a range of services including advertisements, research and training.\nYet Rzesniowiecki admitted they were designed to hide the real reason for the payments, to provide the AWU with resources to fund union organisers on the project.\nIn any event, Thiess John Holland wasn't concerned what it got for their $300,000 and what any organiser did on the project.\nThe AWU could spend the cash as they saw fit; it was small beer compared to the savings the builder had made from dealing with the AWU rather than the militant CFMEU.\nAccording to Rzesniowiecki's diary notes and evidence it was Shorten who proposed the \"side-deal' payment at a meeting in December 2004 when he appeared to ask the builder to cover the cost of four AWU staff â€“ worth more than $1 million over three years.\nThat supported separate evidence from another former senior executive, Stephen Sasse, who recalled Shorten first suggesting payments, although he was less clear on detail.\nThe \"side-deal\" discussions ran parallel with a workplace deal that cut industry conditions around working in hot weather, rostered days off and non-working delegates.\nWhile the workers were well paid on EastLink, on the estimate of the Institute of Public Affairs, the flexible workplace deal saved the builder as much as $100 million.\nShorten has denied any knowledge of the bogus invoices and has been at pains to say he had no role in an \"agreement\" over such a side deal.\nRather, his office has repeatedly drawn attention to the role of Melhem, a rusted-on Shorten ally who succeeded him as AWU secretary. One subheading in an email from his office was titled: \"Rzesniowiecki says the deal was done with Melham (sic).\"\nMelhem this week offered support for Shorten's position and denied knowledge of a deal but struggled when questioned about the payments and bogus invoices.\nIn any event, it is hard to believe that someone who dominated his union as Shorten did, had no idea of such important dealings, nor the large sums of money involved.\nIt was Shorten's evasiveness on this subject under questioning in July that led commissioner Dyson Heydon to question his credibility as a witness.\nOn the face of it appears unlikely that the commission would make serious legal findings against Shorten. That is less clear in the case of others involved on both sides of the Eastlink deal.\nBut the Labor leader would be advised to prepare for some likely adverse findings, both on Eastlink and other matters.\nThey include the sham arrangement whereby a labour hire company, Unibilt, paid the wages of a campaign manager for Shorten in his first bid for the seat of Maribyrnong at the 2007 election. For no good reason, the company recorded the payments as being for its own research officer.\nAnd for no excusable reason, Shorten failed to declare it to the Australian Electoral Commission until just before he gave evidence to the inquiry in July.\nThen there was the sorry case of AWU deals with cleaning firm Cleanevent. Shorten has previously faced claims that a deal struck by the AWU, while he ran it, allowed below-award payments and reduced conditions for low-paid cleaners. He denied it.\nThe Shorten-era Cleanevent deal attracted further controversy when it was rolled over by Melhem as part of an arrangement that saved Cleanevent about $2 million in wages, apparently in return for a $25,000 annual \"service fee\" to the AWU.\nIn an outbreak of honesty current AWU Victorian secretary Ben Davis has publicly conceded before the Royal Commission that his union had suffered from overly cosy deals with employers, noting employer payment of members' dues \"profoundly weakened\" the union.\nOther senior labour movement figures quietly agree, but are reluctant to do so publicly, especially given the looming federal election.\nA \"political witch-hunt\" it may be, but it is not surprising that a fortnight of evidence and headlines about sham invoices, secret backroom deals, and dudded workers, has seen a particularly agitated Opposition Leader's office.\nShorten's office sent out regular detailed background notes to journalists highlighting claimed inconsistencies in the evidence of witnesses with recollections unfavourable to the Labor leader.\nHe has assembled a formidable legal team, including Leon Zwier, the late Richard Pratt's lawyer, and Clelland, who cross-examined witnesses in an attempt to downplay evidence linking Shorten to questionable deals.\nThere is little doubt that Tony Abbott set up the royal commission as part of a political strategy to damage the labour movement and Shorten.\nThat perception was enhanced by the controversy around commissioner Dyson Heydon's accepting an invitation to a Liberal Party linked fundraiser.\nYet many of the dirty secrets of the labour movement have been highlighted by the inquiry, and even labour movement veterans believe some positives might yet come from necessary soul-searching.\nUnfortunately for Shorten a good deal of those revelations have been about the union, and period, where he made his name.\nWhile the commission has nailed CFMEU figures for blatant cash-in-paperbag style corruption, the political optics of the AWU's apparent double-dealing are politically no less damaging. They feed into the widely held public perception of Shorten as insincere.\nThe political fallout is not only relevant between now and the federal poll. Shorten's own people in the Victorian right have already conceded defeat is likely â€“ some say certain â€“ at the election. Whether he can survive as leader afterwards is now being widely canvassed.\nAs much as Labor loyalists protest the injustice of the inquiry, its revelations and findings about Shorten and the AWU will undoubtedly reverberate post election, including in the minds of the party members and caucus, all of whom will decide the next Labor leader.\nA decade ago, AWU organiser Peter Marczenko submitted to the workplace umpire a statement that the AWU would not do deals involving large payments to the union.\n\"The) AWU would never countenance a situation where there was a real, or perceived, abrogation of the union's responsibility to its members.\"\nBill Shorten made a political career out of a more flexible approach to industrial relations. It was his strength. It may yet be his undoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:35:54.569+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
