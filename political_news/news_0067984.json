How to Get Away With Murder is Scandal Redux; Quantico is 24 Redux; every new sitcom is, in its way, a remake of every other sitcom. It’s Turtle , basically, all the way down.\nRelated Story The TV Musical Is Dead\nSo it’s a wonderful and rare thing to be presented with a show—a network show!—that is truly original.

It treads a well-worn path, and not just in its tired repetition of “crazy” as a gendered epithet. (The show’s creators have insisted that “crazy” is a universal burn—that we’ve all, whether man or woman, girl or boy, had our minds addled by love.)", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/arts/television/the-great-american-musical-side-b-in-my-crazy-ex-girlfriend.html?_r=0", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(Entourage)"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:16:23.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
