It’s about local control.” \nShe also objects to those who say putting this on the ballot is a waste of time. \n“If we can’t petition our government, democracy will go down the toilet,” Beiersdorfer said. “Everything starts at the local level. If it passes, we don’t know what happens from there. If it doesn’t pass, I don’t know if we will seek a sixth time.” \nMayor John A. McNally, a member of the Mahoning Valley Coalition for Job Growth and Investment, which opposes the fracking-ban proposal, said, “The residents of the city are tired of hearing about this issue.” \nFracking isn’t happening in the city, but there are other businesses – such as other oil and gas drilling and those that transport fracking water – that would be hurt if this amendment is approved, McNally said. \nButch Taylor, business manager for the Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 396 union and a coalition member, said the ODNR has reacted quickly when there have been problems in the city, and there’s no reason for people to back a proposal rejected four other times. \n“If it passes, a company or business could file in court and it would be ruled unconstitutional, but it has the potential to drive away business from the city,” he said. \nThe Ohio Supreme Court wrote in a Feb. 17 decision regarding a similar matter in Munroe Falls that the state constitution’s home-rule amendment doesn’t grant local governments the power to regulate oil and gas in their limits. \nBecause of that decision, the Mahoning County Board of Elections rejected the anti-fracking proposal Aug. 26. But the city of Youngstown filed a complaint in state Supreme Court two days later stating the board of elections overstepped its authority. The court agreed with the city in a Sept. 17 ruling. \nWhether it can be enforced if the proposal is approved by voters will be decided by the courts, supporters and opponents say. \nThe proposal would ban not only fracking, but “related activities” such as “the depositing, disposal, storage and transportation of water or chemicals to be used in the extraction of oil and gas, the disposal or processing of waste products from the extraction of oil and gas,” according to the charter amendment.
