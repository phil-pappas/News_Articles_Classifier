About two years ago, a well-known Mexican band came in, said Caesar Chavez, whose parents own the shop. So maybe that's why, when a man in a dark suit walked in and told Chavez that Hillary Clinton would be along in just a minute or two, he didn't think the guy was putting him on.\n\"I actually did believe him,\" said Chavez, whose parents, Antonio Chavez Sr. and Genoveva Dominguez, own seven Flor de Michoacan shops in Las Vegas. \"They had to close the doors\" to limit public access.\nChavez said the shop serves about 40 flavors of ice cream and that Clinton, who was in town for the Democratic debate Tuesday night , tried pine-nut and Snickers before settling on lime, one scoop in a cone.\nClinton was accompanied on her foray by Nevada Assemblyman Nelson Araujo.\n\"The people that she was with told me that they recommended her to try out our ice cream,\" Chavez said.\nNobody asked for autographs, but Chavez estimates that Clinton posed for about 20 photos. He also FaceTimed his brother, Antonio Chavez Jr.\n\"He was pretty excited,\" Antonio Jr. said Thursday. \"She told him it was recommended to come try out the ice cream here because it's homemade. She was asking him what did he recommend.\"\nCaesar Chavez said Clinton left a favorable impression.\n\"She was really humble,\" he said.\nâ€” Contact Heidi Knapp Rinella at Hrinella@reviewjournal.com .
