The Andrus Award, named after AARP founder Ethel Percy Andrus , is AARP's most prestigious and visible volunteer award for community service.\nAs part of her selection as the Andrus Award recipient, McNamara, who volunteers for New Beginnings Food Outreach and Clothing, Inc., will receive $3,000 to donate to the charity of her choice. McNamara has decided to donate the money to New Beginnings to fund scholarships for high school students.\nThe award and $3,000 check were presented to McNamara today by AARP New York State President Leo Asen at a ceremony held at New Beginnings.\nAARP selected McNamara for her extraordinary service to the community through her work at New Beginnings, a non-profit which provides families and seniors in the rural upstate New York community of Madrid , with clothing, household items, and food through its thrift store and food pantry. McNamara also serves on the New Beginnings board, where she helps to oversee the donation of money made at the Thrift Store to community projects and residents in need.\n\"The founders and all the faithful volunteers of New Beginnings Clothing and Food Outreach, Inc., the organization that I serve, are deserving of this award and our mission will be blessed by the monetary gift that comes with it,\" said McNamara.\n\"I am proud to represent New Beginnings in my community, proud to serve with our faithful volunteers,\" continued McNamara. \"It is a blessing to receive donations of food and clothing from people in different stages of their lives – children grown, spouses passed, weight lost, retirement begun – to celebrate or mourn with them. It is an equal blessing to serve our neighbors in need – those with limited resources, victims of flood or fire, families who have come upon hard times – to share their journey with them.\"\nMcNamara is a long-time volunteer at New Beginnings, and initially got involved when she shopped there for her family. She eventually became a dedicated volunteer and was later asked to serve on the board of the organization to help raise money for a new building to house the thrift store and pantry. At the time, it was housed in an old barn that was small, poorly lit, drafty, and damp, which often resulted in mold growing on donated items. It was also not accessible to disabled persons and difficult for seniors to navigate.\nMcNamara helped with the fund-raising drive for the new building, leading to a new home for New Beginnings which is larger, safer and cleaner. The new facility better serves the community and it provides a more comfortable environment for the many volunteers who are instrumental to the organization.\nMcNamara was selected from a pool of nominees from across New York State based on the criteria of their ability to enhance the lives of AARP members and prospective members, improve the community in or for which the work was performed, and inspire others to volunteer.\n\"This award acts as a symbol to the public that we can all work together for positive social change, and Robin truly represents this,\" said Leo Asen , State President for AARP in New York. \"AARP has long valued the spirit of volunteerism and the important contributions volunteers make to their communities, neighbors, and the programs they serve.\"\nABOUT AARP\nAARP has 2.5 million members in New York State.
