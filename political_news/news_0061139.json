It is bad and that is why MP's are being warned that they should be careful of the promises they make during their campaigns. It is not our mandate, these days even assembly members are promising that they will build roads, it's fascinating', he lamented. \nMr Odro made these remarks when responding to questions from a section of the public concerning the core mandate of MP's at a Parliamentary constituency forum held in Cape Coast on Sunday. \nThe forum, an initiative by Parliament, which was on the theme 'Deepening citizens' engagement for better understanding of the Legislature,' was aimed at sensitizing citizens for them to understand and appreciate the work of the legislature. \nIt was also to create a structured engagement mechanism between citizens and parliament to enhance their ability to hold duty bearers accountable through increased interaction between them. \nThe legislature, the two-term MP noted, was gradually differing from its core mandate of making laws by embarking on developmental projects, which he insisted, was becoming too much and needed to be tackled before the situation worsens. \nHe indicated that the leadership of Parliament would soon come out with measures to check the situation and called on the media to collaborate with them to ensure that those MP's who engaged in the act were pinned to the wall. \nHe however admonished the general public to desist from demanding excessively from their MPs and other public office bearers as it had the potential of pushing them into acts of bribery and corruption. \nMr. Charles Obeng-Inkoom, MP for Agona West acknowledged that though it was not their mandate to embark on development projects, the increasing demands and expectations from the public often compelled them to use its common fund to undertake some development projects. \nJoe Ghartey, Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament explained that the decentralization system did not mandate MP's to undertake development projects, and that, all funds meant for development were channeled through the District Assemblies likewise the MP's common fund. \nHe therefore urged Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) not to sit on funds meant for development projects but use it for the intended purpose. \nParticipants were schooled on the duties and responsibilities of Parliamentarians, which included an oversight responsibility, approval of budget statement, checks and balances and making laws. \nQuestions on health, employment creation and other development issues, development plan, the debt toll of the nation, disbursement of MP's common fund and others were asked by the public. \nThe forum brought together MP's and aspirants from both the majority and the minority in the Central Region. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:32:07.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
