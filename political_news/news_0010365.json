She ultimately concludes that she's \"over\" finding adorable ways to state her opinion.\nLenny is a recently launched weekly newsletter from Lena Dunham and her \"Girls\" executive producer Jenni Konner.\n---\nOnline: http://www.lennyletter.com\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:18:57.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
