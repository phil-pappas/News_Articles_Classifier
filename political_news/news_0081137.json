Scott Walker's Manufacturing Day tour of a Mequon factory came at the end of a tough week for local manufacturing. More than 100 temporary layoffs were announced at Joy Global in West Milwaukee, and GE announced it was shutting down production at its iconic Waukesha Engine plant and moving 350 manufacturing jobs to Canada.The governor said his staff continues to have talks with GE. \n“Just what sorts of things can we do in general, not just for the Waukesha site, but to keep GE and GE-related employees in the state,” Walker said. \nGE said it's making the move because Congress did not renew the government's export-import bank, cutting off a financing source for the company. \n“We do not have the financing that we need. We're going to go where that financing is,” GE spokesman Shaun Wiggins said. \nDuring a visit to nearby Waukesha Metals, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she worries about additional job losses and said the government needs to step up to save manufacturing jobs. \n“I'm just calling on the House right now to reauthorize the export-import bank,” Baldwin said. \nBut Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan told WISN 12 News that's unlikely.He said the export-import bank shouldn't be renewed, and said he doesn't think it's a good reason for GE to move those jobs out of Wisconsin. \n“I'm astounded that that's the only circumstance that they would cite as to why we've made this decision. And I hope they would reverse the decision,” Ryan said. \nAll of those lawmakers said they're hoping GE will reconsider its move, which is something the company appears unwilling to do. \n“It's a done deal,” Wiggins said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:24:25.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
