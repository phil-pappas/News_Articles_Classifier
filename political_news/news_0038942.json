L.Ac\nUsing candles as therapy has been around for thousands of years, and has been practiced by nearly every religion. Candle therapy can be used to unite the powers of mind, body, and spirit. From ancient times to the present, Candles have lit our way through every transition! From celebrations and ceremonies to proclamations and processions! The candle’s flame has always been a metaphor for the soul! It possesses a tranquil and almost hypnotic atmosphere to those who allow its power to take them to a very special place.\nA candle acts as a “self-object”.\nIf you are looking for for a special candle, visit Gifts to Go by clicking the picture!\nA self-object is an object that is a reflection of our self, a reflection upon which we can act. The candle reflects the spiritual and ethical changes we would like to bring about in ourselves. It burns as a reminder and symbol of our desires. Sometimes we have to hand our dreams over to a force more powerful than we are.\nThe techniques of allowing candles to help in crystal work involve holding a selected crystal in your hand or hands or placing the stone on the floor or table near you and your mat and allow yourself to focus on the mineral as you meditate.\nIn a meditative or yoga group circle, you may place the candles and crystals in the center of the group. Make sure that the intention of the entire group is that of the same intent.\nCrystals can allow one to reach higher spiritual levels during meditation. The crystal magnifies one’s personal energy by aligning and connecting with universal power. The candle can center and align by concentrating on its flame.", "external_links": ["http://www.giftsreadytogo.com/collections/natural-candles", "http://www.giftsreadytogo.com/", "http://omtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Special-Gifts-001.jpg", "http://omtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gifts-ready-to-go-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:25:04.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
