It's why we need to crack down on those who are abusing our asylum system.\"\nMay's remarks came ahead of a meeting of EU interior ministers in Luxembourg.\nThe EU has rules in place for deporting those who do not qualify for asylum or residency but less than 40 percent of people are actually sent home.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
