Scott Walker's campaign that conservatives say went too far. \nA bill before the Assembly and Senate on Tuesday would end the ability of prosecutors to conduct John Doe investigations of politicians , the kind of probe that was conducted of Walker's campaign and conservative groups. \nSheboygan County District Attorney Joe DeCecco, a Democrat, said the changes would make it impossible to use John Doe investigations for political corruption and would make them useless for other types of crimes. \n\"It looks like they're trying to protect themselves,\" said DeCecco, who did not participate in the investigation of Walker's campaign. \"As a prosecutor, if this law passed, I would never do another John Doe again. There'd just be no point.\" \nGOP Attorney General Brad Schimel supports the measure. In his campaign for attorney general last year, he said he was \"experiencing a crisis in confidence\" of how John Doe investigations were handled because of the probe of Walker's campaign. \nRepublicans are poised to add a provision to the bill that would allow targets and witnesses from past John Doe investigations to speak publicly about them, while continuing to preclude prosecutors from talking in many cases. That would free up Walker and conservative activists to speak freely about an investigation they contend was a partisan witch hunt — a claim prosecutors deny. \nOn Wednesday, the Assembly is taking up two other bills — one that would rewrite campaign finance laws and one that would dissolve the state ethics and elections board and create two commissions to do that work. The Government Accountability Board consists of six former judges; the new commissions would be equally made up of Republicans and Democrats. \nThe bills on the accountability board and John Doe investigations were prompted by the probe into alleged illegal coordination between Walker and the Wisconsin Club for Growth and other conservative groups. The state Supreme Court in July ended the probe in a 4-2 ruling that found none of the alleged cooperation was illegal and making clear candidates and issue groups can work closely together. \nThe campaign finance bill also was partly inspired by that unsuccessful investigation, as well as a string of court rulings over the years. The measure would also double the amount donors can give to candidates. \nRep. Therese Berceau (D-Madison) said the bills being taken up by Republicans this week would have sweeping implications for the state's elections laws and the way they're enforced. \n\"They're going to get rid of our watchdog,\" Berceau said of the accountability board. \"They're going to change the law so that politics can't be investigated,...change the law so they can get unlimited (campaign) money. When is enough?\" \nAssembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) responded with a statement that said Democrats were mischaracterizing the GOP agenda. \n\"Democrats are stuck in hyperbole overdrive,\" his statement said. \"They're misleading the public and refusing to accept federal law set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on political speech. \n\"It's time to put aside the fear mongering and allow for the facts to prevail. This week's legislative calendar is about protecting free speech.\" \nWalker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick said the governor supports \"common-sense reforms that protect free speech and ensure transparency and accountability\" for John Doe investigations. He wants to replace the accountability board with a system that is \"fair, transparent, and accountable to Wisconsinites,\" Patrick said. \nJohn Doe investigations allow prosecutors to compel people to testify and turn over documents, and are also conducted in secret. Targets and witnesses often are ordered not to talk to anyone but their attorneys about the investigation. \nThe John Doe bill up for debate Tuesday was proposed by Sen. Tom Tiffany (R-Hazelhurst) and Rep. David Craig (R-Big Bend). It would end the ability of prosecutors to use these investigations for allegations of misconduct in office, such as bribing public officials, using elected office for personal gain and corruptly influencing legislation. \nFor crimes that could be investigated, secrecy requirements would be ended for targets and witnesses. Prosecutors could still be ordered to remain quiet about the probes, however. \n\"They can blab all they want about it and we can't say a damn word,\" said DeCecco, the Sheboygan County district attorney. \"The deck is stacked against us as far as the secrecy is concerned.\" \nThe bill would also end the ability of prosecutors to use the John Doe law to look into crimes such as identity theft, mortgage fraud, dealing small amounts of heroin and cocaine and theft reaching into the millions of dollars. They could continue to use the John Doe law for the most serious felonies, as well as lesser crimes of a violent nature. \nThe investigations could not last more than six months unless prosecutors got the approval of a majority of the 10 circuit judges who serve as chiefs of the state's judicial administrative districts. Those judges would also have to sign off on any expansion of the probe if prosecutors discovered crimes that were not part of their initial investigation. \nSecrecy orders could be placed on judges and prosecutors, but they could not be extended to witnesses and targets, as they are now. Backers of the bill say that was included to ensure people's free speech rights are protected, noting that U.S. Appeals Judge Frank Easterbrook last year said secrecy orders issued under the John Doe law appeared \" screamingly unconstitutional .\" \nAn amendment the Legislature is expected to adopt would extend the changes on secrecy orders to past John Doe investigations. Eric O'Keefe, a director of the Wisconsin Club for Growth, already has been speaking out on the probe of his group's work with Walker, and the change would allow him to continue to do so without risking court sanctions. \nIt would also mean the governor would be free to talk about the investigation — and could not say a court order prevented him from doing so, as he has sometimes noted in the past. \nMilwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm and special prosecutor Francis Schmitz, however, would remain unable to speak on the investigation, even though they have claimed O'Keefe has given out incomplete information. The prosecutors could presumably seek a judge's order that would allow them to speak publicly. \nChisholm is a Democrat and Schmitz is a Republican. They did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. \nJohn Doe investigations are overseen by judges, but the bill would prevent reserve judges from being in charge of them. Reserve judges are former judges who handle overflow work for courts. The probe of Walker's campaign — as well as an earlier one of his aides and associates that resulted in six convictions — were monitored by reserve judges. \nThe bill would allow special prosecutors like Schmitz to be used only in limited circumstances for John Doe probes. \nThe bill would also require prosecutors to make available the cost of conducting John Doe investigations. Republicans have been frustrated that they have not been able to ascertain how much Chisholm and Schmitz spent.
