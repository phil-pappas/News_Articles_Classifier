It represents an uncommon instance in which both parties rallied behind an effort to revamp part of the Affordable Care Act. \nUnder Obama's health care law, companies considered small businesses must offer certain required benefits. Business groups had complained that many employers' health care costs would increase. \nPreviously, small businesses were defined as those having up to 50 employees. But that number was set to expand to 100 on January 1. \nThe new law keeps the small business definition at 50 workers but allows states to increase the number if they choose.
