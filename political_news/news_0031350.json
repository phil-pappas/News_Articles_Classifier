Under the new plan, troops would be drawn down to 5,500 starting sometime in 2017.\nRepublicans hold a majority of seats in both the Senate and the House, and many strongly opposed Obama's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq. They largely blame that decision for the rise of Islamic State militants who now control swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and are appearing in Afghanistan.\n\"We shouldn't focus on the troop levels, we should focus on what military conditions dictate and listen to the advice of generals on the ground,\" Republican Senator Tom Cotton said.\nCongress must authorize and fund Department of Defense programs. Republicans and Democrats are currently battling over this year's $612 billion defense authorization bill, which Obama has threatened to veto.\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:51:31.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
