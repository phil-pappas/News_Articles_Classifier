Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Sanders speaks during the debate. CNN's Mark Preston said Sanders' opening remarks \"hit on all of the hot-button liberal issues: Take back the government from billionaires, climate change. He all but said it is time for a revolution.\" Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Clinton is the national front-runner in the Democratic race. \"I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name,\" she said during the debate. \"I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what Americans are looking for ... and I can take the fight to Republicans.\" Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: The first Democratic debate Webb listens to moderator Anderson Cooper during the debate.
