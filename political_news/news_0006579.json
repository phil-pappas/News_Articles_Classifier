(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nRepublican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson are threatening to boycott the next GOP debate over its proposed format. \nThe two political outsiders wrote in a joint letter to CNBC on Thursday that they will not appear at the Oct. 28 debate unless its length is capped at two hours, including commercials. \nThey also insist that the debate include opening and closing statements from all the candidates. \nThe last GOP debate, aired on CNN, stretched on for a marathon three hours, earning complaints. \nCNBC says in a statement that it's aiming to host \"the most substantive debate possible\" and will be taking the candidates' views into account. \nTrump and Carson have developed a unique rapport, with little fighting between the two.
