Show Caption Previous Next \nLA JOLLA, Calif. - Stephanie and Brian knew President Obama was in San Diego playing golf on Sunday, but they didn’t think it was at Torrey Pines Golf Course where they were getting married. \n\"We’re like, 'Nah, he’s not going to end up here then because his course is in Rancho Santa Fe,'\" Brian said. \nThe couple asked us not to use their last name. \n\"Then we saw the two SUVs that were the Secret Service SUVs, so then we knew he was on the course,\" Brian said. \nThey were just going to delay the wedding, but… \n\"He actually took his last putt and came over to the wedding crowd,\" Stephanie said. \nStephanie, Brian and their family and wedding party watched from the second-story window. \n“Once we saw him coming up I just, I plastered myself against the window, because we had been forced inside, they weren’t allowing us out on the balcony, and I was just hoping that they’d notice my wedding dress,” Stephanie said. \n“But then when it was so clear that he was going to be shaking people’s hands, that’s when Stephanie made the decision,” Brian said. \n“And it would just be the last chance. I was like, 'You know what… You don’t get this chance very often so why not just go for it,'\" Stephanie said. \nShe did, dashing towards the President. \n“All-out sprint in heels and wedding dress,” Brian said. \nBrian was running right behind her. \nThe crowd turned away from the President, to focus to the bride and groom. \n“I actually started crying, I was crying as I’m running up there, you are just overwhelmed with emotion,” Stephanie said. \n“Everyone was cheering for us as Stephanie was running,” Brian said. \n“It’s just such a pump up,” Stephanie said. \n“We literally ran down an aisle of friends to the president,” Brian said. \nTheir wedding photographers, Jeff and Erin Youngren , captured the once-in-a-lifetime moments with a very welcome wedding crasher. \n“He said congrats and good luck,” Stephanie said. \n“And he saw my foot on the train of the wedding dress and he says oops ‘can’t put your foot on the wedding dress there.’ Little piece of advice, pretty funny,” Brian said. \nPresident Obama did not stay for the wedding. \n“To see a sitting president, I was just crying going up there. It was awesome,” Stephanie said. Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
