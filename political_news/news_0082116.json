According to 9to5Mac , Apple plans on unveiling a brand-new 21.5-inch iMac next week, complete with a 4K display.\nThe new iMac won't differ much aesthetically from the current-gen models — the overall iMac design language hasn't changed much since 2012 — so the late-2015 model's differentiating factors will most likely be its screen and faster graphics card. The new all-in-one will also almost certainly ship with El Capitan and be a little pricier than its non-4K brethren. Expect it to launch on the 13th.", "external_links": ["http://9to5mac.com/2015/10/06/apple-planning-to-launch-new-4k-21-5-inch-imacs-next-week/"], "published": "2015-10-06T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:46:57.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
