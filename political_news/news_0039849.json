Auckland house prices have risen three times faster than household incomes over the same period. \n\"The data supports what other surveys have confirmed in recent days: contrary to anecdotal reports of the market slowing, the volume of sales and prices went to a new high in the last month. \n\"While the Waikato and Bay of Plenty have seen house prices rise, prices in the rest of the country are plateauing and even declining in four out of ten regions. \n\"National spent years denying there was a housing crisis in Auckland. Then when they couldn’t ignore the facts any longer, they took grudging half-measures. \n\"It is time the Government admitted defeat and embarked on a massive state-backed building programme to flood the market with affordable houses and crackdown on speculators by banning non-resident foreign buyers from purchasing existing homes,\" Phil Twyford says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:36:39.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
