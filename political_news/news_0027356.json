Scott Applewhite) Comments \nWASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's abrupt decision to withdraw Thursday from the race for speaker stunned members of the Republican conference who expected him to win majority support. \nU.S. Rep. John Katko, R-Camillus, said McCarthy's announcement in a private meeting of House Republicans was as unexpected as House Speaker John Boehner's decision last month to step down at the end of October. \n\"It was almost like Groundhog's Day,\" Katko said in an interview after the GOP meeting at the Capitol. \"With Boehner, it went from sublime to surreal in a flash of a second. And the same thing happened today.\" \nA group of Tea Party conservatives who had opposed McCarthy's candidacy immediately took credit for his decision Thursday. \n\"Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the Speaker race because of the House Freedom Caucus and grassroots pressure,\" said Adam Brandon, CEO of FreedomWorks , a Tea Party group. \n\"Activists across the country sent over 11,000 messages asking their congressmen not to support Boehner 2.0,\" Brandon said. \"This is a huge win for conservatives who want to see real change in Washington, not the same 'go along get along' ways of Washington.\" \nThe House Freedom Caucus, an influential group of hard-line conservatives, had announced Wednesday that its members would support Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., for the speaker's post. Katko said it was ironic that the House Freedom Caucus, as a result of its pressure on McCarthy, ended up prolonging how long Boehner will stay on the job as speaker. \"So they succeeded at nothing,\" Katko said. \nBoehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement after McCarthy's announcement that he will remain as speaker until a new one is elected. \nKatko declined to say whether he would have supported McCarthy for the speaker's job, or who he will back now that McCarthy has withdrawn. \n\"This is all inside baseball in Washington,\" Katko said. \"We still have a leader. I want to worry about governing and let this sort itself out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:43:30.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
