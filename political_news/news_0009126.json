Photo: Andrew Meares\nThe committee found the transparency law had the potential to \"result in the publication of taxation information of privately owned companies that could be misused, misinterpreted or mislead due to poor understanding of the relationship between gross accounting turnover and net taxable income\".\nAdvertisement It also cited the \"long-standing tenet of Australia's tax laws\" that taxpayers' affairs remain private between the taxpayer and the Australian Tax Office and that disclosure could \"place a company at a competitive disadvantage\".\nIn a fiery dissenting report, ALP and Greens senators on the committee said the arguments used to justify shielding businesses are \"absurd, illogical, and often lacking any evidence\".\nJames Packer, pictured with former Liberal leader Tony Abbott in 2012.

There were just a handful of submissions to this inquiry, and other than tax consultants and tax lawyers servicing large private companies, the only corporation to make a contribution was Teys Australia, a privately owned meat processing joint venture with the American company Cargill, based in Brisbane,\" the dissenting senators said.\nWhen the bill was first announced, the reason cited was that wealthy owners could be targeted for kidnappings and extortion attempts if their tax affairs were made public.\nFairfax Media revealed in June that the Abbott government had not requested or received any advice from security agencies, including the Australian Federal Police, to verify any threat before agreeing to repeal disclosure laws that were due to begin this year.\nLindsay Fox.

He said he did not believe there was any greater threat to individuals because most are already on the BRW Rich List and flaunt their wealth with \"waterfront properties, big boats, and big planes\".\nThe committee only made one reference to any security threat in its findings: \"These companies are typically owned by families and, without the proposed exemption, the privacy of these families and in some cases their personal security may be jeopardised,\" it said.\nThe Australian Tax Office will begin publishing the tax paid by large private companies from mid-December unless the Coalition can convince the crossbench to support its 'Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws' amendment.\nDick Smith: Laws would be \"ratting on typical Australians who pay their tax\".

They include James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting, Lindsay Fox's Linfox and the scandal-plagued 7-Eleven convenience store empire of Russ Withers.\nThe committee report cited the bill's explanatory memorandum which says it will \"promote human rights through the prohibition on interference with privacy contained in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\".\nDrafted in 1966, the covenant was drafted to prevent governments arbitrarily or unlawfully invading the privacy of people's homes and bedrooms.\nArticle 17 was used in 1994 by Nicholas Toonen to challenge the Tasmanian government's laws that made it illegal for consenting same-sex couples to have sex in private. The case led to the repeal of the last sodomy law in Australia.\nIn the dissenting report, Labor said: \"Invoking this instrument is an obnoxious attempt to misguide the public, press, and the Parliament. It has no connection to tax privacy, and the claim deserves both derision and ridicule.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/malcolm-turnbulls-taxhaven-investments-6928480.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:29:41.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
