A strong showing before skeptical Republicans could be the final piece of her fall recovery and launch her onward to the Iowa caucuses - now just over 100 days away.\nPolitical skills and a few lucky breaks have fueled Clinton's turnaround. Following a well-received performance last week in the first Democratic primary debate, her poll numbers are rebounding. She ended the third quarter with more money in the bank than any candidate for the White House. And her biggest potential rival for her party's nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, has decided to sit the race out.\nMeanwhile, the House committee charged with investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on an American diplomatic mission in Libya has been so marred by political missteps that its chairman begged his colleagues in a weekend interview to \"shut up talking about things you don't know anything about.\" The committee's shift from probing the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi to Clinton's use of a private email account and server has raised more questions about the politics at play.\nThe latest boost for Clinton came as the daily \"will-he-or-won't-he\" speculation about Biden had started to overshadow the 2016 Democratic race. In sending along warm words for the vice president after his announcement, Clinton also positioned herself as the natural heir to President Barack Obama's coalition of young, minority and female voters.\n\"Joe has been by President Obama's side for every pivotal decision,\" she said. \"It's a record to be proud of, defend, and build on.\"\nBiden's decision not to challenge Clinton followed a spate of post-debate polls that showed the party seemingly ready to unite around her. And it's not just Democrats who view Clinton as a possible winner. Three-quarters of Americans think she could win in the general election, including two-thirds of Republicans, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll out this week.\nFor Republicans, as they prepared for Thursday's Benghazi hearing, there was little to cheer in a poll that found many Americans are indifferent to Clinton's handling of the issue.\nFour out of 10 Americans said they do not have a strong opinion of the way Clinton has answered questions about her role in the attacks, according to the AP-GfK poll. And after 17 months of congressional investigation in the attacks, 20 percent approve of Clinton's response while 37 percent disapprove.\nWhile Republicans care deeply, with 71 percent disapproving, nearly half of Democrats and a majority of independents said they don't have any particular view on Clinton's conduct toward the committee.\nClinton's team believes she can use the hearing to present herself as a seasoned diplomat trying to rise above the partisan fray. She left the State Department in February 2013 as the most popular politician in the country and to accolades from some of the Republicans now running against her - an image that her team wants to resurrect.\nShe's spent days with no public events on her schedule, giving her plenty of time to prepare for what her aides expect will be eight hours of questioning.\nHer supporters, meanwhile, see the appearance as a chance to lob some early general election attacks at the GOP, casting Republicans as wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on an effort they've dubbed the \"committee to destroy Hillary Clinton.\"\n\"It's Exhibit A of the overreach of the Republicans and their desperation to knock her off at any costs,\" said former Michigan Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm. \"It has been made clear now that this committee is a taxpayer-funded political witch hunt.\"\nThe super PAC supporting Clinton's bid aired its first television ad in the days before the hearing, charging Republicans with \"playing politics with Benghazi.\" And at Correct the Record, an outside group that coordinates with her campaign, a 30-person war room stands ready to defend Clinton during the hearing.\nClinton has been helped along the way by a bit of good luck. Aides at her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, were gleeful after California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy, then in line to become the next House speaker, implied that the work of the taxpayer-funded Benghazi committee was responsible for the summertime drop in Clinton's poll numbers.\nNow, McCarthy is no longer in the running for the job and the party is more focused on its own leadership struggles than Clinton's homebrew server.\nYet no matter how well Clinton does on Thursday, the issue won't disappear.\nWith a court ordering monthly releases of her correspondence, Republicans will have plenty of opportunities to remind voters of lingering questions about her email set-up. They're sure to also point at ongoing unrest in the Middle East and try to link it to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state.\nBut for Clinton, much of the risk from such attacks will come in a general election. After months of uncertainty, she's appears to have finally caught the political headwind she'll need to get there.\n___\nAssociated Press News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Lisa Lerer and Ken Thomas on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer and http://twitter.com/kthomasdc\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/kthomasdc", "http://twitter.com/llerer"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:37:03.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
