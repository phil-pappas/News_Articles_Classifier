It's Wednesday, Oct. 14, and this is what we're watching: Next question for Democrats is whether they still pine for Biden Gun control measures winner during debate Audience for first Democratic debate better than expected The first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential campaign season is over — here's the takeaway Hillary Rodham Clinton will host a campaign rally in Las Vegas 9:01 A.M. Joseph Tanfani An emerging Democratic consensus on guns \nThere were some contrasts over gun control during Tuesday night's debate, as Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to ding Bernie Sanders over his past Senate votes against some high-profile measures like the Brady bill. But the exchange also revealed that candidates are now wary of bucking what they think is a desire for tighter gun control among the Democratic faithful. \nIn past elections, Democrats with national ambitions tiptoed gingerly around the gun issue. In 2008, for example, Clinton spoke out for some gun restrictions, but also felt compelled to reminisce fondly about her girlhood days learning how to shoot at a lake near Scranton, Pa. \nLast night, even Sanders opened his answer by pointing out his D-minus rating from the National Rifle Assn. -- not usually a winning tactic for wooing gun owners. Martin O'Malley emphasized that Maryland passed gun laws while he was governor, talking about how guns have devastated his city of Baltimore, and mentioned by name a couple whose daughter was killed in the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting. \n\"You want to talk about a rigged game, Senator?\" O'Malley said to Sanders, riffing on Sanders' positions on crony capitalism. \"A man had sold 4,000 rounds of military ammunition to this -- this person that killed their daughter, riddled her body with five bullets, and he didn't even ask where it was going.\" \nJim Webb was an exception, taking pains to nod to the \"tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.\" \nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, the leading candidates are just as orthodox in their antipathy to new gun laws. The matter didn't even come up during two Republican debates. Ben Carson has suggested that the Holocaust might have gone differently if Jews had been armed. \nThe same divide shows up in public opinion polls , though there has been consistently strong support for measures like expanding background checks for gun buyers. \nTo capture the White House, the eventual Democratic nominee will almost certainly have to win states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, with lots of rural territory and deep hunting traditions. But as columnist Doyle McManus has pointed out , the new talking points on guns may be a sign that Democrats no longer think they need to worry too much about those voters. Debate ratings set record -- for Democrats \nWho says a white-haired Democratic Socialist and a Clinton can't draw a crowd? The ratings from the first Democratic debate showed a better-than-expected audience, with more than 11% of households tuning in, according to the first overnight numbers from CNN. \nThe debate outperformed Clinton's 2008 matchup with President Obama, and #DemDebate traffic dominated Twitter throughout the evening. But the inaugural debate, without the star power of reality television star Donald Trump, pulled in far fewer voters than the two Republican debates¿ which qualify as the top-rated shows of the new fall season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:46:53.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
