People were livid and the bloodbath that ensued at the General Election was completely predicted. \n“But this is on another level. People are furious and while you’d think fury would be reserved for Labour, that’s not the case. \n“It’s Kenny people are gunning for.” Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie An Tanaiste Joan Burton TD and An Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD \nOne of the main causes of anger is that voters feel the Taoiseach is being protected by Fine Gael chiefs, who are shielding him from the public who elected him. \nThe activist added: “The sense we’re getting is that people feel the Taoiseach is being wrapped in cotton wool and kept out of harm’s way when really they want answers. \n“For years it’s been Labour who’ve borne the brunt of voter anger and been accused of betraying those who put them in power. \n“But it seems now they can’t be bothered wasting their anger on Labour as they know the party is on the way to oblivion so now it’s Kenny and Fine Gael they’re baying for. \n“The dramatic shift to the left in the local elections last year was the public’s chance to get their own back after six years austerity and they’re waiting to unleash payback again.
