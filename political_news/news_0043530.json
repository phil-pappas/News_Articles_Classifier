State television showed what appeared to be a successful launch of the new missile, named Emad, which will be Iran's first precision-guided weapon with the range to strike its regional arch-enemy Israel. The U.N. Security Council prohibits foreign powers from assisting Iran in developing its ballistic missile programme in any way, a ban that will remain in place under the terms of the July 14 nuclear deal that will see other sanctions lifted. The United Nations also prohibits Iran from undertaking any activity related to ballistic missiles that could deliver a nuclear warhead, which applies to the Emad, but Iranian officials have pledged to ignore the ban. \"We don't ask permission from anyone to strengthen our defence and missile capabilities,\" Dehghan said. A fundamental flaw in Obama's approach to negotiations with Iran was to ignore Irans ballistic missile program as part of the total \"Iranian nuclear-weapon problem\".
