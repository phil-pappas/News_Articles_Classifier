He killed, raped and plundered his way through the New World but his story has given rise to pervasive myths, like that he proved the Earth is round. \nRegardless, people are out today in abundance to celebrate Columbus Day and a hashtag #ColumbusWasAHero is trending. Sorry haters, Christopher Columbus is in heaven with God. Unlike your heathen cannibal Aztecs. #ColumbusWasAHero pic.twitter.com/c5xRUWFxfB — Shaun Wesley (@ShaunWesleyWyrd) October 12, 2015 #ColumbusWasAHero White demoralization precedes White dispossession. Today #WhitePeople reclaim our glorious hero! https://t.co/p9PwRO32k2 — Mary Whittier (@WhittierPal) October 12, 2015 \nThe commentary that accompanies the hashtag is mostly self-righteous and affronted -- people are upset that Columbus' great contribution to America, namely that he brought a bunch of Europeans to the American continent, is being overlooked. \nOther Tweeters compare the current immigration discussion around Columbus Day. #ColumbusWasAHero Oh so now, when it comes to the Indians, the Left is in favor of borders and nations, and against immigration. — Critical Dissent (@officialCritDis) October 12, 2015 \nA handful of cities, including Seattle and Minneapolis, have already ousted the holiday , which was established in 1968, in favor of \"Indigenous Peoples Day,\" and more cities are following suit. \nColumbus' legacy is on its way out and a half-hearted hashtag -- which is mostly populated by white supremacists with a tenuous grasp on history -- is the best indicator of it.
