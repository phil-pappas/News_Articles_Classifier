His closest contender trailed behind with less than 5 percent.\nLukashenko's vote share was an increase from 79.7 percent vote share in 2010.\nAbout 100 opposition supporters held a peaceful protest march after polls closed to show their discontent.\nYermoshina said all the ballots have been counted inside the country while the ballots cast at embassies abroad have yet to be counted.\nThe authoritarian leader of 21 years faced no serious competition in the election, which was boycotted by the opposition.\nOpposition activists cast doubt on the high turnout, over 87 percent, as reported by authorities.\n\"The election commissions made up the results as they wished,\" opposition leader Anatoly Lebedko claimed. \"I'm amazed by the scale: they made up a staggering turnout with half-empty polling stations.\"\nYermoshina of the election commission explained the high turnout by the fact that a lot of people opted out for early voting.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:13:29.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
