A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling established that a similar no-protest zone in Massachusetts was in violation of free speech rights. \nThe Portland City Council repealed the ordinance in question soon after, but a judge determined that protesters could still seek damages for when the buffer zone was in effect. \n___ \nInformation from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:00:53.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
