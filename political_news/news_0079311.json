Carson has been frequenting Suitsupply , the Amsterdam-based men’s clothier known for being pretty much the anti-Brooks Brothers, with slim-cut suits, bold patterns, fashion-forward color combos and accessories. A whisper campaign has turned Washington’s notable menswear aficionados onto the brand, drawing more and more into Suitsupply’s only local store, adjacent to the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown. “The suit Dr. Carson wore at the second GOP debate was a gray pinstripe; the details made him stand out from everyone else,” says Nish de Gruiter , Suitsupply’s vice president, on the phone from New York. “When you looked at Donald Trump — with the dark suit, the bright red tie — the suit was wearing him, not the other way around.”\nDe Gruiter said that Trump was probably fitted by “an older gentleman,” while Suitsupply’s younger, hipper staff is more adept at cutting a more modern silhouette. Carson purchased a $399 Napoli striped suit for the first GOP debate in August in Ohio; the bold gray look at the Simi Valley debate was the Sienna Gray Stripe, which set Carson back $779.\nOther fans of the brand include \"Project Runway’s\" Tim Gunn , the Rev. Al Sharpton and CNN’s Jake Tapper , who was wearing Suitsupply when he moderated the debate.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/home"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:26:33.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
