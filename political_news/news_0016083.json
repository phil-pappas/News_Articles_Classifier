In full, she said: \n\"Labour initially planned to vote for George Osborne's austerity charter. It was only SNP pressure that changed their minds. \"Or, at least, it changed some of their minds. In the vote last night, Labour divisions were laid bare. \"And it became crystal clear, yet again, that the only party with the unity and the conviction to stand strong against austerity is the SNP. \"You know, there is much that I hoped the SNP and Jeremy Corbyn could work together on. \"But over these last few weeks, it has become glaringly obvious that he is unable to unite his party on any of the big issues of our day. \"When he says he opposes Trident, he is attacked, not just by the Tories, but by his own shadow cabinet. \"When he says he opposes the welfare cap, he is opposed, not just by Iain Duncan Smith, but by his own Shadow Justice Secretary.\" \nShe added: \"Whether on the economy, or Trident, or even the question of whether UK forces should take part in air strikes on Syria, Labour is a party divided and in disarray. \"In fact, the only thing clear about Labour - and it becomes clearer by the day - is this. Labour is unreliable, unelectable and unable to stand up to the Tories.\" \nOn a second independence referendum: \"To propose another referendum in the next parliament without strong evidence that a significant number of those who voted 'No' have changed their minds would be wrong and we won't do it.\" \nHer remarks on the referendum are designed to draw a line under any speculation over when another vote may take place to take the pressure off SNP MPs and MSPs likely to be pressed on the issue during the three-day event. \nMs Sturgeon is attempting balance the views of impassioned pro-independence campaigners - many who joined the party in droves after the failed vote last year - with the political reality of knowing that it must win if another referendum is secured. \nThe party is looking to secure its third term at the helm of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh at next year's elections, and a time-table of when a referendum could be called is expected to be included in the manifesto. \nShe told the audience the \"principles\" behind the manifesto will be \"respect and democracy\". \n\"I believe with all my heart that Scotland should be an independent country. But I respect the decision that our country made last year,\" she said. \n\"So let me be clear. To propose another referendum in the next parliament without strong evidence that a significant number of those who voted 'No' have changed their minds would be wrong and we won't do it. \n\"It would not be respecting the decision that people made.\" \nHe acknowledged to delegates that there is still a job to \"inspire people who voted 'No' last year to vote SNP\". \nShe said: “For those who want Scotland to be independent, there is only one vote next year that makes sense – and that is a vote for the SNP. \n“But I don't just want to win the votes of independence supporters. I want to inspire people who voted No last year to vote SNP too.\" Most Popular Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:22:45.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
