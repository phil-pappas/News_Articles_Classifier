The good outcomes for other agricultural exports will help to demonstrate that free trade should not be feared, and by doing so create a platform for further opening of dairy markets. \n“Removal of distortions from global dairy markets remains a key priority for DCANZ” says Bailey. “We will be looking closely at the trade policy landscape over the coming weeks, and talking to the government, to define a pathway forward.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:54:20.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
