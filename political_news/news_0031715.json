But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton will testify ahead of the House Select Committee on Benghazi in one of the most-anticipated hearings of the year—but maybe not for the reasons originally predicted.\nThe hearing was never supposed to be easy for Clinton, whose campaign has been hampered by inquiries into her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. But the threat the committee once posed to her political fortunes has dissipated, as it has instead become a political challenge for House Republicans, as they try to prove that the focus of the committee is on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya and not a political ploy.\nThe committee’s chair, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, has been fending off a deluge of criticisms since House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested that it was reason for Clinton’s drop in the polls.\nLatest from Politics Slavery Did Not Die Honestly\n“Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee.” McCarthy said on Fox News. “What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s un-trustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought and made that happen.” McCarthy’s spokesman Matt Sparks later issued a statement saying that the committee has “nothing to do with politics.”\nThe disarray among members of the House was striking, but Clinton suspected from the start that a public hearing would likely work in her favor. Gowdy had offered Clinton to come in for a private interview. But Clinton’s extensive experience testifying before committees is reason enough to take what’s expected to be a heated hearing public. My colleague Russell Berman smartly explained the move earlier this year:\nAnd it reflects a confidence that despite Gowdy’s beset efforts to keep the hearing on track, it will devolve into a circus in which GOP lawmakers will compete to offer the most damaging interrogation. Clinton would then come off as sympathetic rather than secretive.\nClinton is preparing to field a flurry of questions from committee members. According to Politico , Clinton is poised to approach her testimony “solemn and serious in manner” and her camp is setting up talking points that call out the Benghazi committee as a “partisan charade.”", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/benghazi-hillary-clinton-hearings-214941", "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/mccarthy-links-benghazi-panel-clintons-sinking-poll-numbers-n436151"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:31:49.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
