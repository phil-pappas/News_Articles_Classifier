But as he seeks a final term in the Division A post, the Harvey Republican is embroiled in a bitter battle for votes across the courtroom, the airwaves and social media.\nJust 38 years old, Roberts has been a player in Jefferson Parish politics for more than 15 years. He said he is being targeted by opponents now because he pushed for changes at the troubled Jefferson Parish Housing Authority, where financial improprieties were uncovered by federal investigators in a 2012 audit.\nBut his challengers, former council members Louis Congemi and Jimmy Lawson, say Roberts is divisive and parochial. They say that has hindered Jefferson's progress.\nEarly voting continues through Saturday (Oct. 17). The primary is Oct. 24.\nHere is a look at the candidates:\nLouis Congemi\nIn one of the nastiest council campaigns in recent memory, Congemi and Roberts return to 24th Judicial District Court Monday for a trial over political advertising . Judge Scott Schlegel will decide whether Congemi must pull spots that accuse Roberts of being a \"tax cheat'' for unpaid taxes.\nRoberts filed his tax returns in September after a winning an appeal with the Internal Revenue Service. He has hefty refunds on deposit.\nCongemi makes no apologies for the ads. \"I have never been involved in a campaign like this before,'' he said, adding that Roberts has many issues. \"The only way to get that message out is by advertising. The public has to know.''\nResidents are upset with Roberts and want change, Congemi said. From his handling of Jefferson's public hospitals to his support of extending tolls on the Crescent City Connection , Roberts has hurt the people he is supposed to represent, Congemi said.\nLouis Congemi Rick Olivier Congemi said Roberts attacked Hospital Corp. of America when it was offering to lease East Jefferson General Hospital and West Jefferson Medical Center for $450 million.\nRoberts disclosed HCA's that initial proposal included a lease-purchase option, which by law would require a public referendum. He also called attention to the company's financial settlements with the federal government to resolve cases of fraud.\nCongemi contends that Jefferson lost out when HCA withdrew from the lease process. The money could have provided transportation, walking tracks, exercise parks and other health programs to aid senior citizens, Congemi said.\n\"In Chris's case, it's his way or no way. You can't call business people criminals or call them corrupt when you are dealing with a hospital,'' he said. \"They are offering $450 million for a hospital. We have to find another company that will lease it or the hospital will continue to lose $4 million to $7 million a year.''\nThough Roberts was elected parishwide, he behaves like a district councilman, Congemi said. He said Jefferson has spent $80 million more in West Jefferson than in East Jefferson. Instead of determining the best way to distribute $53 million from the BP settlement from a parishwide perspective, Congemi expects the council debate will result in another contentious push to direct money toward West Jefferson.\n\"The West Bank needs more money, but you've got to find a way to balance that. East Jefferson needs money as well. You need to work with the other council members,'' Congemi said. \"Lafitte and Grand Isle will get a lot of money. They will get millions with coastal restoration. You have to start looking at the parish overall not from a district point of view.''\nCongemi pledged to be accessible to residents on both sides of the Mississippi River and to have a presence in the community.\n\"Find something that Chris Roberts has supported on the east bank of Jefferson Parish. I don't think anyone can,'' he said. \"I don't think that he comes to the east bank often enough other than for council meetings.''\nCongemi is a Republican who lives in Metairie. A former Kenner City Council member and mayor, he was the Parish Council's 4th District representative for eight years. But when term limits forced from that seat in 2012, he said his work was far from over.\nHe wants to find a tenant to take over the shuttered Avondale shipyard and secure a lease partner for ailing East Jefferson General Hospital. Jefferson Parish needs more federal dollars for flood control and drainage projects, he said, and he wants to pay for more crime cameras in neighborhoods.\n\"It's a job I haven't finished,'' he said. \"I need to finish.''\nJimmy Lawson\nA Gretna Democrat, Lawson questioned how Roberts could strip residents of their vote on the fate of Jefferson Parish's public hospitals. The Legislature passed a 2013 law letting the council to lease the hospitals without a referendum.\nRoberts \"took away the right of the public to vote on the future of the hospitals,'' Lawson said. \"If you're leasing something for 45 years, that's a sale. He killed the deal that HCA had put on the table.''\nJimmy Lawson Lawson said Councilman Paul Johnston appointed him to the Jefferson Housing Authority to \"straighten it out.'' The agency is working to tear down and rebuild its public housing complex in Marrero, a process Lawson said could take at least three years.\nBut the notion that the authority is raking in $200,000 a month from Section 8 vouchers is not true, Lawson said. The U.S. Department of Housing and Development sets the amount a contractor is paid per unit, Lawson said.\nThat amount is $220,000 a month, and the authority collects 10 percent or about $250,000 a year for \"doing nothing,'' Lawson said. That money is used to pay the executive director and staff.\nThere are 4,700 Section 8 units.\nRoberts \"tells a whole bunch of lies. That's what he does. He knows nothing about the Housing Authority,'' Lawson said.\nLawson called for more accountability over parish spending, pointing to the $55 million Jefferson Performing Arts Center in Metairie. He said a $5.6 million change order was approved by the council even though a parish administrator said that amount should have been half that amount. \"You just don't throw taxpayers at the feet of contractors,'' he said.\nLawson served 20 years on the Parish Council before he lost a race in 1995. Among the accomplishments he cited during his tenure was purchase of the Lasalle tract in Metairie, now home to the performing arts center, the New Orleans Zephyrs baseball stadium, the New Orleans Saints headquarters and a public park; a study that brought the TPC Louisiana golf course to the Fairfield-Avondale area; and a measure to alternate council meetings on each side of the river.\nHe said his campaign also is about restoring civility to the governing body. If elected, Lawson said he would work to unify council members and return decorum to meetings, where disputes are often aired publicly.\n\"Politics is the art of compromise. It can't be your way or the highway,'' he said. \"I was always a consensus builder.''\nHe said he would focus on quality-of-life issues and \"proper'' planning and zoning for the parish's remaining developable land in Avondale and along Leo Kerner Parkway between Marrero and Crown Point.\n\"We have to be concerned about economic development in the parish, that it continues,'' he said. \"The West Bank is where the growth in Jefferson Parish will occur.''\nChris Roberts\nFor the past four years, Roberts said, the council has focused its attention on trying to ensure the long-term viability of the parish's public hospitals. Before that, numerous disasters that struck Jefferson's coastal communities, including Jean Lafitte and Grand Isle, were a priority. But all along, he said, he has always been engaged and responsive to all residents.\n\"One of the greatest responsibilities a public official has is when you have a disaster, that's when you are called upon and needed the most,'' Roberts said. \"I was here for every hurricane and the BP disaster, while he hit the road and evacuated. That's the difference between Chris Roberts and Louis Congemi.''\nChris Roberts Jefferson Parish is at a critical point, as most of its challenges are in West Jefferson, Roberts said. The community is experiencing a loss of young families to St. Tammany Parish. Its property values lag behind the rest of the region. And Avondale shipyards , which at its peak employed more than 25,000 workers, remains shuttered.\n\"The question becomes how do we re-brand the parish to attract young families and businesses that are looking to invest so that we can prepare for the future,'' Roberts said. \"When you look to the future, you have to lay the foundation for the next three or four decades.''\nOfficials also have an obligation to ensure money is available to maintain and protect the integrity of the flood protection system built by the federal government after Hurricane Katrina, he said. The Parish Council must hold the state accountable in directing a portion of oil and gas royalties -- a new source of revenue -- toward flood protection, Roberts said.\nSome areas are already seeing subsidence because of soil conditions, he said. \"We can't worry about these things just on June 1. We have to make sure we keep it up,'' Roberts said. \"We've seen it only takes a 150-foot breach to flood out a whole city.''\nHe also called for continued funding of law enforcement. New Orleans' crime problem creates a greater risk for the parish, Roberts said. \"Criminals are well aware we have an effective criminal justice system in Jefferson Parish,'' he said.\nAcknowledging the nasty campaign, Roberts said he has tried to take the \"high road'' and stick to the issues that residents are most concerned about. But he has an \"obligation'' to respond to attacks and distortions of facts.\n\"When you have no record to run on because you're absent, you're forced to resort to these things,'' Roberts said of Congemi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:22:32.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
