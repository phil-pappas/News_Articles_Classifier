The dynamic of better-than-expected shale performance through the downturn has everyone's attention as to what role it will play in the world's energy perspective. I obviously have strong opinions that US domestic shale is here to stay and that the United States will continue to play a prominent role in providing affordable energy for decades,\" Faulkner said.\nThe Forum theme for 2015 is \"Mapping the Zeitgeist\" and will explore new paradigms of world geopolitical strategies, given changing conditions in Asia , Russia and the United States .\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements, including information about management's view of the Company's future expectations, plans and prospects.
