Promoted stories \nAfter the independence referendum polls showed that her main opponent in her East Dunbartonshire seat was the SNP, she said. \nShe added: “The Conservatives (eventually) came fourth in East Dunbartonshire, with 9 per cent of the vote. \n\"They were never going to win in East Dunbartonshire. And they knew that. \n\"But they spent large amounts of money, buying full-page advertisements in magazines that went to every house in half the constituency, having bar charts suggesting that they were the only ones that could beat the SNP.” \nShe added: “I think they there is an interesting question mark about the wider Conservative strategy. \n\"In (the party) being quite content with having an SNP MP, in some cases, elected in preference over a Liberal Democrat MP. \n“And there were certainly other seats in Scotland where they did the same thing,” she said during a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth last week. \nSenior Lib Dems have previously hit out at Tory adverts about the SNP ‘threat’ at the General Election. \nOne notorious poster portrayed former party leader Alex Salmond as a pickpocket. \nThe Lib Dems have also criticised David Cameron’s plan to restrict Scottish MPs' voting rights, announced just hours after the result of the independence vote. \nThe Scottish Conservative leader will address her party’s conference on Wednesday, just before Mr Cameron’s own keynote speech. \nTory activists have already been warned not to wear their passes in public during the conference, amid fears of unrest and potentially violent clashes. \nA number of anti-austerity protests, including one at which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak, will take place in the city to coincide with the Tory event. \nMr Cameron will also come under intense pressure inside the conference centre from the party faithful and his own MPs. \nThe issue of Europe is expected to dominate with some eurosceptics already calling for Mr Cameron to set a date for his pledged EU referendum, promise government funds will not be used to win it and to allow ministers to campaign against government policy. \nA new poll has found most people believe they should be free to argue for the UK to leave the EU. \nThe Survation survey for the Huffington Post website found that 55 per cent think that ministers should be allowed to lobby for a ‘Brexit’ while just 25 per cent think they have a duty to stick to the Government line. \nIt is understood that the theme of much of the Conservative conference will be on “security”, including economic security. \nA spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: “We were only interested in getting Scottish Conservatives elected in May, and were the only pro-union not to promote tactical voting. Share article \n“It’s clear the tactical voting ploy so loved by Labour and the Liberal Democrats didn’t work. \n“If Ms Swinson is suggesting other parties should have stood back and waved her through that would be incredibly undemocratic.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:41:01.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
