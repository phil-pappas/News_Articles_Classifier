It's a venue that gives both Southern Nevada and the candidates an elevated national profile, broadcast on CNN and sponsored by the cable network and Facebook.\nIt's the first of six debates for the Democratic candidates: Debates are planned in five other states with early presidential caucuses and primaries — Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Wisconsin.\nIt's also a reminder to the nation that Nevada is more than a gaming and tourism state. With February caucuses, Nevada is an early-voting state that plays a central role in determining which Republican and Democratic candidates will win their party's nomination.\nNevada offers up plenty of material to candidates hoping to get their messages to the nation — and Nevadans. Southern Nevada's housing market was the hardest hit in the U.S. when the economy tanked in 2008. Immigration reform is a key issue here, too, where there is a large Latino population.\nDemocrats say the debate will be a good opportunity to bring those issues to the forefront.\nThey also intend to demonstrate that their debate will set a different tone than the Republican debates. GOP front-runner Trump has attracted widespread attention to his controversial statements about immigration and the appearance of fellow Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, among other topics. The billionaire businessman is leading the rest of the 15 Republican candidates in the polls.\n\"We won't have a kids table at our debate because there are no children running on our side,\" said Eric Walker, a Democratic National Committee spokesman. \"We're excited to have a serious, robust discussion about important issues that Americans care about, and it's going to be a stark contrast to the Trump circus that has become the GOP nomination contest.\"\nThe Democrats debating on Tuesday are front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady; U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia; and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and former U.S. senator from Rhode Island.\nBoosting profile, turnout\nThe debate gives Las Vegas a platform it normally doesn't have.\n\"This is a very responsible kind of thing, the presidential candidate debates,\" said Fred Lokken, a political science professor at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno. \"I think it helps Las Vegas as it evolves and matures into a different kind of city.\"\nIt should help boost the number of Nevadans who turn out to vote in the election, he said.\n\"We've always struggled with voter turnout in the state,\" Lokken said. \"Having it in our own backyard helps.\"\nIn a teleconference call with reporters Wednesday, Democratic Party leaders said Nevada's situation gives the candidates a good opportunity to highlight issues such as job growth and creation, the economy and housing.\n\"When you look at the diversity of our state, I think the backdrop of Nevada is perfect,\" said Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange. \"We are the middle. We represent exactly what the Democratic Party represents.\"\nAt this point, the campaigns say they are focused on issues — not personalities. Whether that holds true on Tuesday will be for viewers to decide.\n\"Our fundamental goal coming out of the debate is to lay out why Hillary Clinton is running for president — who she'll fight for, what she'll do as president to address the issues that matter most to our country and to American families,\" Clinton campaign spokeswoman Christina Reynolds said in a statement.\nChance for stragglers\nThe debate will offer an opportunity for the low-polling candidates to boost their profiles. Sanders is polling behind Clinton, and the remaining three candidates trail both.\nA campaign aide for Sanders said the senator's approach is not to attack other candidates but to show where he differs from them and talk about his record.\nO'Malley told a reporter at a Monday campaign stop he expects the debate to have a civil tone.\n\"I'm looking forward to the debate,\" O'Malley said. \"In terms of preparing, in a sense every day of this campaign ... has been a step in preparation for the debate.\"\n\"This is the opportunity to forge a new consensus, have a deeper conversation and, I'm hoping that the whole tone of it will be a lot more civil and forward-looking than the Republican debate was,\" O'Malley said.\nPresidential candidates won't be done debating in Las Vegas after Tuesday. The Republican candidates will be here in December.\nThe final presidential debate in 2016 between the Republican and Democratic contenders also will be in Las Vegas.\nContact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2904.
