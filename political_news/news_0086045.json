Bradley Kanaris by Mark Ludlow Matthew Cranston It's no longer \"mate against mate, state against state\". It's Queenslander versus Queenslander.\nRugby league fans from the Sunshine State are used to preparing to fight their traditional rivals, NSW, in the annual State of Origin series.\nIn the past, if one of the Queensland-based league teams reached the National Rugby League Grand Final, traditional club rivalries were put aside and they backed the northern team against any of the southern rivals, especially if they were a despised team such as Manly.\nBut in the lead-up to the NRL Grand Final on Sunday night, Queensland league fans are experiencing a new sensation – fighting amongst themselves.\nFans of the Brisbane Broncos and the North Queensland Cowboys will face off to find out who is the best team in rugby league. It's a classic north-versus-south battle. The glamour club from the capital against the underdog from the regions.\nThe Broncos, who have won six premierships under the guidance of super coach Wayne Bennett, who returned to the club this year, are favourites. The Townsville-based Cowboys, who in 2005, lost the only Grand Final they reached, want to end their drought after 20 years in the competition.\nFairytale endings There are also fairytale endings to be written. Cowboys captain Jonathan Thurston may be the game's best player – winning a record fourth Dally M medal on Monday night – but another premiership will cement his place in history. Broncos captain Justin Hodges, who escaped a ban at the league judiciary on Tuesday, is retiring on Sunday and wants to end his career on a high.\n BMD Group chairman and die-hard North Queensland fan Mick Power, whose wealth from his civil engineering business is estimated by BRW Rich List at $1.4 billion, said a premiership win for the Cowboys would go a long way to lift the spirits of the Far North which has been hit hard by drought and the end of the resources boom.\n\"It comes at a time when things are a little bit slow and tough particularly with the people on the land and in infrastructure and mining,\" Mr Power told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"So it will be an enormous boost for part of the state the likes of which we have never seen. Anyone who has been to Townsville can see the enthusiasm but it's not just Townsville, it's all over North Queensland.\"\nBank of Queensland chief executive Jon Sutton may have grown up playing league in the NSW's Riverina but he is now a loyal Broncos fan.\n\"Brisbane is my second home now and I'll be at the game on Sunday cheering on the Broncos,\" Mr Sutton said.\nMorale boost \"Whatever the result on Sunday, clearly it will be a morale boost for Queensland in a year where the state has seen patchy economic performance, especially in those areas exposed to the mining industry or drought conditions.\"\nMr Sutton said he also greatly admired the winning culture created by the Broncos coach Wayne Bennett.\n\"He's one of Australia's greatest sporting coaches. What's unique is his ability to embed a winning culture – it's amazing how much the Broncos have been able to achieve this season after uniting behind a common goal and team values,\" he said.\nFormer Queensland treasurer Andrew Fraser, who is now NRL's head of strategy and investment, may hail from the small town of Proserpine in North Queensland, but he's backing a Broncos win. He was their number-one ticket holder until he left politics.\n\"I've always had a soft spot for the Cowboys, but I'm a long-term Broncos fan. I've been supporting them since I was 12-years-old. I think they have too much big-game experience,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:10:43.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
