This is pretty much a primer for us,\" said Travis County elections director Michael Winn. \nThe Travis County Clerk's office is taking advantage of the low participation to test out a brand new program that allows voters to fill out a sample ballot online and take it with them into the voting booth. Winn describes it as a sort of cheat sheet, which could come in handy with seven statewide propositions on the ballot. Early voting underway in Texas \nA campaign for the high-profile Proposition 1 launched earlier this month with the help of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R-Texas). A $10,000 increase in the homestead exemption for school property taxes under Prop. 1 is estimated to save the average homeowner around $126 a year. \n\"This bill is the first step, and you tell any person out there that they don't want an extra $150 dollars or so in their pocket?\" Patrick responded at an October kickoff event for the proposition, hosted by the Texas Association of Realtors. Patrick kicks off property tax cut campaign in Austin \nAmong the less publicized proposals are Prop. 3, which would repeal the law requiring state officeholders to live in Austin. It could spare them from expensive rent, while possibly increasing expensive travel -- and shield them from prosecution in Travis County. Another, Prop. 6 aims to enshrine hunting and fishing as state constitutional rights. \nThe other initiative getting major support is Prop. 7, which would permanently steer a portion of state sales tax towards highways. Texas House transportation Committee chair Joe Pickett (D-El Paso) got the green light from lawmakers, and hopes for the same from voters. \n\"We're not proposing a gas tax increase,\" Pickett explained to KVUE in September. \"We're not proposing any registration fee increases, and the decisions on the monies will be made locally.\" More money for Texas highways on November ballot \n\"Have that ID ready to go. It's a vote center election. Voters can go anywhere,\" said Winn. Despite the low turnout expected, it's a dry run for election officials constantly testing new ways to boost participation. \"Every little bit helps, and I think by improving technology, by improving accessibility, we think that we're doing our part.\" \nWe'll see how many Texans do theirs. The Texas League of Women voters has compiled a 2015 Voters Guide, which includes explanations and arguments both for and against each of the statewide propositions.
