The building owner in turn makes one out of five apartments affordable. In essence, the city and county help pay the monthly rent so a tenant can afford to move in. \nBut of the more than 11,000 new apartments launched in the city since 2012, just 315 carried reduced rents under the tax-break program. In that time, 15 developers applied to participate. Eight were rejected by the city and three others dropped out, deeming the regulations too onerous. \nThe tax program's failure results from competing agendas, hard choices and inattention to affordable housing issues at city hall. Local leaders shrugged off warnings of an impending shortage of homes affordable to working people. \nThe tax break-for-affordable apartments swap is not the city's only affordable housing tool. But the voluntary program is particularly important in a state that prohibits rent control and other mandatory affordable housing requirements in use elsewhere in the country. \nSeattle, which borrowed the tax break concept from Portland, is getting about 2,000 affordable apartments a year during the current boom. \nPortland Commissioner Dan Saltzman took over the city's housing programs in 2013. He acknowledged the 2012 restrictions were a mistake and arranged to repeal most of them. But he also blames \"out-of-town developers who don't want to be bothered with anything that interferes with their profit margins.\" \nPortland developer Tom Brenneke said the city missed a golden opportunity to help poor people during the surge of construction. \n\"You've got to ask yourself, why did it take so long for the city to take action,\" he said. \"Why wasn't anybody talking about this issue two years ago?\" \nCity officials maintain the program could eventually lead to 200-300 new affordable units a year. \nThat's better than the zero so far in 2015. But it pales in the face of the city's stated need of 33,000 affordable units. \nUnacceptable giveaways? \nThe city's tax break program to provide for apartments and homes dates to 1975. The program helped create more than 14,000 affordable homes, most built by non-profit housing groups. \nPrivate developers also can participate. They get property tax cuts on new apartment buildings if they reduce rents on 20 percent of the units for 10 years. Depending on the neighborhood, developers need to cut rents sufficiently so that people earning 60-80 percent of the area median income can afford to live there. \nJohn Warner, formerly of the Portland Development Commission housing office, led a city group addressing urban middle-income housing. The group, in place from 2008 to 2010, warned of a looming shortage of housing that the working poor could afford. It advocated an ambitious partnership with private developers to build 3,000 affordable homes. \n\"These are relatively shallow subsidies,\" he said. \"It's pennies on the dollar compared to the cost of building a new low-income housing project. It makes all the sense in the world to get the private sector to work for you.\" \nWarner's task force never gained traction. That was in part a matter of bad timing. The recession was in full swing. Housing was falling in value. The chance of a sudden turnaround and a housing shortage seemed remote. \nWhat's more, the Portland Housing Bureau was riveted on housing the homeless. Nick Fish, the city commissioner then overseeing the housing bureau, doesn't apologize for that. \n\"The biggest needs are at the really low-end,\" Fish said in a recent interview. \"We don't have the bandwidth to do both.\" \nThe tax program had few friends in city hall. As the city, county and schools cut back during the recession, critics deemed the tax breaks unacceptable giveaways to wealthy developers. In 2012, the city and county capped spending on the apartment program at $1 million. \nAt the same time, the city imposed a phalanx of new rules intended to extract better terms from developers . Most significantly, the city decided developers could make no more than a 10 percent profit on a particular project if they wanted the tax subsidy. \nThe market turns \nThose limits came as Portland's apartment market took off and developers had little incentive to restrain their profits. Rents soared, jumping more than 40 percent from 2010 to 2015. \nThat the construction boom would only worsen the affordability problem was initially lost in the exhilaration and relief at the economy's recovery. \n\"We all can get dinged for not seeing this wave coming,\" said Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury. \"But I think for a while, people were just excited about all this development in places where it hadn't happened before.\" \nSaltzman said he realized last year that Warner's prediction of a serious shortage of affordable housing, even for the middle class, was accurate. The commissioner sought to jumpstart the apartment tax break program, cold calling developers to pitch it. The majority ignored him, he said. Other staffers from Saltzman's office and, more recently, the housing bureau also approached developers with little success. \nTwo developers started but dropped out of the process last year after getting a closer look. \n\"From our perspective it seemed we were getting punished in a way for having the affordable component,\" Allison Finn of Trinsic Residential Group explained at the time. \nOne who heard out the commissioner was Tom Brenneke. His company, Guardian Real Estate Services, is a co-developer of the Yard, a 284-unit tower under construction at the east end of the Burnside Bridge. \n\"We weren't going to do it,\" Brenneke said. \"It had some pretty clunky provisions.\" \nThe 10 percent profit cap was particularly unacceptable. \n\"Why would anyone get near something like that in a market as hot as this?\" he said. \nBrenneke was sympathetic to the need for more modestly priced apartments. As Portland prices have increased, Brenneke's company has found it increasingly difficult to retain employees. \n\"I have people who live in Southwest Washington, in east county,\" he said. \"And it's not just Vancouver and Gresham these days. It's Battle Ground and Troutdale. People quit after a couple years because they can't take the commute. Every business owner with 50 or more employees is aware of this.\" \nSaltzman and his staff persisted in their efforts last year to recruit Brenneke into the program, finally asking him what it would take to cut a deal. \nSoon, the city jettisoned most of the 2012 restrictions, including the limit on developer profits. The city and Multnomah County also agreed in October to the triple the budget for the tax program to $3 million a year. \nUnder the subsequent deal with the city, Brenneke's company will save about $800,000 a year for 10 years in property taxes. Tenants will pay $650,000 less in rents, leaving Guardian with a $150,000 annual profit from its arrangement with the city. \nFor Portland, it will mean 57 affordable apartments -- $729 a month for a studio â€“ in the heart of the city. The market-rate rent in the Yard starts at $2,148 a month. \n-- Jeff Manning", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:54:08.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
