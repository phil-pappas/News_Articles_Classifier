I think most \"conservatives\" would support Marsha Blackburn for Speaker of the House. However, she needs to clarify her thinking on \"free trade\" vs America First trade policy. Marsha Blackburn has stated many of here constituents have contacted her with their concerns about Trade Promotion Authority. And, she has acknowledged when traveling around her district, she consistently hears Congressman, I support free trade, but I just dont trust this Administration. To this she responds that \"TPA does not give the President one ounce of authority he isnt already granted by the Constitution.\" But this happens to not to be true! Fast-track trade power would allow the President to negotiate regulations of commerce with foreign nations in secret, while Congress only part before these regulations become law would be an up or down vote within 90 days upon receiving the presidents' concocted regulations. Keep in mind that our Constitution places exclusive power to legislate regulations of commerce with foreign nations in Congress hands. Placing this power in Congress hands was intended by our Founders to insure that any regulations of commerce would be formulated, debated, and amended if needed by the various States Congressional Delegation sent to Washington to insure that each States interests would be represented in the making of such regulations. After any regulations of commerce were agreed upon by Congress, the president was left with a limited power to either approve or veto the regulations of commerce agreed to by Congress. Fast Track Trade promotion authority is intentionally designed to reverse the president's and Congress' constitutionally assigned duties as they apply to regulating commerce with foreign nations. In this reversal, the president would usurp Congress assigned duty to represent their particular state interests when fashioning regulations of commerce while Congress would be left with the limited power to either approve or veto what the president has cooked up in secret with foreign nations. Fast-tract trade authority is a Chamber of Commerces idea to remove the peoples Representatives from amending bad trade deals struck by Obama in secret which are not in the best interests of America, but rather, are deals beneficial to international corporate giants who have no allegiance to America or any nation, and are deals which may not be promoting the general welfare of the United States. Marsha Blackburn needs to explain why she alleges Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority \"does not give the President one ounce of authority he isnt already granted by the Constitution.\" JWK To support Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House is to support our Global Governance Crowd and their FAST TRACK, WTO, NAFTA, GATT, CAFTA, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal... all used to circumvent America First trade policies, while fattening the fortunes of international corporate giants who have no allegiance to America or any nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:46.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
