At no point did the government seek independent legal advice on the Treaty implications of the deal.\" \n\"Upholding the Treaty of Waitangi is one of Labour’s bottom lines for the TPPA. I’m calling on Labour’s Maori caucus to conduct a comprehensive analysis of whether this bottom line is satisfied once the text is finally released.\" \n\"This was not done by FOMA who supported the TPPA even before it had seen the text,\" says Keepa. \n\"As well as looking at the Treaty clause we also need to look at the cumulative effect of the deal to determine how Maori interests will be protected. Take the investment chapter that prohibits tighter regulation of foreign investment in the housing market to bring down the cost of housing, locking the door on Maori already shut out of the housing market.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
