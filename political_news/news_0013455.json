If his words left any doubt about the intended beneficiaries of his energy plan, the setting he chose spoke volumes: a company that makes equipment used to drill and refine fossil fuels, Boc Water Hydraulics. Mr. Rubio’s speech emphasized extracting natural resources from the ground, as opposed to investing in less polluting options like wind or solar power , and struck a sharply combative tone. Mr. Rubio promised the afternoon crowd of about 300 here that there would be major differences in how a Rubio administration would balance energy policy with environmental protection and how a Democratic White House would. “It is innovation, not regulation, that will prompt the development of affordable fuel alternatives,” he said. “That is why conservatives, not liberals, have the more sustainable energy agenda.” To emphasize his point, he reached for a religious reference. He said that the Obama administration had issued nearly 30,000 pages of new regulations, which he noted was “about 46 times the length of the Bible.” And he named Hillary Rodham Clinton one of the biggest impediments to growth in the energy industry. “This is what I mean when I say Democrats like Hillary Clinton are outdated,” he said. “They label themselves ‘progressives’ yet take great pride in opposing economic progress.” Mr. Rubio shares his Republican rivals’ distaste for Mr. Obama’s efforts to negotiate an international accord to combat climate change. And his plan appears explicitly intended to weaken the president’s hand as Mr. Obama tries to reach an agreement with other United Nations members at a Paris climate conference in December. While Mr. Obama hopes that such a deal will be a cornerstone of his legacy, the ultimate success of the accord hinges on whether his successor will actually carry it out — and Mr. Rubio’s plan makes clear that a President Rubio would not do so. In fact, his plan would require congressional ratification of any international climate agreements, something highly unlikely in the current Republican-led Congress. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:24:02.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
