Enter former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice George Carlson. Carlson appears in an ad for 42 for Better Schools saying, \"I know the law and I know what a judge can and cannot do.\" He goes on to say, \"Initiative 42 does not give a Hinds County judge authority over school spending. 42 gives funds to local schools and they decide how to spend it.\" Since the language in 42 has yet to be adjudicated I'm not sure how Carlson can be so certain in his comments. Given his background, he should know that lawsuits against the state do come before a Hinds County judge, and if you take the language of 42 on its own merits, how he can claim local school districts will receive more funds and directly decide where those dollars are spent is beyond me. That notion isn't in 42 at all. It's almost as if there's an agenda behind the scenes and he doesn't want to tip his hand. You see, George Carlson is well acquainted with those behind Initiative 42 and the education lobby, chief among them Ronnie Musgrove. Carlson, a Batesville native, was appointed to the Supreme Court by former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove in 2001. The relationship between the two dates back a number of years, centering around First Security Bank, where each shared a vested interest. Musgrove was the bank attorney with offices in the same building. Carlson has been listed as a principal holder of common stock and later on the bank's board of directors . This ad with Carlson would make the uninformed believe that a random retired judge just got sick of the anti-42 rhetoric and decided to jump in and clear the air but there clearly appears to be a backstory that Better Jobs Better Schools hasn't told quite yet.
