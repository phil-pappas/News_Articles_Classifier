It's not exactly a cheap purchase but if you want to splurge on a single memorable piece for the season, this is a strong contender. The rich shades of blue and green combine to look like the fanciest quilt you've ever seen, and the cocoon shape is not only warm, but roomy enough to accommodate all of your winter layers.\nThe best part of owning this coat is that it almost doesn't even matter what you wear under it — everything just looks better. Here it's styled with a simple cashmere sweater, slouchy boyfriend jeans, and menswear-inspired loafers, but you could also easily wear it with sneakers to run errands on the weekends or dress it up with a trousers and heels for the weekdays.\nAnd if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, try this MSGM option (on sale!) or this Ted Baker style .\nPhoto: Jody Rogac\nCarven heavyweight cocoon coat, $1,750 at Barneys New York ; Everlane cashmere crew neck, $125 at Everlane ; Madewell slim boyfriend jean, for similar try them in the Hatfield wash, $128 at Madewell; Aquatalia Harlow loafers, $450 at Aquatalia .\nPhotographer: Jody Rogac; styling by Diana Tsui; model: Melanie Culley at DNA Models; makeup by Allie Smith; hair by Takashi Ashizawa using Oribe Hair Care; photo editor: Emily Shornick; photo assistant: Tim Schutsky.", "external_links": ["https://www.everlane.com/collections/2015-womens-cashmere/products/womens-cashmere-crew-neck-sweater2-ivory", "https://www.bysymphony.com/msgm-neoprene-floral-coat-32264.html?utm_source=Affiliate&utm_medium=LinkShare&utm_campaign=J84DHJLQkR4&utm_content=10&utm_term=UKNetwork&siteID=J84DHJLQkR4-ldEbZGXNioxMGsNa.KOZzQ", "http://www.barneys.com/carven-heavyweight-cocoon-coat-504245339.html?utm_medium=affiliate&siteID=J84DHJLQkR4-9dWvYZhHAjlOE1mAmwKnCQ&utm_source=J84DHJLQkR4", "http://www.aquatalia.com/harlow-/d/1049C288?CategoryId=201", "http://www.tedbaker.com/us/Womens/Clothing/Jackets-Coats/CARLEIH-Shadow-Floral-cocoon-coat-Mid-Gray/p/123463-02-MID-GREY?cmpid=aff_cpa_cj_2178999-0-0-us-u-0-0-textlink-0-0-0-0&utm_source=aff&utm_medium=cpa&utm_campaign=cj&utm_content=0-0-0-us-u-0-0-textlink-0-0-0-0"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:06:03.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
