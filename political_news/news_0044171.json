Orangethorpe Ave. \n 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Nov. 7 at Hope International University, 2500 E. Nutwood Ave. \n 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Nov. 10 at Maple Neighborhood Center in Lemon Park, 701 S. Lemon St. \n 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Nov. 14 at Sunny Hills High School, 1801 Warburton Way \nTranslators for Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Spanish will be present. \nR.S.V.P. is requested, but not required. For information or to RSVP email districtelections@cityoffullerton.com or call the city clerk at 714-738-6355. \nThe Fullerton School District is changing how its five board members are chosen by voters. \nThe board is holding community meetings and public hearings over the next three months about the move from an at-large election system, where all voters chose from the pool of candidates, to a district system, where voters in five geographic areas choose from candidates within their area. \nThe school district, which governs a region of 117,262 people, is one of many cities and school districts in Orange County and around the state that are moving away from an at-large election system following a string of lawsuits claiming it violates the state’s Voting Rights Act. \nThe Fullerton School District will start using the district system in November 2016. Now the map for the voting district has to be chosen. \nThe district has commissioned a demographics study by the Dolinka Group. \nIn setting the boundaries, there are some basic considerations that have to be made, according to a district presentation, including that each district should contain about the same number of people, the map has to comply with the Federal Voting Rights Act, and voting districts should be as compact and contiguous as possible. \nSuggested boundaries have been drawn and three public meetings will be held to garner feedback. The meetings will be 6 to 7:30 p.m. on: \n Tuesday at Ladera Vista Jr. High, 1700 E. Wilshire Ave. \n Wednesday at Parks Jr. High, 1710 Rosecrans Ave. \n Oct. 29 at Nicolas Jr. High, 1100 W. Olive Ave. \nThe school board is also holding public hearings at 6 p.m. on Nov. 17 and on Dec. 8 at the district headquarters, 1401 W. Valencia Ave. It is expected the final map will be chosen by the board on Dec. 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:02:20.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
