This required all five permanent members of the Security Council — the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union — as well as a majority of the 51 original signatories, to ratify the founding document. To date, 193 nations have become signatories. The charter calls on the U.N. to maintain international peace and security, to promote social progress and higher standards of life, to strengthen international law and to encourage the expansion of human rights.\nThe terms of the charter were hammered out at a 50-nation conference that opened in San Francisco on April 25, 1945. The first meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, opened in London on Jan. 10, 1946. (In the interim, Poland became the 51st signatory.)\nOn Oct. 24, 1949, four years after the charter went into effect, the cornerstone was laid for the U.N. headquarters building near the East River in mid-Manhattan. Nelson Rockefeller arranged for the purchase, after an initial offer to locate it on the Rockefeller family estate in Westchester County was rejected as being too far from New York City. The $83.4 million purchase — as adjusted to reflect current dollars — was funded by Nelson Rockefeller’s father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who donated the land to the city.\nTechnically, the U.N. headquarters complex in New York remains an extraterritorial site that remains beyond the jurisdictional reach of the surrounding city and state as well as the federal government. However, in exchange for police and fire protection and other essential services, the U.N. has agreed to abide by most local, state, and federal laws.\nUnited Nations Day is celebrated on this day each year.\nSOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:35:22.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
