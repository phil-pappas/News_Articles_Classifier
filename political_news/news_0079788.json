But their drive could keep the issue alive during next year's elections and complicate GOP senators' re-election campaigns in some closely divided states.Democrats say their push would include broadening background check requirements to cover all sales at gun shows and online. Republicans blocked similar legislation in 2013 after the killing of 20 students and six staffers at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.A gunman killed nine people last week at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.
