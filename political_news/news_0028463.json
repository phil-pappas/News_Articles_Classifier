This is 93.7 per cent of the 2,462,926 registered electors.\nNon-voters who wish to be able to vote at future elections should apply to have their names restored to the registers and state their reason for failing to vote, said the ELD.\nAcceptable reasons include working overseas, such as being on a business trip at the time of polling; studying overseas at the time of polling; living with a spouse who is working or studying overseas; overseas vacation; and illness, or delivering a baby.\nWithout an acceptable reason, a $50 fee might have to be paid for one to be reinstated.\nSingaporeans can check their elector status and apply to be restored to the registers of electors via four channels. They can do so online at ELD's website at www.eld.gov.sg , or with their NRIC or passport at community centres and clubs, at Singapore overseas missions that serve as overseas registration centres, or at the Elections Department itself.\nELD said it will inform all applicants of the outcome of their applications in writing.\nSingaporeans who wish to vote at one of the designated overseas polling stations, are encouraged to register as overseas electors early via the above channels if they have not done so.\nThey must reside overseas, be listed in the registers of electors and have resided in Singapore for at least 30 days during the three-year period between Feb 1, 2012, and Jan 31, 2015.\nRegistration of overseas electors will close with the issue of the Writ of Election, said the ELD, and that re-registration as an overseas elector is required with each revision of the registers.\nTopics: SINGAPORE GENERAL ELECTION GE 2015 ELECTIONS DEPARTMENT //str.sg/ZuL9 Copy", "external_links": ["http://str.sg/ZuL9"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:21:14.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
