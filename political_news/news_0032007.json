Today it is >300% higher.. at 18,400 trillion dollars. Posts: 4,467 Congress already voted to raise the debt, when they approved spending and tax rates. This is just pissing and moaning by the spineless cocksuckers that call themselves the Republican Party. Thanks from Camelot and Lyzza Originally Posted by goober Congress already voted to raise the debt, when they approved spending and tax rates.

If it they had we would not be having this discussion. I am not going to sit here and tell youthey are not going to raise it.. But I am saying the day is coming it will not be raised. We can to it under our own terms or under our creditors terms. Pay now or Pay later.. No they have not voted to raise the debt limit. If it they had we would not be having this discussion.

Pay now or Pay later.. When the congress voted to spend more than taxes would raise, they voted to increase the debt.

Democrats controlled 1/2 of teh congress the last 5 years. When teh Democrats controlled congress the Deficit (Borrowing) increased from the GOP's 168 Billion, to 1600 Billion in 10 Fold GOP took controll of 1 house of congress adn cut the Defict in 2/3rds to 500 Billion.. They took control of the upper house this year and we are looking at a <500 billion deficit. Remember 14.2 Trillion of our 18.3 Trillion debt was borrowed BY DEMOCRATS. Who controled congress?

I guess you never took statistics and you never learned about correlation. Because the correlation between raising and lowering the deficit is about 50% with which party controls congress, and over 90% with which party controls the White House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:04:24.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
