Jha | October 02, 2015, 07.20 am Esha Deol After a stint on television with MTV Roadies, Esha Deol has taken to the big screen again. Although this time, it is a Kannada film. Titled Care of Footpath 2, it will go to the Oscars as a lateral entry.\nUnlike official entries, lateral entries are made by the makers of the film and not by an appointed national committee. “As far as I know, lateral entry means our film will compete in all the mainstream categories rather than just the ‘foreign film’ category. I will be going to L.A. to support my director. I’ll be there with him for at least 10 days, maybe more.”\nSpeaking about her film Esha said, “Care Of Footpath 2 was interesting because I had never done a Kannada film before or played a lawyer. What sealed the deal for me is that it will be released in Hindi as well. The director Kishan Shrikanth is only 19. Would you believe he was only nine when he made the first part of the film?\nHe is in the Guinness Book for being the youngest director in the world.”\nEsha considers herself blessed for being married into a family that supports her work. “It couldn’t have been more perfect for me. Bharat is everything a girl would want in a husband. His parents, too, are supportive of everything I do — be it my dancing, hosting Roadies and now doing this film. They’re always there to back me.\nTo add to that, I live 15 minutes away from my mother’s house, so I am in and out of both the houses all the time. Life couldn’t be better. Touch wood.” Esha recently turned aunt with her sister Ahana delivering a baby boy. Does she have plans of starting a family too?\n“Bharat and I decided we won’t start a family for the first three years of our marriage. We wanted to utilise this time to discover each other and to get to know one another’s family. As for becoming a mother, it will happen soon. I will take time off dancing and acting to concentrate completely on our child.”\n Esha Deol Care of Footpath 2 entertainment Bollywood Sandalwood Also Read Power cuts Hansika Motwani's Europe holiday Abhishek and Rishi join Sonakshi on the sets of Indian Idol Jr. Sundeep tastes another success The Kapoor connection", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Esha%20Deol_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Esha%20Deol_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151002/entertainment-bollywood/article/esha-has-big-dreams-her-kannada-film", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:38:14.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
