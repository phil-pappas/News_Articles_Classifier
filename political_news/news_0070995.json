Sgt. Jonathan Frost shot Guilford of Mulliken seven times Feb. 28 in Roxand Township. \nBrian and Becky Guilford seek a jury trial but not specific monetary damages. The Guilfords say they \"are outraged by the huge miscarriage of justice.\" \nCounty officials declined comment. Prosecutors previously said Frost wouldn't be charged. \nAn internal investigation concluded he followed department regulations and training but recommended the department \"re-emphasize\" training. \nGuilford was stopped for flashing his bright lights. They began to struggle when Frost tried to pull Guilford from his vehicle. \nInformation from: Lansing State Journal, http://www.lansingstatejournal.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:02:47.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
