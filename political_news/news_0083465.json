Sources on the ground in Atlanta report that New Zealand would go along with a new proposal from US and Australia with a ‘regulatory framework’. That’s a new legal weapon alongside data exclusivity and other intellectual property twists. They all have the same effect - delay market competition and keep medicines prices higher for longer.\" he said. \"But the same sources indicate that Chile and Peru are not convinced by the ‘regulatory framework. They want to stay with a five year data exclusivity system - what we have currently in New Zealand and Australia. We need to hear that New Zealand is speaking up for health, not just relying on Peru.\" \n\"Relying on others is a nice bluffing option for the Trade Minister. Going with the Australian position he will be able to claim that New Zealand has successfully resisted US demands on data exclusivity for biologic medicines, when in fact monopoly times on these medicines will still be extended. But what really is the New Zealand position?\". \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:35:08.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
