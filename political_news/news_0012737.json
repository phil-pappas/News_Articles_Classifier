This provided public safety officials and first responders with secure communications and a clear understanding of the location of personnel to drastically improve response times.\nESChat operating on the FirstNet ready XP7 provides first responders a secure communication platform with the dedicated LTE bandwidth required to meet the needs for mission critical PTT operations.\n\"The ESChat system also includes full integration with the public safety P25 radio networks and dispatch environment,\" said Josh Lober , president of SLA Corporation, which makes the ESChat product. \"This ability enables interoperable PTT communication between various agencies responding to a single incident site.\"\n\"The Push to Talk feature has been super helpful,\" said Captain Jackie White of the Albuquerque Fire Department. \"Communications are always challenging at an event like this. On the Sonim devices there is no interference at all. Communication is very clear like you and I are talking right in front of each other.\"\nVoice communications are critical to public safety operations, yet audio alone does not provide enough situational awareness, particularly in large events. Situational awareness technology such as STING increases effectiveness of public safety personnel and first responders.\n\"Our STING software corrects this problem by creating a digital Common Operating Picture that visually communicates descriptions, multimedia and locations between operators and commanders who are now fully coordinated and informed,\" said Britt Kane , CEO, Intrepid Networks. \"For example, at the New Mexico State Fair, STING assisted the officers on duty to locate several missing children in less than 10 minutes.\"\nRobert Escalle , Sonim's vice president of public safety and defense said New Mexico's XP7 deployment is one of many currently underway around the country. \"Sonim is focused on developing the best, most rugged customized communication solutions that exceed the needs of public safety personnel and first responders. We are excited to be a part of this innovation trend and are committed to serving the brave men and women who protect our communities.\"\nSonim is the first and only Tier One smartphone manufacturer to release a commercially available smartphone platform that enables first responders to get broadband access on both the FirstNet Band Class 14 spectrum and on commercial mobile networks. The XP7's key strengths include its 4,800-milliamp battery, 40 hours of LTE-based talk time, extreme durability in hot, dusty and wet environments, visibility under direct sunlight and support for a wide range of Android applications.\nABOUT SONIM TECHNOLOGIES:\nSonim Technologies ( http://www.sonimtech.com ) is the provider of mission-critical solutions designed specifically for workers in extreme, hazardous and isolated environments.
