Some current inmates could get their sentences reduced by as much as 25 percent by taking part in rehabilitation programs, if they are deemed a low risk to offend again.\nThe bill would eliminate mandatory life sentences for three-time, non-violent offenders.\nThe bill is scheduled to be unveiled Thursday. Details were confirmed by a Senate aide familiar with the package. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not authorized to speak publicly about the bill ahead of Thursday's announcement.\nViolent offenders, sex offenders and inmates convicted of terrorism charges would be excluded. Members of organized crime syndicates and major fraud offenders would also be excluded.\nThe package, which was years in the making, should have momentum in the Senate. It was negotiated by some of the most powerful senators.\nThe White House hasn't commented on the bill. But in July, President Barack Obama became the first president to visit a federal prison while in office. He called for changes in the criminal justice system, saying a distinction had to be made between young people doing \"stupid things\" and violent criminals.\nAmong the senators' goals: make the sentencing system more fair, reduce recidivism and contain rising prison costs.\nSince 1980, the federal prison population has exploded, in part because of mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders. In 1980, the federal prison population was less than 25,000. Today, it is more than 200,000.\n\"My childhood was spent hearing, 'Just say no to drugs,' and look, the thought behind that movement had merit,\" said Holly Harris, executive director of U.S. Justice Action Network. \"But unfortunately, we went too far.\"\nHarris, whose group has been pushing for an overhaul of the criminal justice system, said she was encouraged by how broad the proposal is. She said the political climate has changed dramatically from the 1980s and '90s, when many politicians were afraid to appear weak on crime.\n\"In my book, this isn't a tough vote,\" Harris said. \"People are educated on this and they want these reforms.\"\nAmong the Republican backers of the bill: Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate; Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Sen. Mike Lee of Utah; and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is running a longshot campaign for president.\nAmong the Democrats: Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate; Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat; Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island; and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.\nThe bill would require all eligible inmates to undergo regular assessments to determine the likelihood of committing another crime. It would not authorize any new spending. But it would encourage inmates to take part in rehabilitation programs and other productive activities, such as working prison jobs.\nInmates deemed to be a low risk for a repeat offense could get their prison sentences shortened by 10 days for every 30 days they participate in a rehabilitation program. These inmates could serve the last part of their sentences in community-based programs in which they would be supervised by authorities.\nThe bill would reduce enhanced penalties that apply to repeat drug offenders. However, the penalties would still be applied to offenders with prior convictions for violent and serious drug felonies.\n___\nFollow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stephenatap\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/stephenatap"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:38:57.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
