Times reports .\nImmigration activists argue that Texas has been denying American-born children of immigrants birth certificates since 2013, and that hundreds of families have been affected. In May, 19 families filed a lawsuit against the state , arguing that Texas had been putting \"additional barriers\" to issuing birth certificates into place, such as requiring parents to have a Mexican electoral card or a U.S. driver's license, despite the fact that U.S.-born children are automatically granted citizenship. Without a birth certificate, their children can't be registered for school or social services such as Medicaid.\n Now, Judge Robert L. Pitman has ruled that Texas officials can refuse to accept cards issued by the Mexican consulate as an acceptable form of I.D. to receive birth certificates for U.S.-born children. \" ​ ​ While the Court is very troubled at the prospect of Texas-born children, and their parents, being denied issuance of a birth certificate ... Texas has a clear interest in protecting access to that document,\" he wrote.\nMore from Cosmo for Latinas 20 articles How \"Jane the Virgin\" Narrator Anthony Mendez...

Watch Selena Gomez Admit Her Hair is Totally Fake Judge Pitman also noted in his decision that while the attorneys for the families had provided \"evidence which raises grave concerns regarding the treatment of citizen children born to immigrant parents,\" the court needed to see more evidence (though it's unclear what that means) before issuing the emergency injunction they sought. Lastly, he said that Texas has a right to make sure that the types of I.D. it accepts are valid and reliable.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a public statement that, \"Before issuing any official documents, it's important for the state to have a way to accurately verify people are who they say they are through reliable identification mechanisms. We will continue defending DSHS's policy on safeguarding Texans' most sensitive information and vital documents.\"\nFollow Alanna on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1445019949-landscape-1445008841-gettyimages-492350214.jpg", "http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-texas-immigrant-birth-20150718-story.html#page=1", "https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-statement-on-dshs-birth-certificate-policy-ruling", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444947881-anthonymendezqandapromoforreal.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/alannaknunez", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1445193647-screen-shot-2015-10-18-at-114022-am.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/43/320x160/landscape-1445263993-gettyimages-462346278.jpg", "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-texas-immigrant-birth-certificate-20151016-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:03:01.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
