More Bush calls for repeal of oil export curbs \nMr Hanlin found himself indirectly on the receiving end of a stern lecture from President Barack Obama on Thursday, just hours after the sheriff announced that 10 people had been killed in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Douglas county, where he serves as the top law enforcement official. \n“We are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country . . . that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,” Mr Obama said. \nIn an emotional address, the president urged the public to take a stand so that politicians would be less susceptible to pressure from the National Rifle Association , the powerful lobby group. Tapping into fears about security that have permeated the US since the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, he asked people to consider how many Americans had been killed over the past decade by gun violence compared with terrorism. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 33,000 gun-related deaths in 2013, with two-thirds considered suicides and a third categorised as murders. In comparison, only 26 people have died in terrorist incidents on US soil since September 11 2001, according to the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank. \nThe Gun Violence Archive, a group that monitors firearms-related deaths, says almost 10,000 people have been killed by guns in the US this year. More than 4,000 of those came in the four months since Mr Obama sang “Amazing Grace” during a eulogy at a memorial service following the murder of nine African-Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. \nMr Obama, who has described his failure to make headway on gun violence as his biggest regret, said other nations, including the UK and Australia, had enacted laws to prevent mass shootings after just one incident. \n“We spend over a trillion dollars and pass countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil,” Mr Obama added. “And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?” \nThe answer to that question is the National Rifle Association, which runs hard-hitting campaigns against lawmakers who cross its path. But while the NRA has been incredibly effective at preventing the passage of gun control measures at national level, it is facing a growing challenge from groups pushing for measures at state level. \nOne group is called Moms Demand Action , founded by Shannon Watts after Sandy Hook. The mother of five says taking on the NRA is a huge task, but that organisations like hers are gaining traction across the US. She says they have helped force six states to close loopholes that allow people to buy weapons without any background checks since the 2012 massacre. \nMs Watts says her group, with chapters in every state and 3m members, has helped defeat 15 NSA-backed state bills to allow guns in schools. “We have been at this for three years. The gun lobby has been at it for 30 years,” says Ms Watts. “(But) they have never had that kind of opposition before. We are making significant strides . . . but this is going to take years.” \nMs Watts says companies such as Starbucks and Target have responded to growing grassroots pressure by banning weapons in stores, or barring people from carrying guns openly, something that is permitted in 44 states. \nWhile Moms Demand Action is taking a leaf out of the NRA playbook by creating a grassroots lobbying network, the NRA is firing back with its own ammunition. On its website, the group has a video that stresses the need for mothers to be able to protect their families with weapons. \n“I’m a mom and just like millions of other women, that’s why I own guns,” says a woman in the video. “We’re responsible, we’re law-abiding and we’re everything that makes America strong. Every day we are willing to use a firearm to defend our families . . . it’s time for moms like me to speak out.” \nAryln Pendergast, owner of a South Carolina gun shop that runs shooting classes for women , says women account for 20 per cent of his clients, up from 3 per cent four years ago. “I have met way too many ladies who have bad things happen to them and . . . had no way to defend themselves.” \nMs Watts says the NRA is engaging in a “craven marketing ploy” to sell more guns. “They have to sell guns to children and women to protect their profits,” she says. “That’s why they made the ad and it’s why they’re pushing for guns on college campuses.” \nWhile Moms Demand Action and groups such as Mayors Against Illegal Guns , co-founded by then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, have made strides, they face tough resistance from parts of the US where people are wary of any government effort to regulate their ability to buy or use weapons. \nThe manager of a gun shop called Shamrock Pawn in Dublin, Georgia, says politicians pushing gun control are hypocritical. “The president has dozens of armed men protecting him and we should have a right to protect ourselves,” he says, adding that 75 per cent of people in his county own guns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:58:37.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
