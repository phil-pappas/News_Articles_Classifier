However a senior Democrt close to the VP says Biden will not be making an appearance at the debate. \n\"Nothing is actually being done yet,\" who spoke to CNN on a condition of anonymity in order to avoid violating the trust of the vice president. \"There's far more talk than action.\" \nMoreover, it has been said Biden is unsure whether he and his family is ready for the \"emotional toll\" the campaign will take. However Sen. Tom Carper, a Delaware Democrat who has known Biden for decades, revealed the Vice President is coming closer to a decision. \"If you would have asked me several months ago, I would have said he should decide by the beginning of October,\" Carper told CNN. \"But as time goes by, his numbers continue to improve and more and more people want him to run. I don't think he has to do something this week. This month? Yeah.\" \nWho knows, maybe viewers can expect a cameo tomorrow. \nThe CNN Facebook Democratic Debate will be held in Las Vegas at the Wynn Las Vegas. Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Dan Bush will moderate the event. The Live stream will kick-off at 8:30pm EST on CNN.com with live coverage before the debate gets underway at 9pm EST.
