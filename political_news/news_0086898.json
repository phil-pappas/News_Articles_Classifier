Demanding justice for his father, who was lynched by a mob over rumours in Dadri area of UP, his son Mohammad Sartaj on Monday appealed against politicising the issue. \"This is not for me to comment, what they are saying is their thinking. I can only appeal to them not to politicise the issue. Death of someone's family member cannot be an issue of politics. If you want to politicise, there are some other points too. But it is wrong to politicise someone's murder,\" Sartaj told reporters in Gautam Budh Nagar district.\nHe also said that there was improvement in the health of his brother Danish, who was also critically injured in the attack.\nOn a question about the alleged link of seven arrested persons with a local BJP leader, Sartaj said he was concerned only with justice. \"I am not concerned whom they are related to or not, or with which religion. I am concerned only with justice. They have committed murder and eye witnesses, my sister, have identified them. There are more people involved. When the arrested ones will be inquired, they will open up about others as well.\n\"Justice should be such that it sets an example, allays fears from the minds of people. People are leaving village out of fear... that terror should be dispelled. This incident should be the last incident.\"\nTo a query on police protection for his family, Sartaj said that any incident may take place after the protection is withdrawn. \"Police protection is there. Any incident may take place after the protection is removed. The villagers have not reached to us to express condolences, so there is something (fear) in the minds of people. So, it is obvious staying there is difficult,\" he added.\nSartaj, a Corporal with the Indian Air Force, expressed confidence that the government will walk the talk on its announcement on alternate shelter, while reiterating that anti-social elements are deterred Sartaj's father Iqlakh was beaten to death and his 22-year-old brother Danish was critically injured by a 200-strong mob which barged into their house following rumours that the family had consumed beef.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:20:41.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
