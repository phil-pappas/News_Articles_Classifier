Especially if they have paid their dues. Of course New Zealanders are consistent, we don’t do forgiveness very well.” \nAll the women leaders are issuing the invitation on behalf of the National Urban Maori Authority and will support Chris Brown’s application to come into New Zealand. \nMerepeka says “We will welcome him to our marae and then we expect him to address our youth about his past indiscretions and what he has learnt about life. We are very much looking forward to him coming into the country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:14:09.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
