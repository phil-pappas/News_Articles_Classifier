Religious violence in the devastated Syrian nation is on the rise, as clerics in Saudi Arabia called Sunni Muslims all around Middle East to support a “holy war” against Shia Muslims and Christians in Syria.\nBefore the war, Syria was one of the few nations in Middle East in which religious tolerance was evident. The constitution of the country, guaranteed freedom of religion, but some Sunni Muslims and Jews in Syria, complained for discrimination against them. According to Faithstresst.com, Syria was the home to ancient Christian communities, a variety of Muslim sects, and several indigenous and heterodox religions, and the nation’s culture has always been more heterogeneous than Arab lands in the Gulf and North Africa.\nHowever, the five-year war, is fueling sectarianism and the atrocities by the Sunni Muslims fundamentalists of the Islamic State (IS,) are shattering the Syrian culture. Yesterday senior United Nations human rights officials expressed their alarm as influential religious leaders, outside IS, are also calling for holy war.\nThe UN Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, Jennifer Welsh, condemned the recent call by clerics in Saudi Arabia for Sunni Muslims and their States to support a “holy war” against Shia Muslims and Christians in Syria, as well as against States and non-State armed groups perceived to support them.\n“Such rhetoric can aggravate the already extremely volatile situation in Syria by drawing religiously motivated fighters to join all parties to the conflict, thus escalating the risk of violence against religious communities,” said the Advisers in a statement, adding that “advocacy of religious hatred to incite or justify violence is not only morally wrong, but also prohibited under international law.”\nDieng and Welsh also expressed concern at reports that Russian Orthodox clerics had referred to the Russian participation in the conflict in Syria as a “holy battle” against terrorism, as “statements of this kind can be manipulated, feed suspicion and increase polarization of communities.”\nThe Special Advisers also noted the response by Russian authorities, who reportedly denied that there was any religious connotation to their involvement in Syria.\nThey praised the organization Syrian Christians for Peace for rejecting the concept of a Christian “holy war” and condemning those who invoke it.\nThe Special Advisers called on States to dissociate themselves from and condemn any form of advocacy of religious hatred, promote dialogue and protect and empower all those religious figures and human rights defenders who are working towards enhancing interreligious respect and harmony.\nThe officials also called on religious leaders around the world to refrain from any form of advocacy of religious hatred and incitement to violence, and to counter any use of such rhetoric, emphasizing that “religious leaders should be messengers of peace, not of war.”\n“In situations in which tensions are high, as in Syria, religious leaders should call for and foster restraint and dialogue, rather than fanning the flames of hatred,” they cautioned.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:50:59.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
