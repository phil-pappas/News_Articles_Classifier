(Picture Courtesy: File photo) Most of us have come about to hold certain ideas about food because of things we here from people or have even read somewhere. However, most of these so-called health tips or facts are not true at all. So, we bring to you eight of the most popular food myths that are dispelled by nutritionists themselves, according to the Daily Mail .\n1) All carbohydrates will make you fat: On the contrary, there is nothing fattening about complex carbs with a low GI, such as oats, wholegrain rice or wholemeal pasta. They contain just four calories per gram (which is the same as protein). So, thereâ€™s no reason why you should avoid all carbs from your diet.\n2) Eating after 7pm is not good: Although metabolism does slow down as you sleep, it sill continues to digest any food in the gut. What determines fatty deposits in your body is the excess amount of calories you eat during the day against those you use up by keeping physically active.\n3) Bread can cause bloating: Research shows that wheat sensitivity and allergy is actually not that common. Other factors that might be responsible for bloating are IBS, skipping meals, constipation, a lack of good bacteria and foods rich in fermentable carbohydrates, for example, onions, artichokes and leeks.\n4) Small frequent meals keep you slim: It is regular exercise will keep your metabolism active. Snacking is just a ploy of dieters to avoid hunger pangs and can even lead to over-eating.\n5) Dairy foods are necessary for your calcium intake: Although dairy foods are a rich source of calcium, other foods like dark green vegetables, almonds, tofu, fortified plant mils and ground spices are also rich in this mineral.\n6) Foods with high cholesterol content such as eggs increase heart risk: Foods naturally high in cholesterol have a very little impact on levels in the blood. Only those with diabetes or high cholesterol levels should limit eating them to three times across the week.\n7) Raw foods are essential for healthy digestion: Raw foods may high on nutritional value but all that talk about beneficial enzymes by raw foodies does not add up as these are necessary for plant survival and not essential for human health.\n8) Saturated fat in your diet can lead to high cholesterol and heart disease: Firstly, not all cholesterol is bad and even has many important functions in the body. Also, your body produces more cholesterol than you eat and controls levels in an efficiently managed process.\n fats vegetables diet food myths popular food myths food myths busted Also Read The onion rot Fiber-rich diet helps cut heart disease risk Vegan diet is not enough for newborns, say experts Christmas calories", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/lifestyle-food/article/eight-popular-food-myths-busted-experts", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/food-865102_640_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/food-865102_640_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:08:49.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
