The commission shouldn’t,” FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel said. \nSEE ALSO: House votes to block sanctions relief until Iran pays its U.S. victims of terrorism \nShe pointed to a case where a foreign national who operated adult-oriented websites had contributed to a 2012 ballot measure in Los Angeles that mandated pornography film actors wear condoms. \nBut the commission’s three Republican members said even if they wanted to crack down, the FEC doesn’t have jurisdiction to do so, because the law only allows it to regulate elections. \nCommissioner Lee Goodman read the definition of “election” aloud, and said ballot initiatives just don’t qualify. \n“The term election means A, a general special primary or runoff election; B, a convention or caucus of a political party which has authority to nominate a candidate; C, a primary election held for the selection of delegates to a national nominating convention of a political party; and D, a primary election held for the expression of a preference for the nomination of individuals for election to the Office of President,” Mr. Goodman said. “Period. End. That’s the end of our definition.” \nHe added, “I don’t know how you get referendum in here.” \nRepublicans said it’s up to Congress to give new guidance if it wants to crack down on initiatives. \n“I am not at all opposed to the concerns that you have and the red flag that you have raised about foreign influence in state and local ballot initiatives,” Vice Chairman Matthew Peterson told Ms. Ravel. “This comes down to what can I as a commissioner do? And at this point I think that this is in Congress’ court.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:20:02.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
