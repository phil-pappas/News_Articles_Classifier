It builds on initiatives like the Statute Repeal Bill announced last week,\" Mr Finlayson said. \nThe Bill makes some very minor amendments to the law, as permitted under the statutory revision powers, which are clearly identified for comment. \nThe exposure draft of the Bill and information about how to make a submission are available at www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/consultation-cclb. \nSubmissions close on 7 December 2015. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:26:00.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
