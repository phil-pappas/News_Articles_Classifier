The lacquer cups on the table were a gift from the Japanese ambassador.\nOther innovations in the office include a standing desk for Mr Turnbull to do computer and iPad work (which is fairly trendy but not as trendy as those treadmill desks some active types are keen on).\nAs with other PMs, the bookshelves behind the PM's desk are full of bound copies of parliamentary acts. But Mr Turnbull has also included a diverse selection of books from his Canberra foreshore apartment and former ministerial office.\nThey include John Howard's The Menzies Era (a must-read for any Liberal PM) and former Labor cabinet minister Neal Blewett's account of the first Keating government, A Cabinet Diary . There's also Michelle Grattan's Australian Prime Ministers .\nBut it's not all Australian politics.\nThere are books about Nelson Mandela, British leaders, Napoleon and Canberra's engineering heritage (the second edition). Other topics covered include Australian intelligence agencies, art history, philosophy, gardens in Kyoto as well as several books on China.\nMr Turnbull hasn't forgotten publications closer to home either, with wife Lucy's book on Sydney prominently displayed as well as several on the famous Spycatcher case he worked on in the 1980s. Yes, this includes his own book on the subject, The Spycatcher Trial .\nAlso decking out the office shelves are multiple photos of the Turnbull family. One picture shows a shoeless Mr Turnbull drinking Italian beer and snuggling his grandson, Jack.\nThe walls are adorned with sections of Australian artist Tony Clark's work Clark's Myriorama from the Parliament House art collection, a painting by Mr Turnbull's grandmother (who he suspects might have had some help from William Dobell) and a John Olsen from Mr Turnbull's personal collection.\nAnother family touch is a gift from Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer via the Bank of NSW archives. It is a framed board minute approving the loan for a property bought by Turnbull relative John Turnbull in 1817.\nOn the PM's desk (the sit-down one), there is an inkwell from his wife. This was a gift on their most recent (35th) wedding anniversary.\nTONY ABBOTT\nTony Abbott's office had a sportier influence. Along with some Indigenous art, there was an Aussie Rules football, an Australian cricket team cap as well as a cap for the Great Western Sydney Giants.\nThe headwear theme continued with Akubra hats. He also had a photo of himself and his mother, Fay and a portrait of Robert Menzies.\nA model Linfox truck (from Lindsay Fox's logistics company) also took pride of place on the shelves.\nJULIA GILLARD\nMs Gillard had an eclectic mix on her bookshelves.\nThese included a Sherrin footy (celebrating 150 years of AFL) and a smattering of books, including a dictionary/thesaurus and Australian literature reference.\nShe had a photo of herself and first bloke Tim Mathieson and another snap with pal Hillary Clinton.\nMs Gillard also had some special footy boots that adidas gave her, labelled \"PM\" and \"Gillard\". On the walls were two water scenes by Arthur Streeton.\nKEVIN RUDD\nFirst-time around, Mr Rudd also had the Streeton paintings as well as a giant map of the world above a separate desk for reading newspapers.\nThe bookshelves were mostly filled with books - and not very tidy ones either.\nWho has time for tidy books when you're governing in the midst of the GFC?\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax?lang=en", "http://smh.com.au/interactive/2015/turnbull-office/index.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/k/i/i/d/1/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1445825437823.png", "http://smh.com.au/interactive/libraries/PEZ.common/iframeResizer.min.js", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spycatcher", "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/k/g/i/c/h/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1445584984547.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/k/i/i/c/k/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1445825364138.png", "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/k/g/k/w/6/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1445559275666.png"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:24:59.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
