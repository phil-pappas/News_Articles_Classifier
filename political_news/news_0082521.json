A report out today from the Interior Department watchdog confirms that Biden, departing Education Secretary Arne Duncan, and former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson all enjoyed vacations at the National Park Service's Brinkerhoff Lodge in the Wyoming park, and all avoided paying for months, if not years.\nUnder a National Parks Service policy set in 1992, the lodge is only available to federal employees on official visits. But the Inspector General says that policy has been loosened, and the Park Service created a one-hour briefing for visitors about the park that rendered any visit official.\nLaunched after Time magazine inquired about unpaid use of the lodge last fall, the IG's report covers a four-year period, from 2011 through 2014. It documented 222 stays in that period, 186 of which went unpaid.\nWithin 10 days of the story appearing in Time last October, several current and former Obama administration officials, including Jackson, Biden, Duncan, and Deputy Interior Secretary Michael Connor all paid up. All four also received short presentation on the park to justify their visits.\nFormer Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood listed multiple official reasons for his stay, but he and six guests stayed for nine nights, and the IG listed his visit as a vacation. LaHood was not on the list of people who paid their visit.\nThe IG details how much each occupant paid, and the cost of a stay varied widely. Phil Schiliro, assistant to the president and special adviser, paid $178 a night for three nights for his two guests in 2011. Biden hosted 12 people for four nights in August 2014 and paid $300 a night. Neither paid until November.\nBiden reached out to the National Park in June to find out the cost of his stay, according to his office, and he was told the cost would be the government per diem rate. He eventually paid the per diem cost plus $10 per night per guest.\n\"Billing rarely occurs,\" the IG wrote. \"Even if the Park billed every guest, the amount charged would not cover the cost of operating the Lodge.\"\nThe failure to collect cost the Parks Service $28,875, the IG said. It also noted that the Service altered its description of the property after the press attention grew.\n\"The Lodge’s use was once described in Wikipedia as a vacation home. The page, however, was edited following the increased media coverage and public awareness surrounding the Lodge’s use. The Park’s public affairs officer instructed a staff member to change the Wikipedia page after NPS’ Public Affairs Office in Washington suggested that the page be changed to reflect the Lodge’s current use.\"\nIn response to the report, the Park Service said it would develop new operating procedures to better collect on rental fees and to ensure that the lodge was only used work related to the park.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000150-48d6-dcc0-ad7e-d8de97a00001", "http://time.com/3544052/brinkerhoff-biden-cheap-vacations-log-cabin/"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:16:46.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
