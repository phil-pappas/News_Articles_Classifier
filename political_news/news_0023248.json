He also had atresia of pulmonary valve, which meant that no blood flow was going to his lung from the heart for oxygenation. This life-threatening abnormality was detected by the doctors at Apollo Hospitals when the baby was still in the womb through a fetal echocardiography, they said.\n\"Initially, the team put him on ventilator support soon after birth and hoped to manage him medically for a few months before the surgery could be planned. The surgery was especially challenging because of his deteriorating condition, tiny baby size, small size of the heart (no bigger than an adult thumb) and organs,\" said Dr Girish Warrier, who led the team in performing the surgery.\nAfter a detailed consultation with the family, the team decided to go ahead with surgery on September 14, since without surgery, the child would not have survived, they said.\nThe child had to be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass as preparatory to working inside the heart. Being only 1.2 Kg at birth and 11 days at the time of surgery, specially designed circuitry had to be used to place the child on bypass, the doctors said.\n\"Thereafter a shunt was created to provide reliable source of blood supply to the lungs for purification. The child tolerated the procedure well and was taken off the bypass machine and then shifted to the intensive care unit. He gradually recovered from the surgery and was shifted to the ward on the 14th post-operative day,\" they said adding that additional challenges to his surgery were nutrition and infection control, but he is now recovering well.\nStates: Telangana Cardiac surgery Hyderabad South Also Read CM N Chandrababu Naidu to unveil land package today Hyderabad girl fights racism in Russia MLC elections to be on June 1 Hyderabad: Aadhaar fails to check fraud in tech colleges", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/baby_22.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/baby_22.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/rare-cardiac-surgery-performed-prematurely-born-baby-hyderabad", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:01:05.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
