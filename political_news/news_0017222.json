With membership, these companies join a group of committed contributors and technology industry leaders including Adobe Systems Incorporated, EMC Corporation, Intel Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, SAP AG, Siemens AG, CA Technologies and Symantec Corporation.\nAs SAFECode continues to focus on its mission of identifying and promoting proven methods of secure software development, the addition of these four companies signifies a major step forward in pursuit of the organization's goals. They join existing members in their effort to bring together technology industry experts with real-world experience in managing complex global processes for software development to foster a trusted exchange of insights on software security; encourage broad industry adoption of proven software security practices; and drive clarity into vendor software assurance practices to empower customers to better manage risk.\nExecutive Quote: s\nHoward Schmidt , Executive Director, SAFECode\n\"SAFECode's decision to greatly expand its membership underscores the commitment to an open and inclusive industry dialog, and broadly collaborative effort. The addition of Boeing, Cigital, Security Compass and VMware to the list of SAFECode's associate members further strengthens SAFECode's depth of expertise in software assurance. With each new member another layer of proven practices and lessons learned is added to our arsenal of secure software development methods that we can turn around and share with the greater development community. With security threats making headlines every day, it has become a top priority for business and government leaders alike to create secure infrastructures; at SAFECode our mission is to foster a dialogue on software assurance, and ensure that our technical efforts have the most positive impact possible on the security challenges we all face.\"\nJohn Martin , Information Security Program Manager, Boeing\n\"Whether protecting intellectual property or critical infrastructure, the trust, security and reliability of the software ecosystem are a global concern and responsibility. As the world's largest aerospace company, Boeing is a massive consumer and proving ground for software integration and interdependencies â€“ as well as a case study in its complexities. This is why Boeing is influencing and promoting the best in secure software practices and fostering a stronger security community as a new member of SAFECode.\"\nCaroline Wong , Director of Security Initiatives, Cigital\n\"Cigital, one of the world's largest application security firms, wants to educate the industry about software assurance best practices. As a part of the SAFECode network of assurance practitioners, we hope to actively promote the idea that effective software security goes beyond traditional testing. Our decades of experience have shown that an effective initiative requires a holistic approach that combines many activities, requiring people, process, and automation. Enterprises frequently focus on repairing damage post-breach and fixing bugs after launch. Cigital encourages greater attention to security in the earlier stages of software development. We look forward to helping SAFECode continue to build its body of work and contribute to advancing the art of software assurance.\"\nVishal Asthana , Director - India Operations, Security Compass\n\"Like SAFECode, a prescriptive approach towards software security is Security Compass's core philosophy. By joining SAFECode, we would like to continue to support the cause, at a cross-organizational level. We will be doing so by means of active participation in the body's initiatives, proposing new ones and sharing our experiences while helping clients (many in the Fortune 500 list) with their AppSec needs.\"\nIain Mulholland , Vice President Central Engineering, VMware\n\"Becoming a part of this community of thought leaders and applying the principles developed therein will facilitate VMware's goal of providing more transparency in our software assurance processes and practices to help customers and other key stakeholders manage risk effectively. The exchange of cutting-edge security strategies and insights within the forum can also improve industry-wide agility in dealing with the evolving threat landscape, positively impacting the security and reliability of the technology ecosystem. VMware's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is heavily influenced by SAFECode, and we look forward to continuing to contribute to and draw from the software assurance guidance promoted by SAFECode.\"\nAdditional Resources\nLearn about joining SAFECode .
