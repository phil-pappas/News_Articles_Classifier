Start Quiz View this week's leaderboard \nWelcome to the MinnPost Quiz. \nEach week, quizmaster Andrew Minck will test your knowledge of Minnesota-centric current events with a dozen multiple-choice questions. Topics are likely to vary (a lot), but it shouldn't be too hard if you're a regular MinnPost reader: Answers will be taken from items that have appeared on the site during the previous week or so. \nOnce you’ve finished, you’ll be able to see how your score compares to the average result. And if you’re a MinnPost member, you'll be eligible for the MinnPost Quiz Leader Board, which will list the top 25 scores for that week’s quiz. \nEnjoy.
