She said that the murder was nothing but an honour killing. \nRejecting her plea, the court observed on 9 October that “It is a murder and not heinous. What the accused did is condemnable, but does not call for the death penalty.” \nAfter the court’s order, Neelam said she would continue to “fight for justice”. “I respect the court’s decision. We will come prepared with more facts next time. This fight shall continue,” she said. \nNitish was 25 when he was burnt to death in Ghaziabad, near Delhi . He was dating Bharti Yadav, daughter of politician DP Yadav . The young couple was attending a wedding party when Nitish was abducted and set on fire by Bharti’s brother Vikas and her cousin Vishal. \nHis corpse found near a highway and the police had to use his DNA samples to identify his body.
