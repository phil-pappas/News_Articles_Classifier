Lindsey Graham had a fairly cutting assessment Friday for why Ben Carson is doing so well in polls and other Republicans are doing so poorly.\n\"He's a lovely man, he's a great doctor. And everybody else thinks we suck,\" Graham said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday. \"So that's all, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I can't understand what he's saying half the time. You know, he's a brilliant guy, but I don't think he has a clue about what's going on in the Middle East. So what can I tell you?\"\nGraham, who has been trailing at the back of the Republican field since he entered the race, also offered a blunt assessment of his own chances. If he does poorly in New Hampshire, he said, he might not make it to his own, home state primary.\n\"If I do well in New Hampshire, I'll win South Carolina. If I don't do well in New Hampshire, I'll have to reevaluate,\" Graham said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:25:19.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
