According to the Kremlin, the strikes are aimed at weakening the Daesh militant group, an avowed enemy of the regime.\nTurkey and several western countries, however, accuse Russia of targeting moderate groups in Syria opposed to Assad, many of which enjoy the support of Ankara and Washington.\nIraq has been gripped by a security vacuum since June 2014 when Daesh stormed the northern city of Mosul and declared a self-styled caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.\nSeveral foreign ministers open talks over Syria conflict in Vienna\nRussia’s FM: Syria crisis cannot be resolved by war or coup\nKerry, Lavrov hammer out plans for Syria while meeting in Vienna\nLavrov: Only Syrian people can decide fate of President Assad\nKerry vs Putin vs Federica Mogherini. What is Assad role in Syria future?\nHezbollah chief blames US hegemonism for all wars in Middle East\nThe Empire of Chaos is in a Jam\nBy Pepe Escobar\nThe no-fly zone in Syria already exists. It is run by Russia and Washington is unable to jam it.\nNATO is desperate. The Pentagon is desperate. Imagine waking up one day in Washington and Brussels just to realize Russia has the ability to electronically jam — detect, trace, disable, destroy — NATO electronics within a 600 km range across Syria (and southern Turkey).\nImagine the nightmare of row after row of Russian Richag-AV radar and sonar jamming systems mounted on helicopters and ships jamming everything in sight and finding every available source of electromagnetic radiation. Not only in Syria but also in Ukraine.\nLt. Gen. Ben Hodges, commander of U.S. Army units in Europe, was even forced to qualify Russian electronic warfare capabilities in Ukraine as “ eye-watering .”\nFor their part, caught in the crossfire as sitting ducks or headless chickens, that mighty ideological aircraft carrier known as the USS Think Tankland was left dabbling with the four options left for Washington to “achieve its goals” in Syria.\nThe first option is containment — which is exactly what the Obama administration has been doing. The recipe was proposed in full by the Brookings Institution ; “containing their activities within failed or near-failing states is the best option for the foreseeable future.”\nBut that, Think Tankland argues, would “crush the popular opposition” in Syria. There is no “popular opposition” in Syria; it’s either the government in Damascus or a future under the ISIS/ISIL/Daesh Salafi-jihadi goons.\nThe second option is the favorite among US neocons and neoliberalcons; to weaponize the already weaponized opposition. This opposition ranges from the YPG Kurds — who actually fight on the ground against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh — to Jabhat al-Nusra, a.k.a. al-Qaeda in Syria and its Salafi-jihadi cohorts. Al-Nusra of course has been rebranded in the Beltway as “moderate rebels”; so this option means in practice the House of Saud weaponizing al-Qaeda while they fight under the cover of US air strikes.\nPure Ionesco-style theatre of the absurd. Compounded by the fact those apocalyptic nut jobs who pass as “clerics” in Saudi Arabia, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, have duly declared jihad against Russia .\nThe third option will go nowhere; Washington allying with “Assad just go” and Iran — not to mention Russia — in a real fight-to-the-finish against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. Obama boxed himself in a long time ago with “Assad must go”, so he remains immobilized by a self-inflicted ippon.\nThe fourth option is the neocon wet dream; regime change, achieved, in theory, by what I call the Coalition of the Dodgy Opportunists (CDO), as in the NATO-GCC embrace, with a Turkish starring role and attached US air strikes, plus all those thousands of CIA-trained “moderate rebels” slouching all the way to Damascus. As if the Russian campaign did not exist.\nIn fact, for US corporate media, it’s as if the overwhelming Russian massacre — and not “containment” — of “Caliphate” assets these past three weeks is not happening at all. Hubris has metamorphosed into huge embarrassment and finally into total omission.\nThe Obama administration’s “Assad must go” diktat has also metamorphosed into a wacky version of a non-denial denial. It’s plain obvious now that the Russia air campaign, way beyond ISIS/ISIL/Daesh, has destroyed the whole imperial game across “Syraq”; that same old mix of regime change, Balkanization, creating and keeping failed states, “isolating” Russia.\nMoreover, and contrary to all the current rehash of Afghan mythology — where, incidentally, the Taliban continue to win in America’s Longest War — Syria won’t be a revisited USSR quagmire. On the contrary; while in Afghanistan in the 1980s the proverbial imperial game of using Salafi-jihadis against a secular government worked, as it worked in NATO turning Libya into a failed state, now Moscow reverse-engineered the process, smashing the Salafi-jihadis on the ground in conjunction with secular governments. It’s our (bombing) way or the highway\nWhich bring us to Iraq.\nNext week, Iraq’s parliament will vote on whether to request Russian air strikes against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. Mowaffak al-Rubaie, former national security adviser to former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, is convinced the vote will pass — even facing Sunni and somewhat Kurdish opposition.\nA measure of Washington’s alarm is that the new chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford was forced to fly to Baghdad to make sure this won’t happen. In his own words, the Pentagon was consumed by “angst” when Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi evoked the vote.\n“Angst” is bound to persist. This is all about imperial spheres of influence. A “yes” vote, on the ground, means the Russian Air Force working in tandem with ground intel collected by Shi’ite militias such as the Badr Corps and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haqq to smash all fake “Caliphate” positions. And geopolitically, a “yes” vote signifies the ultimate humiliation — after all those elaborate multi-trillion dollar plans for the “Greater Middle East” which Shock and Awe in 2003 should have set in motion.\nThe USS Think Tankland’s prescription for all the trouble in Syria is to beef up NATO, as in “send aid of all kinds” to “protect” poor Turkey.\nSultan Erdogan is possibly about to profit from a Chancellor Merkel-engineered 3 billion euro plan to “encourage” Ankara to keep on Turkish soil potential Syrian migrants bent on a peaceful invasion of the European Union. Thus the Sultan will have paved the way for being finally “accepted”, in the long run, as a EU member.\nThe problem is Sultan Erdogan not only supports ISIS/ISIL/Daesh as a regime change tool, but he also has renewed his war against PKK Kurds, which are allied with YPG Kurds, which are objectively allied with Washington.\nEven that configuration does not prevent the USS Think Tankland from advising the creation of a NATO-enforced no-fly zone along the Turkish-Syria border, supported by American, Turkish, British and French troops.\nBeltway, now we do have a problem. This no-fly zone is already in effect. And it’s run by Russia. And you won’t be able to jam it.\nA quick final recap: the Empire of Chaos destroys Iraq; creates the conditions for the emergence of a Salafi-jihadi constellation, from al-Qaeda in Iraq to its Frankenstein, ISIS/ISIL/Daesh; does not get the oil (remember Wolfowitz’s “We’re the new OPEC”?); tries to destroy Syria for four years, unsuccessfully; and in the end Russia reinstates its Middle East sphere of influence as the real power fighting Salafi-jihadism across “Syraq”.\nIf this is what passes for imperial planning, the Empire of Chaos certainly does not need enemies.\nMedia Believes Baseless Claim Putin is Bombing Hospitals\nStuartJHooper\nhttp://21stcenturywire.com/2015/10/23/i-think-it-was-russian-media-believes-baseless-claim-putin-is-bombing-civilians/\nRussian Air Force cuts off ISIS supply lines by bombing bridge over Euphrates in Syria\nRussian thermobaric TOS-1 MLRS rockets provided to Syrian army raining down on terrorists’ positions\nSyrian army makes gains against militants in Aleppo\nSyria, Aleppo – Syrian Army Abu Daher Falcons Inside Blas Village Southern Aleppo.\nSyria, Homs, Syrian Arab Army at Ter Maela\nRussian MI-24 Hind Helicopters In Action Over Ter Maela\nSyria: SAA/NDF Operations in Latakia: TOS-1A MRLS Barrage\nQuneitra, Syrian Army Recapture 4th Battalion Base north of Tell Ahmar this Morning.\nDrone footage reveals devastation in suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus\nSyria Dzhobar tough day for 3 tankers\nSome 84 Terrorists Give up Fight, Surrender to Syrian Authorities in Homs\nURGENT: Two Other IRGC Members Killed in Syria\nThree Senior Al-Qaeda Commanders Killed in Bomb Explosion in Syria’s Idlib\nSyrian Forces Advancing in Several Fronts in East Aleppo towards Kuweires Airbase\nIraq, Russia Agree to Hit ISIL Militants Heading from Syria to Iraq\nHead of the Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Commission Hakem al-Zameli said that Baghdad and Moscow have agreed to hit ISIL militants heading from Syria to Iraq.\nIn a statement released on Friday, Zameli said that the joint data center between Iraq, Syria and Russia was still in its initial stage, noting that however, it has offered important intelligence information which helped end the battle in Beiji.\nHe further added that Syria offered important information about the position of ISIL terrorists.\n“Iraq agreed with Russia, which leads the joint data center, to hit the ISIL militants heading from Syria to Iraq,” Zameli said, pointing out that this move would weaken the ISIL militants as it will cut off supply routes of the Takfiri insurgents.\nSyrian Army Wins Back Two More Villages Southwest of Aleppo\nSyrian Army Seizes FSA Military Base in Golan Heights in Quneitra\nThe Syrian Armed Forces on Saturday morning stormed the 4th Battalion Base of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) in the Golan Heights and took full control over the base after fierce clashes with the FSA militants.\nAt sunrise on Saturday morning, the Syrian Army’s 90th Brigade of the 9th Armored Division, in coordination with Fouj Al-Joulani (Golan Regiment) and Liwaa Suqour Al-Quneitra (Al-Quneitra Hawks Brigade) of the National Defense Forces (NDF), launched a counter-assault at the 4th Battalion Base outside of the town of Taranjah, resulting in a series of intense firefights with the Free Syrian Army’s Southern Front Brigades.\nThe FSA has now lost all of their previous gains from the September offensive that put them in position to attack the Syrian government strongholds of Khan Arnabeh and Hadar inside the Golan Heights of the Quneitra province.\nThe Syrian Arab Army’s 90th Brigade and the National Defense Forces were able to impose full control over the 4th Battalion Base after they overran the Free Syrian Army’s defensive positions; this forced the aforementioned militants to withdraw to Tal Taranjah in order to regroup after their frontlines crumbled at the base.\nAccording to a military source from the town of Hadar, the FSA militants have conducted a counter-assault since losing the 4th Battalion Base; however, they have yet to regain any territory lost to the Syrian Armed Forces this morning.\nSyrian Bombers Pound ISIL Hideouts, Convoys in Hama Province\nSyrian Forces Recapture Key Areas in Quneitra Countryside", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcSGVi1uPNc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ldq2jDLLpA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBbcPmN7iGk", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000125", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000211", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/QC7mXAZDUsk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/phV01WlUirQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//blogspot/https://www.rt.com/news/317831-saudi-clerics-jihad-syria-russia/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SeUpFmklrc", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000056", "http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/10/23/i-think-it-was-russian-media-believes-baseless-claim-putin-is-bombing-civilians/", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000247", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbmQGJdNHrY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhnLz-OyZUE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MawR4Su9_Js", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000172", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2O-g42eIdw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nswyVeKuHog", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sF-BNbtof_U", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/POLlIj5cZ-I", "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/11/07-big-questions-islamic-state-threat-hein", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mm3sgbdfP6c", "http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article43238.htm", "http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article43239.htm", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/Pvv4SOupf5Q", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000094", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P3GKDYM32I", "http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/warfare/2015/08/02/us-army-ukraine-russia-electronic-warfare/30913397/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTK1ghxL5fw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ek1f5oQ_UvA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncYqyggtv2Y", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000067", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dVkmTWWrR8", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000160", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kll3ztXotJs", "http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940802000146", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1QGoYdo0xiw"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:34:30.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
