He gave a list of requirements for the two members of the DP’s defence team to gain access to Parliament. \n“I have no objection meeting you and the defence team of William Ruto. Regarding your request for me to appear as a witness for the defence, I hereby confirm acceptance of the same. You may now feel free to list me as your witness,” he said. \nMr Kuria also informed Mr Ruto’s defence team that he has also been requested by ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s team for an interview on the claims he has made in prayer meetings for the DP which have been held in several parts of the country. \nMr Sang’s lawyer Katwa Kigen had, on the same dates, also written to Mr Kuria, requesting for an interview and the possibility of the Gatundu South MP accepting to testify as a defence witness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:18:40.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
