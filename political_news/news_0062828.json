Trudeau can easily say that. He can start talking about 2030.\"\nThe Liberal election platform committed to supporting provincial measures, \"including their own carbon pricing policies,\" but did not provide longer term targets. It also promised to hold a full first ministers meeting within 90 days of the Paris summit to develop \"a framework to combat climate change.\"\nThe Harper government attacked any talk of carbon pricing for years as a job-killing tax on everything but it leaves office amid what appears to be a global movement toward putting a price on carbon pollution.\nThis week the Canadian Chamber of Commerce announced that more than 98 per cent of delegates to its annual general meeting had agreed on a resolution to reduce emissions \"by using economic instruments, where the federal government is asked to work with the provinces to adopt a national carbon tax or cap and trade system to achieve a reduction in GHG by 2050.\"\nThe same day, a blue-chip international group that included the head of the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among others, issued a call for countries and companies around the world to price carbon.\n\"There has never been a global movement to put a price on carbon at this level and with this degree of unison,\" World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim said in a release.\nThere are clearly some reservations remaining among Canada's premiers.\n\"We want to make sure that whatever Canada is committing to doesn't kneecap our economy in the West,\" Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said this week.\n\"We think what we've seen so far from Mr. Trudeau, there are not a lot of details, but so far his commitment that each province would be able to reach the national (emissions) targets on their own, using their own sort of equivalency, that's positive. But I think the details are important -- we want to protect Saskatchewan's interests.\"\nQuebec already has an active cap-and-trade market with California that Ontario recently agreed to join, and British Columbia has had a provincial carbon tax for years.\nJaccard said it should be relatively easy for a federal Liberal government to induce Atlantic Canada and Manitoba to join the cap-and-trade market, but that it will take longer to incorporate B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan into such a scheme.\n\"We don't need a premiers conference,\" Jaccard suggested. \"It really is going to be the federal government negotiating one-on-one or with groups of provinces.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:38:43.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
