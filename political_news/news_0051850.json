Now she's on the October cover of T magazine and another writer has fallen in love.\nThe interview was performed by artist and writer Miranda July , and she surmises that something special has happened between the two. July takes an hour-and-a-half Uber to Malibu, falls deeply in love with Rihanna, then takes an hour-and-a-half Uber back to Los Angeles. It is an Uber-love sandwich. \"My understanding, from the moment she sat down, was that we were in love,\" July writes. \"We were the most in love any two people had ever been. The sun was finally setting. We’d been talking for almost two hours.\"\nIn the midst of all the loving, July asks Rihanna about everything from her experience as a powerful young black woman to what turns her on (\"I’m turned on by guys who are cultured. That’ll keep me intrigued\"), but would it surprise you to hear what Rihanna has been Googling lately?\n‘‘Childbirth is putting it the not-gross way. I was searching the size of certain things, and how much they expand, and then what happens after ...’’\nNothing abnormal about that. And thankfully July puts her at ease: \"It's gonna be fine.\" But Rihanna wants to Google it anyway: ‘‘‘Phobia of a big vagina.’ ... ‘Deep.’ ... This is awful. I can’t believe I’m typing this in.’’ And that's how a Rihanna interview is done.\nVanity Fair , T magazine — who's got next?", "external_links": ["http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/rihanna-anti-album-cover.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/t-magazine/rihanna-miranda-july-interview.html?_r=0", "http://www.mirandajuly.com/"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:37:18.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
