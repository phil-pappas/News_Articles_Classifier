For two years now, we have experienced tears of joy when we present the checks to the winning organizations. This year, adopters throughout the country have the power to make this happen and can share in the experience with us.\"\nIn 2014, the Petco Foundation and Halo, Purely for Pets partnered to provide half a million dollars of grant funding for 33 Holiday Wishes winners, including $100,000 for grand prize recipient Animal Alliance of New Jersey in Lambertville, N.J.

This campaign is a fun and exciting way to reward the important lifesaving work being done throughout the country and shine a light on the joys of pet adoption,\" said Halo CEO Steve Marton .\nAdopters can submit their stories to the Petco Foundation's Holiday Wishes grant campaign from October 1-31 – including photos. The Petco Foundation encourages adopters to submit their stories early in the process as it can only guarantee that the first 10,000 will be fully reviewed.
