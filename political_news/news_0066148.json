In October, much of that candy ends up on the teeth of the 41 million trick-or-treating children ages 5 – 14 across the U.S. 1 However, the AAPD wants parents to know that when it comes to keeping children's teeth healthy, not all treats are created equal.\n\"The longer teeth are exposed to sugars, the longer cavity-causing bacteria have to feed on them. Instead of gummy, sticky candy, offer children candy that melts and disappears quickly – like chocolate,\" suggests AAPD President Dr. Robert Delarosa . \"And always make sure children brush and floss their teeth before going to bed.\"\nAdditional Halloween insights and tips from AAPD include:\nGummies, caramel, sour candies and bubble gum have the potential to dislodge fillings, crowns, space maintainers and orthodontic appliances. Hidden sugars such as glucose, fructose and honey that appear in foods such as cereal bars, flavored yogurts, fruit bars, pureed fruit pouches and juices can be just as destructive on children's teeth. Not only is bottled water environmentally unfriendly, it also lacks fluoride. Decorate a Halloween -themed reusable water bottle and have children fill it with water from the tap. Before trick-or-treating, ensure children eat a well-balanced meal to reduce chances they will fill up on empty calories and sugar.
