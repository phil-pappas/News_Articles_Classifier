In fact, I would venture to say that the Nazification of the United States is pretty much complete. As you will see below, we have a heavily socialized economy where tax rates are out of control and lots of freebies are given out just like the Nazis did. And just like the Nazis, our society has become highly militarized and our government has become increasingly obsessed with watching, tracking, monitoring and controlling the general population. But more than anything else, all of the pageantry and beauty in our society masks an evil which has grown to a level that is almost unspeakable. The other day, my wife and I were watching some footage of the beautiful parades and celebrations that were held in Germany before World War II, and they certainly were very impressive. But under the surface, a great evil was growing. Just because something happens behind closed doors does not make it okay, and just like the Nazis, our society is about to learn an exceedingly painful lesson in that regard.\nLet’s start out by talking about the economy. Most people tend to regard the Nazis as “far right”, but the truth is that they were socialists. By heavily taxing and spending, the Nazis were able to temporarily restore economic prosperity after the great economic crisis that occurred under the Weimar Republic, and this helped fuel their wild popularity. The following comes from Wikipedia …\nIn the midst of the Great Depression , the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy . Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahns (high speed highways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime’s popularity.\nJust like the Democrats of today, most people don’t consider the Nazis to have been socialists, but that is precisely what they were. I think that former game show host Chuck Woolery nailed it with some of his recent public statements …\nChuck Woolery, perhaps best known for being the host of the show “Love Connection” from 1982-94, also frequently takes to Twitter to express political viewpoints. In a recent series of tweets Woolery, 74, offered his opinion on politics, the size of government, and the political nature of the Nazi party:\n“Nazi is described as a right wing organization, Yet their were Socialists [sic]. They were left. But Chuck. But My BUTT.”\n“National Socialist German Workers’ Party. Nazi Party. Hitler. Need I go on?”\n“Maybe better. Democrats don’t value the country. They value the power of Government. There is a difference ya know.”\nI knew there was a reason why I always liked that guy.\nJust like Barack Obama and the Democrats, the Nazis loved to give out free stuff. Kitty Werthmann was a child in Austria at the time the Nazis took over, and her description of the freebies the Nazis were handing out sounds very much like what the Democrats want to do today…\nNewlyweds immediately received a $1,000 loan from the government to establish a household. We had big programs for families. All day care and education were free. High schools were taken over by the government and college tuition was subsidized. Everyone was entitled to free handouts, such as food stamps, clothing, and housing.\nI like free stuff too, but in the end someone always has to pay for all of that free stuff. According to Kitty Werthmann, “ our tax rates went up to 80% of our income “, and in America we are moving in the same direction.\nIn the United States today, when you add up all federal taxes, all state taxes, all local taxes, all property taxes and all sales taxes, there are some Americans that actually pay more than 50 percent of their incomes in taxes.\nSomehow we still have the audacity to claim that we are not socialists even though that is exactly what we have become.\nAnd the Germans had their own version of Obamacare too. The following is more eyewitness testimony from Kitty Werthmann …\nBefore Hitler, we had very good medical care. Many American doctors trained at the University of Vienna . After Hitler, health care was socialized, free for everyone. Doctors were salaried by the government. The problem was, since it was free, the people were going to the doctors for everything. When the good doctor arrived at his office at 8 a.m., 40 people were already waiting and, at the same time, the hospitals were full. If you needed elective surgery, you had to wait a year or two for your turn. There was no money for research as it was poured into socialized medicine. Research at the medical schools literally stopped, so the best doctors left Austria and emigrated to other countries.\nThere is no way that you can get around it. The Nazis were never on “the far right”. The were always leftists, and they always hated capitalism. National Socialist theologian Gregor Strasser once made the following statement …\nWe National Socialists are enemies, deadly enemies, of the present capitalist system with its exploitation of the economically weak … and we are resolved under all circumstances to destroy this system .\nNot even Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders would make such an extreme statement today.\nAnd like the Nazis, our society has become highly militarized.\nJust prior to World War II, the Germans probably had the most powerful military on the entire planet, and they loved to use that military to push other countries around. They stunned the entire world when they swept through Poland, and the lightning speed with which they defeated France changed the way war is waged forever.\nBut just like the leftists in our own nation, the Nazis definitely did not want the general population to be armed. Kitty Werthmann remembers very well what happened in Austria under the Nazis…\nNext came gun registration. People were getting injured by guns. Hitler said that the real way to catch criminals (we still had a few) was by matching serial numbers on guns. Most citizens were law abiding and dutifully marched to the police station to register their firearms. Not long after-wards, the police said that it was best for everyone to turn in their guns. The authorities already knew who had them, so it was futile not to comply voluntarily.\nAnd just like the leftists of today, the Germans were extremely suspicious of individual liberty and freedom. The secret police were everywhere, and anyone that was even suspected of anti-government activity was monitored very closely.\nSadly, we are becoming just like the Nazis in this regard, only now we have the technological capability to take things so much farther. Government control freaks are systematically watching us, tracking us, recording our phone calls and monitoring our emails . It has gotten so bad that even 64 percent of all reporters believe that the government is spying on them. We spy on our enemies, we spy on our friends (just ask the French and the Germans about this) and we even spy on the little old lady down the street.\nWe have been sold the lie that we have to give up our privacy and our liberty in exchange for security.\nIt is the same lie that the Nazis told.\nBut perhaps our greatest similarity to the Nazi regime of the 1930s is our lust for blood.\nWhat the Nazis did behind closed doors was so horrific that it is hard to even speak about it. Once the Holocaust was revealed, the world should have never allowed crimes against humanity like that to ever happen again.\nBut they are happening.\nThey are happening behind closed doors in America today, and most Americans are perfectly okay with this.\nIn this country, millions of babies are being systematically murdered and their organs are being harvested. Those organs are then sold off to the highest bidder and they are ultimately used in extremely bizarre scientific experiments.\nIn recent months these crimes have been put on display for all the world to see , and yet the American people have not responded with outrage. In fact, only 29 percent of Americans even want to cut off the hundreds of millions of dollars that Planned Parenthood is getting from the federal government every year.\nDo you know what that 29 percent figure tells me?\nIt tells me that America is done.\nAmerica is finished.\nAnd it turns out that Hitler was actually a huge fan of the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger. As I have written about previously , it was Sanger that once said the following…\n“The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.”\nHitler echoed this sentiment when he penned the following in Mein Kampf…\n“The demand that defective people be prevented from propagating equally defective offspring. . . represents the most humane act of mankind.”\nOf course those on the left are going to get very upset by all of this, and I am sure that some of them will leave some very nasty comments following this article.\nBut the truth is the truth.\nAnd it isn’t just Democrats – most Republicans in Congress are in the exact same boat too.\nIf we don’t want to be like the Nazis, we should stop acting like them, and that includes not pushing Christianity out of every area of public life. The following information was uncovered by author Bruce Walker , the author of “ The Swastika Against the Cross: The Nazi War on Christianity “…\nThe Nazi tract Gott und Volk was distributed in 1941, and it describes the life cycle of German youth in the future, who would: “With parties and gifts the youth will be led painlessly from one faith to the other and will grow up without ever having heard of the Sermon on the Mount or the Golden Rule, to say nothing of the Ten Commandments … The education of the youth is to be confined primarily by the teacher, the officer, and the leaders of the party. The priests will die out. They have estranged the youth from the Volk. Into their places will step the leaders. Not deputies of God. But anyway the best Germans. And how shall we train our children? Thus, as though they had never heard of Christianity! ”\nOur nation is falling apart because we have rejected the values and the principles that were handed down to us by our forefathers.\nWe have embraced the same lies that the Nazis embraced, and if we don’t turn around we will experience a similar fate.\nI think that the following excerpt from a recent RT editorial sums things up pretty well…\nThe United States is in decline. While not all major shocks to the system will be devastating, when the right one comes along, the outcome may be dramatic.\nNot all explosives are the same. We all know you have to be careful with dynamite. Best to handle it gently and not smoke while you’re around it.\nSemtex is different. You can drop it. You can throw it. You can put it in the fire. Nothing will happen. Nothing until you put the right detonator in it, that is.\nTo me, the US – and most of the supposedly free West – increasingly looks like a truck being systematically filled with Semtex.\nBut it’s easy to counter cries of alarm with the fact that the truck is stable – because it’s true: you can hurl more boxes into the back without any real danger. Absent the right detonator, it is no more dangerous than a truckload of mayonnaise.\nBut add the right detonator and you’re just one click away from complete devastation.\nAbsent a major crisis, the United States may be able to keep going down this same road for a few years more.\nBut I wouldn’t count on it.\nWe have willingly chosen to tear down and destroy everything that our forefathers built, and we were convinced that we had a better way.\nNow decades of incredibly foolish decisions are starting to catch up with us, and yet we still persist in our stubbornness.\nSo where do we go from here?\nWhat will the fate of America be?\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below…\nhttp://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/right-now-america-looks-a-lot-like-nazi-germany-just-prior-to-world-war-ii", "external_links": ["http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/64-percent-of-news-reporters-believe-that-obama-is-spying-on-them", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Big-Brother-Eye-Public-Domain-460x460.jpg", "http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/3861#When:08:07:00Z", "http://amzn.to/1Gdml5y", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/right-now-america-looks-a-lot-like-nazi-germany-just-prior-to-world-war-ii", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsautobahn", "http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2449983/posts", "http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2009/05/23/hitler-was-a-socialist/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "http://cnsnews.com/blog/mark-judge/chuck-woolery-nazis-were-socialists", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/30-years-later-america-truly-is-becoming-a-1984-society", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/america-is-done-only-29-percent-of-americans-want-to-cut-off-funding-for-planned-parenthood", "https://www.rt.com/op-edge/318986-america-bomb-society-crisis/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/19-facts-about-abortion-in-america-that-should-make-you-very-sick", "http://amzn.to/1khFdX5", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-most-evil-government-in-american-history"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:11:55.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
