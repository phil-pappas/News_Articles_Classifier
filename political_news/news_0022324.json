The budget amendment failed by a vote of 127 to 73. \nTo make it happen, the governor would have had to garner 18 GOP votes. The vote went down mostly on party lines. \nRepublican House Speaker Mike Turzai says that his party has no support from voters in home districts for tax increases. \n“This impasse has been about one thing and one thing only,” he said. “The governor's –and I'm going to use the term but it is accurate --massive tax increase plan…Pennsylvanians do not want it.” \nThe debate started around 10 a.m. by lawmakers in the Pennsylvania House and continued for hours. Before the vote, we talked with two York County legislators from different sides of the aisle with different views on the $1.8 billion proposal. \n“Ultimately we have a large structural deficit in this Commonwealth we need to address this deficit,” Keven Schreiber said. \n“If you want to help the middle-class, you don't tax the middle class,” Republican Seth Grover said. \nThe governor’s proposal would have increased the personal income tax from 3.07 to 3.57 percent. Sales tax and tobacco tax increases were taken off the table. The personal income tax and a drilling fee on Marcellus shale drilling would be used to increase funding for education, according the Wolf administration. \nA local mom from Shippensburg joined a press conference early in the day to support the plan. \n“Middle school music is one of the program set to be cut in Shippensburg a school district,” Christine Tolbert said. \nBehind the debate, the big question was whether this democratic governor had 18 Republican votes that would go his way. That would have been the only way that this plan would get through the republican-controlled house. Not only did the Republicans not jump the aisle, some moderate Democrats rejected the plan. \n“I am constantly worried about the people who are affected because tomorrow we're going to start day 100,” Democratic Representative Patty Kim said. \nRepresentative David Reed said the vote was an important step forward because it shows the governor that Republicans will not vote for broad-based tax increases. \n“No broad base taxes what happens, the schools boards will have to raise their property taxes once again instead of taxing Shale companies,” Kim said. \nWolf wants new revenues to plug a billion-dollar-plus structural deficit and to send more money to schools and for human services.
