The Liberal Democrats are a federalist party.\n\"I was disheartened with the Better Together campaign. We all need to look at what happened to Labour in Scotland to see how badly that can affect a party.\"\nUK Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said Mr Carmichael deserves \"a second chance\" after his admission that he lied during the general election campaign.\nA bid by his lawyers to have the court case against him thrown out failed after the court dismissed a key plank of his defence and called for further evidence on the remaining legal matters.\nA four-day Election Court hearing will take place at the Court of Session in Edinburgh from November 9.\nIn a briefing to journalists at conference, Mr Farron said: \"I have no legal training whatsoever so I have no opinion on the legal matter.\n\"We shouldn't comment, but just that most normal people tend to give people a second chance.\"\nShare article A YouGov poll of over 1,000 people in Scotland earlier this month found over two-thirds (67%) who thought Mr Carmichael should resign as an MP over the matter.\nMr Farron added: \"I think it's a reminder, I guess, that we all need to be careful with our language.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-25T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:22:21.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
