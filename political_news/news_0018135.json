Some of the cases, including the embattled tollway transport service and radio frequency service, have been struggling for more than a decade, Prayut said. Actions to resolve them need to be taken before they expire, Prayut said, including those involving the rice-pledging scheme initiated by former premier Yingluck Shinawatra. Government spokesperson Maj-General Sansern Kaewkamnerd stressed that Wissanu would focus on major cases, with demands for billions of baht worth of damages. Currently, 12 cases are pending with the government as a plaintiff. \"Although we are a plaintiff in some cases, it doesn't mean that we will be of advantage,\" Sansern said. \"It means that we have to counter [defendants] immediately before the cases are expired.\" If we fail to resolve these issues, he continued, the government can be accused of neglecting its duties. \"More importantly, all government offices have to trace cases under their authority for the national benefit.\" Sansern pointed out that all the cases happened before May 22, 2014, the day when the junta assumed power in a coup d'etat. However, the government needs to follow them up during its term. The government will have to deal with defendants and plaintiffs, he added, whether they are civil servants, political officials, or domestic or international business offices. 306 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:55:20.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
