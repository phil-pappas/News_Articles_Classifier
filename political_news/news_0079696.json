Ivory Coast’s president Alassane Ouattara is widely expected to win a second term as the West African nation votes, five years after a disputed poll that spilled over into the worst violence the country has experienced since independence.(AP Photo/Schalk van Zuydam)\nAssociated Press Oct. 25, 2015 | 7:28 a.m. EDT + More By ROBBIE COREY-BOULET, Associated Press\nABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Ivory Coast voters headed to the polls Sunday hoping to put the past behind them as the West African nation holds its first presidential election since a disputed vote five years ago triggered violence in which more than 3,000 people died.\nDozens of voters lined up outside a school in Abidjan's Plateau district before the official 7 a.m. start time. Incumbent President Alassane Ouattara was widely expected to prevail over a divided opposition and perhaps secure enough votes to avoid a runoff.\nVoting started one hour late at the school but local election official Kassoume Toure said all materials had been received.\n\"Voting is important to me because I want to choose my candidate so we can turn the page toward peace,\" said Ouolli Kone, a teacher and Ouattara supporter, at the Notre Dame du Plateau middle school. He said he was optimistic there would be no violence.\nIn 2010, Ouattara defeated incumbent Laurent Gbagbo who refused to concede, sparking the worst fighting the country has experienced since independence.\nKone said under Ouattara's leadership his salary had increased for the first time in 10 years, from 250,000 CFA ($420) per month to 312,000 CFA ($520) per month.\nOuattara has touted an economic rebound and security gains although opponents say he has failed to reconcile the country or reduce poverty.\nVoting was also delayed in many districts of the country's largest city, Abidjan, as poll workers rushed to organize materials. In the northern Abobo district, polling stations were awaiting electronic tablets a couple hours after voting should have begun.\nMore than 6 million people are registered.\nThree members of an original roster of 10 candidates have withdrawn from the process citing doubts about the vote's fairness.\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Nicolas Garriga in Abidjan, Ivory Coast contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
