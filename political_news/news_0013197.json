John Kasich said.\n\n“He clearly made a mistake,” Kasich said, after initially telling reporters “I’m not going to get into that.”\n\nThe billionaire is taking credit for Ford's decision to move truck production to Ohio from Mexico - an agreement that was reached in 2011 by the Kasich administration once the automaker reached a deal with the United Autoworkers Union.\n\n\"Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S.,\" Trump tweeted late Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth. Think what can be done as president!\"\n\nHe and several supporters cited a prntly.com article by Dmitri Volova entitled \"Trump successfully pressures Ford to move Mexican plant to Ohio.\" \n\nThe piece begins: \"Donald Trump may not be the president yet, but his constant criticism of Ford outsourcing jobs to Mexico has caused the auto tycoon to change course and bring the $2,000,000 plant back to the United States.\"\n\nHowever, the brief web story is filled with factual errors, such as the number of jobs, the value of the plant, where it is being located in Ohio, when it happened, and what the original article cited about the topic in CNN Money actually said. The latter actually centered on production starting in August at a heavy-pickup-truck plant in Avon Lake in Lorain County.\n\nAnd that new line stemmed from an economic development deal announced by Kasich in December 2011 - obviously well before Trump blasted onto the scene. The state promised $15 million in tax incentives and other goodies to bring the truck line to Ohio from Mexico.\n\nAt the time, Ford called Kasich's role \"instrumental\" in insourcing the jobs - as noted in a YouTube video that was linked by the campaign. The UAW also praised the move.\n\nFord issued a statement saying: “Ford has not spoken with Mr. Trump, nor have we made any changes to our plans. We decided to move the F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks to Ohio Assembly in 2011, long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. president.\"\n\nThe Kasich campaign said, \"The truth is that Ford began moving jobs back to Ohio four years ago under the leadership of Governor John Kasich … Our country needs real leadership and not empty, false rhetoric.\"\n\nWhen ABC News asked Trump about the spat involving Kasich and Ford, the billionaire said, \"He’s a nice man, John Kasich. I like him.”\n\nHowever, that's not quite all to the story. As the CNN Money article pointed out, Ford has been taking heat for about six months after announcing plans to invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs in Mexico.\n\nFor several months, Kasich has been pressuring an automaker behind the scenes that has announced plans to move production to Mexico. But the campaign won't say which one.\n\nIn March, GM announced that it would plow $350 million to produce the next generation of the popular Chevrolet Cruze into its plant in Coahuila, part of $5 billion targeted for south of the border in 2014. However, the Mexico commitment - as well as a similar one in China - would not affect the Cruze manufacturing already taking place in Lordstown, west of Youngstown, the automaker said.\n\ndrowland@dispatch.com\n\n@darreldrowland\n\najohnson@dispatch.com\n\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:10:04.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
