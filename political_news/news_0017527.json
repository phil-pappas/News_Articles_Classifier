It will criminalize our online activities, censor the Web, and cost everyday users money. This deal would never pass with the whole world watching – that’s why they’ve negotiated it in total secrecy.” \nNational governments can sign the TPP now, but most countries require a formal vote from legislators before the agreement can be ratified and brought into force. Details remain unclear as to when experts and the public will be able to perform a full analysis of the text and what it means for Internet users. \nHowever, under Trade Promotion Authority, U.S. President Barack Obama has committed to releasing the text for public scrutiny 60 days before a final vote in Congress. Despite pressure to complete the deal by the end of the year, analysts suggest that at this late stage the TPP will be impossible to ratify until 2016. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:50:41.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
