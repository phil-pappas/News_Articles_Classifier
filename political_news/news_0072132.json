Is it you or Lord Ashcroft?\" \nMr Cameron replied: \"What I'd say to you is I would think of many better uses of your time than reading that book. Share article \n\"I managed to procure a free copy and in order not to give anyone royalties I'll gladly lend you a copy if that's what you'd like. \n\"I think you'll remember in this House, Labour and Conservative agreed to legislate so that non doms could not sit in either House - legislation I fully supported and indeed suggested at the time.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:49:35.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
