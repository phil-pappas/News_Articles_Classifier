We did it to ourselves.’ \nBut the KEEA executives replied Dr Nduom saying: \n“This clearly implies that when it comes to citizens voting to select leaders, God has absolutely no hand in it. [Dr Ndoum], however, fails to accept what the Bible says, \"It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings. Again, the very God Dr. Nduom prayed to tells us, \"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. It is vivid God establishes human powers. It is true the people of Ghana have been voting, but we need not forget that God rules in the affairs of men. If in God's plans a person not destined to be a leader, he can't be”. \nThe following were the words from Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom’s Facebook post: \n“Dear God, I know you are a kind God. You love your children so much that you forgive us our sins, again and again. I pray for forgiveness for all of our people, especially those who lead our nation. You give us Grace in abundance daily. It is You who have given us a fertile soil, gold, oil, manganese, bauxite, and other minerals. You have made it possible for cocoa, timber, maize, cassava and others to grow when we do the work. Energize our will to put these to good use. My Lord, I know you did not choose Bokassa, Iddi Amin, Jammeh, and others for Africa or Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and their type for the world. You my Lord God did not rain ‘dumsor’, poverty, corruption, HIPC, illiteracy or cholera on us. We did it to ourselves. Help us work to get rid of them. I know you were not in the line to vote for Rawlings in 1992 and 1996, Kufuor in 2000 and 2004, Atta-Mills in 2008, or Mahama in 2012. We the voters, human as we are did the voting. Master, I know you did not bring foreigners to vote in Ghana, nor did you carry minors to go and and vote. You Lord, did not steal ballot papers or deny candidates votes that belonged to them. As I continue to pray, Master, let not your people use your name in vain. Teach us not to bear false witness. Teach us all to pray for humility, incorruptibility, diligence and the courage to take the righteous path. Teach our people to know that it is they who vote and that no free manna will fall from the heavens and that whom we give our vote to will determine our well-being on this earth. My Lord God, make our hearts pure and our minds fertile for the truth and help us make wise choices so that we can vote for leaders who will help us make excellent use of natural gifts you have put here on part of the world called Ghana. \nThese and others I ask and pray for in the name of Jesus. \nAmen.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:30:28.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
