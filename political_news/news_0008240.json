Steve Beshear should issue an executive order to exempt Kim Davis and other clerks from issuing licenses to same-sex couples due to religious objections. Minus as executive order, Westerfield says a special session of the legislature should take up the issue. \nDemocrat Andy Beshear says the governor cannot change a section of law by executive order. He calls it \"law school 101.\" \nBeshear says a special session would be a waste of taxpayer dollars. \nThe candidates made a joint appearance on Kentucky Educational Television Monday night. \nBeshear is the son of Gov. Steve Beshear. Westerfield is chairman of the state Senate Judiciary Committee.
