Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe October Fairfax-Ipsos poll has found the Coalition has surged ahead of Labor at 53-47 according to the flow of second preferences as allocated at the 2013 election.\nAdvertisement It is the first time the government has led Labor since March 2014, just before the disastrous first Abbott-Hockey budget, and suggests the Coalition, now under new management, has recovered almost all the ground lost since its landslide victory in September 2013.\nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott.\nWhen respondents were asked specifically who would get their second preference right now, the story got even worse for Mr Shorten, with the split widening to 54-46 in the Coalition's favour.\nThe poll also shows Australians have not been frightened away from the task of economic reform by anti free-trade, union-sponsored advertising campaigns, with 54 per cent of respondents in favour of the China-Australia free trade agreement compared to 33 per cent opposed, giving it a support rating of 21 per cent.\nMr Turnbull's net approval rating as Prime Minister now stands at a healthy 51 per cent based on 68 per cent of voters approving of the way he is handling his job, minus the 17 per cent who disapprove.\nMr Shorten's performance in his role as Opposition Leader is being marked down, with those approving (32 per cent) minus the percentage who those who disapprove (56 per cent) giving him a net rating of minus 24 per cent - a fall of 14 points in two months.\nLabor's primary vote has dropped by a precipitous 6 points over the same period to be just 30 per cent, whereas the Coalition's first preference support has bounced back to 45 per cent. This is within one percentage point of where it was in September 2013 election.\nBased on the second preference allocated by voters in 2013, that translates to a split of 53-47 in favour of the government - just half a percentage point off the high-water mark of 53.5 per cent when it was elected.\nIt means the swing away from the Coalition since September 2013 now stands at just 0.5 per cent, returning the now Turnbull-run operation to frontrunner status for the election due within a year.\nSupport for the Greens remains at the upper end of its strong 2015 performance on 14 per cent, although it had peaked at 17 per cent earlier in the year and was at 16 per cent in the previous two Fairfax-Ipsos polls.\nTough times ahead for Shorten\nThe statistically weighted nationwide phone survey of 1403 respondents was taken over October 15-17 at the end of another difficult week for Mr Shorten, who attracted widespread criticism for attacking Mr Turnbull's wealth and his use of a hedge fund in the off-shore tax-haven, the Cayman Islands, to manage his investments.\nThe former Australian Workers Union boss also faced fresh allegations last week arising from the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. Executives from construction companies with which the AWU dealt claimed side-deals and bogus invoices were used to mask the transfer of money to the union, as part of mutually agreeable arrangements to lock out the more militant CFMEU.\nAt 51 per cent, Mr Turnbull's net approval rating (68 per cent minus a 17 per cent disapproval) eclipses even the stellar approval rating of Kevin Rudd at his peak (in the then Fairfax-Nielsen series) who in May 2008 registered a 69 per cent approval number but also had a slightly higher disapproval rating than Mr Turnbull of 22 per cent.\nBy contrast, Mr Shorten's approval rating at just 32 per cent (down 7 percentage points), is sinking at the same rate as his party's plummeting primary vote support of 30 per cent (down 7 points since August), which is 10 points lower than it was at the start of 2015. Those disapproving of his performance as Opposition Leader has soared to 56 per cent in a finding likely to increase internal dissatisfaction levels in his leadership.\nOn the simple head-to-head contest of preferred prime minister, Mr Turnbull's lead of 46 points is among the highest in recent times, eclipsing all but the 53-point advantage Mr Rudd enjoyed over the-then embattled opposition leader in May 2008, Brendan Nelson. That lead was 70 per cent to 17.\nTurnbull trumps his main rival\nIn further bad news for Mr Shorten and his supporters, voters were also asked to rate the attributes of the two current leaders on aspects like competency, strength as a leader, trustworthiness, and grasp of economic policy.\nPollster Jessica Elgood said the results were clearly much better for the Prime Minister than for the man who wants his job.\n\"Of the 11 attributes, Malcolm Turnbull has a statistically significant lead on all 10 of the positive attributes,\" she said.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax", "http://e.infogr.am/_/tQfOSWtUMYN0tQLmY7Lz?src=embed", "http://e.infogr.am/_/Os3LwVEdkj2BnuNhfnbN?src=embed", "http://e.infogr.am/_/TGEybWpn6rQxEIbciLMR?src=embed"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:41:42.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
