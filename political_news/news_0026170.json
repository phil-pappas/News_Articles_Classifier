The surprise announcement that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy would not seek the speakership role, following a heavy challenge from the right, leaves the question of when and how the debt limit will be lifted even harder for Wall Street to figure out.\n“We will not mince words — this is the political equivalent of a dumpster fire,” said Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities. “We are increasing our odds from 30 percent to 40 percent for some kind of accident that would keep Congress from raising the debt ceiling in time due to brinkmanship, procrastination, or political gridlock.\"\nThe Treasury Department has said it will run out of room under the debt limit on Nov. 5th. The nation faces a first in history default if the borrowing limit is not raised by then. Government funding runs out on Dec. 11th. Of the two issues, the debt limit is far more worrisome to investors and much more potentially damaging to an economy that is only growing around 2 percent and creating jobs at less than 200,000 per month during the last two months.\nHouse Republicans have already begun suggesting the administration is playing politics with the debt limit deadline, increasing the risks of an ugly showdown. A near miss on the debt limit in 2011 led to a downgrade of U.S. debt for the first time, turned markets upside down and slowed down the economic recovery.\n\"I'm not at all sanguine about December fight,\" said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. \"Nothing centrist and benignly positive comes from such politics.\"\nWall Street overall reacted tepidly to the McCarthy news on Thursday, with markets little changed. That reflects a general belief that despite the chaos in Washington, both parties will ultimately find a path to raising the debt limit and keeping the government open.\nMcCarthy drops out, House in chaos By Jake Sherman , Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\n“While it adds to the uncertainty, the assumption of most market participants currently is that this heightened political drama will not materially derail the US economy,” said Mohamed A. El-Erian of Allianz.\nSome on Wall Street and in Washington see a potentially benign scenario emerging from the GOP leadership mess.\nUnder this scenario, the chaos on Capitol Hill — with no clear candidate at the moment who can unite the GOP — will give outgoing Speaker John Boehner a freer hand to cut a deal before he leaves that would both raise the debt limit and fund the government into next year.\nBoehner said on Thursday that he would stay on as speaker until a new one has been elected. He had previously said he would leave Congress at the end of this month, just days before the debt ceiling would be hit.\n“I actually think this is good for debt ceiling,” said Jason Rosenstock of Thorn Run Partners. “The chaos is being caused by the Freedom Caucus and while they are also opposed to raising the debt ceiling I think [Thursday’s] activity will reinforce those who want to have Boehner raise the debt ceiling before he leaves.”\nTrump celebrates McCarthy dropping out of speaker race By Nick Gass\nBut still others fear that the fight to be the next speaker will embolden conservatives to battle any effort by Boehner to cut a deal with the White House and congressional Democrats on raising the debt limit or funding the government. The White House has also signaled it will take a hard line and not negotiate with Republicans on raising the debt limit.\nThe economy could also be dealing with the first interest rate hike in a decade this December, raising the risks that Washington drama could deliver a serious blow to a soft economy. The global economy is also slowing, particularly in China, making it an even more precarious moment.\n“This is the third — and final — debt ceiling crisis of the Obama Administration,” said Krueger. And many investors are skeptical of another ‘boy cries wolf' saga. We understand and can sympathize but would remind all that in the book the wolf eats the boy.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:08:08.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
