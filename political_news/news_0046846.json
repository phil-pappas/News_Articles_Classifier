The committee questioned her senior aide, Huma Abedin, for six hours in a closed session on Friday. \nDemocrats have argued that the 17-month-old probe is a political tool to damage Clinton as she seeks her party's nomination in the November 2016 presidential election. \nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, the No. 2 House Republican, stoked that view last month when he said the panel's work may be hurting Clinton's poll numbers. \nGowdy advised fellow Republicans who are not involved in the committee's work to stay quiet. \n\"I have told my own Republican colleagues and friends 'Shut up talking about things that you don't know anything about.' And unless you are on the committee, you have no idea what we have done, why we've done it,\" he said on CBS. \nClinton has said she considers the committee to be politically motivated. \n\"I think it's pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee,\" Clinton said in a CNN interview broadcast on Friday. \nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the leading Democrat on the Benghazi committee, told \"Face the Nation\" that the 18-month-old had lost its focus: the events that led to the Benghazi deaths. \nHe said Gowdy has not interviewed the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the secretary of defense, but has brought in many witnesses connected to Clinton through the State Department or her campaigns, including aides and speechwriters. \n\"We still have been zeroed in on Hillary Clinton. There is absolutely no doubt about that, and it's very unfortunate,\" he said. \n(Reporting By Patrick Rucker; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Nick Zieminski) U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign town hall meeting in Keene, New Hampshire October 16, 2015.
