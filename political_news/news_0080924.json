More BBC defends its light entertainment role \nInstead Mr Corbyn missed the meeting, sending apologies via his spokesman, as he is thought to be taking a short holiday before parliament reconvenes next week. \nThe ancient body, which dates to the court of the Norman kings, has 600 members who advise the monarch at meetings roughly once a month. \nBy joining it Mr Corbyn would gain access to a range of sensitive information including foreign affairs and policing and security matters. \nWhen becoming a Privy Council member it is traditional for politicians to bow to the Queen and kiss her hand. \nThe Labour leader, who is a longstanding republican, has refused to say whether or not he would kneel in front of the monarch. \nSuch uncertainty has played into wider criticism of his unconventional stances on a range of issues — for example describing the extra-judicial killing of Osama bin Laden as a “tragedy”. \nThis week, David Cameron, the prime minister, used his speech to the Tory conference to call Mr Corbyn a “security threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating” ideologue. \nMr Corbyn, who has spent three decades as a protester on the backbenches, must now decide how much ground to cede on his principles as leader of Britain’s second-largest political party. \nHe has also equivocated on wearing a red poppy to the annual remembrance service at the Cenotaph next month. Mr Cobyn has in past years also worn the pacifist symbol of a white poppy. Last month, his aides said he would only wear a red poppy this year. \nMr Cameron also missed his first Privy Council meeting when he joined the body in 2005 as the newly elected leader of the Conservative party, which was in opposition at the time. Mr Cameron was not sworn in until three months after his membership was approved. \nA spokesperson for Mr Corbyn said: “Although Jeremy was unavailable for today’s meeting, he has confirmed he will be joining the Privy Council. As the prime minister and others did, it is far from unusual to miss the first meeting due to other commitments.” \nMr Corbyn won the Labour leadership contest in a shock result after mustering a groundswell of support from new Labour members and those who signed up to vote in the contest through the party’s £3 supporter scheme. \nThe team which masterminded his victorious campaign revealed on Thursday that they are converting it into a new local activist network, dubbed Momentum. \nAlthough the grassroots group will not stand candidates or act as a bloc vote in contests for internal Labour party positions, it intends to create “a mass movement for social change”. \nBut the plans prompted alarm among more rightwing factions within the Labour party. \nLuke Akehurst, secretary of the more rightwing “Labour First”, criticised the “divisive” creation of the new group as a “parallel structure” outside the party. \nHe warned that it could be part of an attempt to remove moderate councillors and MPs disliked by “veteran Bennite organisers”. \nLabour has signed up more than 180,000 new members since it lost the general election in May, approximately doubling the size of the party. \nBut some leading figures in the Momentum network fear that the new members may lose motivation unless their energies can be channelled into frontline campaigning.
