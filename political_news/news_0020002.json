It’s the same old stuff. It’s really sad that Texas has this reputation.”\nA Collin County grand jury indicted Paxton in July after special prosecutors, with an assist from the Texas Rangers, investigated Paxton’s dealings while he was a member of the Legislature.\nThe indictment — the first against a sitting Texas attorney general in more than 30 years — stemmed from transactions involving Servergy Inc., a data storage and security company in which Paxton held stock.\nSantorum is a close friend of Paxton. He was in the Senate chamber in 2013 when Paxton was sworn into office. But Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, said he hadn’t talked to Paxton in several months.\nThe indictment alleges that in July 2011, Paxton “engaged in fraud” by selling more than $100,000 in Servergy stock to a fellow Republican state representative and a Florida businessman without telling them that he would make a profit from their investment. He also failed to disclose that he had already been compensated with 100,000 shares of the company and that he had not put any of his own money into the company, according to the indictment.\nA year later, it said, Paxton “rendered services as an investment adviser representative” without being registered with the Texas State Board of Securities.\nPaxton admitted the actions underpinning that charge in an earlier administrative proceeding. He called his failure to register as an investment adviser an oversight, and in 2014, he paid a $1,000 fine.\nIf convicted on all counts in the indictment, he could be sentenced to life in prison.\nAnd his case is much different than the Hutchison and Perry cases cited by Santorum.\nIn 1993, Hutchison was indicted in Travis County on charges of official misconduct and records tampering while she was state treasurer. She blasted the charges, brought by Democratic District Attorney Ronnie Earle, as politically motivated. Ultimately, Earle did not proceed with the case and Hutchison was acquitted. She went on to have a long, successful career as a U.S. senator.\nPerry, as his final term as governor was concluding, was indicted in Travis County on charges that he misused his power. He cut off $7.5 million from the Travis County district attorney’s office after District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was arrested on a charge of drunken driving and was belligerent during her booking at the county jail.\nPerry’s case was handled by a special prosecutor. And while Perry has adamantly insisted that the indictments against him were political and a farce, the judges hearing the case — including those on the Third Court of Appeals — have been fellow Republicans.\nOne of the charges against Perry has been thrown out.\nAnd Paxton was not indicted in connection with activities associated with his public office, but actions in his private career.\nSantorum was in Fort Worth unveiling his plan to boost the nation’s economy.\n“America has lost hope,” Santorum told the World Affairs Council at the Fort Worth Club. “Most Americans are pessimistic about the future of our country.”\nA key element of Santorum’s plan is overhauling the country’s tax code and switching to a single rate for all taxpayers.\nSantorum said that while Democrats have wooed American workers and the poor in elections, they have failed to deliver sound policies to help them.\nAnd his fellow Republicans, he said, have largely failed to discuss problems facing working Americans. He said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s poor approval rating with average Americans cost him the 2012 presidential election.\n“We’ve been very lacking in talking about American workers and the poor in America,” he said.\nIn a veiled jab at rival Ted Cruz, the U.S. senator and presidential contender from Texas, Santorum said it was important for elected leaders to compromise.\n“I’m not interested in winning the next election. I’m interested in getting the country on the right track,” he said. “Leaders find good compromises.”\nOn Twitter:\n @gromerjeffers", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gromerjeffers"], "published": "2015-10-13T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:21:48.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
