The rupee today opened at 64.74 as against the previous close of 65.03. It does not foresee much turmoil in the global financial market if the US Fed raises rate either in December 2015 or takes it to 2016.\nThe report said some short-term volatility in the rupee can occur due to readjustments carried out by foreign institutional investors in their portfolios towards the year end or in the beginning of 2016.\n\"However, since the rupee is currently overvalued in terms of the real effective exchange rate, some amount of nominal depreciation in the currency will only enhance the competitiveness of the country's exports and therefore, is unlikely to lead to any policy or RBI intervention,\" the report said.\nThe decision of Central Bank of China to allow the yuan to depreciate by 3.4 per cent over the two consecutive days—August 11 and 12, 2015—rattled the emerging market currencies in that month. Despite witnessing some volatility and depreciation, the rupee has remained one of the most stable emerging market currencies, the rating agency said.\nIt had depreciated 3.11 per cent till end-September 2015 when it ended at 65.74 on September 30, but recovered to 64.78 by October 9. According to the report, the better macroeconomic fundamentals of the country in August 2015 saved the day for the rupee.\n business Economics Rupee Also Read Jaitley appointed as ADB governor RBI hold rates steady, cuts bond reserve ratio for lenders Rupee logs worst drop in a month, down 44 paise FedEx charged for shipping illegal drugs", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/rupee-currency_6_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_4_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/rupee-currency_6_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_4_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/business-economics/article/rupee-may-stay-stable-rest-fy16-strong-macros-ind-ra", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:23:08.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
