Comment Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 11:09 AM By Lynn Ondrusek Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 11:09 AM » Social News In a lesson of learning to interact with civic leaders, 130 students at East Stroudsburg Area High School South heard from U.S. Senate Democratic candidate Joe Sestak Tuesday morning. The former admiral took questions from students in the high school’s advance placement government class and 10th grade civics class for close to an hour on topics ranging from the environment and global warming and women in the military, to staying in touch with state issues and accountability. Sestake didn’t stay at the podium that was set up on a raised platform for the stage, but walked around where the students were sitting in the library. He wore blue jeans, a black long-sleeved shirt and boots to speak to the students. He said he was dressed like that because when he took up running for the U.S. Senate seat, he held up a pair of boots he wore in Afghanistan and said he would walk across Pennsylvania. “I wanted to walk in the shoes of my fellow veterans,” he said. He also had speaking engagements in Easton, before walking 18 miles to Allentown later in the day on Tuesday. He shared stories with the students of his time in the Navy and the trust that bonds seamen and women, his time in Afghanistan, his daughter's battle with brain cancer and his father, a World War II veteran. He urged students to connect with veterans in some way just to show support for them. Civics and Government teacher Michael Healey said he wanted his students to be able to know that they can interact with their civic leaders. He said allowing speakers in the school, like Sestak, is a way to connect what is read in books to reality. High school senior Amit Maharaj, said he was with Healey when the email came back from Sestak that he could speak at the school. He said his visit was an honor and meant a great deal to him. One thing that Maharaj said he was going to take away from the talk is what Sestak mentioned about accountability. “Everything we do, every move we make, you need to be able to have accountability for your actions,” he said. Superintendent Sharon Laverdure welcomed Sestak as well, and told the students that the opportunities that they have in school become their memories. “They are etched in your minds forever,” she said, encouraging the students to make the best of the opportunities that are presented to them and to ask Sestak questions. Sestak is one of several candidates who will face off in the spring's primary election to be the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat. Others running include Katie McGinty, former chief of staff for Gov. Tom Wolf, John Fetterman, mayor of Braddock in western Pennsylvania, and Joseph Vodvarka. The spring primary winner would face sitting Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.
