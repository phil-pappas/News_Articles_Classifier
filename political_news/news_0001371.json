There are three others that have nuclear weapons. That is eight countries out of 192...So 187 countries don’t feel the need to have a nuclear weapon to protect their security. Why should those five need it themselves? We are not in the era of the cold war anymore. It finished a long time ago.”\nMr Corbyn added: “I am opposed to the use of nuclear weapons. I am opposed to the holding of nuclear weapons. I want to see a nuclear-free world. I believe it is possible.”\nHis remarks infuriated his Westminster colleagues.\nMaria Eagle, the Shadow Defence Secretary, who is in favour of Trident renewal, said her leader’s comments had \"undermined to some degree\" the review she is carrying out of the party's defence policy.\n\"I don't think that a potential prime minister answering a question like that, in the way in which he did, is helpful,\" she added.\nLord Falconer, the Shadow Justice Secretary, said: \"There's no point having a nuclear deterrent unless you're prepared in extreme circumstances to use it.\"\nAndy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said he would find it difficult to remain in Mr Corbyn's frontbench team if Labour ditched its support for Trident.\nThe Tories seized on his remarks with Mr Cameron, during a visit to Jamaica, saying: \"The independent nuclear deterrent that we have in Britain is a vital insurance policy for our nation in what is a very dangerous world.\n\"And, frankly, the way the Labour leader has answered that question demonstrates that Labour can't be trusted with our national security which, after all, is the most important duty of government.\"\nShare article Asked later if he stood by his comments, Mr Corbyn said: \"Would anybody press the nuclear button?\"\nThe main-gate decision on a Trident replacement is expected early next year; in the run-up to the Holyrood elections. A crunch vote is expected at Westminster.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-01T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:29:50.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
