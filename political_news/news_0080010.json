George Hawkins as the Chairperson of the Community Impact Forum (CIF) tasked with facilitating community interaction with Auckland South Corrections Facility. \nSimeon Brown has also been appointed as the Chair of the Social Impact Fund Allocation Committee (SIFAC) which will consider funding any mitigation applications which are identified by the CIF or the Tangata Whenua Committee which also has oversight over the social impact of the new prison. \n\"I commend the Minister for ensuring that Manurewa has strong representation on these panels. The Minister has recognised that Manurewa is adversely affected by the prisonâ€™s location in our community and has wisely chosen to safeguard our voice by appointing a local community leader. \n\"Mr Brown is well placed to take on these roles as someone who lives in the Manurewa community, and will bring a strong community focus to the roles. \n\"This is a vote of confidence in Mr Brown as a leader in the Manurewa community, and as someone who can advocate for our community. \n\"I also welcome the appointment of Manurewa Central School Principal and local resident Laurie Thew as a member of the SIFAC committee. \n\"Mr Brown and Mr Thew will ensure that local people are making decisions on issues which affect the Manurewa community.\" Says Ms Dalton. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
