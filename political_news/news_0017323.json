(It doesn't provide citizenship, but it does allow for temporary legal status.)\n The lawsuit argues that each student was eligible for in-district or in-state tuition but was instead charged the higher out-of-state tuition at each of their respective colleges. According to KCUR , the lawsuit is challenging the preamble to a new law that forbids public universities and colleges from using public money to provide in-state tuition to undocumented students. However, because that specific language appears in the preamble, not the body of the bill itself, the suit alleges that it's unenforceable.\nMore from Cosmo for Latinas 20 articles Victoria Justice Opens Up About Her Struggle With...

KCUR reports that he had been a high school athlete who had worked for years at a bank to save money to attend college, and he arrived in the U.S. when he was just 1 year old.\nWhile spokespeople for the University of Missouri and St. Louis Community College declined to comment on the situation, MCC spokesperson Christina Medina said in a statement to FNL that the school \"is committed to serving students and our community within the confines of the regulatory parameters provided by state and federal requirements.\"\nFollow Alanna on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/10/14/undocumented-students-sue-missouri-colleges-for-charging-higher-tuition-rates/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444702372-janethevirginseason2premiererecap.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444745973-vsfashionshow2015.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444830649-gettyimages-492556320.jpg", "http://kcur.org/post/immigrants-sue-missouri-schools-over-higher-tuition-rates", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444758942-dafnealmazan.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/alannaknunez"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:39:34.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
