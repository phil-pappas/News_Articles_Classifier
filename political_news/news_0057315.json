Robert Menendez, both angry over the Obama administration’s diplomatic opening to Cuba, are now targeting America’s ties to a far more important neighbor: Mexico. At issue is who, if anyone, will serve as the next U.S. ambassador in Mexico City during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency.\nIn June, the administration nominated Roberta Jacobson, the State Department’s assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, who helped lead the negotiations that re-established U.S. diplomatic ties to Cuba. But her confirmation has been held up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, with the vote postponed earlier this month. The committee is expected to vote in favor of Jacobson during its next business meeting, but the nomination is then likely to languish indefinitely on the Senate floor unless Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) deems it a priority.\nThe holdup, sources familiar with the committee said, centers directly on Jacobson’s work on Cuba.\nThe delays in her committee approval have “everything to do with the Cuban policy,” said Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, ranking Democrat on the committee. “That’s not Roberta Jacobson. That’s the Obama policy.”\nIn The Arena\nTen Deadly Lies about Israel By Ron Dermer\nSources said Rubio, a Florida senator considered a top-tier 2016 candidate, and Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey who is facing federal corruption charges, are Jacobson’s primary opponents.\nBoth senators, who are of Cuban descent, have actively opposed Obama’s decision to restore ties to the communist-led island, a decision that took effect July 20, but there’s been virtually nothing they’ve been able to do to stop the executive branch. Homing in on Jacobson’s nomination for the Mexico position is one way to needle the White House.\nIn an interview, Menendez denied that he was taking out his Cuba frustrations on Jacobson. But he wouldn’t say what his objections are or whether he will vote against her in committee or slow her nomination on the Senate floor.\n“That is wrong. I have concerns about her nomination, but not because she participated in the Cuba negotiations,” Menendez said. “When I determine exactly what I intend to do, if it is to oppose her, I will describe the reasons but they will not be based upon her negotiation.”\nThe New Jersey senator, who is battling his indictment and denies wrongdoing, questioned Jacobson fiercely about U.S. policies in Latin America during her nomination hearing in mid-July.\nWhile Jacobson is one of several ambassadors — and dozens of executive branch nominees — facing obstacles in the Senate, her situation is especially notable because Mexico is considered a crucial posting. The nation of 122 million is America’s third-largest trading partner . It’s also a major source of immigrants, documented and undocumented, whose presence on U.S. soil has become a flashpoint on the 2016 presidential campaign trail.\nAfter Canadian rout, a quick verdict on Keystone? By Elana Schor and Andrew Restuccia\n“We have a person who is eminently qualified. No one disagrees with her qualifications. There’s no justification to hold this individual up,” Cardin said. “We have drugs. We have immigrants and refugees, we have bilateral economic relations, we have environmental relations. We have so many things going on with Mexico, we need a confirmed ambassador representing our interests.”\nRubio and Menendez have tried repeatedly to trip up the Obama administration’s nominees due to their views on Cuba. Rubio temporarily blocked Jacobson’s 2011 nomination to her current post, in part over Cuba. Back in 2009, Menendez reportedly opposed the ultimately successful nomination of Carlos Pascual for the Mexico job; Pascual had helped write a paper arguing for normalizing ties with Cuba.\nSupporters of restoring relations with Cuba panned efforts to delay Jacobson’s nomination.\n“It’s unfortunate. She’s eminently qualified,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\nJacobson is a career civil service officer who is fluent in Spanish and extensive experience related to Mexico , whether in positions such as director of the State Department's Office of Mexican Affairs or as deputy assistant secretary for Canada, Mexico and NAFTA issues. She would be the first woman to hold the ambassador's post in Mexico.\nMexican officials declined to comment on the potential Senate fight, but the Mexican government has previously expressed its happiness with Jacobson’s nomination.\nIn an interview, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) pledged to move the nomination imminently and suggested that Jacobson has broad support within the Senate.\n“At the next meeting she’ll be voted upon,” Corker said. “I’m very supportive and will certainly vote for her, as will numbers of people on our side of the aisle, to move her through.”\nJacobson was not available for an interview, but White House spokesman Eric Schultz urged lawmakers to support her. “A strong relationship with Mexico is vital to the economic stability and national security of the United States, and that relationship relies on a Senate-confirmed ambassador to Mexico,” he said. “Roberta Jacobson is immensely qualified for this job, and we urge Congress to swiftly confirm her nomination.”\nJacobson would succeed E. Anthony Wayne, who departed from Mexico City earlier this summer. But she wasn’t the first Obama administration choice for the role, or the first one to run into trouble.\nThe president last year nominated Maria Echaveste, a former Clinton administration official of Mexican ancestry. She was considered a political appointment because she did not have a diplomatic background, although she had applicable policy expertise. But in January, after waiting several months without getting a committee hearing in the wake of the Republican takeover the Senate, Echaveste removed herself from consideration.\nState Department objects to email release by Benghazi panel By Josh Gerstein\nA Rubio aide confirmed that the Florida senator had requested more information from Jacobson, thus delaying a committee vote on her nomination, but insisted that Cuba isn’t the only issue of concern, pointing to what the senator considers relatively lax administration policy on Venezuela and questions about the integrity of its annual human trafficking report.\nOnce Jacobson clears committee (a meeting is expected before Thanksgiving), it’s anyone’s guess when the full Senate will take up her nomination. Any senator can put a hold on her nomination once it reaches that stage, which would require McConnell, the majority leader, to use his procedural powers to override objections.\nBesides Rubio and Menendez, Sen. Ted Cruz — also a Republican presidential candidate — might choose to block her nomination at that stage. Cruz, who is also of Cuban descent and opposed to the U.S. rapprochement with the island, already has holds on a number of other diplomatic nominees due to his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal; several other senators also have holds on State Department nominees.\nWith just more than a year left in the Obama administration, Jacobson’s tenure in Mexico City could end up being relatively short, although her status as a career diplomat could extend it longer than would be the case for a political appointee, especially if Democrats keep the White House.\nAlthough the GOP-led Congress has little power to derail the executive branch-led resumption of U.S.-Cuba ties, Rubio and Menendez have vowed to do what they can. And one area where the White House doesn’t seem willing to test them is on nominating an ambassador to Cuba itself.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/clift-obama-needs-spend-some-political-capital-81799", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/01/31/obamas-pick-for-ambassador-to-mexico-withdraws/", "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/198696.htm", "http://www.cubademocraciayvida.org/web/print.asp?artID=29004", "http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/071515%20Jacobson_Testimony.pdf", "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/200215-rubio-to-resume-holds-on-two-western-hemisphere-nominees-over-cuba", "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/05/142020.htm"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:05:47.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
