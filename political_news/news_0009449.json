Columbus Day is typically a day where people catch up on shopping and errands, but it's also a time when people call and put in applications. The staff at Legal-Bay have noticed that during the more laid-back holidays, people spend time doing things that they've put off due to life's demands. Inquiring about a potential lawsuit or receiving a cash advance for an expected settlement or verdict is something many people do during this time, especially because with holidays typically comes more money spending. Legal-Bay understands the stress a lack of funds can put on people and their families, and it is for this reason that they try to help their clients the best they can, especially during the holidays. Most companies in the legal funding industry typically have an approval process with at least 48 hours, however, Legal-Bay has added additional staff in order to be able to fund more cases and accept more applications with an even faster turnaround time than just 24 hours. Legal-Bay also has low monthly usage rates â€“ less than 2% in some cases. Additionally, Legal-Bay is willing to assist those who have already received prior funding, while most companies don't assist plaintiffs who have previously received a lawsuit cash advance with another company.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140714/126845\nLegal-Bay, a lawsuit cash advance firm, is a lawsuit pre-settlement funding company that provides cash advances to plaintiffs while they're awaiting payments prior to case settlements. The cash advances are on a non-recourse basis, meaning the plaintiff only needs to repay the advance if the case is successful. Legal-Bay dos not buy the full claim but only advances a small portion of the expected settlement amount. Any fees or expenses accrued on the advance will be repaid by the plaintiff's lawyer if and when the case is officially settled and paid.\nChris Janish , CEO of Legal-Bay, commented on the company's commitment to assisting their clients during the holidays, \"As many people are taking off in observance of Columbus Day to catch up on errands, our company is focused on servicing our clients' needs. We anticipate a sharp rise in plaintiffs who are finally getting around to applying for a much needed cash advance.\"\nTo see the full list of cases Legal-Bay funds, or to apply for the 12-24-hour approval process on your lawsuit settlement funding request, visit: http://lawsuitssettlementfunding.com\nLegal-Bay's programs are non-recourse lawsuit cash advances, also known as case funding.
