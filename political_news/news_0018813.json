Erin Jonasson Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross says the tribunal's vice-president MIchael Lawler should ''potentially\" be investigated by New South Wales police for his covert recordings of their telephone conversations.\nJustice Ross also said he told Mr Lawler that his continued public involvement in the legal proceedings of his partner, the disgraced union leader Kathy Jackson, was damaging the commission and he should cease attending her court proceedings.\nAppearing before a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday,Justice Ross said he was \"profoundly disappointed\" by Mr Lawler recording their conversations and he regarded his conduct as a \"very serious matter'.\nHe said he expected the covert recordings to be investigated by the government-appointed investigator examining Mr Lawler's conduct and ''potentially New South Wales authorities''.\nMr Lawler admitted to the Four Corners program televised on Monday that he had covertly recorded telephone conversations with Justice Ross during which they discussed Mr Lawler's extended sick leave.\nOn the recording, Justice Ross told Mr Lawler that he would \"take responsibility for any amounts of sick leave you seek\" and \"there's no cap or anything like that\".\nJustice Ross later wrote to Mr Lawler stating: \"I reject the suggestion that I made any statement to you to the effect that you had unlimited entitlement to sick leave.\"\nDidn't know about recording Justice Ross told the hearing on Thursday that Mr Lawler did not inform him he was recording the conversation and he did not give his consent.\nHe revealed that Mr Lawler admitted himself to a psychiatric facility, later claiming he took the action after two contacts by the commission. Justice Ross said Mr Lawler later claimed the approaches while he was on sick leave amounted to ''harassment''.\nHe said he had approved 215 days of sick leave for Mr Lawler between May last year and July this year.\nHe said a psychiatrist's report, referenced on Four Corners , had been sought by him prior to Mr Lawler returning to work. The report found Mr Lawler was suffering a ''very significant major depressive order'', but also found he was fit to return to work in July.\nHe confirmed he did not approve Mr Lawler being granted leave to provide legal assistance to Ms Jackson. He said he did not agree with Mr Lawler's claim that there was nothing wrong with taking leave to help Ms Jackson defend herself or his claim that ''most Australians would regard that as an honorable and decent thing to do''.\n'I do not agree' ''If the vice president was suggesting there was nothing wrong with taking paid sick leave for the purpose of assisting your partner in legal proceedings, then I do not agree and I cannot think that most Australians would agree,'' he said.\nJustice Ross said Mr Lawler told him in an email in June this year that accompanying Ms Jackson to court proceedings would not be an action that would cause damage to the commission.\n''I informed him of my view that the reputation of the commission, and his own standing as a member, was being damaged by his continuing public involvement in the proceedings involving his partner and he should cease attending the proceedings in any capacity,'' he said.\nMr Lawler participated last year in a Federal Court mention involving Ms Jackson. Two weeks later, Justice Ross told him that any further involvement in her court proceedings would not be consistent with the principle that commission members should avoid involvement in matters of public controversy. He said he sought and received an assurance from Mr Lawler that he would not participate in other court proceedings.\nHe said he approved the sick leave based on Mr Lawler being medically unfit to perform his duties, not to assist Ms Jackson.\nHe said Mr Lawler was a statutory office holder, not an employee, and the terms and conditions of his appointment were governed by the former Workplace Relations Act.\nHe said there was no statutory regulation for the amount of of sick leave that Mr Lawler could take, or the process for approving it.\nJustice Ross said he had been advised that Mr Lawler was entitled to remuneration while in office. ''This means there are no circumstances in which the commission could withhold remuneration from a member even if, for example, the member were to absent himself or herself from the commission without seeking leave,'' he said.\nHe said Mr Lawler's leave was supported by medical certificates. Based on his personal observations, Justice Ross said he became concerned about Mr Lawler's wellbeing and his capacity to perform his duties.\nRestricted to unfair dismissal cases Justice Ross also submitted email correspondence between him and Mr Lawler, excerpts of which were read out by committee members.\nIn one email, Mr Lawler accuses commission members of leaking to the media about him. He urged Justice Ross to take action but Justice Ross told the committee that the allegations were not specified.\nIn another email, Mr Lawler called on Justice Ross to publicly defend him against a ''media campaign'' against him.\nJustice Ross said Mr Lawler had been largely restricted to handling unfair dismissal cases since returning to work in July.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-10-22T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:47:22.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
