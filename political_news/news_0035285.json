The Secretary of State’s Office partnered with the City of Jackson to auction 360 parcels in Hinds County with an estimated value of $14.6-Million. “Any funds received from these properties is a major win for the City of Jackson,” says Secretary Hosemann. “Selling these properties puts these parcels back on the tax rolls which generates revenue for schools, education and infrastructure.” “The strong response to the public auction is an indication of the growing enthusiasm for the continued revitalization of Mississippi’s capital city. These properties now have new ownership and our schools and entire community will benefit because of it,” says Mayor Yarber. Thus far, 187 properties tax-forfeited parcels have been approved for immediate sale for an approximate $793,000, with many properties still in the application process. “Partnering with local communities spotlights what is a growing problem in Mississippi and helps alleviate the tax-forfeited epidemic plaguing our State,” says Secretary Hosemann. “Properties sold in the auction will now be held in private ownership, which means someone will be responsible for these properties.” Over 1,666 bids were received for the Hinds County tax-forfeited auction.
