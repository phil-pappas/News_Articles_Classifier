Experts said the Microsoft remote desktop service wasn't intended for such use without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government and industry warnings at the time over attacks from even low-skilled intruders.\nRecords show that Clinton additionally operated two more devices on her home network in Chappaqua, New York, that also were directly accessible from the Internet. One contained similar remote-control software that also has suffered from security vulnerabilities, known as Virtual Network Computing, and the other appeared to be configured to run websites.\nThe new details provide the first clues about how Clinton's computer, running Microsoft's server software, was set up and protected when she used it exclusively over four years as secretary of state for all work messages. Clinton's privately paid technology adviser, Bryan Pagliano, has declined to answer questions about his work from congressional investigators, citing the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.\nSome emails on Clinton's server were later deemed top secret, and scores of others included confidential or sensitive information. Clinton has said that her server featured \"numerous safeguards,\" but she has yet to explain how well her system was secured and whether, or how frequently, security updates were applied.\nClinton has apologized for running her homebrew server, and President Barack Obama said during a \"60 Minutes\" interview Sunday it was \"a mistake.\" Obama said national security wasn't endangered, although the FBI still has yet to complete its review of Clinton's server for evidence of hacking.\nMore on this...
