Documents and photos that could shed a light on these practices are routinely denied to the public. “This secrecy adds to our concerns that what has happened to these animals would not stand up to public scrutiny,” says Mr Kriek. \nThe limited information available to the author of the report indicates widespread animal suffering, from calves born without bladders, liver failure, still births, limb deformities, abnormally large ovaries and a number of other health problems. \nSAFE is calling on the Government to halt the genetic engineering of animals and order the release of all documentation of past research so that the true extent of animal suffering can be evaluated. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
