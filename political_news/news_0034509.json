Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), under indictment on corruption charges, on Friday formally appealed recent decisions from a federal judge not to throw out a dozen counts against the senator. In a court document filed Friday, Menendez’s attorneys appealed the decisions from Judge William Walls to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The appeal is certain to prolong Menendez’s legal battle, which officially began in April when he was indicted on 14 federal corruption charges.\nWalls dismissed two of those counts against Menendez last month, saying the indictment did not support two charges of bribery that accused the senator of receiving bribes from Salomon Melgen when the wealthy eye doctor donated $40,000 in 2011 and 2012 to Menendez’s legal fund. Two felony charges against Melgen for allegedly making those payments were also dismissed.\nBut the federal judge ruled on Thursday that all of Menendez’s other charges will stand. In those rulings, which Menendez appealed, Walls rejected various arguments from Menendez to dismiss the charges.\nFor instance, Menendez argued that actions he took allegedly on behalf of Melgen – such as intervening in a Medicare dispute that the ophthalmologist had with the Department of Health and Human Services – were not “official acts” under bribery laws. The judge disagreed.\nMenendez and his legal team also contended that the charges were too vague – and that Justice Department lawyers did not identify what acts were allegedly part of Menendez and Melgen’s quid pro quo arrangement. Walls also disagreed with Menendez on that point.\nJudge tosses 2 bribery charges against Menendez By Josh Gerstein\n“The many official acts alleged in the indictment serve as circumstantial evidence of that Melgen’s payments were made and accepted with the intent to retain Menendez’s services on an as needed basis,” Walls wrote. “This provides more than sufficient factual orientation for the charges” of bribery, honest services fraud and conspiracy, the judge added.\nFederal prosecutors have accused Menendez of taking nearly $1 million worth of lavish gifts and campaign contributions from Melgen in exchange for using his Senate office to enrich Melgen and his business interests. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nThe senator’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, had previously indicated that Menendez would appeal to the Supreme Court if needed, and a trial in the Menendez case will likely not occur until fall 2016. Menendez also tried to move his trial from Newark to Washington, D.C.; that request was also denied.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:12:34.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
