But Jonathan Toews, who played for Hakstol for two seasons at North Dakota, thinks he’ll do just fine.\n“He’s a good coach; obviously had a lot of success [at North Dakota],” Toews said. “I don’t know how many times he brought his team to the Frozen Four (seven times in 11 years). Year after year, I think it’s a tough thing — especially in college when you’re losing payers every couple of years — to have success the way they did. So it’s pretty amazing. He’s a great motivator.”\nHe’s also a pretty serious guy, which might explain why he and Toews fared so well together, reaching the Frozen Four in both of his seasons, 2006 and 2007. The coach’s glare is the stuff of legends.\n“You can feel it in the back of your head sometimes when you’re sitting on the bench,” Toews said.\nToews said the speed and physicality of the college game is better than most people think. Where Hakstol will have to adjust, he said, is in managing the personalities and egos of professionals rather than kids.\n“The dynamic in the locker room is completely different, considering you have guys that have been professionals for a number of years,” Toews said. “It’s just a whole different animal in the way you talk and the way you treat your players.”\nAs for what Toews was like as a college kid, well, you can probably guess.\n“Probably just a little bit younger version of what you guys see today,” Hakstol said. “Always very composed, very focused. Hard-working. Good teammate. … Jonny always put the team first.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:12:43.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
