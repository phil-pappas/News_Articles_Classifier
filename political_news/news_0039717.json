A land mass? But they also know that if they are honest, they will be defending the indefensible. So they start their campaign with an untruth.\" \nIt came as the Leave.EU campaign launched a petition to highlight so-called media bias around reporting of the In campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe. \nArron Banks, founder of the group, said: \"The question that the Electoral Commission has recommended in the forthcoming referendum is 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?’ Therefore we believe ALL reporting by the British media should reflect that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:35:58.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
