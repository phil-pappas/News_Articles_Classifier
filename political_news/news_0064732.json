Larry Serafini had been serving as interim director; he’ll return to his previous role as deputy director of facilities.\nRondinella starts Nov. 13 and will be paid $200,000 annually. \nHis contract is for one year, which county spokeswoman Jean Pasco said “aligns with the annual review process for employees.” County executives will determine whether his contract should be renewed and for how long, she said.\nRondinella, 54, is a licensed commercial pilot and a veteran of the U.S. Air Force. \nHe’s been Los Angeles World Airport’s director of operations since 2010 and previously was deputy director of operations at Sacramento’s airport and airport director for Stockton Metropolitan Airport and the Santa Maria Public Airport.\nRondinella said by phone Tuesday he’s looking forward to meeting neighboring residents and businesses.\n“One of my primary goals is to establish open and candid lines of communication,” he said.\nIn a news release, Todd Spitzer, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, called Rondinella “extremely qualified and collaborative.”\n“It’s essential to have an airport director whose highest priorities are to protect the community and honor the (noise) curfew,” Spitzer said.\nThe airport is undergoing a litany of safety and aesthetic improvements under a $102 million contract approved by supervisors Oct. 4. The work will include earthquake retrofitting, upgraded smoke detectors and fire safety equipment, as well as new carpet, rehabbed restaurants, and better lighting, heating and cooling systems.\nNew international and domestic flights also are bringing more people to the airport. Monthly traffic numbers increased 12 percent in August, the second biggest uptick since 2007. \nAnd the increases don’t look to be slowing down anytime soon. Southwest Airlines plans to add nonstop routes to Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis on Nov. 22, and Alaska Airlines this month added flights to Puerto Vallarta and Los Cabos, Mexico.\nContact the writer: mcuniff@ocregister.com or on Twitter: @meghanncuniff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:26:57.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
