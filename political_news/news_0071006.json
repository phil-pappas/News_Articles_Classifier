The two organizations, with representatives from Ford Motor Credit, will hold a seminar Nov. 7 at the Burgundy Basin Inn as part of BBB Foundation’s consumer education series.“I am frequently asked to speak to groups on how to buy a car so welcomed this opportunity to take my message and insight to a larger audience of consumers,” Genesee Valley Motors owner Dom Genova said. “We want to help educate customers on how to navigate the car buying process, make informed decisions and not get snookered.” BBB President Warren Clark said the organization receives calls every day to inquire about car dealerships, television ads or to ask questions after customers have purchased cars.“We want to let people know they can use us as a resource before they make any car buying decision,” Clark said in a statement. Consumers can register for the seminar by visiting this link . Proceeds from the $15 event will benefit the BBB Foundation.
