Tennessee's planned closure comes less than a week after Kentucky decided to also close its doors after financial troubles.\nThe decision means only 17 insurance co-ops are left. The co-ops were created by the Affordable Care Act to offer more competition in the insurance marketplace exchanges.\nBut the co-ops have been plagued by financial troubles since they went online. Co-ops received more than $2 billion in federal funding as of December 2014.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Republicans set up viewing room for Planned Parenthood videos House Oversight Committee has received the footage Chaffetz subpoenaed from the videos' producer.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/14/15 2:31 PM The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wrote to the co-op called Community Health Alliance in late September with concerns about its financial viability.\nThe agency, which oversees the co-ops, noted that the Tennessee insurer had issues processing enrollees and transactions due to problems with its software vendor. The problems led to consumer complaints.\nCMS was also concerned about the co-op's viability. The insurer has 29,773 members and planned to increase its membership, but it has since raised rates by 44 percent.\nThe agency wondered what effect the rate hike would have on its financial viability.\nThe problem is one experienced by several co-ops, which initially offered lower premiums that drove people to enroll. However, the insurance startups didn't have enough money to pay off medical claims, leading to financial troubles.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner White House isn't sure how Clinton read TPP text The final text of the trade deal hasn't been made public yet.\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/14/15 2:26 PM The agency put the Tennessee co-op on an oversight plan that required the insurer to submit monthly financial and complaint reports.\nThe co-op urged its customers to find a new plan through the next open enrollment which begins Nov. 1.
