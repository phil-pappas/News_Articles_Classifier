(Andrew Theen/The Oregonian) Comments \nAs Portland's dry spring carried into summer and fall, the Water Bureau has increasingly relied on its secondary water supply. \nPortland has used about 4.5 billion gallons from its backup well fields this year , the most since 1987. The system has been activated for 90 days, with nonstop use since mid-July. \n\"A lot of people around here are sitting around waiting for the rains to fall,\" said Scott Bradway, water quality program manager. \nPortland's Bull Run Watershed about 26 miles east of downtown is the city's main water source. The protected area in the Mount Hood National Forest is fed by rain and snowmelt. \nIt doesn't take a meteorologist to explain there's been little of either for months. \nBradway said Tuesday that the Bull Run has about 1.7 billion gallons of water now, roughly 16 percent of its capacity.

Historically, the Bull Run has more than 4 billion gallons of water in October, more than twice the current total. \nBut Bradway said there's no cause for alarm, saying the city can meet the 100 million gallon per day needs for the city through the fall and winter. Portland's historical water use at the Bull Run, according to city figures. Courtesy of Portland Water Bureau \nPortland's peak daily water demand is 150 million gallons per day. \nMeanwhile, Portland is still drawing down its two Bull Run reservoirs, Bradway said. \nThe record for the latest date the reservoirs began refilling was Dec. 6, 1976, spokeswoman Jaymee Cuti said in an email. \nPortland typically needs 4 inches of rain during a two-week period to see significant reservoir filling. \nHeavy rain can move the dial more quickly. Last October, two days of heavy rain added more than 1.8 billion gallons to the Bull Run. \n\"Come spring, our reservoirs will be full,\" Bradway said. \n-- Andrew Theen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:50:12.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
