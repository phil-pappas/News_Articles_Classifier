I support President Obama's effort to combat the Islamic State in Syria while at the same time supporting those in Syria trying to overthrow the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Assad,\" Sanders added. On Friday, Clinton recommended that the U.S. implement a no-fly zone in Syria. \"I personally would be advocating for a no-fly zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage from the ground and on the air,\" Clinton said on CNN affiliate WHDH. President Barack Obama distanced himself Friday from his former secretary of state's position, warning against \"easy, low-cost answers\" to ending the war. Asked to respond directly to her suggestion, he said that one's perspective changes when they become president. \"I think Hillary Clinton would be the first to say that when you're sitting in the seat that I'm sitting in in the situation room, things look a little bit different. Because she's been right there next to me,\" he said. He also said, \"I also think there's a difference between running for president and being president.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:09:18.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
