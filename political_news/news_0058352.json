Bernard Sanders took a veiled jab at Clinton over DOMA. (Photo courtesy Sanders’ Senate website). Following a strong week for Hillary Clinton, the presidential candidate mounting the strongest challenge against her for the Democratic nomination is ramping up his offensive — and gay rights is among his weapons of his choice.\nDuring his remarks Saturday at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S. Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) made a veiled criticism of Clinton for recent remarks the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act was a “defensive” act to prevent worse anti-gay discrimination. \nSanders recalled being a member of the U.S. House at the time and among the 57 lawmakers in the Republican-controlled chamber to vote against DOMA, which was signed into by President Bill Clinton. \n“That was not a political, easy vote,” Sanders said. “Now today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. That’s not the case. There was a small minority in the House opposed to discrimination against our gay brothers and sisters, and I am proud that I was one of those members.” \nIn his prepared remarks, Sanders was supposed to say, “Not everybody held that position in 1996,” but he dropped that line in favor saying he was proud to vote against DOMA. \nSanders makes the remarks on DOMA one day after Hillary Clinton appeared on “The Rachel Maddow Show” and asserted the 1996 law — as well as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” — was a “defensive” act and “political momentum” without DOMA would have led to enactment of U.S. constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage entirely. \nThe Vermont senator also identified gay people as among the minorities he wouldn’t throw under the bus if elected president — another possible reference to Clinton and her lack of support for marriage equality under 2013. \n“I will not abandon any segment of American society – whether you’re gay or black or Latino or poor or working class – just because it is politically expedient at a given time,” Sanders said. \nThe veiled criticism from Sanders against Hillary Clinton on gay rights was one issue among several Sanders brought up to take the Democratic front-runner to task — even though during his entire speech the Vermont senator never explicitly named Hillary Clinton. \nSanders also drew a contrast with Clinton by saying he has no Super PAC, unlike the Democratic front-runner, and is largely funded small donors whose average contribution is $30. On the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Sanders made a veiled reference to Clinton’s changing views, saying, “I did not support it yesterday. I do not support it today. And I will not support it tomorrow.” \nThe veiled criticism against Clinton from Sanders is striking because he’s resisted earlier opportunities to criticize her and sworn he wouldn’t go negative over the course of his presidential campaign. Sanders gets fiery as the media declared Clinton the victor in the first Democratic debate and reported she came out on top during her recent testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. \nSanders invoked the presidential candidate of another U.S. senator who challenged Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination eight years ago — and was ultimately successful in besting her. \n“Eight years ago the experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president, Barack Obama, couldn’t win,” Sanders said. “How he was unelectable. Well Iowa, I think we’re going to prove the pundits wrong again. I believe we will make history.” \nThe Clinton campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request to comment on Sanders’ veiled criticism against the former secretary of state. \nBut Sanders wasn’t the only candidate who invoked LGBT rights on stage at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner. In a speech ranging from promoting gun safety laws, protecting reproductive rights and building the middle class, Clinton said she’s fighting for “LGBT Americans, who despite all our progress, can get married on Saturday and fired on Monday in a lot of state just because of who they are and who they love.” \nClinton also identified her work on international LGBT rights when recalling her accomplishment as a secretary of state. \n“As your secretary of state, I fought for human rights, women’s rights, LGBT rights, internet freedom, American jobs and security,” she said. \nFormer Martin O’Malley repeated lines on LGBT rights he uttered during the first Democratic presidential debate, saying young people under 30 aren’t willing to deny rights to gay couples. \nMaking the case he’s who’s acted, not just spoken, in favor of progressive values, O’Malley invoked the passage of marriage equality under his watch in 2012. \n“With fifteen years of executive experience — as mayor and as a governor — I have learned how to be a very effective leader,” O’Malley said. “I have learned how to get things done. I am clear about my principles.” \nPerhaps in reference to Clinton’s evolution on marriage equality, O’Malley said the United States needs “someone with the courage to stand up for what’s right — even when it’s not always popular.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:29:07.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
