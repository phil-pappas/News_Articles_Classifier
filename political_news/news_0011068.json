Paul LePage is fueling the notion that there are two Maines — the wealthy south, and the less-prosperous north. The Republican governor told about 100 people in Lewiston that lawmakers from southern Maine dominate the legislative process with the intent of keeping prosperity for themselves. The Sun Journal (http://bit.ly/1OBP2dK ) reported that the governor said, \"People in the south part of Maine will not allow people in northern Maine to earn a good living.\" He added, \"I know it sounds hard and cruel, but it's a fact.\" He referred specifically to failed efforts to ease restrictions on mineral mining in northern Maine. In July, LePage scolded a Cape Elizabeth resident in a handwritten note, saying she lives in a region where people \"exploit those who are not so fortunate.\" seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 12:40 PM » Comment or view comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:35:07.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
