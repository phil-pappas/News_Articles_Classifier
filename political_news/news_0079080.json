Mr Goldsmith was elected with 70% of the vote following an online primary and will face-off with Labour's choice Sadiq Khan in the 2016 mayoral election.\nMr Goldsmith, 40, said the main priority for London was to deal with the pressure created by a growing number of people flocking to a city that is seeing unprecedented investment.\nThe Richmond Park and North Kingston MP is a staunch opponent of Heathrow expansion and expanding the congestion charge and says air quality was fast becoming a priority.\n\"Our living environment is facing increasing pressure, and we will need to protect, enhance and improve access to our green spaces, as well as radically improving the quality of the air that we breathe,\" he said.\nPlay video \"Sadiq Khan Will Work With Corbyn\" Video: Sadiq Khan Will Work With Corbyn But the main issue for London is the housing crisis and Mr Goldsmith told Sky News that the solution to this requires three things, most of which the city already has.\n\"You need land – and we have stacks of brownfield publicly-owned land… (Transport for London) alone owns land that, if you put it together, would be the equivalent of Camden. We can prise that land away from the public bodies and we can build on it.\n\"You need planning – that’s a political issue, a political problem which the mayor and the local authorities can deal with.\n\"You need finance and the one thing London is not short of is people wanting to invest in our property.\n\"Put those together and you can create a very ambitious house building programme for Londoners.\nPlay video \"Goldsmith On Heathrow Expansion\" Video: Goldsmith On Heathrow Expansion \"The key is that you build well – it’s not all about quantity, it’s also about quality.
