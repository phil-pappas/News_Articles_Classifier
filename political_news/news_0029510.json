To improve these statistics and to celebrate Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month, local volunteers for the Dallas – Fort Worth Affiliate of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network are calling on the community to join them in the movement to rewrite the future for pancreatic cancer at PurpleStride DFW , presented by Bell Nunnally & Martin LLP and Goldman Sachs .\nThe 5K timed run and awareness walk taking place on Sunday, Nov. 8, 2015 will raise awareness and funds for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, the national organization committed to advancing research, supporting patients and creating hope.\nRegister today at purplestride.org/dfw .\nParticipants will Wage Hope in honor of those currently battling the disease, like Dallas resident Darshonnia Lee who has bravely been fighting pancreatic cancer for over a year.\nLee was fortunate to be diagnosed at an early stage after undergoing tests for an unrelated condition. When reviewing test results, Lee's doctor noticed a shadow on her liver. After several tests, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery one month later.\n\"With no early diagnostic tools, I consider myself incredibly lucky that I was diagnosed as early on as I was; a feeling sadly that many of my fellow survivors do not get to share,\" said Lee. \"That is why I have joined the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, to advance research and ensure patients receive the support and information that they need when facing this disease.\"\nParticipants will also Wage Hope as a tribute to those who have passed away from the disease, including mother and daughter Gertie Gramlich and Cindy Toth . Gertie and Cindy were diagnosed within 16 days of one another and passed less than six months later, just 17 days apart. Gertie's daughter and Cindy's sister Dianna has since joined the fight against pancreatic cancer and is committed to doubling survival of pancreatic cancer by 2020. Dianna will be joined by friends and family at the event to honor her mother and sister.\nWith more supporters and participants, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network can make strides toward its 2020 goal and accelerate its proven approach to fighting the disease. The strategy combines research, builds and sustains federal support, provides support for individuals and families living with the disease through its unique patient services and raises awareness in communities across the country.\nNearly 49,000 individuals will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year and more than 40,000 will die from the disease.\nPurpleStride DFW Honorary Chairs include Muhammad Shaalan Beg, MD of UT Southwestern Medical Center, Scott Celinski , MD, FACS of Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas , D. Rohan Jeyarajah ,MD FACS of Methodist Dallas Medical Center, and G. Thomas Shires III , MD of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\nAdditional sponsors include:\nPresenting sponsors: Bell Nunnally & Martin LLP and Goldman Sachs Gold Sponsor: The Carrell Clinic and UT Southwestern Harold C.
