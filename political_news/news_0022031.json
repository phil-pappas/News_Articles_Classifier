Walker raised about $7.4 million in run for president \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Gov. Scott Walker raised about $7.4 million in his short-lived campaign for president and spent about $6.4 million before dropping out after 71 days in the race, campaign finance reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission showed. \nWalker reported having less than $1 million cash on hand at the end of September, just over a week after he dropped out of the race. He reported owing about $161,000 as of Sept. 30, but the report does not show ongoing costs beyond that point that Walker will have to pay. \nWalker left the race as fundraising could not keep up with the expenses of maintaining a campaign operation that grew to around 90 staff members located around the country. He decided to drop out rather than take on debt, or significantly scale back his operation, in the face of a steep decline in poll numbers in key early voting states. \nTwo of the people he paid to be on staff were his college-aged sons, Matt and Alex. They were paid about $1,500 a month, for a total of about $4,800 each, the filings showed. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said they had part-time jobs at campaign headquarters and returned to school when fall semester started. \nWalker paid his campaign manager Rick Wiley nearly $52,000 for three months of work, which equates to about $208,000 a year. His campaign communications director, Kirsten Kukowski, was paid roughly the same amount. \n“There were a lot of different factors, obviously different candidates, different situations, different staff,” Walker said on Wednesday when asked on WTMJ radio about reasons for his abrupt departure. “All of those things come. Instead of doing what a lot of candidates do and whine about this, that or whatever, for me I accept it for what it is.” \nWiley said at the time he dropped out that the campaign faced about $800,000 in bills, with around $1 million to pay them, and Walker decided to drop out rather than go into debt as costs would eventually exceed donations. \n___ Bill dissolving Wisconsin elections board advances \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Democrats argued Thursday they were being bullied by Republicans but were unable to stop a fast-tracked bill doing away with Wisconsin’s unique nonpartisan elections board from moving one step closer to passage. \nIn a heated committee meeting, where one Democrat pounded his first on the table, Republicans voted as a bloc to advance the bill eliminating the Government Accountability Board which oversees elections, campaign finance, ethics and lobbying laws. \nIn its place, two new commissions overseeing elections and ethics run by partisan appointees would be created, doing away with the current board of six nonpartisan former judges. Republican backers say that will create a more transparent process, while Democratic opponents say it will only lead to gridlock and the opportunity for more political corruption. \nThe bill is rocketing through the Legislature, with its introduction, public hearing and committee vote happening in a week. The full Assembly was scheduled to vote on passing it Wednesday. \nIt was originally scheduled to be up Tuesday, but Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos agreed to delay it by one day after complaints from Democrats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:52:52.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
