If all goes according to plan, Anheuser-Busch InBev could swallow up rival SABMiller for a whopping $106 billion.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 13, 2015 | 6:00 p.m. EDT + More SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev announced Tuesday that the duo had finally agreed \" in principle \" to the terms of a multibillion-dollar deal that would put iconic brands like Miller, Stella Artois, Foster's, Budweiser and Corona all under one corporate roof.\nThe companies' combined sales in 2014 clocked in at around $70 billion – effectively giving them control of nearly a third of the international beer market – and they collectively employ more than 200,000 workers in dozens of countries. It's expected that Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose revenue last year more than doubled that of SABMiller, will shell out around $106 billion to acquire its former rival's stable of products.\nRELATED\nBrew Without Borders: What's the Best City to Buy a Beer? But the transaction isn't a done deal just yet: The final tab will still need to garner shareholder approval, though the market response to Tuesday's announcement was largely positive. Anheuser-Busch shares were up more than 2 percent in midday trading, and SABMiller stocks soared more than 8.6 percent.\nThe megamerger will also need a green light from international regulators, however, which could be a tough sell given the sheer size of the deal. Officials in the U.S. and China, in particular, are expected to offer resistance, especially considering U.S. Justice Department regulators previously sued to obstruct Anheuser-Busch InBev's acquisition of Grupo Modelo (the Mexico-based maker of Corona) in 2013. A proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner Cable was notably blocked earlier this year.\nTake Quiz\nAre You a Beer Expert? The Justice Department is also investigating Anheuser-Busch InBev over allegations that its recent purchases of beer distributors limit increasingly popular craft brewers from selling their products, according to Reuters . Although the probe is unrelated to the potential SABMiller acquisition, it's clear that regulators in the U.S. are keeping an eye on the beer behemoth. Analysts generally expect a long road ahead before any kind of acquisition is finalized.\nBut deals like this one are hardly out of the ordinary in the firm-eat-firm world of international beer-making. Both Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are themselves amalgamations of dozens of individual brewing establishments and have been decades in the making.\nU.S. News breaks down some of history's most notable brewing buyouts that could culminate in the single largest beer-related acquisition in history.\nTAGS: food and drink business economy", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Anheuser-Busch%20InBev%20and%20SABMiller%20Latest%20in%20Long%20Line%20of%20Beer%20Mergers", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Anheuser-Busch%20InBev%20and%20SABMiller%20Latest%20in%20Long%20Line%20of%20Beer%20Mergers", "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/justice-dept-seeks-to-block-anheusers-deal-for-modelo/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Anheuser-Busch%20InBev%20and%20SABMiller%20Latest%20in%20Long%20Line%20of%20Beer%20Mergers&summary=Today%27s%20biggest%20beer%20titans%20are%20mostly%20Frankenstein-esque%20mashups%20of%20smaller%20breweries.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5v37%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/12/us-abinbev-doj-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKCN0S623R20151012", "http://www.ab-inbev.com/content/dam/universaltemplate/abinbev/pdf/investors/13October2015/Agreement%20in%20principle%20and%20extension%20of%20PUSU%20deadline%20-%2013%20October%202015.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:11:40.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
