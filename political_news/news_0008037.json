The tapes come after a nearly three-year-long undercover operation organized by the group's founder, David Daleiden. CMP has also released more than 10 hours of uncut footage, as well as audio transcripts and several lengthy mini-documentaries.\nPlanned Parenthood maintains that the tapes have been deceptively edited so as to give the impression that it is engaged in unethical and likely illegal behavior. Some reporters have responded to the scandal by giving Planned Parenthood a platform to accuse CMP of spreading falsehoods, while others have reported that the videos are intentionally misleading.\n\"Planned Parenthood … says that the videos were deceptively and misleading edited,\" read a New York Times report authored by Jackie Calmes .\n  Hillary: 'I'm just getting warmed up' \n \nBy Curt Mills • 10/25/15 12:10 AM Mother Jones' Molly Redden reported that, \"a little-known anti-abortion activist named David Daleiden ignited a firestorm by releasing two selectively edited videos.\"\nMic's Gregory Kreig said CMP had released, \"secretly recorded and selectively edited videos.\" And for Salon's Sohpia Tesfaye , the videos are \"heavily\" and \"deceptively\" edited.\nAnd there are several additional examples .\nThough many of these reporters claim that the tapes have been deceptively edited, none of the 15 reporters contacted this week by the Washington Examiner's media desk said they watched the uncut footage, and only one responded directly to being asked about the uncut tapes.\nThe Huffington Post's Samantha Lachman, who specifically referred to the tapes as \" selectively edited ,\" would not say whether she had watched them. She instead directed the Examiner's attention to a Planned Parenthood-commissioned study that claimed the videos have been doctored. That study was done by Fusion GPS, which said the videos were \"secretly recorded and selectively edited.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pharmacies skirt regs to compete against high prices By making special formulations, compounding pharmacies don't need FDA approval of competing drugs.\nBy Robert King • 10/25/15 12:01 AM The Examiner asked Lachman a second time whether she had watched all of the videos. She did not respond.\nTwo Washington Post reporters declined to comment, and instead referred the Examiner to the newspaper's spokeswoman.\nThe spokeswoman, Kris Coratti, defended reporters Sandhya Somashekhar and Abby Ohlheiser and their coverage of the scandal by telling the Examiner, \"The fact is, in their extensive coverage of this issue, they made repeated reference to both the edited and longer footage posted by the Center for Medical Progress. In addition, they reported on exchanges captured in the longer videos that did not make the shorter cut.\"\nThe CMP videos have sparked multiple investigations by Congress, and several states have moved to defund the \"women's health organization.\" Planned Parenthood's go-to defense in all that time has been to claim that the CMP videos are grossly doctored.\n\"We know that the videos Mr. Daleiden has released were deceptively edited to smear Planned Parenthood. They omit exculpatory passages and splice excerpts together to create false impressions,\" the group's president, Cecile Richards, said in an August letter addressed to Congress.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Meet the three Republicans likely to vie for Ryan's Ways and Means gavel Pat Tiberi of Ohio, Kevin Brady of Texas and Devin Nunes of California are all running for the position.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/25/15 12:01 AM \"Our analysis of the videos released by Mr. Daledien documents numerous instances where the videos have been heavily edited to change the meaning of what Planned Parenthood staff said and deceive the public,\" she added, referring to the findings from Fusion GPS, which has strong ties to the Democratic Party .\nFusion GPS did not address questions surrounding one CMP video showing Planned Parenthood's Deborah Nucatola, who has served as the organization's senior director of medical services since 2009, discussing \"doing a little better than\" breaking even for donated organs. The commissioned study also failed to address footage showing Planned Parenthood affiliates seemingly discussing performing partial birth abortions so as to keep specific organs intact.\nIt is illegal to profit from the donation of fetal tissue. It is also illegal under federal law to perform partial birth abortions.\nThere is nothing in the hours and hours of CMP's uncut footage that changes the context and spirit of Nucatola's remarks, or the remarks by affiliates who apparently perform partial birth abortions.\nAnd both Fusion GPS and the press have failed to explain how Planned Parenthood affiliates have been taken out of context by CMP's editing.\nTop Story Trump: I tried to tell Carson about his Iowa lead 'but he was sleeping'   while Trump lagged behind.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/24/15 1:10 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:29:51.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
