It emerged last month that millions of VW vehicles worldwide were fitted with so-called \"defeat devices\" - where software was used to fool American environmental tests.\nThe software switched engines to a cleaner mode when they underwent official exhaust testing - and meant true emission levels, as much as 40 times the level legally allowed in the US, were hidden.\nThe scandal has affected 11 million vehicles globally, including almost 1.2 million in the UK, with recalls due to begin in the first quarter of 2016, starting with two-litre models.\nVW's UK managing director Paul Willis, appearing before the Commons Transport Committee, apologised \"sincerely and unreservedly\" to customers and admitted the car maker \"mishandled the situation\".\nPlay video \"VW USA President Says Sorry\" Video: VW USA President Says Sorry He said: \"Our engines behaved differently within the testing regime to real world and that's why we need to fix the cars.\n\"That's why we need to get the customers in and put the cars right.\"\nMr Willis said 400,000 vehicles would need changes to their fuel injection systems as well as having the software removed.\nPlay video \"VW Boss Appears Before Congress\" Video: VW Boss Appears Before Congress He said he wanted the recall work to be completed by the end of next year, though there was a \"risk\" that the target would not be met.\nAnd he insisted that engineers were being told to make sure the fuel efficiency of the cars involved was not reduced by the changes.\nMr Willis said the first VW fitted with the pollution test-cheating software was sold in the UK in 2008 - and more than 1,000 cars were sold after the revelations emerged last month.\nPlay video \"VW Recall 'In 2016'\" Video: VW Recall 'In 2016' He said he first heard of the scandal on the news on 19 September and told the committee: \"I couldn't stop selling cars if I didn't know which cars were affected.\"\nDefending the speed of the car firm's response to the scandal, he said he received those details on 30 September, eight days after it emerged Europe was affected.\nHe said he halted sales within hours of confirming which particular models were affected and could not have acted any faster.\nPlay video \"VW Scandal: Car Rigging Explained\" Video: VW Scandal: Car Rigging Explained There are claims that the scandal was caused by a couple of software engineers in Germany but Mr Willis did not know whether this was the case.\nHe admitted sales and orders for VW vehicles were down \"a little bit\" since the scandal broke, but that the company's other brands were selling as would normally be expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:41:53.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
