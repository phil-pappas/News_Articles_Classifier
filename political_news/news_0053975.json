Lawmakers in Utah’s House ... more > By Tom Howell Jr. - The Washington Times - Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nIt’s still far too easy for undeserving Obamacare enrollees to get taxpayer subsidies on the law’s exchanges, and some customers are getting both Medicaid and tax credits under the law, government auditors said Thursday in written testimony to Congress. \nThe findings, delivered by the Government Accountability Office to the House Energy and Commerce and Senate Finance committees, raise doubts about the program less than two weeks before Americans flock to the overhaul’s marketplace. \nThey also demonstrate that a key problem the GAO uncovered last year — fake enrollees can get covered — continues to be a problem. \n“Our undercover testing for the 2015 coverage year found that the healthcare marketplace eligibility determination and enrollment process remains vulnerable to fraud,” wrote Seto Bagdoyan, the GAO’s director of forensic audits and investigative service. \nAuditors said all 10 of their fictitious applicants were able to get coverage in state-run exchanges in California and Kentucky and federally operated exchanges in North Dakota and New Jersey, even though eight of them were initially rejected during an ID check at the front end of the system. Four of the applicants used Social Security numbers that have never been issued, auditors said. \nIn addition, seven out of eight fake applicants for Medicaid — the government health program for the poor — were able to obtain coverage or subsidized exchange plans instead. \nTheir applications were buoyed by false Social Security information and, in one case, a fake immigration card. Only one applicant was denied, after California demanded a Social Security of taxpayer-ID number. \nThe Affordable Care Act established two main streams of coverage for the uninsured — web-based exchanges where customers can shop for private plans with the help of taxpayer subsidies, and the expansion of Medicaid coverage in the 29 states, plus, D.C., that have opted in so far. \nYet the GAO said the administration is not doing enough to prevent people from double dipping, as an estimated 7 million people could toggle between the programs because their incomes are so volatile. \nIt also has a hard time differentiating between eligibility groups, so that states get the correct amount in federal matching funds from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \n“Consequently, we concluded that CMS cannot identify erroneous expenditures due to incorrect eligibility determinations, which also limits its ability to ensure that state expenditures are appropriately matched with federal funds,” Carolyn L. Yocum, the GAO’s director of health care, said in prepared testimony. \nThe GAO said electronic records are not always updated in real time to reflect a person’s transition between the programs, which may also expose enrollees to gaps in coverage. \nInvestigators said taxpayers may be billed twice, and that individuals who double-dip would be liable for Obamacare subsidies they received while on Medicaid. \nAs part of its separate, undercover investigation, the GAO said fake applicants were able to get exchange coverage in part because officials only look for documentation that’s been clearly altered. \n“Thus, if the documentation submitted does not show such signs, it would not be questioned for authenticity,” Mr. Bagdoyan wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:26:18.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
