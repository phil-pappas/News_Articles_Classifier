Why they use this trash is anybody’s guess. It is a type of super mellow flute noise that sounds like it is played by a 110 year old senile bagpiper. It is so annoying the customers all turn on their speaker phones. It is so terrible that it will make a person drop the call and deal with their problem another way: emails, in person or smoke signals, anything but the telephone.\n–\n–\nSome of the crap below is actually worse that my company’s hold music. This stuff must be designed to make callers who have a beef with the specific company hang up before they have a meltdown.\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–\n–", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/00O27WkYq-Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jj0ChLVTpaA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5v8sWAU3rI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMDdbvdcdm8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQvN1Ahck6w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markosun.wordpress.com/37422/", "https://markosun.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hold.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xV9lcXxzqw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://markosun.wordpress.com//feed/https://markosun.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hold.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHt8gNeoS9c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markosun.wordpress.com/37422/", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=markosun.wordpress.com&#038;blog=10835220&#038;post=37422&#038;subd=markosun&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:31:41.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
