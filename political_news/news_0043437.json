Once one of the most stable sectors of the American economy, health care is in the throes of unprecedented change, driven by a potent mix of technological advances and mandates to contain costs and improve quality. At the forefront of this transformation is the Mayo Clinic , one of the nation's leading health systems, which cares for more than 1.3 million patients annually in its own hospitals and many more indirectly through the Mayo Clinic Care Network. The network is made up of 35 independent hospitals or systems that have satisfied Mayo quality standards and have been granted access to Mayo intellectual support and, for highly complex patients who can't be treated at home, fast-tracked clinical services.\nU.S. News Hospital of Tomorrow keynote speaker Dr. John Noseworthy, president and chief executive officer at Mayo Clinic, spoke with U.S. News about some of the changes affecting the nation's health care system and Mayo's approach to improving health care for tens of thousands of patients inside – and outside – its walls. (The interview has been edited for clarity and length.)\n[ READ: Health Care Industry Rethinks Leadership, Delivery of Care ]\nWhat are two or three of the biggest health system changes over the last year?\nDr. John Noseworthy is president and CEO of the Mayo Clinic. There's a very strong focus on transparency that will [uncover] a lot of sins, [shedding light on] quality and safety and all of the parameters that the consumer is increasingly going to be paying attention to – as are payers. And we are transitioning, hopefully, from process measures [Did the doctor prescribe aspirin?] to outcomes measures [How did the patient do?], though that's still in the early days. The outcomes that we measure are death, falls, retained foreign objects [following surgery], hospital-acquired infections, and those kinds of things. More complex aspects of health care, such as efficiency, accuracy, and appropriateness of care, are more difficult to measure, but we'll find ways to get there.\n[Measuring outcomes] is terribly important; this is an appropriate direction for medicine to go. Patients should know about [their hospital's performance]. Actually, hospital administrators should know about [the push to develop better ways of measuring their performance], so they can drive higher quality, which will then ultimately translate into payment for better outcomes. That's the general direction in which the government is going, and the payers [such as self-insured employers and insurance companies] will follow. This is huge, it's a good thing, and it's a big change. [The big question is] just how that change is managed, so that appropriate incentives and sharing of data are all put in place.\nWhat other developments strike you as critically important?\nMergers of four of the five largest private insurers obviously is big news, as is Secretary [of Health and Human Services Sylvia] Burwell's declaration that CMS [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] is going to pay for [improved] outcomes in a very aggressive timeframe. The repeal of the sustainable growth rate formula [which calculated the fees that Medicare paid doctors] also has [propelled the development of] alternate payment models and gotten everybody working pretty hard together.\n[ READ: Health Care’s Future Hinges On Smart Use of Technology, Other Resources ]\nConsolidation has become a powerful force in the health care marketplace. What are your thoughts on this trend?\nFor the private sector, such as bio-tech, pharma, device companies and so on, to work together with payers and providers to come up with solutions that work in a STEM-innovation country is a good thing. … But [a push by hospitals to] get bigger so that we can have purchasing power on the back end – on the business side of life – and not deliver it to the patient in the form of better care, that's [a problem]. We decided not to go with consolidation – to get bigger by owning more hospitals, so we can drive out costs and win. Ours is a much more patient-centered, front-line approach to deliver the knowledge to the patient so that they get better care, saving money that way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:54:47.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
