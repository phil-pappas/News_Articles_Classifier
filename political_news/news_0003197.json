Rick Snyder. \nThe law takes effect in three months. \nSnyder, who signed it Wednesday, says the goal is to modernize government and make everyday life easier for residents. \nThe governor also signed a budget bill providing $4.3 million more to intermediate school districts to increase the number of half-day slots in a preschool program. Another new law renames a portion of U.S. 12 in Berrien Highway for Steven DeVries, a state trooper shot and killed while apprehending a bank robber in 1972. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
