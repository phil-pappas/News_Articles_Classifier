Paducah police say he kidnapped three people and threatened to kill them. Vernon Ward, 58, is accused of confronting a woman he knew, her son, and another young man with a gun. Police say Ward thought one of them stole his marijuana. Ward forced the two young men at gunpoint to go to the woman's house, then forced all three into his car. The victims told police, Ward threatened several times to kill them. Investigators say Ward pointed his gun at the woman. Her son then fought with Ward, pulled out a knife, and stabbed him in the neck and head. Ward crashed into another vehicle and all three victims got away.
