Posted on 0 \nI am a registered Republican. I am not an establishment Republican, and, I am only registered as a Republican so I can vote in the primaries. When people start talking to me about Donald Trump being the GOP Candidate, I immediately start thinking about his stupid hair! That is how seriously I take Donald Trump as a candidate. I have also been known to compare him to Ross Perot. He is a rich guy who can spend enough of his own money to get to the White House, and, he seems to believe his own rhetoric, but he is just too much of a joke to really be a serious candidate. I can also imagine him doing what Perot did--run as a third-party candidate and thus ruin the election for the GOP candidate. \nBut apparently, the establishment Republicans--the big chiefs who run the Party--are getting a little worried about how well Donald Trump is doing. \nThe Washington Examiner says the establishment folks are starting to plan their war against the Donald: Insiders have watched as Trump defied what many believed were immutable laws of the political universe. First they thought Trump wouldn't run. Then they thought voters wouldn't take a reality-TV star seriously. Then they thought gaffes would kill Trump as they had other candidates. None of that turned out as expected. But there is one belief Trump has not yet tested, and that is the political insiders' unshakeable faith that negative ads work. \"I don't think Trump can withstand 10,000 points of smart negative in Iowa and New Hampshire,\" says one veteran Republican strategist who is not affiliated with any campaign. \"It would force him to spend money. That's when this starts to get real for him.\" (\"Points\" refers to gross ratings points, a way of measuring TV ad buys; 10,000 points would be a really big buy, meaning the average viewer would see an anti-Trump ad many, many times.) There is no central anti-Trump conspiracy. But one group that would like to play a leading role in taking him down is the Club for Growth. In September, the Club ran two ads against Trump in Iowa — 2,000 points — with one arguing that Trump is not a true conservative and the other hitting Trump for his support of the Supreme Court's Kelodecision on eminent domain. \"We primed the pump with our ads in Iowa,\" says Club president David McIntosh. \"We did some polling afterward. The ads flipped Trump from first to second place among caucus-goers and put a dent in his approval rating.\" \nCan the tried and true practice of negative ads save the GOP from Donald Trump? Since he has defied the odds so far in so many other areas, things might have to get uglier than usual to put a stop to him. And, then, if he does beat the odds and trample the establishment all the way to the nomination, does his freak show campaign have enough stamina to beat one of the equally unappealing Democratic candidates? Who knows? \nWhat we do know is the 2016 Presidential Election is not bringing us candidates from either party who have what it takes to set this country aright. If only we had a candidate with character who believes in giving Americans freedom to make wise choices and who upholds the Rule of Law, then we could kick the likes of Trump to the curb and move forward in a country that makes us proud to be Americans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:16:29.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
