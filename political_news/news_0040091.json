This should be scrap and should be elected to deepen Ghana’s democracy to develop local economy,” Dr. Oduro Osae stated. \nHe added that the appointment of DCEs make some of them arrogant. He said they usually do not work in the interest of the people as a result of this. \nMeanwhile, Country Director of development NGO SEND-Ghana, George Osei-Bimpeh, has also called on the various assemblies to be affective whenever they are being appointed into office by a sitting President and stop the politicization of developmental projects. \nHe added that the assemblies must use the common fund wisely and effective for the betterment of the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:37:57.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
