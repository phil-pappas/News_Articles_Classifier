Here's Bernie Sanders dancing: Presidential candidate @BernieSanders ​ is ready for his entrance onto my show. https://t.co/cxVVL68hzJ — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 15, 2015 \nThe Vermont senator taped a segment on the \"Ellen\" show Wednesday that will air Thursday. There was some seriousness early on, but it was mostly light fare. He joked about his hair and played along in a lightning round when he was asked: \n-What Republican he'd want to be stuck on a deserted island with? After a long pause, \"Marco Rubio; he's used to the sun.\" Rubio's from Florida. \n-What flavor Ben & Jerry's ice cream he'd be. \"Burn, Bernie, Burn.\" \"So, it would be hot and spicy ice cream then,\" DeGeneres joked. \n-Had he ever been in handcuffs? \"Yes,\" he's said quickly, before pausing and following up, \"Now, I don't know exactly what you mean by that.\" Well, then. \"When I was young, I was involved in a civil rights demonstration, and I was arrested,\" Sanders clarified. \"All right, let's call it a civil-rights demonstration,\" DeGeneres quipped. \n-Better hair — him or Trump? He pointed to his cranium, obviously. \n-Favorite member of \"One Direction.\" With a little help from the audience, \"Harry,\" he answered. (That makes one of us who know who that was.) \n-What Karaoke song would he sing? Stayin Alive, or, as he called it, \"John Travolta walking down the street.\" \n-Boxers or briefs? \"Briefs.\" \n-Favorite swear word? \"Can't say.\" (At least, on television, right?) \nDeGeneres also gave him a present — a mobile fold-out lectern in a brief case. What else do you get a traveling candidate who has everything, right? \nHe came out dancing to, \"Disco Inferno\" (You know, \"Burn, baby burn.\" Get it?): YouTube \nAnd appropriately, he did a little something of a disco move. So, here's more dancing (followed by serious stuff, and a really awkward high five that never quite materializes):", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:43:13.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
