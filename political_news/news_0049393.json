Since many people were unable to get tickets last weekend, demand spilled over into the week, and to accommodate that, cinema halls had to increase screens from Monday — which is rare, to say the least. Exhibitors tell us that normally, weekday occupancy is only 20-30%, but this week, the occupancy of Talvar shows is between 60 and 70%. Word-of-mouth publicity is responsible for a lot of this, they say.\nWe had to increase screens during the week: Cinemas\nKamal Gianchandani, CEO, PVR Pictures, is effusive in his praise, saying, \" Talvar is a small gem with a big heart. It had a reasonably good start on October 2, since it was a holiday, but even on Saturday, there was hardly any drop in numbers. In fact, on both Monday and Tuesday, collections were better than on Saturday. It has been growing from strength to strength and it is carrying absolutely compelling word of mouth (reviews).\"\nHe adds, \"With the unprecedented success that the film has had, its capacity (the number of screens on which it being shown in a given hall or multiplex) has been increased from about 75% to 100%. The capacity we had allocated was generous, but because of the huge demand from viewers, we have added more capacity (more screens) on Monday for the weekdays. Even with that added capacity, the film has grown at roughly 60-70% occupancy on weekdays, which is an extremely strong number. There is no hard and fast rule for weekday occupancy, but Talvar is an outperformer. I won't call it a surprise because we were expecting a good movie, but the film has exceeded expectations. It is one of those rare films that has generated terrific, positive reviews internationally, positive reviews in the domestic market and also managed to do well commercially. Good films always tend to work well, there is no rule that a realistic film doesn't do well.\" He adds that this is not just an NCR trend. \"The film is doing extremely well in all the top 20 cities of the country, and we had to increase the number of shows not only in Delhi and Mumbai, but at all our centres. And 'word of mouth' is helping the film do well in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities also,\" he says.\nREAD: President Pranab Mukherjee to watch 'Talvar'\nDevang Sampat, business head - strategy, Cinepolis, also has the same story to tell. He says, \"The response has been very encouraging, with the occupancy percentage as high as 95% for the weekend. On weekdays, we had to increase shows because of the high demand. The night shows of Talvar , even on weekdays, were housefull, while during the afternoons, it was around 60-70%. It's not that the genre of films based on real incidents commands a bigger audience, but Talvar has been able to create this kind of success because the film is combination of three things — Irrfan has his own fan following, the story, which was received with great curiosity, and the direction — the director has created a different kind of drama as the film doesn't have a conclusion. It is left to audiences to decide whatever they want, and so they think that the filmmakers are being honest in not forcing an opinion.\"\nListen to songs of Talvar on Gaana.com\nPacked shows on weekdays, afternoons all across the country Cinema reps told us that usually, their weekday occupancy is only 20-30%, but this week, for Talvar, it has been 60-70%. A representative from BookMyShow told us that they have observed an upward trend in the weekday shows of Talvar. He said, \"The movie is doing quite well not only in the metros, but even in Tier-2 cities, where the response has been good. Not just in NCR, but even in Mumbai and Pune, the shows were housefull this week. Many multiplex chains added more shows for Talvar from Monday in cities like Lucknow and Bhubaneswar.\"\nTinku Singh, vice president and chief strategy officer, SRS Cinemas, told us, \"For Talvar, we have observed an different, upward trend. This film has set an example of how word-of-mouth publicity can work in favour of a film. In terms of occupancy, our shows are almost housefull in the evenings, while in the afternoons, it's around 60%, which is rare — normally, we see a dip in occupancy during weekdays. But Talvar is doing better business with each passing day. It's not only in the metros where we have seen good occupancy, but even in cities in Punjab and UP, including Kanpur, Bareilly and Lucknow, the response for a 'niche' film like Talvar has been quite overwhelming — we are able to sell advance tickets. The occupancy is up to 40% higher since the day of release.\" Sampat adds, \"The higher occupancy in afternoon shows, and housefull shows at night and on weekdays, was quite surprising. This is true not only for Delhi or Noida or just the NCR — it is a pan-India phenomenon. Even in a city like Patna, we had to increase the number of shows because of growing demand.\"\nReactions\n\"I went with my family to see Talvar on the second day after its release. But we were only getting seats in the second row and we didn't want watch the movie from there. Because of my hectic schedule, I didn't get time to go for another show but I rue the fact that I am yet to see the movie, which has become the talk of the town.\"\n— Lushin Dubey, theatre artiste and actor\n\"I couldn't find a ticket! I had gone to watch Talvar on Monday at the Oberoi Mall in Goregaon, Mumbai, but the shows were housefull. I had been hearing positive reviews for the film so I drove down to Vapi, which is almost 180 kms from Mumbai, to watch it with my fiance on Thursday.\"\n— Saurabh Pandey, TV actor\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nWATCH: Neeraj Kabi was troubled during the shoot of Talvar - TOI\nPosterboy 'Paan Singh Tomar - Irrfan Khan' Poster (Black, 60.96 cm x 88.9 cm) Amazon.in : INR 3,299.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/album/talvar", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://www.amazon.in/Posterboy-Paan-Singh-Tomar-Irrfan/dp/B00GQVQSBM%3Fpsc%3D1%26SubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00GQVQSBM", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wFMDDixRL._SL160_.jpg", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HewiySJlQRg"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:38:08.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
