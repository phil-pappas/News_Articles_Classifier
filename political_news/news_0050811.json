(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nPresident Barack Obama is rejecting Russia's military campaign in Syria, saying it fails to distinguish between terrorist groups and moderate rebel forces with a legitimate interest in a negotiated end to the civil war. \nObama made his remarks at a White House news conference Friday. \nThe president called Russia's military involvement, including airstrikes that began this week, a self-defeating exercise that will move the Syrian conflict further from a solution. \nObama said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not attracted international support for his approach in Syria, which is a longstanding Russian ally. He said only Iran and Syrian President Bashar Assad are on Putin's side, while the U.S. is leading a 60-nation international coalition against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
