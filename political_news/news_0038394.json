Instead of standing up for New Zealand, the Government has just sucked it up. \n\"These laws took effect in December and the deportations have gone from a handful a month to dozens, with hundreds more waiting in detention. \n\"It is only since the issue became public that the Prime Minister has finally started to make noises. \n\"That raises the question of why the Government was so reactive when the story broke, when it should have been well-briefed and prepared. \n\"Did the Prime Minister and others take their eye off the ball? \n\"Or have they been dishonest by acting like the policy came as a surprise for them, when they knew about it all along?\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
