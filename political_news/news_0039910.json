If the Government cares about saving them, it needs to take action to protect them. \n\"Environment officials highlight the biggest concerns for the environment are due to dairy intensification, something the Government has shown no interest in doing anything about. \n\"The Government is putting agribusiness interests and growth in dairying ahead of a healthy environment. \n\"The report reveals the shocking extent of nitrogen in our rivers. Total nitrogen levels in rivers increased 12 percent since 1989, with 60 percent of monitored sites showing statistically significant increases. \n\"Half of the monitored river sites have enough nitrogen to trigger potentially toxic algal blooms. \n\"The Green Party wants a future where we can swim in our rivers, and where the status of all of our threatened species and the quality of their habitats is improving. \n\"What we need to see from the Government is a commitment to stop subsidising dairy intensification and to strengthen water standards so that it’s safe for people and wildlife to swim in our rivers. \n\"We need a much greater investment in pest control on conservation lands and beyond. \n\"We also want to see a commitment to establishing effective deep sea marine protected areas and ocean sanctuaries to protect marine habitats, and a National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management that actually ensures the water is fresh. \n\"The message in this report is clear: our mammals, our rivers, and our environment are suffering because the Government refuses to step up,\" said Ms Sage. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:26:45.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
