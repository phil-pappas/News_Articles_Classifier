Photo: Andrew Meares\nSmart and popular, it was basically a no-brainer, and will effectively connect the abstract objective of financial system reform with the daily experience slash hip pocket nerve of regular folk.\nAdvertisement Other changes recommended in the Murray Financial System Inquiry and now embraced by the government, are equally worthy if perhaps, less readily understood.\nAmong these are bolstered prudential requirements on banks to lift their capital holdings as insurance against future shocks, and the insistence on ensuring employees get the ultimate say on which superannuation funds they have their income invested in.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull addresses the media during a joint press conference with Treasurer Scott Morrison (right) and Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nTurnbull argues the review recommendations will strengthen Australia's banking system while also delivering \"choice and security\" for retirees.\nInterestingly though, one reform has been ducked - a proposed prohibition on self-managed superannuation funds in particular, leveraging - that is, borrowing money - which review principal David Murray had counselled could ratchet up financial risk.\nThe government says it has merely held fire and could adopt the recommendation later if the circumstances change and the risk profile therefore warrants it.\nAnnouncing the government's long-awaited response, Turnbull, as the new Prime Minister and flanked by his Treasurer Scott Morrison and Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer, wanted to be clear about one thing: who now is in charge.\n\"I want to thank the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for the hard work they have done and of course their predecessors, in particular Joe Hockey and Josh Frydenberg,\" he said.\n\"But this is very - this response is a response of the Turnbull government to this inquiry.\"\nGot that?\nAfter a series of announcements following his promotion that were known to have been lined up for Tony Abbott's diary, Turnbull has now shifted to being Prime Minister proper - head honcho in his own right.\nPut it down to a combination of enough time having passed since the \"troubles\" which saw him knock over his predecessor, and the massive vindication of public support measured in this week's Fairfax-Ipsos poll .\nExpect to see Turnbull, who within a couple of weeks will be rubbing shoulders with world leaders as summit season hits, owning policy more fully from here on.\nAnd of course, owning all of the problems as well.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-21T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:58:25.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
