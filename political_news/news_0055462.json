Tom Wolf is open to a gambling expansion, if it's part of a comprehensive package that resolves what his administration projects to be a multibillion-dollar long-term deficit. \nTop Democratic lawmakers have yet to voice support. \nOne idea is Internet gambling, which is legal only in Delaware, New Jersey and Nevada. There's also allowing casinos to station slot machines at off-track horse-racing betting parlors and Pennsylvania's six international airports.
