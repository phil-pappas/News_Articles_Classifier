Know them. People with diabetes have the right to test blood sugar and inject insulin anywhere at work.\nBy Gina Gavlak, R.N. Oct. 21, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT + More Do you have what you need to manage your diabetes at work?\nAre you able to check your blood sugar, eat, take medications or treat low blood sugar, anywhere and at any time? Did you know you have the right to be able to do these important things without fear of penalty?\nHave you ever been denied a job because you have diabetes ?\nNot long ago, people with diabetes could be denied certain jobs, or lost their job, simply because they had diabetes – or because they used insulin. Asking for things needed to manage diabetes at work could result in loss of job or decrease in pay. When an employment decision is based on whether a candidate has diabetes instead of that individual's ability to perform the job requirements, it is a form of discrimination.\nIn 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act – a federal anti-discrimination law that protects qualified people with disabilities from unfair treatment – became law and things began to change. The ADA was strengthened in 2008 with passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act .\nWhat qualifies as a disability? A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Diabetes substantially limits the function of the endocrine system – a major life activity – and is therefore recognized as a disability.\nWhat does this mean for people with diabetes? In addition to these laws, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and state laws have helped to provide equal employment opportunity by removing various forms of discrimination – or unfair treatment – in the workplace.\nCommon examples of discrimination include:\nNot being allowed to take a break to check blood sugar, eat and/or take insulin. Job offer being taken back, losing job or not being considered for promotion because you have diabetes. Being told you can never have a job as a bus/truck driver, police officer or firefighter because you use insulin. Needing to maintain a certain blood sugar level in order to keep your job. Your rights. You have the right to ask your employer for reasonable accommodations. Accommodations are adjustments to a job or the work environment that allow employees with disabilities to perform required job functions. Sometimes, individuals are afraid to speak with their employer about their diabetes needs because they fear they might lose their job. Employers are required, by law, to provide reasonable accommodations; they are also prohibited from taking any form of retaliation.\nYou are responsible for making the accommodation request to your employer. Although not required, it is highly recommended that you provide your request in writing. The request should describe how diabetes is a disability, list the accommodations needed and explains how they will assist with safe job performance.\nCommon accommodations include:\nBreaks to check blood sugar, eat, take medication or go to the bathroom. Ability to keep diabetes supplies and food nearby. Ability to test blood sugar and inject insulin anywhere at work. If preferred, a private area to perform these tasks. Leave for treatment or training on diabetes management. No penalty for absences related to diabetes. Opportunity to work a standard shift instead of a swing shift. For individuals with diabetic neuropathy ( a nerve disorder ), permission to use a chair or stool instead of standing. For individuals with diabetic retinopathy (a vision disorder), large screen computer monitors or other assistive devices. Be sure to include a letter of support from your doctor. Sample letters (for the employee and for the doctor) can be found at www.diabetes.org/jobaccommodations .\nYou deserve, and have a right, to have what you need to take care of your diabetes while at work.\nAdditional resources:\nThe U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission The American Diabetes Association: Your Job and Your Rights Association\nThe American Diabetes Association: Employment Discrimination\nTAGS: health patients patient advice For Better diabetes diabetes type 2 diabetes type 1 employment disability", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=How%20to%20Manage%20Diabetes%20at%20Work&summary=You%20have%20rights.%20Know%20them.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2014/12/how-to-deal-with-nerve-pain-if-you-have-diabetes/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=How%20to%20Manage%20Diabetes%20at%20Work", "http://www.diabetes.org/jobaccommodations", "http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/know-your-rights/discrimination/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=How%20to%20Manage%20Diabetes%20at%20Work", "http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2013/05/eye-disease-rates-rise-along-with-diabetes-cases/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.ada.gov/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ghr%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/diabetes.cfm", "http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adaaa_info.cfm", "http://main.diabetes.org/dorg/PDFs/Advocacy/your-job-your-rights.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:15:58.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
