Follow more or his work at The Weapon Blog\nSIG Sauer Legion P229\nSIG SAUER, Inc., the world’s premier manufacturer of complete weapon systems, is now inviting professional users worldwide to become part of the new Legion Series™.\nBy joining its ranks, Legion members will receive access to a new line of enhanced products from SIG SAUER®, developed with the input of the most elite professionals from around the world. These products have been built to meet and exceed the demands of the elite. These are serious tools, for serious users.\nThe Legion is also a community, a brotherhood of like-minded individuals who push themselves and their gear to the limits. Legion members will receive exclusive product offerings and information from SIG, gain access to premium accessories built specially for the Legion, and find lifestyle items representing their membership in the Legion.\nThe Legion name has roots reaching back to the great Roman armies, and to this day designates elite membership among the world’s military and professional communities.\n“We have worked with elite SIG users for years as we have developed the Legion,” said Jeff Creamer, Executive Director and General Merchandise Manager for SIG SAUER, Inc. “We wanted to know what custom features professionals were seeking as factory enhancements. The result is a line of high performance firearms and accessories that deliver not only what elite users need, but what they want.”\nAfter customers purchase a Legion product, they simply call SIG SAUER with their serial number to register the product. SIG will then send a complimentary custom Thermo-Mold case, cut for their specific firearm and featuring a slot for their challenge coin matched to that firearm.\nThe new Legion member will also receive a web account login, which unlocks the Legion portion of the SIG website. Here Legion members can learn more about the privileges of being a member of the Legion and find exclusive products expressly designed for them. Partnering with companies like Surefire®, Peltor®, Blackpoint Tactical® and others, members can purchase top-of-the-line accessories made exclusively as part of the Legion Series.\nSIG SAUER has also partnered with some of the finest blade makers in the industry to offer Legion-specific knives available only to members. To name just a few, Emerson Knives®, Rick Hinderer, Daniel Winkler, Duane Dwyer of Duane Dwyer Customs and Strider Knives®, and Quartermaster Knives® are designing and building these exclusive offerings specifically for the Legion.\nAdditional lifestyle accessories from premier manufacturers such as Gramm Works® humidors and Key-Bar products will also be exclusives to the Legion base.\nLegion members will have exclusive access to SIG SAUER product news and training tips from the SIG SAUER AcademySM faculty. They will also be among the first to see new Legion products as they come available.\nThe Legion will launch with the two most prevalent SIG SAUER handguns in use within the professional community. The P226® and P229® have served countless military units and law enforcement agencies for decades. These trusted firearms are counted on day in and day out to protect those who protect our freedoms.\nBoth models will be finished in a proprietary Legion gray PVD coating, custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the new SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY3™ high visibility day/night sights, and will ship with three magazines.\nThe P226 and P229 in DA/SA include a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip, but a reduced profile, to eliminate printing while carrying concealed. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip, even in adverse situations. A high undercut has been machined behind the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. Front cocking serrations provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm, or conducting status checks. The P226 and P229 DA/SA guns will first be available in 9mm, followed by .40 and .357SIG.\nThe DA/SA also features low profile decocking and slide catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT™ (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc., Intermediate Adjustable Trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. These enhancements maximize the user’s accuracy potential, while increasing their split times between shots.\nThe P226 SAO variant brings the same feature set to the table in a single-action only package. The addition of the SIG Master Shop Super Match Flat Trigger provides exceptional feel and consistent trigger pull regardless of finger placement. Additionally, the Legion SAO debuts the new single action SRT (short reset trigger) and is available in 9mm. The P226 SAO is projected to begin shipping in November.\nAvailable only at SIG SAUER dealers, the Legion Series of products will grow to include offerings from all of SIG SAUER, including rifles, optics, silencers, and more.
