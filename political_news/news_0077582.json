The investigation found \"substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment and institutional inertia leading to the belief by many tax-exempt applicants that the IRS targeted them based on their political viewpoints,\" the letter said.\n  Why Katy Perry and Bill Clinton are an awkward pairing Katy Perry's lyrics may have some echoes of the former president's salacious past.\nBy Sean Langille • 10/24/15 5:37 PM \"But poor management is not a crime,\" it said.\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., disagreed with the department's conclusion.\n\"The Department of Justice investigation did conclude that the actions of IRS personnel involved in the scandal was 'disquieting' and in that we all agree,\" he said. \"However, the American people should be concerned that this kind of politicization continues to go unchecked by this administration and a Justice Department charged with pursuing wrongdoing.\"\n\"You can be sure this will be a major issue during the Committee's DOJ oversight hearing with Attorney General Lynch next week,\" he added.\n\"This announcement is a reminder that the Obama administration continues to refuse to hold anyone accountable at the IRS,\" House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in an email.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump on super PACs: 'I think they’re the dumbest thing' Trump suggested most of the leading outside support groups backing presidential candidates \"are a disaster.\"\n  4:50 PM \"While DOJ may have closed its investigation, as a co-equal branch of government, Congress will continue to seek accountability for the American people,\" he said. \"A clear message must be sent that using government agencies to stifle citizens' freedom of speech will not be tolerated. If the administration won't send that message, Congress will.\"\nChaffetz's predecessor as Oversight chair, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., also weighed in.\n\"Giving Lois Lerner a free pass only reinforces the idea that government officials are above the law and that there is no consequence for wrongdoing,\" Issa said.\nLerner outraged conservatives around the country and in Congress when the scandal broke.\nShe headed the IRS office on tax exempt groups, and admitted that they applied extra scrutinty to conservative groups seeking tax exempt status in the runup to the 2012 election. Some Republicans say her actions may have tipped the balance in favor of Obama that year. Lerner was called up to Congress to testify on her role in the scandal, and pled the Fifth Amendment.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Palestinians chide 'extreme' Israel to Kerry Kerry and Jordan's government brokered an apparent deal between Abbas and Netanyahu.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/24/15 4:41 PM Read the DOJ letter here:\nTop Story Trump on Carson's rise: It just means I have to work a bit harder Two   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:02:40.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
