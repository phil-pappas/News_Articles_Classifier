More Cameron plans big push ahead of EU summit \nMinisters say the purpose of the bill is to stop disruptive industrial action on the basis of low ballot turnouts, particularly in crucial public services, and to balance the rights of trade unions with those of business and other workers. \nHowever, human resources directors in the National Health Service , including those in some of the biggest hospitals, have written to Matthew Hancock, cabinet office minister, questioning government plans to scrap the “check-off” system for paying union subscriptions. \nOne letter, from London HR directors, suggests that staff motivation would be adversely affected in return for a “very limited cost benefit”. \nAnother letter, from HR directors and regional union representatives from the east of England, suggests that a five-year plan to improve the NHS, published a year ago, may even be set back by the changes. Close working between managers and union representatives had been “recognised by health ministers as fundamental” to its delivery, they said. \nThese strong relationships had also helped to secure agreements on pay awards that had protected lower-paid employees even within workforces that had had “little real terms increase in their pay or benefits”, they said.The managers, who between them represent hundreds of thousands of staff, also express concerns that partnerships between union representatives and NHS managers, that have minimised the risk of disruption through industrial action, may come under strain. \nAmong those who have written to Mr Hancock to express concerns is Dean Royles, until recently chief executive of NHS Employers, which handles workforce negotiations for the health department, and who is now director of human resources at Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust. \nMr Royles said industrial relations in the NHS and the wider public sector had moved on significantly in the past decade or so. \n“We get so much more, day-in day-out, from working with trade unions and I’m anxious we don’t damage the largely constructive relationships we enjoy,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:23:16.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
