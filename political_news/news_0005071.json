Filaments are darker than most of the Sun's surface when viewed in extreme ultraviolet light because they are not as hot as the sun's surface behind them.\nThe birth and death of filaments is a mystery and the subject of ongoing study by solar scientists.\nWatch the video here .\nAlso read: http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/potw/item/671?linkId=18229418\nCredit: Solar Dynamics Observatory, NASA.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/potw/item/671?linkId=18229418", "http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/gallery/movies/Filament193_Oct_big.mp4"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:16:35.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
