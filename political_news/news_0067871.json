Though it wasn't discovered within base boundaries, Hill Air Force Base spokesman Richard Essary says its bomb squad detonated it Tuesday afternoon with C4 plastic explosives.\nEssary said it appears to be a practice bomb from the World War II era. It may have ended up there because of a test range in the area.\n___\nInformation from: KSL-TV, http://www.ksl.com/\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
