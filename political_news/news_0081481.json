Kevin McCarthy of California has yet to win the gavel as House speaker, but he's speaking enough to step into some political minefields.\nOn Tuesday evening, McCarthy, the No. 2 Republican in the House and the favorite to become the top leader in Congress this month, gave an interview to Fox News in which he seemed to concede a key Democratic talking point: that the GOP investigation into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is all about politics.\n\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\" McCarthy said. \"But we put together a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known that any of that had happened had we not fought to make that happen.\"\nClinton, in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday, called the remarks \"deeply distressing,\" adding that she knew Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, one of four Americans who died in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi.\n\"When I hear a statement like that, which demonstrates unequivocally that this was always meant to be a partisan political exercise, I feel like it does a grave disservice and dishonors not just the memory of the four that we lost, but of everybody who has served our country,\" said Clinton, the secretary of State at the time of the attacks.\nRep. Adam B. Schiff of California, who is one of the Democratic Party's top voices on intelligence matters, called McCarthy's statement a blunt admission that the committee's \"true purpose had little to do with finding out anything new of that tragic night that claimed four American lives, and everything to do with attacking a likely Democratic nominee for president.\"\nAs controversy swirled Wednesday, McCarthy's office issued a statement intended to clarify his remarks. Spokesman Matt Sparks blamed the Obama administration's \"stark refusal and indifference to oversight and accountability\" and pledged \"to vigorously conduct\" oversight.\n(c)2015 Tribune Co.\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1730667&h=Panel+on+Benghazi+called+into+question", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1730667", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1730667&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:11:01.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
