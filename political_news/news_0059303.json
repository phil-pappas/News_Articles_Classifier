(AP) - An attorney for the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission says former Democratic lawmaker Paul Davis can continue to be part of a federal lawsuit challenging voter registration restrictions. \nThe Wichita Eagle reports (http://bit.ly/1htewwE ) attorney Brett Barry announced Thursday that Davis’ work on the case does not conflict with state law. \nThe State Republican Party demanded this week that Davis withdraw from the lawsuit. They said he was violating a state law that bars former or current lawmakers from arguing in court that a legislative action is unconstitutional unless he or she voted no. In 2011 while serving in the Kansas House, Davis voted in favor of a law requiring people to prove citizenship when they register to vote. \nBerry says Davis’ brief in the case does not violate that state law. \n___ \nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.)
