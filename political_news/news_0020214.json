The report was to be submitted this week.\nHe, however, declined to elaborate on the angle authorities are focusing on.\nIndrani was rushed to state-run JJ Hospital after she fell unconscious. The 43-year-old was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday last.\n\"Going by the information gathered till now, it seems highly unlikely that Indrani could attempt suicide. She has denied attempting suicide and anti-anxiety medicines were being given to her in presence of a jail doctor. Also, she had no place to hide medicines in her cell,\" the official said.\n\"Attempt to murder\" theory has been discarded because the food provided to her is cooked by inmates themselves, he said.\n\"If somebody wanted to murder her, there would have been a long chain to follow. This could not have been possible without the support of other inmates. The Investigating Officer has taken statements of people who have come in contact with Indrani in the prison. Nobody seems to have been involved in assisting a third party in trying to kill her.\"\n\"Once these two theories are discarded, the Investigating Officer is now working on a new angle. The findings of this, coupled with evidence collected till now and the JJ Hospital report will then be scrutinised and a report will be submitted by either Monday or Tuesday,\" he said.\nRead:\nIndrani Mukerjea denies attempting suicide, CBI to grill accused in Sheena Bora case\nCBI seeks permission to question Indrani Mukerjea\nIndrani Mukerjea is safe and out of danger, say JJ Hospital Doctors\nIndrani Mukerjea critical, next 48 hours crucial: JJ Hospital\nSheena Bora case: Indrani Mukerjea critical after suicide attempt; CM orders probe\nIndrani Mukerjea's lawyer seeks court nod to meet her\nSheena Bora case: Murder-accused Indrani Mukerjea admitted to hospital\nGovernment says probe in Indrani's drug overdose to be over in one week\nNewly-appointed IG (Prisons) Bipin Kumar Singh is heading the probe into the episode.\nAfter Indrani's hospitalisation, conflicting reports had emerged on suspected drug overdose in prison.

It is now up to British Consulate to write to Jail authority whenever they want to meet Indrani,\" Singh said.\nIndrani and the two other accused - her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyam Rai - were arrested in August- end on the charge of murdering her daughter Sheena and disposing the body in a forest in Raigad district, about 84 km from here, in April 2012.\nThe case, initially was with Mumbai Police and is now being handled by CBI.\n Indrani Mukerjea Sheena Bora case Attempt to Murder nation Also Read Jaswant Singh hits back at BJP 3 year old on bike killed LG Najeeb Jung forms SIT to probe burning of St Sebastian's Church in Delhi FTII students to carry on stir for removal of Gajendra Chouhan", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/indrani_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/nation-crime/article/probe-rules-out-drug-overdose-indrani-case-focus-now-‘new-angle’", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/indrani_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:34:31.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
