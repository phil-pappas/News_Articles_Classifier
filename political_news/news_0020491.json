Lew's warning, outlined in a letter sent to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), raises the stakes in the political fight over the $18 trillion-plus debt ceiling.\nBoehner — whose decision to resign has set off a chaotic scramble among House Republicans to find a new speaker — is considering putting a \"clean\" debt ceiling bill on the floor, although this would infuriate conservatives who want to use the measure to reform entitlement spending.\nBoehner would do this as part of a larger budget agreement with President Barack Obama and Democrats. Negotiations on such an overall deal are proceeding slowly, and the debt limit will likely have to be raised before an agreement is reached.\nCongress\nThe obsession of the House Freedom Caucus By Jake Sherman\n\"Over the past two weeks, Treasury has continued to receive information about daily receipts, investments, and expenditures. The trend in our projected net resources has continued to be negative, and our projections for the relevant period have declined an additional $4-6 billion,\" Lew said in his letter. \"Based on our best and most recent information, we now estimate that extraordinary measures will be exhausted no later than Tuesday, November 3. At that point, we expect Treasury would be left with less than $30 billion to meet all of the nation's commitments — an amount far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:34:54.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
