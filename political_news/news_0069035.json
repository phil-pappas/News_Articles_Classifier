The laws to be introduced in the next fortnight would mean children as young as 14 could be subjected to control orders – down from the current age limit of 16 – and authorities would be able to monitor subjects more closely to ensure they were complying with the orders, Senator Brandis said.\nThe laws would also create a new offence against \"incitement of genocide\".\nAttorney-General George Brandis said the new legislation would provide greater protection for sensitive information.

Photo: Louise Kennerley\nA spokesman for Mr Baird responded by saying that \"if nationally consistent measures are not implemented, NSW will consider changing its own legislation to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to respond to terrorism threats\".\nUnder control orders, which have been used six times since they were introduced in 2005 – four of those times in the past year – people can be forced to wear tracking devices, observe curfews and have their movements and communications restricted.\nThey must be sought by a senior Australian Federal Police officer – with the consent of the Attorney-General – by an application to a court.\nFifteen-year-old killer Farhad Jabar.\nFairfax Media understands that under the changes, the AFP could ask the judge to withhold some evidence from the subject of the order if it is deemed highly sensitive.\nThis could include information that exposes police methods, reveals sources or comes from foreign governments who would be deterred from sharing intelligence with Australian authorities in future if their methods risked exposure.\nThe final decision would rest with the judge.\nPolice have long expressed concern that they may increasingly be unable to present certain evidence in control order hearings because they cannot risk it becoming known to potential terrorist networks.\nThe new laws come in the wake of the Parramatta shooting, in which 15-year-old Farhad Jabar shot dead police accountant Curtis Cheng, but have been in the works for several months.\nSenator Brandis said the use of control orders against teens would be \"subject to appropriate safeguards\".\nIt is understood this includes the appointment of independent advocates who would represent the best interests of the child, similar to a system that currently exists in the Family Court.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said the Opposition would continue to work with the government on terrorism but would not promise any blank cheques.\n\"Whilst on one hand it sounds draconian to have control orders on 14-year-olds, I also get that the police are trying to work through the issues,\" he said.\nSenator Brandis told ABC radio that he was comfortable with the idea of control orders being imposed on children as young as 14.\nPolice and security agencies have spoken repeatedly in the past six months about the dramatic downward trend in the ages of Australians suspected of or associated with terrorism activity.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:25:07.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
