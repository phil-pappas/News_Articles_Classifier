From behind a blue podium, as brightly colored, and as plastic, as a child’s toy, Whitehouse made this claim: “In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated.” This certainly sounded like the Wild West of unregulated chemicals to us: 22,996 chemicals on the market and only four run-ins with regulators? It was clear early on that our fact-checking of the statement would pivot on the definition of “regulated.” Our dictionary tells us that to “regulate” is “to control or direct by a rule.” Whitehouse’s go-to expert on chemicals, Richard A. Denison, a lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was at the event and provided some immediate clarification after the senator spoke. The EPA blocked four chemicals from the market place after the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. That, Denison said, was the regulation Whitehouse was talking about. So almost 23,000 other chemicals went unregulated? That didn’t line up with a 2010 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector General. Through September of 2008, according to the report, EPA “regulated 1,432 chemicals by means of Consent Orders.” We rate his claim Mostly False . providencejournal.com Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 4:08 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:18:04.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
