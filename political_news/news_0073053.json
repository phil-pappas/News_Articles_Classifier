Steve Smith as the sheriff’s congressional campaign chairman. \nSmith, who represents a legislative district that covers a significant amount of the Congressional District 1, said he supports Babeu because of his unmatched record on combating illegal immigration and drug smuggling. \n“Pinal County and all of Arizona has been blessed to have Paul Babeu fight to stem the tide of illegal immigration through our beautiful state and aggressively combat the drug cartels,” Smith said. “Sheriff Paul is an oath keeper, who does exactly what he promises and we need patriots like him in Washington. I am proud to support Paul and help send a Sheriff to Congress.” \nBabeu, the two-term Pinal County sheriff, is running for the open CD1 seat. \nThe Goldwater Institute and Arizona Conservative Coalition both ranked Smith as the top conservative legislator and Americans for Prosperity named Smith a “Champion of the Taxpayer.” \n“I am honored to have Steve on this campaign and can think of no better champion for rural conservative values,” Babeu said. “His expertise and advice will be invaluable as we look to replace a liberal Democrat in CD1.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:22:12.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
