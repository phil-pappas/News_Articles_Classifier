(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) By Greg Jaffe October 12 at 4:00 PM Follow @GregJaffe In meeting after meeting this spring and summer, President Obama insisted that the last American troops in Afghanistan would return home by the end of his presidency, definitively ending the longest war in American history.\nObama and his closest foreign policy advisers laid out the reasons for his military commanders. Keeping as many as 10,000 troops in Afghanistan indefinitely at a cost of as much as $10 billion to 15 billion a year wasn’t politically feasible or financially responsible. There were more pressing domestic priorities that needed money. The country faced bigger threats.\nThen in August, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, came in with one more plan to maintain a counterterrorism force of as many as 5,000 troops in Afghanistan to prevent a reemergence of al-Qaeda and battle Islamic State fighters seeking a foothold in the country. Dempsey’s plan was a quick, back-of-the-envelope exercise, according to senior administration officials. \nThis time, though, Obama didn’t dismiss it. “I think that’s an argument that can be made to the American people,” Obama said, according to a senior administration official who took part in the meeting and who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \nObama had come to office with a deep skepticism of the U.S. military’s ability to bring order to broken and chaotic societies. His experiences over the course of his two terms in office had reinforced his instincts to the point that the phrase “no military solution” had become a mantra that he deployed not just to describe Afghanistan, but a half-dozen other conflicts in places like Libya, Syria and Ukraine.\nThis is Obama’s mind-set as he weighs a decision on whether to leave troops in Afghanistan past his presidency. It is a choice that would contravene a long-held personal desire and central tenet of his election campaigns — a definitive end to the wars he had inherited. His struggle shows how a president, who once described war as an “expression of human folly,” has come to wield force on battlefields where America’s interests often seem peripheral to him and its enemies are brutal and determined. \nSimilar dilemmas had consumed his predecessors. Bill Clinton, after an agonizing debate, didn’t deploy troops to stop genocide in Rwanda, but he dispatched U.S. forces to halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo. In the wake of 9/11, George W. Bush sought to stamp out the terror threat by toppling governments and trying to build democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nObama has defined American interests more narrowly than Bush or Clinton, convinced that the country’s biggest and costliest mistakes over the past 50 years have been the product of American military overreach. \nHis hesitancy to commit American forces is especially evident in the way he talks about America’s military might. “His rhetoric is not in the traditional American vein,” said Andrew Bacevich, a retired Army colonel and history professor at Boston University. “It comes from a different place — one of ambivalence, complexity and a reluctance to sound crusading notes.”\nObama has launched military strikes in seven countries. He ended a war in Iraq only to recommit thousands of American troops there when Islamic State insurgents routed the U.S.-trained Iraqi army in Mosul. A few weeks later, he ordered the U.S. military to start bombing Islamic State strongholds Syria.\nAfghanistan has been the one constant that spans his two terms in office. As an inexperienced president, Obama decided to send more than 50,000 American troops into Afghanistan in an attempt to blunt the Taliban’s momentum, bolster the Afghan army and improve the prospects for reconciliation in a country that had experienced three decades of civil war. \nNearly seven years later, the leaders of Afghanistan’s new unity government were still feuding, Afghan security forces were losing ground to insurgents and the prospects for reconciliation with the Taliban seemed bleak. \nIn early October, Obama summed up one of the biggest lessons he’s taken from America’s interventions in these fractured societies. “What we’ve learned over the last 10, 12, 13 years is that unless we can get the parties on the ground to agree to live together in some fashion, then no amount of U.S. military engagement will solve the problem,” Obama said at a news conference.\nWhat kind of difference could U.S. troops make in such deeply divided and chaotic countries? What were the risks of leaving? These were the questions that Obama would have to answer in Afghanistan. They were the sorts of questions that had come to define his presidency.\nOne year ago, Obama laid out his philosophy for how and when to use American military power in a carefully constructed speech at the U.S. Military Academy.\nHe’d touched on the subject in previous addresses: before sending troops to Afghanistan, launching airstrikes in Syria, plunging the U.S. military back into Iraq. The subject had been the focus of his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize address and a major speech on drone warfare.\nThe speech at West Point was supposed to be the definitive word. \nThe United States would continue to use force unilaterally “when our core interests demand it — when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the security of our allies is in danger,” Obama said. This was the rationale driving Obama’s drone campaign and special operations raids. \nThese sorts of operations were low cost but limited in what they could achieve. Often they provoked fury and resentment overseas.\nTo bring order to places like Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya and Iraq, the United States needed to train allies on the ground, Obama said. The centerpiece of the president’s strategy to address this larger problem was a $5 billion Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund that would help the nation recruit, train and equip local forces. \nToday the strategy that Obama outlined at West Point is in tatters. Congress gave Obama only $1.3 billion of the $5 billion he requested in 2015 to train local partners. Senior congressional staffers complained that the White House and Pentagon could never explain how and where they planned to spend all that money.\nEven when there was money to build local forces, America’s allies, many of whom were beholden to corrupt or sectarian governments, frequently lacked the will to fight. Three weeks after Obama’s West Point speech, lightly armed Islamic State rebels seized Mosul, crushing Iraqi army units that had been the recipients of years of training and billions in aid and equipment. Then U.S.-backed forces in Yemen fell apart when that country dissolved into civil war. In Syria, the $500 million U.S. training and equipment program has produced only four trained fighters.\n“Is it possible to build an indigenous force that will actually take control of its own destiny?” Dempsey, who spent two years overseeing the training of the Iraqi army, asked in a recent interview with Joint Forces Quarterly. “I don’t know.”\nThe failure to find capable local partners or build effective indigenous forces was driving the president to rely more heavily on fighter jets and drones. Even as drone strikes diminished in Pakistan, where al-Qaeda had been badly damaged, they were ramping up in Syria and Iraq.\nThese long-distance sniper shots were hardly satisfying to the White House or the military, which saw its mission as fighting and winning the nation’s wars. But neither the president nor his commanders saw better options.\n“Everywhere I’ve gone for the past year, shoot, the past decade, I hear the mantra that we can’t kill our way to victory. I never disagree,” said a senior U.S. military commander involved in counterterrorism operations. “However, with no clear strategy, there’s lots of killing to be done to keep the wolves at bay and buy space and time. My only satisfaction is that we aren’t wasting precious American lives while we figure things out.”\nDebate within White House Here’s what Obama and his war cabinet were trying to figure out earlier this year in Afghanistan: If they kept withdrawing forces under the president’s current plan, would Afghan troops crumble and would the government fall apart?\nChastened by the collapse of Iraqi forces a few months earlier and the Afghan army’s battlefield struggles, U.S. military commanders were asking Obama to freeze troop levels at 9,800 this year, a departure from the president’s plan to shrink to about 5,000.\nAfghanistan’s new president, Ashraf Ghani, was eager to maintain a large American presence as well. \nThe request from Ghani and the military provoked an emotional debate inside the White House. The United States had been working with the Afghan army and police forces for more than a decade, said James R. Clapper Jr., Obama’s director of national intelligence. Just about every plan to cut troop levels was met with a request from the military to slow the withdrawal. The extra troops and time never seemed to be enough. \n“What’s the definition of insanity?” Clapper asked at one White House meeting, according to several administration officials. “It’s doing something over and over and expecting different results.” \nSusan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, took a similar position. The Afghan troops’ struggles had been foreseeable when the president and his team agreed to the drawdown plan.\n“We all had hands on that decision,” she said, according to the administration officials. “What’s changed?” \nThe final word fell to Obama, who told the Pentagon that he was willing to freeze troop levels at 9,800 for the remainder of 2015, but that he was still determined to bring home the vast majority of U.S. troops before he left office.\nVice President Biden summed up the logic driving Obama’s split-the-difference decision for Ghani when he visited the White House in March. Afghanistan was important, Biden said, according to a senior administration official who was present at the meeting. But the White House faced more pressing threats elsewhere. “The wolf at the door is not Afghanistan,” Biden told Ghani.\nObama’s withdrawal plan for Afghanistan has provoked nearly universal alarm among those in the Washington foreign policy establishment who follow the country closely.\n“I don’t know why he sticks to it so relentlessly,” said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official who helped lead Obama’s initial 2009 review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy.\n“When things have collapsed, completely collapsed in Afghanistan, it has been when the international community abandons them or they have no outside international support,” said Michele Flournoy, who was among Obama’s top choices to be defense secretary last year before Ashton B. Carter was nominated. \n“We are an impatient people — that’s what built the nation,” said Ryan Crocker, who was ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan under Obama. “But impatience doesn’t work in places like Afghanistan.”\n‘Don’t want to screw this up’ These days, Crocker says, keeping a force of 10,000 to 15,000 U.S. troops in the country indefinitely would be enough to allow the Afghan government to muddle through without feeling completely abandoned by the West. “The stakes are pretty high, and the costs are quite manageable,” he said.\nCrocker met Obama for the first time in 2009. It was 3 a.m. in Baghdad, and Crocker was about to brief him on the political situation in Iraq. \n\nHe didn’t know quite what to expect from the president, who as a state senator had warned that a U.S. invasion of Iraq would lead to a protracted and bloody occupation. Six years later, as a presidential candidate, Obama had run on a promise to pull all U.S. combat brigades from Iraq in the first", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:22:25.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
