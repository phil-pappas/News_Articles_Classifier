Pat Toomey's campaign says it raised nearly $2 million in the three-month period through Oct. 1 as the first-term Republican prepares to defend his seat in next year's election. Toomey's campaign said Wednesday that it spent nearly as much in the period, leaving $8.6 million in the bank. Democrat Joe Sestak has not revealed his latest fundraising report ahead of Wednesday's reporting deadline. The former congressman and Navy vice admiral is seeking a rematch with Toomey after losing by 2 percentage points in 2010 in a contest to succeed Arlen Specter. First, Sestak must contend with two Democrats who recently joined the Democratic Party's nomination race. They are Katie McGinty, who has held top posts in the state and federal governments, and Braddock Mayor John Fetterman.
