John Kasich didn’t watch the first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night.\nBut he sure heard what Hillary Clinton said.\n“She bragged that she made enemies out of Republicans? Is that where this country’s going?” Kasich wondered during a town hall with about 80 voters in the back room of a restaurant. “And she’s proud of that?\n“I’ve gotta tell you, that’s a disgrace. That is a D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E, got it? I don’t ever want to brag about the fact that I can’t get along with people. I want to talk about putting the country together again.\n“Do you want the election that badly? If that’s how badly you want it, you shouldn’t have it.\"\nKasich often has remarked how reticent he is to criticize the former secretary of state. But on the last day of a bus tour through the state that will hold the nation’s first 2016 presidential primary in February, Kasich needs to regain the footing that had him among the poll leaders last month.\nHe also has yet to unveil how much money his campaign has raised since its launch in mid-July; the deadline is Thursday.\nKasich continued to tout Thursday’s planned rollout of an outline for his objectives during his first 100 days in office.\n“I don’t think it will take 10 years to balance the budget,” he told one questioner at the town hall.\nTo another, he said he will propose a substantial increase in defense spending.\nBut what he promised most was a competent, take-charge leadership style that will get even an recalcitrant Congress to cooperate.\n“You got to have somebody to go in there and inspire them them to think about the country before themselves or their political party or their ideology,” he said. “And it’s a helluva hard thing to get done.”\nKasich also toured scenic Woodstock, N.H., including historic Fallen Hardware where he tasted some fresh maple syrup and jokingly made an awful face.\n\n@darreldrowland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:39:52.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
