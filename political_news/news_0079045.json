Education Secretary Arne Duncan speaks Sept. 14 during a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa. Duncan is stepping down in December after seven years in the Obama administration.\nBy Lauren Camera Oct. 2, 2015 | 12:42 p.m. EDT + More After seven years helping to usher in dramatic changes to the education landscape, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is stepping down in December, a White House official confirms.\nThe announcement comes as a surprise to the entire education community, as Duncan has said that he would remain secretary until the end of President Barack Obama's time in the White House, even after he announced recently that his wife and children moved back to his hometown of Chicago to begin school there this year.\nDuncan is one of Obama's two remaining original cabinet members and is one of the president's closest allies.\nDuncan oversaw the Education Department during a time of significant change in the K-12 space, and the secretary was a pro at finding ways to work around Congress to get things done when he felt lawmakers weren't doing their job.\nRELATED\nEducation Secretary Duncan Combats School-to-Prison Pipeline He was instrumental in creating the Obama administration's signature competitive grant program, Race to the Top, which with billions of dollars from the economic stimulus incentivized states to make a series of difficult education policy changes.\nAmong them was the adoption of the divisive Common Core State Standards , a set of rigorous academic benchmarks that more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted . The competition was also integral in pushing states to expand charter schools, evaluate and pay teachers in part on student test scores, and intervene in chronically failing schools.\nThose changes were largely cemented into place when the department began offering states waivers from the most burdensome parts of the outdated and much-maligned No Child Left Behind Act. In order to receive a waiver, states had to promise to adopt many of the same education polices that were required to receive a Race to the Top grant.\nCritics of Duncan, especially Republicans in Congress, have argued that he used Race to the Top and the conditional NCLB waivers to coerce states into adopting education changes â€“ though Duncan has maintained that both the grants and the waivers were optional for states.\nThe secretary also went to battle with the two national teachers' unions, both of which have called for his resignation at various times. The National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers have argued that his embrace of a corporate style of education, where public schools are shuttered to make way for privately managed charter schools, are detrimental to the public education system.\nRELATED\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan Urges Black College Students to Give Back On the other hand, his focus on tackling the poorest-performing schools and creating a better education system for the most disadvantaged students in the country won him the support of civil rights groups. Those values, he's said, were largely instilled in him from a young age, when he helped run his mother's after-school day care center on the south side of Chicago.\nDuncan wasn't afraid of working across the aisle when it was politically convenient for him to do so, often teaming up with Republican governors, such as Bill Haslam of Tennessee, to bolster support for his ideas.\nHis resignation comes as Congress is in the final stages of trying to overhaul NCLB, the latest version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. And it follows the resignation announcement of House Speaker John Boehner , who was an original architect of the federal K-12 law, as well as the announcement by Rep. John Kline, the Minnesota Republican who authored the House's NCLB rewrite bill, that he won't seek re-election next year. Taken together, it's unclear whether this will entirely derail the bill's chances or embolden lawmakers currently conferencing the House and Senate bills to deliver a measure to the president's desk by the end of the year.\nDuncan also helped usher in significant changes to the higher education space, focusing much of his efforts on curbing student loan default rates by putting in place a set of new repayment options pegged to borrowers' incomes.\nJohn King, currently the second-in-command at the department, will succeed Duncan in December. King was most recently the commissioner of education in New York state.\nTAGS: Duncan, Arne education policy Department of Education", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Arne%20Duncan%20to%20Step%20Down%20as%20Education%20Secretary&summary=One%20of%20Barack%20Obama%27s%20closest%20allies%2C%20the%20education%20secretary%20had%20been%20expected%20to%20ride%20with%20the%20president%20for%20the%20rest%20of%20his%20term.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Arne%20Duncan%20to%20Step%20Down%20as%20Education%20Secretary", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtrwh%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Arne%20Duncan%20to%20Step%20Down%20as%20Education%20Secretary"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:21:45.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
