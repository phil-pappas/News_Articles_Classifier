Rep. Kevin McCarthy's withdrawal from the speaker's race has caused disarray혰that is, greater disarray혰within the House GOP conference. Hours after McCarthy's announcement, there was no word of what comes next. Who might jump in? Would a caretaker candidate emerge? How long could Speaker John Boehner stay in the job? And, it seemed, the House tea partiers who had somewhat caused this crisis혰they had succeeded in driving Boehner from the job and had deemed McCarthy insufficiently conservative혰were yearning for more chaos. The House Freedom Caucus, the tea party GOPers, put out this statement: Note that last sentence: \"The next Speaker needs to yield back power to the membership for the sake of both the institution and the country.\" In other words, we don't want a speaker who is going to try to govern in a time of divided government; we don't want a speaker who will endeavor to forge a compromise on behalf of the GOP conference and make the system work; and, as a government shutdown looms and a possible debt ceiling crisis approaches, we want a speaker who will step to the side and let the chaos reign. This is the congressional equivalent of \"burn, baby, burn.\" Yup. These business men from the teabagger party are out for only one thing. more money for themselves.
