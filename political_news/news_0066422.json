Early voting offers hints There are only 11 days until election night and early voting results are giving us clues as to who may end up in a runoff to become Houston's next mayor. Doug Miller, KHOU 11 News 8:20 p.m. CDT October 23, 2015 KHOU 11 News CONNECT TWEET   \nHOUSTON - Election Day isn't the only election day anymore. \nNo longer are winners and losers decided by a flood of Texas voters gushing through polling places on a single day. Instead, a stream of citizens flows to the polls casting early ballots over the course of two weeks. \nAs a result, people in politics watch the voting play out in a sort of slow motion. So they study the turnout numbers, looking at who's showing up at the polls and making their best educated guesses about who might win. \nTherein lies a tantalizing hint about who might emerge as the two candidates facing each other in an almost certain runoff in December. \nEvery evening, the Harris County Clerk's office blasts out an email to a long list of reporters and people working in politics. A spread sheet shows how many voters cast ballots every day at each of the county's early voting places. \nRelated: Early Voting Guide \nCampaigns also receive lists of the names of voters who've cast their ballots. Among those who study those lists is Bob Stein, the Rice University political scientist and KHOU political analyst, who discerned a pattern in the first few days of early voting. \n\"We're seeing heavy early voting turnout in places like the west side and Clear Lake,\" Stein said. \"We're also seeing heavy early voting turnout in African-American precincts.\" \nUsing the data on who's already voted, where they've voted and how it compares to what a sampling of voters told him during the most recent KHOU News 88-7 Poll, Stein believes the early turnout advantages two candidates for Houston mayor. \n\"Looks good for Sylvester Turner, no question,\" Stein said. \"And it looks good for a Republican candidate and probably Bill King.\" \nTurner has been the front-runner in every poll conducted on this race and even other candidates have assumed he's pretty much a lock for the runoff. The high turnout at historically African-American early polling places, as well Stein's analysis of confirmed early voters, gives him reason to smile. \n\"I am seeing a big uptick in African-American early voting turnout,\" Stein said. \"I assume that's due to two things: the mayor's race where Sylvester Turner's a very prominent black (candidate) and a very large number of African Americans voting for controller and at large (council seats). So I think they're moving the early vote. Any candidate who knows who their base is likes to get their vote out early.\" \nMeanwhile, polling has indicated Republican voters have been breaking for King over Steve Costello, who's also angling for GOP votes. So a high turnout at traditionally Republican polling places like the Trini Mendenhall Sosa Center on Houston's west side, is good news for King, Stein said. \n\"There were so many undecided Republican voters who were breaking in our poll very clearly towards Bill King,\" Stein said. \"That would be a real indication that he's likely to be in the runoff.\" \nAdrian Garcia, who placed second in a poll released last summer, and Chris Bell have both been competing with Turner for core Democratic voters. \n\"But there are just not enough undecided Democratic voters to go around for those two candidates,\" Stein said. \"And Costello, I think, is just not able to win support from the base Republican vote that's out there that he should have been able to win as a three-term incumbent councilmember.\" \nStill, Stein emphasizes that King, Garcia, Costello and Bell all have a realistic chance to advance to the runoff in December. \n\"When you're talking about 20, 25 percent at the most turnout, your vote will make a difference,\" Stein said.  //on.khou.com/1LTh4R9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:36:01.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
