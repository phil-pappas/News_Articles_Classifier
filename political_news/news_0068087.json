(Courtesy of Ruth Gates) October 22 at 5:54 PM Regarding the Oct. 20 Health & Science article “ Creating corals that can survive climate change ”:\nWhile it is true that marine corals are under some stress at present, efforts to enhance their survival by selective breeding seem unnecessary; nature, i.e., evolution, has done the job.\nCorals of various types have been around for a half-billion years (the Cambrian Period ) and became overwhelmingly abundant in the Ordovician Period (about 450 million years ago). Apart from a brief hiatus at the Permian-Triassic Extinction (roughly a quarter-billion years ago), from which they recovered handily, corals have survived the many extreme environmental swings throughout Earth’s history without our assistance.\nPriestley Toulmin , Alexandria", "external_links": ["http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/ordovician/ordovician.php", "http://www.coris.noaa.gov/about/what_are/", "http://www.britannica.com/science/Cambrian-Period", "http://www.britannica.com/science/Permian-extinction"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:32:36.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
