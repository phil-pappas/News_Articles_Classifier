Because the minute you create a timeline... your opponents, your enemies are organizing for, waiting you out. And I think that's the proper thing to do.\" \nMr. Obama announced Thursday that the U.S. would continue to keep its 9,800 troops in the country through the majority of 2016, reducing that number to about 6,000 forces after 2016. It's a change from president's plans to draw down the amount of soldiers to 1,000 by the end of his term. CBS News Homeland Security Correspondent Jeff Pegues and CBS News Senior National Security Analyst Juan Zarate discuss the president's recent ann... \n\"I'm pleased the president has not worried about a campaign promise six years ago,\" Bush continued. \"Conditions change. And I think he made the right decision to keep troops on the ground.\" \nBut, the White House contender said: \"It looks like it's political -- cut it in half, and, you know, off we go.\" \nBush also laid out a strategy on intervention in Syria, and slammed the White House for their late response to the four-year-long conflict. \nWhen it comes to acting in Syria, Bush charged that the president \"should have earlier.\" \nAs for his own plans in Syria, the former Florida governor said that we \"need to create safe zones, to have a safe harbor for refugees, and to allow us to rebuild the remnants of the Syria free army.\" \nBush also included no-fly zones in his list of intervention tactics in the war-torn country and dismissed Russian support to Assad. \n\"The argument was, well, we'll get into conflict with Russia -- well, maybe Russia shouldn't want to be in conflict with us,\" he said. \"This is a place where American leadership is desperately needed. Russia is there to prop up Assad. We're there to deal with both Assad and ISIS and we should garner the support of Europe and the Middle East countries to do just that.\" \nThe presidential candidate also weighed in on the 2016 race, where he's made a precipitous drop in the polls, falling behind political outsiders like real estate mogul Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. \nHe criticized Trump for how the billionaire would handle Assad and slammed him for wanting to send refugees back to Syria \"to their slaughter.\" \n\"I mean these are serious times and I think you need a person who has the temperament and the leadership skills to fix the things that are broken,\" Bush said. \"I don't know about Donald Trump's views of leadership because he talks about himself the whole time, rather than what he would do.\" \nAsked if he had any advice for Joe Biden, who has been weighing a jump into the 2016 race, Bush said: \"Continue speaking Korean.\" Bush was referring to Biden's comments to reporters Thursday , just before he greeted South Korean President Park at the Naval Observatory. The vice president laughingly responded to the press' questions about a White House bid that he would only \"answer in Korean.\" Â© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
