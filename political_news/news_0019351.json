We hear that he will be spending this year’s Dussehra there. Sources say that Mahesh’s kids haven’t been to the Eiffel tower yet and since they’re on their holiday break from school, the family felt this is the right time to make some plans. Sources add that Mahesh would be joining the sets of Brahmotsavam in Ooty, once he’s back from his holiday for a month-long schedule. Mahesh will be accompanied by his wife Namrata Shirodkar and their children Gautham and Sitara. Meanwhile, we hear that it was Samantha, who actually made Mahesh go ahead with the Paris trip as she hadn’t given dates for his movie that made him wait till the first week of November. On the film front, rumours are abuzz that Mahesh might team up with filmmaker AR Murugadoss for a bilingual, however nothing has been confirmed yet. “Talks have been going on for a while. But nothing concrete has happened on this development so far,” a source told us.
