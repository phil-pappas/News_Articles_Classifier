Birnbaum, MD, Quality Leadership Award, formerly named the UHC Quality Leadership Award. Presented by UHC, an alliance of the nation's leading nonprofit academic medical centers, the award is given to members that demonstrate superior performance as measured by the UHC Quality and Accountability Study . Memorial Hermann-TMC was one of only 13 member hospitals across the country chosen as a 2015 award winner.\n\"It is a great honor to be recognized again by UHC as a high-performing academic medical center that provides safe and high-quality care to all patients,\" said Craig Cordola , Regional President of Memorial Hermann Health System. \"This prestigious recognition reflects the dedication and compassion from our talented staff, affiliated physicians and our partners at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) Medical School. They should be applauded not only for helping Memorial Hermann-TMC achieve this honor, but more importantly, for their tireless dedication to providing quality patient care.\"\nConducted annually since 2005, UHC's Quality and Accountability Study was designed to help academic medical centers identify structures and processes associated with high performance in quality and safety across a broad spectrum of patient care activity. The Institute of Medicine's six domains of care – safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity, and patient centeredness – were again used as a guide in structuring the study criteria.\nThe award winners were announced last night at the UHC Annual Conference 2015 in Orlando, Fla. , which was attended by nearly 2,000 people, including health care professionals from more than 200 UHC member organizations.\n\"I'm incredibly proud of our staff and affiliated physicians as they are the true recipients of this award,\" said Brian Dean , CEO and Sr. Vice President of Memorial Hermann-TMC. \"We approach our day-to-day as a mission, not a job, and that has made all the difference. I'm honored to walk into work every day knowing that each and every patient is receiving safe, high-quality care.\"\nThis year, 102 UHC member institutions were included in the analysis, which used performance data from a variety of UHC sources, as well as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network. As in previous years, the scoring and ranking methodology was refined for the 2015 study to ensure that contemporary measures of quality and safety were included.\nFor more information about Memorial Hermann-TMC call 713-222-CARE (2273) or visit www.memorialhermann.org .\nMEDIA CONTACT:\nDrew Munhausen\n713-704-5547\nDrew.munhausen@memorialhermann.org\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140923/147994\n releases/memorial-hermann-texas-medical-center-wins-prestigious-quality-leadership-award-300153395.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.memorialhermann.org/locations/texas-medical-center/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140923/147994", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140923/147994", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC18554&Transmission_Id=201510021120PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC18554&DateId=20151002", "https://www.uhc.edu/membership/quality-accountability-study", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/memorial-hermann-texas-medical-center-wins-prestigious-quality-leadership-award-300153395.html", "http://www.memorialhermann.org/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:18:39.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
