The question looming before us is: Like Delhi in January 2015, will Bihar, too, declare a loud and emphatic NO to the BJP juggernaut?\nTo be sure, democratic opinion in the country is looking towards Bihar to stall the BJP’s march, or the ‘bulldozer’ it represents — to borrow a BJP leader’s graphic description. The leader in question has threatened to “bulldoze” West Bengal after winning power in Bihar. Indeed, “bulldozer” is a more appropriate imagery to describe the unleashing of the BJP’s aggressive corporate-driven and RSS-directed agenda. Market fundamentalists, RSS ideologues and other hard core Modi fans may well root for the bulldozer, but the overwhelming majority of Indians, including many who had voted for Narendra Modi in 2014, no longer appear to be enamoured of the Prime Minister. The battle for Bihar will be fought in this larger national context.\nThe BJP is aware of the growing disappointment of the people: the reason why Modi, in one of his meetings in Bihar, openly said that the time has not yet arrived to judge his government’s performance. He told the people of Bihar to wait till 2019. But once he was back in Delhi, the Prime Minister lined up his cabinet colleagues to present his government’s report card to the RSS!\nModi is trying to present his party as a fresh option for the people in Bihar. He is trying to tell the voters that his party is the only one which has not yet got an opportunity to rule the state. The people of Bihar, however, would clearly remember that the BJP, in alliance with Nitish Kumar, had run the state government for close to eight of the last 10 years.\nWhile Modi is seeking power in the name of change, Nitish Kumar has joined hands with Lalu Prasad and the Congress to defend his government. Both Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar are promising to deliver ‘development’ with the announcement of mega packages, presenting the vision of a glittering future. Neither, however, is willing to take responsibility to account for Bihar’s harsh current reality of mass deprivation and acute poverty. Modi keeps mocking Bihar’s backwardness and handing out promises to develop Bihar on the lines of Gujarat. Even though the true story of his corporate-driven Gujarat model has now been revealed by the Hardik Patel phenomenon.\nNitish Kumar, on the other hand, is claiming to have perfected his own Bihar model. In 2010, he talked mostly about infrastructure, citing improved roads and promising electricity. With roads unfailingly returning to their pothole-ridden past and electricity still remaining largely elusive in rural Bihar, he now talks less about infrastructure and more about social sectors. But given the crisis in public education and health services in Bihar and the failure of the entire delivery system, his development discourse sounds tired and hollow. Also conspicuously missing is his failed grand promise of delivering corruption-free governance.\nThe key question that Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar never address is the need for agrarian reforms and decent jobs — jobs that can be performed with dignity. Bihar is still a predominantly rural and agrarian state. But in the absence of land reforms and public investment, agriculture has been left to stagnate even as the bulk of the actual cultivators, including the landless poor and small tenants, who lease in land paying heavy rent, have no rights and get no state assistance. MNREGA has not filled the gap of declining agricultural employment. Industry only means land acquisition without creating jobs. And the millions of educated young people, including a growing proportion of women who run the services, whether private or public, are left with no job security or minimum wages.\nLand and agrarian reforms and jobs with dignity are the two issues that are central to the agenda of the Left bloc in Bihar. In a major tactical shift away from their erstwhile familiar line of tying up with regional parties, the CPI and CPI(M) have — this time — joined hands with the CPI(ML) to form a united and independent Left bloc. This promising political development reflects the resolve of the Left and the wide range of fighting forces on the ground, to see the Left emerge as a consistent and credible alternative centre of politics. The banner of independent assertion of the Left, upheld by the CPI(ML) against all odds through every twist and turn in Bihar politics, has galvanised the fighting Left base of Bihar with a new spirit of enthusiasm.\nWe would like to remind those who are worried that the unity and independence of the Left in Bihar may work to the electoral advantage of the BJP, that the Bihar elections are not just be about the growing disillusionment with the Modi government’s 16 months. They are also about Nitish Kumar’s huge betrayal to the poor and the oppressed of Bihar in delivering both development and justice — the two central planks of his much-trumpeted gospel of good governance. The Left’s alignment with the JDU-RJD-Congress alliance would have made the BJP/NDA the exclusive beneficiary of the political reality that analysts and poll gurus generally describe as ‘anti-incumbency’.\nAlso, on a more fundamental level, the question that should merit the urgent attention of every defender of democracy is: how on earth did the BJP manage to acquire such a major foothold in Bihar? Obviously, the symbolism of Lalu Prasad stalling the Advani rath and Nitish Kumar belatedly pitting his Bihar ‘swabhiman’ campaign against the arrogance of Narendra Modi have not been enough. Something much more vital and substantive has been missing. And this is where the Cobrapost revelations regarding the Ranveer Sena give us a crucial insight.\nBehind the brave rhetoric against Advani and BJP and the tall talks of empowering the poor, Lalu Prasad presided over the grisliest of serial massacres of men, women and children of some of Bihar’s most oppressed castes.\nAnd the appeasement of feudal forces, especially of the BJP-backed Ranveer Sena, has assumed more shocking dimensions during Nitish Kumar’s stewardship. This was more so in evidence following the disbanding of the Amir Das Commission and the subsequent wholesale acquittal of the perpetrators of the massacre. It may be recalled that the Amir Das Commission was set up in the wake of the brutal December 1997 massacre, killing more than 60 men, women and children belonging to socially and economically oppressed groups of Laxmanpur-Bathe, Jehanabad, by the Ranvir Sena.\nAlongside systematic assaults on the Left social base, we have also witnessed in this period, targeted killings and persecution of Left leaders and activists. Against this backdrop, the resurgence of the Left in Bihar will be the most effective bulwark for democracy; and for the struggles of the oppressed, disempowered and marginalised all over the country.\nThe author is general secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:07:38.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
