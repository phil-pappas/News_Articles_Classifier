The LGA declined to reveal which councils were affected.\nChancellor George Osborne has asked government departments to draw up plans for cuts of 40% and 25%.\n'Better ways' The LGA released to the BBC an analysis which said 40% cuts would leave councils £20bn worse off.\nLord Porter told BBC Radio 4's PM programme some councils \"will be very close in the life of this Parliament to not being able to meet their statutory obligation to balance their budget\".\nHe said: \"We're not shroud-waving - we kind of know we need to do more and better and do it with less money - but we're saying there are better ways of doing things with less money than simply top-slicing some things out of local government \"\nA 40% reduction to core central government funding for councils in England and Wales would be worth £8.4bn while the same cut to separate local government grants would see a further £2.1bn lost, the LGA said.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/332D/production/_86210131_003935919-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:55:05.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
