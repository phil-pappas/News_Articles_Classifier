(Washington Blade photo by Damien Salas) Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton drew a strong contrast on Wednesday between herself and Republican hopefuls who back Kim Davis, telling the Kentucky clerk “enforce the law or you resign.”\nThe former secretary of state made the remarks in response to a question at a rally in Iowa on Davis, who was jailed for defying the U.S. Supreme Court on same-sex marriage out of religious objections. \n“I think what happened to Kim Davis was the right thing,” Clinton said. “She violated the law and therefore she was arrested, and when she was released she had to agree that she would not stand in the way of doing her public duty under the Constitution.” \nBy supporting the jail time, Clinton stands in contrast to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who said her incarceration amounts to the criminalization of Christianity and appeared with Davis on stage at a rally upon her release. Other Republicans who’ve expressed support for Davis are Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said during the second Republican debate he agrees with Huckabee on Davis. \nClinton said people are entitled to their personal and religious beliefs, but “when you take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, that is your job.” \nThe candidate compared Davis to former Arkansas Gov. Orval Fabus, who in the 1950s sought to block school integration despite orders from the courts. \n“You either enforce the law or you resign from your public position,” Clinton said. “That is exactly what should have happened.” \nWatch the video (courtesy Washington Pos t)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:01:45.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
