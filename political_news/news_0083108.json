Revamps of the Resource Teacher Learning and Behaviour scheme and truancy programmes, the PACT tool and selling National Standards to parents? \n\"New Zealanders’ long held belief that their children are entitled to a free education, no matter how much parents earn, is clearly taking a hammering under the National Government. \n\"Today’s Parents’ Report Card proves it’s time for the government to get back to the basics and provide a solid, affordable education for New Zealand children and their families\" says Mrs Martin. \n\"New Zealand First would work with the sector to immediately review the cost of delivering our world class New Zealand Curriculum.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
