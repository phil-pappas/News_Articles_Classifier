But the former secretary of state arrived in Las Vegas ready to re-introduce herself to voters after a rough summer as the candidate ready to make history.\nTwice during the debate, she reminded the audience that she would be the first woman president.\nClinton: Republicans demonize and insult immigrants By Nick Gass\n“I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president,” she told Cooper when asked why the country should elect an insider, not an outsider.\nLest anyone forget that this time she plans to shatter that “highest, hardest glass-ceiling” that eluded her eight years ago, she brought it up again when grilled on how her first-term would look different from President Obama’s third term: “being the first woman president would be quite a change,” she said.\nClinton leaned into gender beginning with her opening statement, when she introduced herself as “the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child” and said she believes “in equal pay for equal work for women . . . and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.”\nClinton has made gender central to her campaign since her kick-off rally on Roosevelt Island six months ago, when she spoke emotionally about lessons learned from her mother, and debuted her line about fathers being able to tell their daughters they can do anything — including be elected president.\nEight years ago on the debate stage and throughout the primary, Clinton’s campaign downplayed any focus on running as a woman and focused on presenting her as a tough leader. But surrounded by men, most of whom needed to score points against her to stand out, Clinton on Tuesday night announced it as one of her strongest attributes.\nThe positioning might come from years of practice. Clinton has, perhaps, learned over the years that being the sole woman on a debate stage can open up her opponents to mistakes. The decisive moment in Clinton's 2000 New York Senate race against then-Rep. Rick Lazio was delivered courtesy of a debate night, when Lazio walked over to Clinton holding a piece of paper and demanded that she sign a pledge to never spend soft money in her campaign. The move was seen as bullying and aggressive, and became a turning point in the race.\nSanders team pumps out attacks on Clinton By Gabriel Debenedetti\nIn 2008, Obama made a similar mistake by telling Clinton, \"You’re likable enough, Hillary,\" and came off sounding patronizing.\nOn Tuesday night, none of her male opponents fell into a trap of attacking her on personality or appearing to bully her -- Bernie Sanders' best moment came when he defended her against the intense focus on the email controversy dogging her campaign.\nBut after the debate, campaign chairman John Podesta briefed volunteers, telling them \"she just made our jobs a little easier\" and reminded them, yet again, they were on the path to help elect the first woman president.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:42:37.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
