Following the success of this launch, Baume & Mercier announces a second installment in its collaboration: A one-of-a-kind Capeland Shelby® Cobra timepiece that will be auctioned at Antiquorum in New York City on December 9, 2015 , with all proceeds going to the Carroll Shelby Foundation. Bids may be placed online , over the phone or in person.\n\"We are very proud to partner with the Carroll Shelby Foundation. Our agreement is nurtured by a similar philosophy. The elegance of the lines, the attention to high quality, and commitment to humanism are some of our common characteristics,\" stated Alain Zimmermann , CEO of Baume & Mercier.\n\"Shelby and Baume & Mercier have earned an international reputation for quality, precision and craftsmanship,\" said Neil Cummings , CEO of Carroll Shelby Licensing and co-CEO of Carroll Shelby International. \"Our shared pursuit of perfection has made both companies legendary. We're honored that Baume & Mercier has created a one-of-a kind watch to benefit the Shelby Automotive Museum, which was designed to inspire a new generation of enthusiasts worldwide.\"\nOne-of-a-kind Capeland Shelby ® Cobra 18K red gold Flyback Chronograph\nIn keeping with the design of the two Baume & Mercier Capeland Shelby® Cobra chronographs released earlier this year, Baume & Mercier has designed a truly unique version of this watch inspired by the graphic identity codes of the Shelby Cobra racecar. This precious and sporty one-off chronograph is distinguished by the extreme subtlety of its Haute Horlogerie finishes: an off-white dial with sky blue stripes picking up those on racing cars, blue accents on the dial and hands, a 44 mm polished/satin-finished 18K red gold case, a finely grained black calfskin strap with round-scale blue alligator lining and gray stitching, and an 18K red gold pin buckle. The inscription \"Shelby Cobra 1965-2015, Unique Piece\" is engraved on the case back, framing a sapphire crystal bearing Carroll Shelby's signature. In keeping with tradition and with the high-precision reputation of Baume & Mercier watches, this flyback chronograph is driven by a Swiss-made mechanical self-winding movement from the Manufacture La Joux-Perret. The exclusive presentation box will also house an additional black leather alligator strap with round-scale blue alligator lining and gray stitching.\n\"It is a pleasure for Antiquorum to offer Baume & Mercier's unique Capeland Shelby® Cobra Flyback Chronograph commemorating Carroll Shelby's most celebrated automotive creation, the legendary Shelby Cobra in our December auction,\" said Evan Zimmermann , President & CEO of Antiquorum. \"We are honored to support the Carroll Shelby Foundation and help raise funds to assist families of children with major heart ailments.\"\nProceeds from the auction will go to the Carroll Shelby Foundation, an organization that raises funds to help families and children affected by heart diseases. It also provides schooling and education for underprivileged young people in the US.\nBaume & Mercier will produce only one exemplar of this significant collector's piece. The highest bidder in the auction will also receive an exclusive VIP package experience, valued at $10,000 . It includes a visit to the Shelby World Headquarters in Las Vegas , an original illustration of the Cobra signed by the Cobra driving legends, a Cobra driving experience, two custom-made racing suits, a VIP factory tour, a personal item of Carroll Shelby and a photo opportunity aboard an historical Cobra CXS2000.\nFor more information or to register for the auction, visit www.antiquorum.com .
