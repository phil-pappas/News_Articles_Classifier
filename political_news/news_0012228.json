But the soft-spoken politician was mostly overshadowed on stage. The former Republican’s insistence that he was a “block of granite” when it comes to his political beliefs fell flat.\nHillary Clinton \nA seasoned debater, Clinton more than held her own in the first debate. She defended herself against attacks, pushed back on what she described as Sanders’ weak record on gun control and won applause when she mentioned that O’Malley backed her for president in 2008. She worked to show she can relate to working American families after years of being criticized as an out-of-touch Washington insider by speaking about her factory worker grandfather and 1-year-old granddaughter.\nMartin O’Malley \nThe debate was unlikely to be the game-changer he had hoped for. He presented himself as a progressive with a record of getting things done as Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor as he introduced himself to potential voters in his largest audience to date in the campaign, but even a solid performance is unlikely to alter the race because the two front-runners, Clinton and Sanders, did not make any huge gaffes. O’Malley has spent millions of dollars and months building a campaign, but he has failed to get any traction in the early states or even his own state.\nBernie Sanders \nThe fiery Sanders opened with a clarion call for taking back government “from a handful of billionaires,” but his clash with Clinton over whether he is a capitalist may have underscored a problem he may have expanding beyond his activist base and convincing skeptical Democrats that he could be the party’s standard-bearer. Sanders, who needs to show he could be president, appeared uneasy when the debate veered into foreign policy, at one point asserting that Russian President Vladimir Putin was “already regretting his invasion of Crimea.” But he gained steam when the debate moved back into regulating Wall Street.\nJim Webb \nThe former secretary of the Navy struggled for attention, at one point telling moderator Anderson Cooper he’d been “waiting for 10 minutes” to make a point. He sought to stress his experience on military issues and foreign policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:26:22.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
