He has also raised more than $3.2 million since Tuesday's debate, his campaign said, with an average donation of $32.28.\nHis reliance on small donors is a marked difference from any other serious contender: only 270 of his contributors gave the maximum of $2,700, and more than 77 percent of his contributions since he launched his campaign were from individuals giving less than $200.\nSanders spent $11.3 million from July through September.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:33.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
