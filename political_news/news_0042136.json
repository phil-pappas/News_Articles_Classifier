More MPs fear for pension savers \nAlibaba, China’s biggest ecommerce business, floated on the New York Stock Exchange just over a year ago, raising $21.8bn in the biggest initial public offering in US history . \nMr Ma is the first person without any obvious connections to the UK to join Mr Cameron’s 19-strong business sounding board, which meets four times a year. \nThis week’s presidential visit by Mr Xi is designed to cement a new “golden era” in Sino-British relations, with the signing of a string of business deals, including an investment in Hinkley Point nuclear power station. \n“I think it’s a real opportunity to deepen our relationship and I’m delighted President Xi is spending so much time here in the UK,” Mr Cameron told China Central Television. \nBut the red carpet trip has already been criticised by human rights activists while raising eyebrows among traditional allies such as the US. \nDuring the trip Mr Xi will address Parliament, stay at Buckingham Palace as a guest of Queen Elizabeth and dine at Chequers with the prime minister. \nJeremy Corbyn, Labour leader, has vowed to raise human rights with the president during a meeting on Tuesday. \nMeanwhile, Mr Cameron is still set to launch the annual Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal on Thursday on the steps of Number 10 despite the risk of offending his guest. \nIn 2010 Mr Cameron and fellow ministers refused to remove their poppies during a visit to China after Beijing officials complained they were a reminder of the Opium Wars between Britain and China during the 19th century. \nMr Cameron’s spokesman said he would not change his poppy-wearing arrangements just because of “what visitor is in town”. \nMr Ma will be joining the prime minister’s business group, which already includes prominent chief executives such as Bob Dudley of BP, Nigel Wilson of Legal & General, Carolyn McCall of easyJet and Jayne-Anne Ghadia of Virgin Money. \nMeetings are also attended by George Osborne, the chancellor, and Sajid Javid, the business secretary. \nMr Ma has enough political clout in China that an investigation by Chinese regulators into a range of accusations against Alibaba, from bribery to tolerating counterfeit goods, which was unveiled in January, was quickly quashed. \nThe company’s biggest liability has been the prevalence of fake goods for sale on Alibaba’s online marketplace Taobao. \nHe has previously blamed consumers for buying fake goods and saying they are at fault. \nIn April 2012, Alibaba was removed from the list of “notorious markets” compiled by the United States Trade Representative after it hired high-powered Washington lawyer James Mendenhall, former general counsel in the USTR. \nWhen Alibaba sold a stake to Yahoo and took over its China operations in 2005, Mr Ma told reporters he was committed to following Chinese law. In that context, he would hand over the private communications or online information of any users of Yahoo or Alibaba to Chinese police. \nHis comments came not long after a Chinese journalist was sentenced to 10 years in prison for sending emails through a Yahoo account to overseas human rights groups informing them of Chinese censorship directives. \nMr Ma has also said on several occasions, including in an interview with the Financial Times, that he would happily hand over all of his businesses to the ruling Communist party if he was asked to do so. \nChinese internet companies are closely monitored by government censors and have deep ties to the Chinese state security apparatus. \nAlibaba has enjoyed breakneck growth and has a corporate culture that is even more colourful than US rivals such as Facebook and Google, with employees encouraged to take on nicknames inspired by Kung Fu. \nThe group is poised to open offices across Europe , including in Italy, France and Germany, in the coming weeks. \nYet the company has recently lowered its sales estimates for the third quarter in a sign that China’s flagging growth is having an impact on consumer spending.
