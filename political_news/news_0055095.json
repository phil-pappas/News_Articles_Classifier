(AP) - Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says next year's election is about making \"a generational choice\" because well-established leaders of both parties are out of touch with most Americans.\nThe Florida senator is telling voters in New Hampshire that the country won't change direction, \"if all we do is keep electing the same kind of people.\"\nThe generational theme is one Rubio frequently mentions because it serves as a way to knock his many GOP presidential primary rivals. Many are older than Rubio and white, especially his former mentor Jeb Bush, the son and brother of presidents. It's also a way to attack Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton, wife of former President Bill Clinton.\nRubio trails GOP frontrunner Donald Trump in the latest polls nationally and New Hampshire.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
