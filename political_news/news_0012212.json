The top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of political affiliation. The idea was to fight polarization and encourage primary candidates to appeal to a wider pool of voters.\nBut minor parties say their candidates almost never are on the ballot in November, when millions more people vote than in the June primaries. The parties say the new system violates their constitutional right of political association.\nThe case is Rubin v. Padilla, 15-135.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
