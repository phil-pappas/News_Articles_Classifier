Those companies, who may be caught between a seed and series A funding round, could each receive anywhere between a few hundred thousand to a few million dollars to help accelerate their growth. \nThe Columbia, Md.-based institutional investors have raised a new fund, called the Propel II fund , to capitalize off the success of their previous fund, the Propel I fund, which helped support a number of high growth potential Baltimore tech companies— including edtech powerhouse CiteLighter, rising cybersecurity star RedOwl Analytics and eco-friendly product developer Bambeco. Chris College \nCollege said that the Propel II fund will be used to invest in companies that agree to headquarter in the Baltimore area—similar in nature to the incentive basis establish by Virginia’s state-funded, seed-stage VC firm, the Center for Innovative Technology (CIT). \nUnlike CIT, however, TCP Venture Capital receives no funding/support from the state of Maryland. Instead, College says that the fund is inspired by a basic belief that venture capital investment can foster both positive returns for LPs and create great tech businesses and jobs in a city he loves. \n“By narrowly defining where companies in our portfolio should be HQ’d, it becomes easier to create a critical mass within the city,” said College. \nWhile the preference for investment via the Propel II fund will be focused on tech companies, College explained, that the focus is industry agnostic—meaning that companies from a range of specialities, like e-commerce and data analytics, will be evaluated for potential involvement equally. \n\"Leveraging the strong portfolio of 10 investments assembled by Propel I and a robust pipeline of promising additional companies; Propel II has increased the number of new Limited Partners, to include several new foundations, corporations and private investors,\" College said in a statement. Context \nTCP Venture Capital currently operates via two funds, it’s aforementioned Propel fund, designed for early stage tech companies that will HQ in Charm City, and the Veterans’ Opportunity Fund, a multi-stage venture capital fund that was formed to invest in veteran-owned businesses in need of growth capital. Stuart M. Sutley \nCollege said that he believes D.C. and Baltimore’s technology landscape work in tandem and that in the future, it will be important to further improve the region’s access to early-stage capital, top-flight tech industry mentors and investor connections. \nBaltimore, as College explained, has witnessed a growth of both tech entrepreneurship and access to capital over the last 10 years—and that parallel trend is not a coincidence. In addition, a series of local success stories—which have spurred the creation of more new companies via the sale of advertising.com to AOL—has helped create a sense of momentum as well. \nTwo industries of particular strength that have come to call Baltimore home is the cybersecurity and for-profit education technology sectors. Outside of Baltimore’s RedOwl Analytics and CiteLighter, there is edtech stars Sylvan Learning and Laureate Education. Baltimore-based cybersecurity firm LookingGlass Cyber Solution has raised more than $30 million from investors, nationwide, and is also quickly expanding—effectively bringing high paying tech jobs to the city.
