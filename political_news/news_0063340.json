U.S. and Iraqi special forces are seen in a makeshift Islamic State group prison in an image captured via helmet camera on Thursday in the town of Huwija, in northeast Iraq.\nBy Paul D. Shinkman Oct. 26, 2015 | 10:26 a.m. EDT + More Footage emerged over the weekend reportedly showing the daring U.S.-Iraqi commando raid on an Islamic State group prison that freed dozens of captives and resulted in the death of a member of the U.S. Army's secretive Delta Force, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler .\nIt's a scene that will be repeated in the near future, U.S. officials say, amid the need for the specialized skills on the ground only Americans can provide. The Pentagon insists, however, this does not conflict with President Barack Obama's assurances that the U.S. would not deploy \"boots on the ground\" to engage in combat.\nRELATED\nU.S. Commando Killed in Joint Raid to Rescue ISIS Hostages Kurdish news network Rudaw first released the video from the Kurdistan Regional Security Council purportedly showing the raid from a helmet-mounted camera of a Kurdish special operations service member. In it, highly trained troops bearing American-made weapons and equipment storm a compound and usher out dozens of captives in prison robes, some with visible blood stains.\nAmerican voices are audible in the video, working directly alongside the Kurdish force as they frisk and move the prisoners and provide direct fire at the Islamic State group fighters there. U.S. and Kurdish officials have said roughly 40 Kurdish troops participated in the raid, supported by more than two dozen U.S. service members who operated the helicopters they used for transportation and served as direct advisers on the ground.\n\"We'll do more raids,\" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a press conference Friday. \"We have this capability. It is a great American strength.\"\n\"It doesn't represent us assuming a combat role. It represents a continuation of our advise-and- assist mission,\" he added. \"When we find opportunities to do things that will effectively prosecute the campaign, we're going to do that.\"\nThe headquarters overseeing the U.S. involvement in the anti-Islamic State group campaign released a video Sunday of one of its aircraft destroying the prison the commandos targeted last week. It likely was one of the many sources of close air support the Americans in the raid helped coordinate to weaken the enemy strength there before landing at the site.\nCarter said Friday the U.S. service members there were not supposed to get directly involved in the mission, but got drawn in after taking fire themselves. Master Sgt. Wheeler was wounded by small arms fire and later died.\nStill, the Islamic State group routinely kills locals en masse, and no Americans were reportedly being held at the prison, calling into question why the U.S. military got involved in this particular mission and how often they get involved in firefights in Iraq and Syria.\nRELATED\nU.S. Identifies Soldier Killed in Iraq Raid to Free Hostages A former commander with Delta Force – the elite hostage rescue and direct action unit considered the Army's equivalent to the Navy's equally secretive SEAL Team 6 – tells U.S. News there were few options for the U.S. operators who had been tasked to support their highly effective Kurdish counterparts and with whom they've been partnering for more than a decade.\n\"They are serious professionals, well-trained and committed,\" Dalton Fury, the commander's pen name, says of the Kurdish forces.\n\"They don't cut and run like the Iraqi military does. When you are tasked with supporting an allied [special operations forces], and they are gearing up for a hasty assault based on seemingly actionable intel, Delta operators don't stand around and wish them well as they leave the compound – they kit up and roll to the target with their allies,\" he says. \"It's more of a commando rule than a warrant for Delta specifically. Would anyone question this if the allied SOF was the Brits? No.\"\nRescue missions for hostages other than American citizens are very common, Fury says, and the chance of gathering further intelligence at the site of the raid was likely enough to merit deploying Americans as well.\nWheeler's remains were flown back to the U.S. on Saturday. Carter and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley attended the honor ceremony on the tarmac at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.\nTAGS: Iraq Islamic State Kurds military national security special forces", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Joint%20U.S.-Kurdish%20Commando%20Raid%20in%20Hawija%2C%20Iraq%2C%20to%20Become%20Frequent%20Sight", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Joint%20U.S.-Kurdish%20Commando%20Raid%20in%20Hawija%2C%20Iraq%2C%20to%20Become%20Frequent%20Sight&summary=Despite%20Obama%27s%20assurances%20against%20%27boots%20on%20the%20ground%2C%27%20Pentagon%20officials%20say%20this%20kind%20of%20combat%20will%20be%20repeated.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBJZmI1O2T4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBJZmI1O2T4", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/241020154", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Joint%20U.S.-Kurdish%20Commando%20Raid%20in%20Hawija%2C%20Iraq%2C%20to%20Become%20Frequent%20Sight", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek3gu%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:18:00.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
