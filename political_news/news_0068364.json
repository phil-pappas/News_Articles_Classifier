A hearing will be scheduled later. \nThe charge says Raphael extorted money in the form of campaign contributions for elected officials from Phoenix-based Redflex for contracts awarded by the Columbus City Council. \nRaphael said in a statement that he is taking responsibility for his “improper” actions, but denies he took part in any bribery or public corruption. \nRaphael does not implicate any elected officials in his plea deal. A federal investigation is ongoing. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:53:54.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
