Related Content House hardliner: We would consider Ryan for House speaker \nThe Republican-backed measure was scheduled for a joint Senate and Assembly hearing on Tuesday. \nDemocrats who had been co-sponsors of the measure dropped their support on Monday, and the Wisconsin League of Women Voters voiced opposition because the proposal would get rid of special registration deputies. \nThose deputies are used to canvas neighborhoods and get people registered to vote. \nIn addition to allowing online registration, the bill would also permit people who are already registered to change their name and address online and shorten the window when absentee ballots could be received and be counted. \nThe bill is on a fast track in the Legislature. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
