That's what a demagogue does: They say whatever they need to say to try to stir up the passions of people.\"\nClinton also slammed Trump for his rhetoric on immigration.\n\"He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia, he's been really appealing to the worst instincts of human nature,\" Clinton said. \"I think it's dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing.\"\nTrump, who appear on \"Morning Joe\" shortly after the clip aired, responded by saying Clinton used to call him a \"genius.\"\n\"I'm a little surprised at her tone, but that's OK,\" Trump said. \"She's been surprised at my tone.\"\n\"I'm a counter-puncher, and everything I say is when somebody says something about me.\"\nThe two candidates have a long history, including Trump inviting the Clintons to his most recent wedding and them attending. He has donated both to Clinton's past campaigns in New York and to her family's foundation. Their daughters are also friendly.\nBoth have since brushed off the connections, with Trump saying Clinton had to go to his wedding because of the donations and Clinton saying she went merely for fun.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:09:06.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
