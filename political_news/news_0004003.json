Jim Webb (Photo: Charlie Neibergall / AP) \nCONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Washington — Jim Webb says he is dropping out of the Democratic race for president and is considering his options about how he might “remain as a voice” in the campaign.\nThe former Virginia senator says at a news conference that he is “withdrawing from any consideration” of becoming the Democratic party’s nominee.\nA one-time member of President Ronald Reagan’s administration, Webb repeatedly complained during the first Democratic debate last week that he was given little time to answer questions compared to other candidates. He said Thursday he felt the debate had been “rigged in terms of who was going to get the time on the floor.”\nWebb has trailed badly in the field that includes Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Webb has been polling in the back of the pack with former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.\nWebb has raised only about $700,000 and ended the month of September with more than $300,000 in the bank. Rivals like Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have raised millions for the campaign.\nWebb surprised many fellow Democrats when he became the first major figure in the party to form a presidential exploratory committee in November.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
