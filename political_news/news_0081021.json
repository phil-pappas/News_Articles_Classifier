Rather than considering the practical consequences of what they have done, the automated locking people up, throwing away the key isn't just a human rights issue, but it's going to continue to be a sore that will fester if it's not fixed between Australia and New Zealand.’ \nSenator Hanson-Young told TV One’s Q+A programme, these ‘are people who haven’t lived in New Zealand since they were sometimes very young children. They are, by all other means, Australian. They were educated here, they went to school here, they’ve got jobs here, they’ve paid taxes here. If they are able to stay; if they’ve done their time, then they should be able to.’ \nMs Hanson-Young says she will be raising the issue when the Australian parliament reconvenes in a week, ‘as an Australian politician, we have got to start standing up for what is right.’ \nQ+A, 9-10am Sundays on TV ONE and one hour later on TV ONE plus 1.
