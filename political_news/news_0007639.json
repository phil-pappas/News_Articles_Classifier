Bradley Podliska before firing him in late June. \nThe former staffer had reservations about a partisan investigation focused on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton . The panel's chairman, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, said he was unaware of the man's concerns. \nThe lawyers also said they sent a cease-and-desist letter asking Gowdy to stop talking about confidential settlement discussions with Podliska. \nPodliska plans to file a lawsuit contesting his dismissal.
