Australia endured a 12-year drought from 1997 to 2009. \nDemocratic Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le√≥n of Los Angeles says California can learn how to adapt to what could be more frequent extreme weather due to climate change. \nAssembly Minority Leader Kristin Olsen, a Republican from Modesto, is among the 11 lawmakers from both political parties on the trip. \nAlso attending is California Water Commission member Daniel Curtin. \nThe trip is organized and paid for by the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think-tank.
