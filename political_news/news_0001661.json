Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a CNN Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: John Locher, AP) \nIOWA CITY, Ia. — U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders says he has an “ample supply of underwear,” despite how he was portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" this week. \nComedian Larry David imitated Sanders during yesterday’s \"SNL\" cold open, which recreated Tuesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas. David, the co- creator of “Seinfeld,” won praise for nailing Sanders’ thick Brooklyn accent. \n“I own one pair of underwear,” David said. “That’s it. Some of these billionaires they have three, four pairs.” \nAfter a house party in Iowa City Sunday, Sanders assured reporters he is well supplied. \n“Last week, I bought my second pair of underwear. That’s a joke. Please don’t write it down,” Sanders said. \"I have an ample supply of underwear.” \nSanders said he only owned one suit while he was mayor of Burlington, Vt., but said he has increased his wardrobe during his tenure in the U.S. Senate. \nMORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:00:42.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
