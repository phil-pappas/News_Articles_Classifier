Services industries continue to outperform, while the mining industry trails well behind,\" Mr Oster said.\n\"Weak commodity prices and falling mining investment will remain a drag on economic activity and downside risks from offshore remain pronounced.\"\nDespite this, it was difficult to mount a case for further Reserve Bank interest rate cuts, and the current market pricing for further easing was \"overly pessimistic\", he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:33:25.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
