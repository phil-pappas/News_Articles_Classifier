That was the golden age apparently ... and then I came along and messed it all up.\"\nThe President slammed Republicans, saying they wanted to turn back the clock on his administration's work on immigration. He offered rare praise to his predecessor, George W. Bush, who spent a year trying to pass an immigration plan through Congress that offered a temporary work program for undocumented immigrants.\nWithout naming him, Obama took aim at GOP 2016 front-runner Donald Trump, who has proposed building a massive wall between Mexico and the United States to keep out undocumented immigrants.\nRead More \"America's greatness does not come from building walls,\" the President said, accusing Republicans make voters fear immigrants. \"It comes from building opportunity.\"\nObama also alluded to GOP contender Marco Rubio's track record on immigration. The Florida senator sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013.\n\"Some of the very same Republican politicians who championed immigration reform in the past, some of whom sponsored these efforts, suddenly they want nothing to do with it,\" Obama said.\nAs the audience booed, the President interrupted them.\n\"Don't boo ... vote. They can't hear the boos ... they can hear your vote,\" he said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:52:07.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
