Police responded to reports of gunfire just after 11 p.m. Thursday, NBC News reports ; reportedly a dispute over \"a dice game\" being played in an outdoor courtyard descended into a fight and then a shooting. Multiple rounds were fired.\n Students on the scene are believed to have filmed the fight, and subsequent gunshots, but police have not released a description of the shooter — Vice News says this is because the footage is not of sufficient quality (given the darkness at the time of the shooting). That said, \"we know that there are other students who have video who may have good knowledge of the parties involved in this,\" a police spokesperson said Friday morning.\n The deceased victim has not been named, but is believed to be a 19-year-old male and not a student at TSU; CNN reports that the shooter is not a TSU student either. The two injured students are said to have gotten caught in the crossfire as they crossed the courtyard, though their injuries are \"not considered life-threatening.\" ​\nTSU's campus was locked down overnight and is closed today — but as part of the university's routine schedule, The Tennessean notes . Classes will resume as normal next week, and a police spokesperson added that \"the Nashville Police Department believes this campus is safe.\"\nThis post will be updated as further information becomes available.", "external_links": ["http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2015/10/23/3-shot-tsu-campus-one-critical-condition/74443452/", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/us/tennessee-state-university-campus-shooting/", "https://news.vice.com/article/gunman-still-on-the-run-after-fatal-shooting-at-tennessee-state-university", "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tennessee-state-university-campus-shooting-kills-1-injures-2-n449756"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:58:45.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
