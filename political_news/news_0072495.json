That’s compared to 39% that view Hillary Clinton positively with 47% reporting that they have a negative view, which leaves her with a net -8 rating. And Bernie Sanders continues to fare better with a +10 rating.Clinton’s continued erosion in support isn’t surprising. Though she has been more open with the press – sitting down for a number of interviews – that hasn’t changed the fact that Americans remain skeptical of her. A recent Quinnipiac poll shows that only 34% of voters think that Clinton is honest and trustworthiness as compared to 61% who say she’s not. And the latest CBS/NY Times poll wherein 81% of Democrat primary voters think Biden is honest and trustworthy as compared to 64% who think the same of Clinton.[caption id=\"attachment_490529032\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 29: (AFP OUT) U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attends the 'Leader's Summit on Countering ISIL and Countering Violent Extremism' at the United Nations Headquarters, on September 29, 2015 in New York City. The Summit, hosted by Obama, addressed national, regional and global initiatives to counter ISIL and the spread of violent extremism.

While Clinton would beat Trump by 10 points, Biden would win by 21 if the election were held today. And Clinton is in a statistical tie with Fiorina, Carson and Bush whereas Biden would beat Fiorina by six, Carson by eight and Bush by eight as well.Those figures aren’t bound to get any better considering that the latest batch of emails reveal that that there were three emails the State Department is calling “secret,” the second highest classification. And that it looks like Russian hackers tried to access Clinton’s private email five times while she was serving as secretary of state.We’ll know more if these revelations take a further toll on her numbers, but for the moment Clinton is still holding onto the lead for the Democrat nomination. In the latest polling, she garners 42% support with Sanders seven points behind at 35% and Biden at 17%. Of course, there were days when Clinton led the field by more than 40 points, but as I’ve argued before – and Clinton has pointed out herself – this was never going to be a coronation.Taken together, it’s not surprising that Biden is the most popular candidate in the field. The adage that you’re never as popular as the day before you announce certainly has truth to it. And there’s good reason for Biden to be popular: he’s completely authentic. Managing to remain genuine after 40+ years in public service is no small feat.But that doesn’t mean that Biden has a clear path to the presidency. There is talk of him waiting until the South Carolina primary to get into the race, a strategy that could be perilous for the vice president.Clinton holds a strong favorability rating with black voters. Although not as high as her husband’s approval, Clinton’s rating remains between 70% and 80%. Furthermore, in recent polling she has led Biden by up to 27 points in South Carolina and Sanders by 34. This is in a state where Obama beat her by 28 points. Sanders or Biden would be lucky to get 50% of the black vote against Clinton.All of us are watching this unfold closely and no one is doing so as intently as Biden and his team. If Clinton crashes or there are more adverse developments, expect to see him enter the race sooner rather than later. The numbers are already showing steady progress as doubt about Clinton grows.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490529032/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-01T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:29:40.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
