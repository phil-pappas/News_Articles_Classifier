Jim Jordan asked Clinton during the hearing Thursday.\n\"It started with you, Madam Secretary,\" he said. \"You could live with a protest about a video, that won't hurt you, but a terror attack would.\"\nClinton rejected Jordan's claim, describing the situation in the hours after the attack as \"fluid\" and the details unclear.\n\"I am sorry that it doesn't fit your narrative congressman, I can only tell you what the facts are,\" Clinton said.\nDuring the marathon hours of questioning -- which Democrats claim was a partisan attack on the Democratic presidential frontrunner -- Clinton said Stevens understood the risks involved and that his requests for additional security never crossed her desk.\n\"Those requests for security were rightly reviewed by the security professionals,\" Clinton told the committee. \"I did not see them. I did not approve them. I did not deny them.\"\nClinton also described Stevens as a friend, saying the 52-year-old ambassador \"understood that most people in Libya or anywhere reject the extremists' argument that violence can ever be a path to dignity or justice.\"\n\"I knew and admired Chris Stevens,\" she said in her opening remarks Thursday. \"He was one of our nation's most accomplished diplomats. Chris' mother liked to say he had 'sand in his shoes,' because he was always moving, always working, especially in the Middle East that he came to know so well.\"\nBut Clinton's closeness to Stevens was called into question by Rep Susan Brooks, R-Ill., who asked: \"Did you ever personally speak to him after you swore him in in May? Yes or no please.\"\n\"Yes, I believe I did,\" Clinton replied. \"I don't recall.\"\nIngmire described Clinton's choice of words about Stevens as jarring.\n\"How could she say 'Chris thought this' and 'Chris felt that' when she basically had nothing to do with him?\" Ingmire said.\nTyrone Woods' father, Charles, recalled meeting Clinton when his son's body arrived at Andrews Air Force Base two days after the attacks.\n\"I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand and she said, 'We are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of your son,\" Woods said, reading the account from his journal.\n\"That was a complete bald-faced lie,\" he told FoxNews.com Friday. \"The day after the attack, she was talking to the Prime Minister of Egypt and she said the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the video.\"\nSmith's mother, Patricia, gave a similar account, saying she was told by the administration \"it was a video when they knew it was not a video.\"\n\"They told me lies,\" she said Friday. \"My son told me the night before that he has been asking for security and he hasn’t heard anything.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:27:06.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
