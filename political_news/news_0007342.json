Students who participate in alternative certification programs would gain federal assistance under a new Education Department plan.\nBy Lauren Camera Oct. 14, 2015 | 12:04 a.m. EDT + More Continuing its month-long push to make higher education more affordable for low-income students, the U.S. Department of Education announced Wednesday a new effort that would allow students to tap federal tuition assistance for alternative certification programs.\nRELATED\nParents Support Testing, but Think There's Too Much As the cost of higher education has exploded over the last decade, there’s been a surge in alternative styles of degrees and certification programs, including “boot camp”-style training, a variety of online programs, short-term certificate programs and others.\nMany of them provide more flexible schedules and more affordable credentials than traditional higher education institutions and are showing promise in preparing students with specific training needed for in-demand jobs. However, because they fall outside the traditional accreditation system, students can’t use federal aid to pay for them, and no system is in place to gauge their effectiveness.\n“There are some indications that students enrolled in many of these programs may have impressive learning gains and impressive employment success,” Ted Mitchell, undersecretary of education said Tuesday during a press call. “But since many of these are standalone efforts outside of accredited institutions that offer financial aid, many students from low-income backgrounds cannot access them.”\n[ READ: Teachers' Unions Look to Clinton to Save Them ]\nA new program from the Education Department could change that. Beginning Wednesday, the department will evaluate proposals from colleges and universities seeking to partner with nontraditional providers to offer students credits, certificates, or alternative degrees. If approved, students enrolled in such partnerships would be able to access federal tuition assistance.\n“Through this experimental site, we hope to equip students, particularly low-income students, with greater access to innovative educational programs in subjects with the flexibility that they may not otherwise have,” said Mitchell.\nRELATED\nEducation Reforms Are Here to Stay The department estimates that in 2015 alone, computer coding boot camps are expected to grow the number of students they graduate by 240 percent, rising from 6,740 in 2014 to over 16,000. And the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that men with nondegree certificates in computer and information services earned $72,000 per year, which is on average more than 72 percent of men with traditional associate’s degrees.\n“We're expecting that there can be any other number of configurations and we're really interested and excited to see what sorts of programs are envisioned by colleges and universities and their partners over the coming weeks,” David Soo, senior policy adviser at the department, said during the press call.\nThe announcement, which was originally hinted at over the summer, comes on the heels of several higher education announcements from the Obama administration, including the release of the College Scorecard, a massive data set on things like graduation rates, student loan accumulation and estimated earning upon graduation.\nTAGS: Department of Education financial aid", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Education%20Department%20to%20Experiment%20With%20Federal%20Aid%20for%20Alternative%20Degrees&summary=New%20effort%20would%20allow%20students%20to%20tap%20federal%20tuition%20assistance%20for%0D%0Aalternative%20certification%20programs.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Education%20Department%20to%20Experiment%20With%20Federal%20Aid%20for%20Alternative%20Degrees", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Education%20Department%20to%20Experiment%20With%20Federal%20Aid%20for%20Alternative%20Degrees", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6bxn%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:27:54.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
