The shift is yet another departure from Obama's campaign promise to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq by the end of his presidency at the beginning of 2017, which under his original plan would have kept only a military presence at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul of roughly 1,000 advisers and attachees.\nThese remaining forces face grave challenges in Afghanistan -- though the war officially ended in 2014 -- as they continue to bolster the local military's attempts to stay a surge in Taliban violence, conduct counterterrorism operations, as well as contribute to fighting the endemic corruption that plagues Afghan governance, and offset a growing Islamic State group presence there.\nSpeculation that Obama would change his calendar-based decision to withdraw from Afghanistan had drifted throughout Washington D.C. for weeks. Defense Secretary Ash Carter hinted Wednesday the change in plan might be coming soon.\n\"It's not a question of whether, but how to continue the mission in Afghanistan, and last week, it became clear that our NATO allies feel the same way, as they told me. Many of my counterparts made a point of reaffirming their commitment, too,\" Carter said, while speaking before the Association of the U.S. Army's annual convention in Washington, D.C. \"The narrative that we're leaving Afghanistan is self-defeating. We're not. We can't, and to do so would not be to take advantage of the success had to date.\"\nObama's original plan for Afghanistan dictated the formal end of combat operations under the war name of Operation Enduring Freedom by the end of 2014. A residual force of 10,000 would remain based around major hubs in Kabul, Bagram, Kandahar and Jalalabad to assist the Afghan military in assuming responsibility for security operations. That number would have shrunk to just under 5,000 by the end of 2015, with no combat forces remaining by 2016.\nThe Afghan National Security Forces and federal police soon proved unfit to the task on their own, compounded by their inability to gather and process intelligence, perform their own logistics and get an air force off the ground. Such evident shortcomings demonstrated they would need to continue to rely on their American patrons for these essential war capabilities.\nThis period also saw a resurgence of Taliban activity, as the U.S. drawdown allowed the hardline group to move back into its traditional strongholds in the north and regions like Helmand province. The security collapse in nearby Iraq gave rise to the Islamic State group, which has probed Afghanistan since its sweep across the Syrian border toward Baghdad last year.\nAs a result of these pressures, Obama announced in March the 10,000 forces would remain intact through the end of 2015.\nRELATED\nIn Afghanistan, Taliban and Kunduz Present Harsh Truths for Obama \"We're doing everything we can to make sure the Afghan National Security Forces succeed so we don't have to go back,\" Obama said at the time in remarks in Washington alongside new Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. \"We're on the path to do that.\"\nThe situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse since then, most recently as Taliban forces were able to capture the key crossroads town of Kunduz last month. Afghan forces bolstered by U.S. airpower have ultimately been able to retake it, but the unanticipated campaign demonstrates a larger danger than this one incursion. Texas-based private intelligence firm Stratfor estimates such an operation would have taken years to plan, and the Taliban's ability to wage complex war without the Afghan or U.S. governments being able to foresee it indicates the group could conduct similar attacks again in the future.", "external_links": ["https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/what-battle-kunduz-means-afghanistan"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:37:52.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
