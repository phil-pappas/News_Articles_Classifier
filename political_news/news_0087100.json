Andrew Cuomo today called on congressional Democrats to shut down the federal government unless more conservative lawmakers agree to tighten the nation's gun laws. \n\"I'd love to see the Democrats stand up and say we're going to shut down the government or threaten to shut down the government if we don't get real gun control legislation,\" Cuomo told Time Warner Cable News' NY 1 . \"It should be that high a priority.\" \nCuomo also called on presidential candidates to make gun control a priority issue in the 2016 race. The governor's comments come one day after a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon left 10 people dead and seven wounded. \nThe governor, a Democrat, has been criticizing inaction on gun control in recent weeks, after the fatal shooting of one of his aides in Brooklyn. \nNearly three years ago, Cuomo signed into law the NY Safe Act, a group of laws that increased penalties for some gun-related crimes and was meant to combat mass shootings. \nCuomo was interviewed on NY1 shortly after 10 a.m. this morning. \nHere are more of his comments from the interview with Roma Torre: \"It is really sad and tragic and discouraging, frankly, because it is such a blatant failure of our political system. And frankly, such a blatant failure of the elected officials in this country. \n\"I understand that the gun issue is a controversial issue. And I understand that there is a segment of this population that believes the 2nd Amendment means no gun control, slippery slope, the whole argument. I've heard it. I've read it. I've had it thrown at me. We can, as a society, do something about this chronic public health hazard that is only getting worse, Roma, because sickness breed more sickness. \n\"We passed the smartest gun control legislation in the nation in this state and yes, it was hard, and yes, it cost me political capital, but it's probably one of the proudest things I've ever done because that law saves lives. \n\"This nation has to get that same wisdom and elected officials have to be willing to step up and take the challenge of, 'Why were you elected?' And it wasn't just to gather political capital. It was to make a difference in society, and take the votes when they're tough votes. \n\"We have a presidential election; we have a congressional election. This should be the No. 1 or No. 2 issue. What will you do about guns? If someone can look at this carnage and say nothing needs to be done or nothing can be done, then they are on a different planet as far as I'm concerned. And let them tell the voters that. \n\"But it's the elected officials who have failed; the process has failed; and voters have a responsibility even in this state because our state law is the best. \n\"But you know what's happening to us? I close the front door to guns, they're coming in the back door. You can buy a gun in Virginia. You can buy a gun in South Carolina. If you're willing to take a ride in a car, you can bring a gun into this state. \n\"We have learned nothing. Daily News front page: 87,000 deaths since Newtown. I mean, where – it is insane.\" . @NYGovCuomo on @NY1 says Congressional Dems should threaten shutdown over gun control: \"It should be that high of a priority.\" — Jesse McKinley (@jessemckinley) October 2, 2015 Following latest mass shooting, @NYGovCuomo says guns should be the \"No.1\" issue in prez, congressional elex in '16. — Yancey Roy (@YanceyRoy) October 2, 2015 \nContact Teri Weaver anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2274", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:20:42.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
