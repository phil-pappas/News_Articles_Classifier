On top of the list is J.W. Anderson , who happens to be having a pretty good year. Besides having a hit bag under his belt at Loewe , he's earned nods for his work both on his namesake men's and women's lines. He'll face Victoria Beckham , who was nominated for the brand award last year, and Christopher Kane .\nTom Ford is on the red-carpet designer nominees list, going up against Christopher Kane, Erdem , and Roksanda . Burberry is up for both the creative campaign and brand awards. But one person seems to be missing: Cara Delevingne, who's probably too busy going after her acting career to care.\nThe awards will be presented on Monday, November 23, and they'll be hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall. Also on deck to be presented: BFC Outstanding Achievement, British Style, International Designer, and the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator.
