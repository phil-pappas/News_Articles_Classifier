The new survey found that 65 percent of Republican voters would rather have fresh ideas from their candidates, compared with 29 percent who want “experience and a proven record.” That number has gone up since March, when it was 57 percent to 36 percent.\nDemocrats feel a little more evenly divided on the issue: 50 percent want a proven record, 42 percent are looking for a different approach. The numbers were similar, but slightly higher in favor of a new approach, in the last survey: 46 percent for experience, 49 percent for fresh ideas.\nOverall, 55 percent of all registered voters said it’s time for something new from candidates, while 37 percent still say they valued experience more.\nThe numbers are in line with the three outsider candidates leading the GOP field in this poll, businessman Donald Trump (25 percent), retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson (16 percent) and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (8 percent), all of whom have no political experience.\nThe other candidate who would appear to benefit from voters? Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who tied with Fiorina at 8 percent when possible Republican and independent-leaning Republican primary voters were asked whom they would support. Rubio's campaign theme, \"A New American Century,\" is built around packaging the candidate as the vanguard of a new generation of Republican politicians.\nFiorina faces tough slog on Capitol Hill By Burgess Everett and Lauren French\nRubio’s Florida rival in the race, former Gov. Jeb Bush, has touted his experience and leadership in Tallahassee as positives, while downplaying Rubio's readiness to lead. He earned just 4 percent. And Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who likes to say that the country wants “someone who knows how to land the plane,” drew less than 2 percent.\n(As a disclaimer, the ballot-test question in this survey differs from other national polling in that it was asked as an open-ended question, rather than having respondents choose from a list of names. The results will also not be part of determining the criteria for the CNBC debate on Oct. 28 in Boulder, Colorado.)\nThe Pew poll was conducted Sept. 22-27 via landlines and cellphones, surveying 1,502 adults nationwide with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Among those, 1,136 registered voters were surveyed, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. Within the subgroup of registered voters, 566 Republicans or Republican-leaning independents carried a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points, while the 473 Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents carried margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\nAmong the 496 possible Republican and independent Republican-leaning primary voters the margin of error is 5.5 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.people-press.org/2015/10/02/contrasting-partisan-perspectives-on-campaign-2016/"], "published": "2015-10-02T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:05:45.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
