India's External Affairs Ministry held Nepal's leadership responsible for anti-India sentiment in the country (Photo: PTI/File) New Delhi : In a blunt message, India on Thursday asked Nepal to \"put its house in order\" and rejected charges of economic blockade from the Indian side.\nSpokesperson in the External Affairs Ministry Vikas Swarup also expressed serious concerns over the growing \"anti-India\" sentiments in Nepal.\n\"We do recognise that there is growth of anti-India sentiment and this is something we are seriously concerned about. There is no doubt about that. But who is responsible for this... Who has stoked this anti-India sentiment,\" he said, adding that due to unrest on Nepalese side, Indian goods were not being able to enter.\n\"And for which the blame squarely lies with the Nepalese leadership and we hope that they do something about it so that the traditionally friendly relationship between Nepal and India can continue like before,\" the spokesperson said.\nRejecting Nepal charges that India was choking it, he said there was no \"official or unofficial economic blockade\" from India and the obstruction was from Nepalese side at the exit and entry points.\nHe also noted that in last one week only 250-300 trucks each day have been able to enter into Nepal even as 5033 cargo vehicles were awaiting entry into that country. He also cited instances where Indian truckers and other vendors have faced violence and feared for their safety and security.\nHe also noted that in past few days only 250-300 trucks have been able to entry even as 5033 cargo vehicle were awaiting entry into that country and also cited instances where Indian truckers and other vendors have faced violence.\n\"The problem in Nepal is their own creation. And that is why we are urging them to reach out to their own people. Put your house in order,\" he said but ruled out that India has ever been \"prescriptive\" or has put any conditions on Nepal regarding their Constitution.\nIndia has only been asking that the Statute should be broad-based which should take care of all its population, he said.\nOn Nepal's threat to turn to China in case India does not ease the supply of petroleum products and other essential goods, the Spokesperson said India believes that dialogue was the only way forward.\n\"But if they want approach any other country, they are welcome. They are the sovereign independent country and can make their own choices. We cannot constraint them but the kind of 'roti-beti' relationship they have with India, no other country can substitute it,\" he added.\nNepal envoy here Deep Kumar Upadhayay has been maintaining that if India does not resolve the issue of supply of essential goods, the Himalayan nation would be forced to approach China for help.\n India Nepal economic blockade Anti-India protests nation Also Read Mass conversion in PM Narendra Modi's home state sparks anger Congress seeks to boot rebels All 9,812 applicants to get IFFK delegate passes RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan gets threatening email, Mumbai police investigate: sources", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Nepal-anti-india-protest.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151008/nation-current-affairs/article/india-sends-stern-message-nepal-asks-it-put-its-house-order’", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Nepal-anti-india-protest.jpg", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151008/nation-current-affairs/article/india-sends-stern-message-nepal-asks-it-put-its-house-order’", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:52:53.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
