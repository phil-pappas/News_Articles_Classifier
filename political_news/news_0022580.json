Marco Rubio, meanwhile, took third place in the Farleigh Dickinson poll with 8% while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tied Fiorina with 7%. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee follows that pack closely with 6%. \nMore than half of Republican voters surveyed in the poll are supporting candidates who have never held elected office, combining Trump, Carson and Fiorina's numbers. \nOn the Democratic side, Sanders, the senator from Vermont whose insurgent campaign has been fueled by grassroots momentum, continues to trail Clinton by more than 20 percentage points. \nSanders notched 23% of support to the former secretary of state's 45% lead, less than a week before the pair will square off for the first Democratic presidential debate. \nVice President Joe Biden, who has yet to decide whether he will jump into the race for president, is polling at 17% according to the poll -- a figure the remaining Democratic contenders don't come close to notching. \nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb each notched just 1%. But the pair, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee who registered less than 1% in the Farleigh Dickinson poll, will get a chance to boost their numbers when they appear in primetime on national TV for the first Democratic debate Tuesday on CNN. \nThe poll surveyed 305 Republicans for a margin of error of 5.6 percentage points and 339 Democrats with a 5.3 percentage points margin of error. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
