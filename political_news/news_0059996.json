October 20, 2015 By Taegan Goddard 0 Comments \nLeonard Steinhorn : “It’s now routine for the scribbling pens and chattering class to pose the beer question or a variation thereof, and, based on a candidate’s perceived likability and relatability, they create a self-fulfilling narrative of electability. If a candidate is warm and likable, these pundits say, Americans will be more inclined to vote for him or her. But woe to any politician who seems unable to kiss babies with ease, feel someone’s pain, look relaxed on television or down a beer comfortably.” \n“For the candidate deemed ‘unlikable’ by the press, it’s an uphill battle to reverse the narrative. It gets compounded by polls that reflect the dominant media storyline, which then lead to new stories about the candidate’s likability deficit. That then creates a vicious cycle of negative framing, making it increasingly difficult for the candidate to gain traction.” \n“The problem is that likability is, and should be, irrelevant in electing a president. How a candidate makes us feel is insignificant compared to what he or she does as president.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:07:07.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
