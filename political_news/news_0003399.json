Gov. Mary Taylor did on Tuesday. \n\nBut DeWine’s speech at the Ohio Economic Development Association's 2015 Summit today indicated the veteran Republican is expanding his vision beyond law and order issues that are typically the bailiwick of the attorney general. \n\nWhile DeWine mentioned the state’s crippling heroin crisis, his speech at the Marriott Hotel in Dublin focused more on jobs, education and “broadening the horizon for kids who otherwise might not have the opportunity to live the American Dream.” \n\n“We have to look at them as our kids,” he said, referring to youngsters who don’t fit the traditional academic mold, are in career centers, or other kinds of programs with limited horizons. \n\nDeWine is taking another unusual step, as the state’s top law enforcement officer, by compiling a guidebook on economic development he will publish later this year and make available on his office’s website. The guide is not about development strategies, but offers a “legal framework for economic development,” DeWine said. It is designed for elected officials, economic development professionals, and the business community. \n\nWhile DeWine’s office compiles books and reports on topics ranging from capital punishment and concealed carry weapons to public records law and guardianship, this is the first time DeWine, or any attorney general, has ventured into economic development. \n\nIn an interview, DeWine declined to say he is running for governor. Is he interested? “Of course,” he said. “There is a lot unfinished business in this state.” \n\nHe said his first priority is seeing U.S. Sen. Rob Portman reelected and Gov. John Kasich, “ or some other Republican,” elected president in 2016. He said it is premature to talk about 2018 political aspirations. \n\nBut he said part of the appeal of being governor is that it gives the officeholder the “bully pulpit” to work on major issues. “My focus in office has always been on making a difference,” he said. \n\nDeWine, who turns 69 in January, has been attorney general since 2011, winning a second term last year. He served in the U.S. Senate from 1994-2007, as lieutenant governor from 1991-1994, in the U.S. House from 1982-1990, and in the Ohio Senate in 1981-1982. He began his political career as Greene County prosecutor. \n\nIn addition to DeWine and Taylor, Secretary of State Jon Husted is also said to be interested in running for governor in three years. \n\najohnson@dispatch.com \n\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:59:49.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
