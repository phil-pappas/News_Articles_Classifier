However, PW-18 (Dattatray Bhalshankar, chemical analyser at Forensic Lab in Kalina) found 4 ml of blood only in one vial,\" Salman's lawyer Amit Desai told Justice A R Joshi of the Bombay High Court.\nThe high court is hearing an appeal filed by the actor against his conviction in which he has been found guilty of ramming his car into a shop in suburban Bandra on September 28, 2002, killing one person and injuring four who were sleeping on pavement.\n\"It appears that what PW-18 (chemical analyser) has received is a completely different sample,\" the lawyer said.\nThe appellant (Salman) has been convicted with this kind of evidence, Desai argued and alleged that this is an addition to the chain of discrepancies.\nBesides, the CA's report does not speak about the percentage of alcohol but talks only about the content of alcohol.\nReferring to portions of the paper book (evidence), Desai said that evidence in one place says \"one sealed vial intact, as per copy sent\", while in another place it says \"no copy sent\".\n\"This is confusing....so whether it is 'vial intact as per copy sent' or 'no copy sent'...an ambiguity has been created,\" Desai pointed out to the court.\nThe lawyer further said the \"blood story\" is curious -- it starts from Bhabha Hospital, which does not have the facility to draw blood and goes to the JJ Hospital, where oxalate, which is an anti-coagulant, has been shown as a preservative.\n entertainment Bollywood Salman Khan Also Read Hrithik Roshan turns singer for Siddharth Anand's next Salman Khan introduces girlfriend Iulia Vantur to his family Dharmendra to undergo a surgery, says Hema Malini Salman Khan, Dhoni, Vivek in Delhi for Modi's swearing-in ceremony", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/salman-khan-relationship-14-07-2013_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/entertainment-bollywood/article/mismatch-quantity-salman-khans-blood-samples-alleges-lawyer", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-khan-relationship-14-07-2013_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:59:13.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
