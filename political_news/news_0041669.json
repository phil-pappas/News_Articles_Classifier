Some 42 Republicans had signed the so-called \"discharge petition.\"\n\"At a time when our Republican conference is divided, this will divide it even further,\" Hensarling said in a statement.\nWhile the petition and subsequent House floor vote would demonstrate that a majority of the House wants to renew the charter for the U.S. export credit, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already rejected taking up the measure.\nMcConnell is opposed to keeping the trade bank open, siding with Hensarling and other Republican conservative critics who charge that the 81-year-old institution provides \"corporate welfare\" to massive, wealthy companies such as Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric.\n\"The Senate is not going to spend a week on a bill that the leader doesnâ€™t support,\" said McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, when asked about the petition on Friday.\nIt may be still possible, however, for EXIM backers in Congress to attach a renewal measure to a bill to extend transportation funding that will be needed by the end of October. The Senate approved a similar measure in July as part of a longer-term transportation bill, but this was never taken up by the House.\n(Reporting By David Lawder; Editing by Susan Heavey and Doina Chiacu )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:39:01.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
