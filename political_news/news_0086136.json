On Monday, Zody started in Fairfield County as chief of staff/chief deputy auditor for Auditor Jon Slater.\nHe made $108,000 a year leading the Division of Wildlife; Fairfield County is paying him $94,500 annually.\nZody, 49, told Fairfield County Bureau Reporter Mary Beth Lane that he left the state specifically because this opportunity came up.\nHe will replace Chief Deputy Auditor Ed Laramee, a 21-year office veteran, who plans to retire in January. Laramee is paid $82,623 annually.\nSlater said that when Laramee decided to retire, he reached out to Zody, who had worked as the Fairfield County commissioners’ clerk/manager from August 2007 through 2010.\nIt will be a pretty easy daily commute for Zody, who lives near Sugar Grove, south of Lancaster. He said he’s looking forward to the job and, with less time spent in traffic each day, to spending more time with his family.\n• • •\nBrian Stewart has announced that he is seeking re-election. In 2016 .\nWe’re not even to the November election this year, but the current president of the Pickaway County Board of Commissioners wasted no time in sending word that he would seek a second term.\nStewart, 36, a Republican and partner in the Farthing & Stewart law firm in Circleville, said he is most proud that the county has stayed within its budget and reduced deficit spending in the past four years, all while building the general fund’s cash reserves.\n“If we continue to work together towards fiscally responsible, common-sense conservative solutions,” Stewart said in his announcement, “Pickaway County will become an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.”\nBut Keith Peters is an early bird, too.\nThough Peters, the current president of the Harrison Township board of trustees, hasn’t yet made a public fuss that he’s challenging Stewart for the seat, he already has filed his paperwork with the Pickaway County Board of Elections. No candidate’s paperwork is due until the close of business on Dec. 16.\nPeters, a 55-year-old Democrat, is a fifth-generation farmer. He said he’ll make his own announcement soon enough. One of his sons, who is deputy press secretary for a California congressman, is crafting the material.\n“I have a lot of plans,” he said. “We’re going to make a splash.”\nWhoever wins the race (and, of course, it could be neither — plenty of time for someone else to file) will take office in January 2017. A Pickaway County commissioner’s salary for terms starting in that year will be $61,215.\nlkurtzman@dispatch.com\n@LoriKurtzman\nhzachariah@dispatch.com\n@hollyzachariah", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/LoriKurtzman", "http://twitter.com/hollyzachariah"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:47:21.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
