Reuters/Jim Young \nCHICAGO Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert has reached a deal with prosecutors and is expected to plead guilty to wrongdoing in a hush-money case, his lawyers told a federal judge in Chicago on Thursday. \nProsecutors and defense attorneys did not say what the charges were, or whether Hastert, the Republican speaker from 1999 to 2007, would serve time in prison. \nHe was charged in May with trying to hide large cash transactions as part of a hush-money scheme and with lying to the FBI. \nThe agreement is expected to be submitted to U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin on Monday, attorneys for Hastert said during a brief court appearance. \nHastert, 73, who is free on bond, was not required to attend Thursday's hearing and was not in court. He pleaded not guilty in June to the two charges. \nHastert is scheduled to plead guilty on Oct. 28. \nFederal prosecutors allege he promised to pay $3.5 million to an unnamed individual from his hometown of Yorkville, Illinois, to conceal past misconduct. \nThe individual who was allegedly receiving hush money from Hastert has not surfaced publicly. But anonymous law enforcement officials have told a number of media outlets that Hastert was trying to cover up sexual abuse of a male decades ago when he worked as a high school teacher and wrestling coach. \nHastert has not been charged with any past misconduct. \nLawyers for both sides said in September they were negotiating a plea deal to keep the case from going to trial. Durkin had asked both sides to bring him an agreement this week, or he would set a trial date. \nAccording to the indictment, Hastert withdrew $1.7 million in cash from his bank accounts from 2010 to 2014. He is charged with \"structuring\" $952,000 of the withdrawals, taking the funds out in increments of under $10,000 to evade a requirement that banks report large cash transactions. \nHastert then told the FBI he was keeping the cash for himself, which the indictment said was a false statement. \nEach of the charges carries a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \n(Reporting by Mary Wisniewski; Writing by David Bailey ; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Jeffrey Benkoe) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:51:25.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
