Planned Parenthood said the videos were deceptively edited and denied seeking any payments beyond legally permitted reimbursement of costs.\nThe new policy — forgoing even permissible reimbursement — was outlined in a letter sent Tuesday by Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards, to Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\"Planned Parenthood's policies on fetal tissue donation already exceed the legal requirements,\" Richards wrote. \"Now we're going even further in order to take away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.\"\nThe videos were released, starting in mid-July, by a group of anti-abortion activists calling themselves the Center for Medical Progress. Activists posed as representatives of a biomedical firm and sought to negotiate the purchase of fetal organs from some Planned Parenthood personnel.\nRepublicans in control of Congress have responded to the videos by launching several investigations of Planned Parenthood, along with efforts to cut off the organization's federal funding. Most of that funding is reimbursement for Medicaid patients receiving cancer screenings, contraception and other non-abortion services.\nPlanned Parenthood says its fetal tissue programs currently take place in only two states — California and Washington — at about a half-dozen of the 700 health centers run by the organization nationwide.\nPlanned Parenthood's executive vice president, Dawn Laguens, said the Washington state affiliate already had a policy of accepting no reimbursement for its costs, and the California affiliate will now follow the same policy.\n\"I don't think it will have a huge impact on their budget,\" Laguens said. \"For Planned Parenthood, this was always about one thing — honoring the desire of women to contribute to lifesaving research. It was never about money.\"\nWhile selling fetal tissue for profit is illegal, a 1993 law passed by Congress with bipartisan support allows women who undergo abortions to donate fetal tissue for use in scientific research. The law allowed entities supplying the tissue to recover the costs of running such programs.\nDuring the three-month controversy over the videos, some of Planned Parenthood's critics have called a ban on research using donated fetal tissue. However, there has been strong defense of the practice from within the medical and scientific establishment.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, in a letter to Congress in August, said fetal tissue \"continues to be a critical resource for important efforts such as research on degenerative eye disease, human development disorders such as Down syndrome, and infectious diseases, among a host of other diseases.\"\nProfessor Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center's Department of Population Health, said Planned Parenthood's move was strategically wise.\n\"The fees are being used to promote the canard that PP is killing babies for profit. They are not,\" Caplan wrote in an email. \"But deciding not to accept reimbursement for any processing or handling would effectively end the lying about what PP is and has been doing.\"\nEarly reaction to the announcement divided along party lines in Congress, where Democrats have depicted the multiple Republican investigations as baseless.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:13:40.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
