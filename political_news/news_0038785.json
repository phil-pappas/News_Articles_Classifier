Jones . \"This is a wonderful example of the impact of our faculty collaborations to leverage federal funding and influence critical areas of law and public policy-even on the international level.\"\nThe project will merge essential concepts from international human rights law and health law to provide trainings that address the health needs facing the Middle East . The grant represents the first major academic award UAlbany and Albany Law School have received together since it announced its affiliation in late September (the affiliation is contingent upon ABA approval).\n\"This is exactly the kind of work we intended to collaborate on through the affiliation of our two schools,\" said Alicia Ouellette , Albany Law School's President & Dean. \"This is a grant that requires the resources and expertise of both schools, affirming that our sum is larger than our parts.\"\nThe Global Institute for Health and Human Rights was founded by Drs. Kamiar Alaei and Arash Alaei in 2012, with the mission of generating a deeper understanding of the intersection between health and human rights, and promoting innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in this arena. Through research, education, policy, advocacy and development, the GIHHR seeks to advance the understanding and protection of health and human rights in a theoretical, academic, practical, and ethical context. It strives to be interdisciplinary in both analysis of global health issues and in approach to addressing them.\nRenowned human rights activists, the Alaei brothers are committed to generating a deeper understanding of the intersection between health and human rights, and promoting innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in this arena. In May 2015 , Kamiar was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Founded by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations , the awards pay homage to the immigrant experience and the contribution made to America by immigrants and their children. Additionally, the Iranian brothers were praised for their work by the World Health Organization while serving as AIDS doctors when they were imprisoned in Iran in 2008 for attempting to bring lifesaving treatments to that country's AIDS patients.\nAlong with the three partners, international scholars from McGill University and Oxford University will also participate in the project.\nEducationally and culturally, the University at Albany-SUNY puts \"The World Within Reach\" for its more than 17,300 students.
