(AP) â€” A pumpkin festival failed to scare up a world record for jack-o-lanterns.\nThe New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival in Laconia was trying to break the record of more than 30,500 lit jack-o-lanterns. It came up far short Saturday, with only 9,567 pumpkins.\nThe festival was previously held in Keene. That city wrested the jack-o-lantern record from Boston in 2013.\nThe next year, violence and scores of arrests soured the festival's relationship with it longtime host city. The violence, which started at alcohol-fueled parties linked to Keene State College , prompted the City Council to reject the festival's permit for 2015.\nLaconia then announced plans to take over the festival. Officials said the town's experience hosting an annual motorcycle week that attracts thousands provided confidence it could manage public safety for the pumpkin festival.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:50:10.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
