Smokers are then increasingly switching to cheaper and often illegal products, which loses the Treasury some £2.6 billion each year.” \nHe added: “Rather than imposing yet more tax on a legitimate UK sector, which directly and indirectly supports over 60,000 jobs and generates over £12bn in tax revenue, the UK Government would be better served by holding an independent review of tobacco tax policy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:08:41.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
