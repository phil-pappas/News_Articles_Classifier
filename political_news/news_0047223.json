Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., voted yes and Sen. David Vitter, R-La., no.\nIn the House, the bill passed 277-151 , just seven hours before the midnight deadline to fund the government. All 186 Democrats voting Wednesday supported the bill, but only 91 of the 242 Republicans voted yes. In the Louisiana delegation, the only yes votes came from Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, the House Majority Whip, who is now running for House majority leader, and Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans.\nRep. Ralph Abraham, R-Alto, expressed the view of many Republicans who wanted more of an effort to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\"I will listen to anyone and compromise when appropriate, but I will never compromise my principles,\" Abraham said. \"I could not in good conscience vote for a CR that provides funding for Planned Parenthood. I believe Congress missed an opportunity to leverage the power of the purse to protect life. Fighting to defend the unborn is a battle I'm always willing to wage, and I will continue to look for opportunities to hold Planned Parenthood accountable for its barbaric abortion practices.\"\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the 151 Republicans who voted against the spending bill.\n\"Tonight, 151 Republicans voted to shut down government rather than allow women to access affordable family planning and life-saving preventive health care,\" Pelosi said. \"One-hundred and fifty one Republicans decided their obsession with women's health was more important than the thousands of disabled veterans, disadvantaged children and working families who would pay the price of another government shutdown. Tonight's vote highlights the astounding, toxic radicalism of the Republican majority. It exposes the depths of their contempt for women's health and their total indifference to the priorities of hard-working American families.\"\nThe bill passed Wednesday continues spending levels at last year's rate – about $1.017 trillion for the year, with $700 million added to combat wildfires in the West.\nVoting for the temporary spending bill were Scalise and Richmond, the delegation's only Democrat. Voting no were Abraham, Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, John Fleming, R-Minden, and Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge.\nScalise's opponent in the majority leader race, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., voted against the spending bill.\nGraves said the temporary spending bill doesn't address issues important to him and others that were resolved as part of the appropriations process.\n\"We worked hard the last 10 months to pass a number of amendments through the regular appropriations process – amendments that are important to Louisiana,\" Graves said. \"Provisions that would stop the EPA from finalizing job-killing regulations, stop the Corps of Engineers from continuing their double-standard on wetlands mitigation and our amendment to force NOAA to open up red snapper to recreational fisherman across the Gulf South.\n\"This CR simply hands the Administration their wishes on these issues while failing to address the unethical treatment of fetuses or the immigration and refugee crisis facing our country. I did not come here to rubber stamp the White House agenda.\"\nScalise said the House is moving aggressively against Planned Parenthood, passing a measure Tuesday to bar federal funding for any organization that engages in the trafficking of baby parts. Planned Parenthood officials deny that it does anything but recoup its costs when making fetal material from abortions available for medical research -- something it says is sanctioned by federal law.\n\"House passage of this measure sends a clear message to the American people: the right to life is our most precious gift from God, and it is offensive and unacceptable that a single cent of taxpayer dollars would be sent to an organization that systematically aborts infants and sells their body parts.\" Scalise said. \"House Republicans will continue to promote a culture that respects life at every stage.\"", "external_links": ["http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll528.xml", "http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00272"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:22:30.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
