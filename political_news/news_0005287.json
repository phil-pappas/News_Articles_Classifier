Groups are strapping on their dancing shoes in support of Destiny Rescue, an international non-profit organisation dedicated to rescuing children from sex trafficking and exploitation. \nThe No Lights No Lycra dance communities in Auckland and Christchurch are actively backing the campaign. True to its name, No Lights No Lycra Auckland will be performing in the dark this 19th of October in Grey Lynn while in Christchurch, No Lights No Lycra will gather at the White Elephant HQ (442 Tuam Street) between 8 and 9pm on the 22nd of October. Attendees are invited to contribute $5 cash donations at the door. \nWellingtonians have also jumped in with Nia dance enthusiasts executing their unique routine in Aro Valley Park on the 31st of October. Destiny Rescue advocate and dance aficionado Alie Benge, and licensed Nia instructor Amanda Hanna-Doull, will be running an hour long guided Nia dancing session in their effort to Dance for Freedom . \nDestiny Rescue NZ’s Dance for Freedom campaign runs this October and November and is open to Kiwis of all ages keen to support a worthy cause. Participants commit to dancing non-stop for a certain period of time, set their fundraising targets and then invite friends, family and community to sponsor their efforts. These funds will be funnelled towards the rescue and restoration of children who have fallen victim to sexual exploitation, and their reintegration into society. \nSince it was established in 2001, Destiny Rescue has rescued over 1400 children and currently has 994 children in its care. It operates in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines and India, and recently launched in the Dominican Republic. It has established 13 safe houses across Southeast Asia to restore and reintegrate children rescued from this horrific trade. Its support offices are here in New Zealand, in Australia and the USA. \nLisa Ho, Director at Destiny Rescue NZ challenges Kiwis to rise up, “An estimated 4.5 million children globally are trapped in sexual slavery today. We need to make a stand for these children who have had their innocence stolen from them. Dance in solidarity for their freedom and help give them a chance to dream again.” \n“The children in these poorer nations rely on the compassion and generosity of people who are willing and able to advocate and speak out against such vile crimes wherever it may occur,” she adds. \nAnyone keen in taking up the challenge, can sign up as an individual or group, or consider sponsoring other dancers at www.danceforfreedom.org.nz.
