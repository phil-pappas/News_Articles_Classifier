Rob Portman said Friday, and addressing the problem will take job training, less red tape, and improved foreign trade.\nPortman made the remarks during an Ohio State University forum on business and innovation. He appeared with Whirlpool CEO Jeff Fettig and other prominent business leaders in the state.\nThe Cincinnati-area Republican will face a re-election challenge next year from either former Gov. Ted Strickland or Cincinnati City Councilman PG Sittenfeld, both Democrats.\nHere are three takeaways from Portman's remark:the event:\n1. Currency protections\nPortman said U.S. negotiators should do more to prevent other countries from intentionally manipulating the exchange rate of their currencies to gain a trade advantage.\nThe White House announced Monday that negotiations have concluded on a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with 11 Pacific Rim nations. Portman said legislators earlier this year urged negotiators to make currency manipulation a \"principal negotiating objective,\" but the negotiators failed to do so in the proposed trade deal.\n\"I'd like to put teeth in it, to make it something where currency manipulation is a discussion in trade negotiations,\" Portman said. \"When a country intentionally manipulates currency, it's almost like adding a tariff to their products and reducing the tariff here. Think about it that way. It's not fair.\"\nPortman, who served as U.S. Trade Representative under President George W. Bush, said perhaps every other person who served in that position disagrees with him.\nBut Portman is supported by many lawmakers from the Midwest and automobile industry officials who worry that Asian countries can keep the price of American-made vehicles artificially high.\n2. Ohio's unemployment rate\nPortman said September unemployment numbers were \"really disappointing.\n\"The president talks a lot about it, saying, 'We're out of the woods, everything's going well.' It's not,\" Portman said.\nOhio's unemployment rate dropped slightly last month to 5.6 percent . While that figure is better than the national unemployment rate and is nearly 2 points lower than Ohio's rate in September 2014, Ohio's job growth trailed the national average for the 23 rd consecutive month.\nPortman noted that the unemployment rate does not factor in the number of people who have stopped looking for work. About 10 percent of eligible workers are unemployed, he said.\n\"In effect, we have double-digit unemployment now,\" he said.\n3. Solutions\nPortman said job openings exist, but many of them require skilled workers. Ohio, he said, needs to make sure that its workers have the training needed to secure high-paying jobs.\n\"If companies do not have a skilled workforce here in Ohio, they will go elsewhere,\" Portman said.\nThe senator also noted that he's pushing legislation that would require studies of federal economic development programs to see whether they're working or not.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:39:24.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
