Speaking exclusively to the Western Morning News six months on, they have revealed what life after Westminster holds in store. \nThe early hours of that fateful Friday morning brought report after report of Lib Dem and Labour strongholds across the country falling to the Conservatives. As seats in the Westcountry began to announce, the region was steadily swept by a sea of blue. \nOne of the most shocking results was the defeat of long-standing North Devon MP Sir Nick Harvey. The former defence minister held the constituency for 23 years, and despite knowing it would be a tight campaign, he admits he “never saw the tidal wave coming”. \n“When it did, in a sense it was almost easier to deal with,” he says. “I didn’t feel personally rejected by it. \n“If I had lost narrowly and my neighbours had hung on I would have blamed myself for not doing more or doing it better. \n“Whereas being on the wrong end of a complete tidal wave you knew that nothing you did would have made any difference.” \nThere is general consensus among those who lost their seats in May that the scale of the national swing towards the Tories removed much of the personal element from the defeat. \nFormer Torbay MP Adrian Sanders described his result as a “blow” but one which was “softened by the fact it was nothing to do with me”. “I can’t walk into town or go shopping without somebody coming up and saying how sorry they are that I wasn’t re-elected,” he says. \nWhile Plymouth’s Alison Seabeck said the loss was not “entirely surprising” after polls had begun to show support for the party “drifting”. “If a swing is going nationally there is nothing you can do about it,” she says. “You could be the worst MP in the world or the best MP in the world.” \nThe confirmation of electoral defeat is not easy news for an MP to digest, but many claim their first thoughts are for their staff, some of whom they have campaigned and worked with them for decades. \nMrs Seabeck said “knowing that six staff had lost their jobs” was one of the hardest parts of the experience. “I knew I had to go through the whole business of redundancy and helping and supporting them into new jobs if I could,” she says. “Which is why I was really taken aback when, minutes after I’d lost, I did an interview for radio and the guy said ‘well you’re on the scrapheap’. I thought a) ‘that’s a bit harsh’ but b) actually I’m more worried about my staff.” \nAnother unexpected challenge is the process of winding down two offices and disposing of hundreds of casework files. Ousted MPs had just one week to clear out their Parliamentary rooms, before moving out of their rented London accommodation. \nBut once the initial workload was over, they found themselves with a lot of spare time on their hands. And they enjoyed finding new ways to fill it. \nAndrew George, former MP for St Ives, said he regularly clocked up 80-hour weeks when he worked in Westminster. \n“Now I’m putting some of those 80 hours into things that I want to do and my family want to do,” he says. \n“I’m doing DIY jobs that I’ve failed to do for years on end and I’m now turning attention to. Even though I’m hopeless at it I do get satisfaction out of giving it a go.” \nMr Sanders said losing enabled him to “rediscover what a weekend is”. “We visited the in-laws in Yorkshire, which coincided nicely with Torquay United’s game at Halifax,” he explains. “I was there for the five-goal thriller which saw Torquay win 3-2. I would never have been able to do that [before].” \nAnd having had time for a little R&R, minds have begun to turn to what the future might hold. But writing a CV is not as easy as it seems when your back catalogue includes running election campaigns and making UK law. \n“It’s very difficult when you come to write out your CV – you do everything as an MP, particularly as a shadow minister,” says Mrs Seabeck. “You have a huge range of skills and it’s difficult to work out how you apply those skills and what to do with them. \n“[And] I’m just not sure how people will view an application from an ex-MP. People have very differing views about what MPs do.” \nNick Harvey says he is toying with the idea of consulting – a common fall-back career for former politicians. He adds he did consider a return to his previous career in communications, but decided 25 years later the profession had probably “moved on”. \nMr George says he is one of the “lucky ones” having found a dream job with Cornish housing charity the Cornwall Community Land Trust. He has prior experience in the charitable sector and describes the new role as “really exciting work that I’m really motivated by”. \nUnderstandably, the majority of those who spoke to the WMN say six months down the line is simply too soon to say whether they would consider running for election again. Nick Harvey and Andrew George hint that they may test the waters in two to three years, after the EU referendum. \nHowever, Mr Sanders has thrown his hat into the ring for Torbay council by-elections following the death of death of councillor Ruth Pentney. He told the WMN: “I have gained a huge amount of experience in 18 years at Westminster and hope this can be used to help the prosperity of the Bay.” \nMrs Seabeck said “nothing is ruled out”. \nProudest moments: \n- Andrew George: “I was really proud a year ago getting the Private Members Bill on affordable homes...something which actually reversed Government policy. \n“The [Prime Minister] used a money resolution to scupper it [but] Parliament was on my side – it voted with a large majority to defeat the bedroom tax.” \n- Alison Seabeck: “There are an awful lot of things which were never in the media, like working with a firm to save around 100 jobs before one Christmas. \n“There was nothing in the public domain, but I know it happened and the company know it happened.” \n- Adrian Sanders: “Lifting the profile of diabetes, for example changing employment legislation so people in the blue light services are no longer made redundant if diagnosed with diabetes. \n“And the Children and Families Bill – getting that bit in there which assures children cannot be denied a place in school because they have diabetes and the schools says it can’t cope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:41:11.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
