(AP) Â— Hillary Clinton's campaign is marking the Democratic presidential candidate's 68th birthday by opening a third office in Nevada. The campaign plans to open an office in Henderson on Monday evening with help from Henderson city councilwoman Gerri Schroder and Democratic Nevada lawmakers Ellen Spiegel and Joyce Woodhouse. The campaign also has offices in Reno and Las Vegas. Staff members have called for a day of action in honor of Clinton's birthday and plan to spend it recruiting campaign volunteers in the Henderson area. Clinton started building her campaign staff in Nevada in April, well before her Democratic rivals.
