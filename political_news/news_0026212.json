While many U.S. companies are cutting back on health care benefits and/or increasing employee payroll contributions, Liaison continues to buck the trend for its employees.\nLiaison is one of only a handful of companies to offer such a significant benefit. Providing exceptional healthcare benefits is part of the company's overall brand strategy for recruiting and retaining the best talent in a competitive high tech market. It also eases any uncertainty Liaison employees may have regarding their annual coverage.\n\"We believe strongly that this continued investment in great healthcare benefits sends the right message that we genuinely care about each of our team members which ultimately yields better business performance outcomes,\" said Mark Malis , Vice President of Human Resources of Liaison. \"As Liaison continues to expand our market leadership positioning through innovation and impeccable execution, it is our pleasure to invest in the well-being of our employees and their families with the same generosity and dedication they've shown to the company. We want our employees to view our company as a great place to work, and to be proud of our commitment to them in programs like this.\"\nIn addition to the free healthcare premiums, the company also provides a health club membership reimbursement plan as part of its wellness package. In addition, the organization conducts wellness webinars throughout the year, offers free onsite flu shots and biometric testing, and inspires competitive events such as company-sponsored FitBit team challenges and community runs.\nLiaison employees recognize the positive message this sends to them. Mike Payne , an eight-year member of the organization, stated, \"I was very excited when it was announced that Liaison would incur the cost of our healthcare coverages. With a family of four, including two children, this saves me several thousand dollars annually in payroll contribution costs, an amount I can then use for other family needs.\"\nLiaison's continued stance to cover 100 percent of health insurance premiums for both employees and their dependents stands in stark contrast to the number of companies that already have or will likely discontinue company-sponsored healthcare plans due to rising premium and care costs. S&P Capital IQ estimates that 90 percent of workers at S&P 500 companies who currently have insurance coverage through their employer will enter government exchanges by 2020 as the rising cost of healthcare continue to impact the cost of doing business.\nAbout Liaison Technologies\nLiaison Technologies provides integration and data management solutions to help customers unlock the power of a data-centric approach to their business.
