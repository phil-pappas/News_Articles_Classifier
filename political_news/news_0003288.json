Parents can access the free and discounted books by visiting www.bookitprogram.com/amazon .\n\"We are proud to team with the BOOK IT! Program toward our shared goal of helping kids develop a love of reading,\" said David Blum , Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of Amazon Publishing's children's imprint, Two Lions, \"We're excited to have our authors' fantastic stories available to kids across the country as they work toward their reading goals this school year.\"\nSince 1984, more than 60 million students have participated in BOOK IT!, which motivates children to read more by rewarding their reading accomplishments. In 2014, for the 30th anniversary of BOOK IT!, more than 250,000 alumni joined The BOOK IT! Alumni Program, celebrating the accomplishments of past \"BOOK IT! Kids.\" Today, BOOK IT! reaches more than 14 million students in 620,000 classrooms annually.\n\"We're thrilled that we've been able to play a role in increasing literacy awareness for 31 years, and we're still going strong,\" said Shelley Morehead , manager of the Pizza Hut BOOK IT! Program. \"Moving from print to digital books is a natural evolution for the BOOK IT! Program and working with Amazon means BOOK IT! parents will have instant access to books to help students reach their reading goals each month; we can't wait to see what's in the next chapter for BOOK IT!\"\nKids and their parents can read Kindle children's books on Amazon's Kindle e-readers or Fire tablets, on the free Kindle app for iPhone, iPad, Android and more, or on any web browser compatible with Kindle Cloud Reader.\nIn addition to the collaboration with Amazon, BOOK IT! offers tons of great features for teachers and families. For example, the Teacher Dashboard works in conjunction with a mobile app and a new web timer as an innovative way to track print and e-book reading goals. The app and web timer features an interactive game where students choose their favorite dragon to be their reading companion through the duration of the program. Students will earn \"coins\" for every minute spent reading that they can cash in for accessories for the dragons such as fun glasses, watches or scarves. The app and web timer is connected to an online teacher dashboard that can be used to track reading goals and to recognize students for making progress. To learn more about the app and web timer, visit http://teacherdashboard.bookitprogram.com/ .\nThis year, BOOK IT! is entering into its third year partnering with bestselling author Jeff Kinney , creator of the award-winning Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. In addition to Diary of Wimpy Kid themed materials, students who are using the app will receive monthly personal motivational messages from Jeff Kinney himself.\nAlso in 2015, BOOK IT! will continue its tradition of challenging principals across the United States to be examples for literacy and the BOOK IT! program by choosing one day to read, all day long, from the first bell to the last during National Young Readers Week Nov. 9-13 .
