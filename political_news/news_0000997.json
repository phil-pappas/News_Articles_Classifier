(AP) - A Long Island immigrant who says his guilty plea made him a deportation candidate is seeking to have his conviction overturned. \nNatanael Varenga, a Honduran native, pleaded guilty to second-degree assault in March 2009 in a 2008 altercation in East Farmingdale. \nNewsday reports (http://nwsdy.li/1MUoTqE ) Varenga holds temporary protected status, which allows him to live legally in the U.S., but his plea made him vulnerable to deportation. Immigrants with lawful presence or permanent legal status can be removed if theyâ€™re guilty of crimes. \nHis attorney says Varenga should be protected under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says noncitizens should be afforded Sixth Amendment rights in being told they risk deportation before entering a guilty plea. \nThe case will be argued Nov. 16 before the state Court of Appeals. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:55:44.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
