Facebook is fanning the flames of the current Palestinian intifada and its refusals to actively monitor and block the incitement to violence is an outrageous abandonment of its obligations to the public.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:08.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
