The momentum in the battle will be lost and we will simply be fighting fires.” \nMs Cameron urged the Government to address the issues of “help seeking, stigma, referral processes, assessment and availability of appropriate treatments”. \nShe said: “Veterans are individuals who would have put their lives on the line for their country. \n“The least we can do is prioritise their care and treatment to support them in their recovery.” \nShe also raised the issue during Prime Minister’s Questions today and David Cameron said there is an opportunity to look at provision as part of the Government’s strategic defence and security review. \nSpeaking during the debate in reference to current service provision, the health minister Alistair Burt said “palpably it’s not enough”. \nHe said that current provision “good that it is and better than it was, is not yet meeting the demands and the needs”. \nHe said: “It is plain from what colleagues are saying that you want us to do more and look for more.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:41:46.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
