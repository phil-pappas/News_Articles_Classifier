Photo: Gareth Chaney Collins \nThe general election will take place next year, the Taoiseach insisted yesterday - while refusing to rule out going to the polls in November. \nEnda Kenny said he intends to let the Government run its full term, which would mean an election in early February or early March. \nHe said: “Well I haven’t changed my mind, I’ve been very consistent in anything I’ve said about this. \n“My intention is to have the General Election in the Spring of 2016, and I see no reason to change that.” \nBut the Fine Gael leader has been anything but consistent and last week refused to rule out a pre-Christmas election on four separate occasions - causing strains with its Labour coalition partners. \nAnd while Mr Kenny yesterday appeared to clear up the confusion by insisting the election would be in the Spring, his wording “I see no reason to change my mind” could mean he might change his mind if circumstances change. \nHis refusal to end the speculation has threatened to undermine trust between the Coalition parties, with one Labour TD claiming he would not support another voting pact with Fine Gael if the Taoiseach called a snap election. \nBut yesterday, Mr Kenny said it was crucial for both parties to head into the election on a joint platform. \nHe told RTE’s Week in Politics: “The important thing is both parties, Fine Gael and Labour, go into this election on a joint electoral pact platform. Yes we will have different programmes.” \nFianna Fáil said it was difficult to take the Taoiseach seriously, as party leader Micheal Martin claimed it was Enda Kenny who fuelled uncertainty during the week by deliberately dodging questions in the Dáil. \nHe said: “The Taoiseach has only himself to blame for the political uncertainty created on the timing of the election. \n“It’s clear from the Taoiseach’s comments today that the election will be next year. However the country did not need to be treated to an unedifying spectacle this week of Labour Ministers and TDs appearing desperate to stay in government and Fine Gael representatives leaving the door open to a snap election after the budget for their own political expediency. \n“I asked the Taoiseach very straightforward questions on this and other matters related to the Banking Inquiry report on Tuesday and Wednesday and his decision to dodge and to fudge the issue shows his contempt for the Dáil and actually fuelled the uncertainty over the timing of the election. \n“It’s difficult to take the Taoiseach seriously when he said he ‘never changed his mind’ on the timing of the election. He has been forced into a humiliating climb-down today.” Previous Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:53:20.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
