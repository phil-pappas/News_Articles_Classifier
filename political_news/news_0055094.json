The donations – $100,000 from Continental AG and $15,000 from Continental Tire the Americas, LLC – will help all those residents impacted by these devastating floods.\nContinental has approximately 1,300 employees and three facilities in South Carolina : the tire plant in Sumter , the headquarters for Continental Tire the Americas, LLC in Fort Mill , and a fuel systems facility in Fountain Inn . The manufacturer was fortunate enough to remain unaffected by any direct damage to its facilities, but many employees and their families were impacted in the Sumter area. The town of Sumter received an unprecedented 20 inches of rain in 48 hours – wreaking havoc on the city's infrastructure, destroying homes and forcing schools and businesses to close for up to a week.\nDue to the inundation of the water and sewage system, Sumter was placed under a Boil Water Advisory for several days, as well as a nightly curfew.\nImmediately following the flooding, employees from the headquarters location for Continental Tire the Americas, LLC in Fort Mill delivered over 16,000 bottles of water to their colleagues at the Sumter facility.\n\"It is incredibly important that we help each other during difficult circumstances,\" said Jochen Etzel , CEO Continental Tire the Americas, LLC. \"The time and resources our employees have dedicated to helping one another during this time shows a great sense of pride in South Carolina and our Continental family.\"\n\"We appreciate the generosity of businesses like Continental, whose financial support for the relief operation enables the Red Cross to help communities affected by the widespread flooding across South Carolina ,\" said Louise Welch Williams , Regional CEO for Palmetto South Carolina.\nThe American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation's blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a not-for-profit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.
