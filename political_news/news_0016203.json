(Mr. Schaitberger doesn’t deny the falling-out, but a spokesman said that he defers to his board members when making these assignments.) “People that you thought were friends before don’t have time for you anymore,” Mr. Mohler said. “It’s difficult to deal with.” A Very Nice Perk One of the more controversial practices of Mr. Schaitberger’s tenure is the payment of per diems. I.A.F.F. officials can claim up to $80 a day to cover meals and other unreimbursed expenses while performing “duties outside of their regular domicile.” Mr. Schaitberger is relatively scrupulous in his own use of the per diems, typically claiming the allowance only when he travels outside Washington. But he has granted his vice presidents wiggle room on per diem for years. (The I.A.F.F.’s vice presidents represent 16 geographic districts across the United States and Canada and populate the union’s executive board.) According to documents obtained by The Times from one current and one former I.A.F.F. official, vice presidents routinely request and receive the per diems three, four, even five days a week regardless of whether they are on the road, effectively increasing their salaries by thousands of dollars each year. “From Schaitberger’s point of view, if that’s all it takes to keep them happy, he could care less,” said Mr. Lamar, the former aide turned critic. “That’s no skin off his back.” In the 2014 fiscal year, four vice presidents received at least $18,000 in per diem payments and seven more received at least $11,000. An analysis of the paperwork they submitted shows that several of them received the full $80 on dozens of days — in some cases well over 100 — in which they reported that they remained in their city of residence. Ken Margolies, a labor specialist at the Worker Institute at Cornell University who has worked for several unions, said some unions did have policies that allowed officials to collect per diems even when they weren’t traveling, though his impression was that many had abandoned them because of concerns about the appearance of impropriety. But the I.A.F.F.’s policy does not appear to allow this. In February 2015, the union’s financial auditor, Renner & Company, flagged the issue in a presentation at the union’s executive board meeting in Hollywood, Fla., according to a copy of the slides from the presentation provided to The Times by a former union official. The auditors noted that some vice presidents were “requesting $80 any day when I.A.F.F. business is done” and reminded the board that the per diem was not “intended to be $80 compensation for time spent.” Paul Hufnagel, a vice president from Michigan who until recently claimed the $80 on many days when he worked in town, said, “The way I understand it, if you leave your residence, that’s when it kicks in.” (After I’d raised the issue with the union several times, Mr. Hufnagel sent the I.A.F.F. a letter saying, “In an abundance of caution and to avoid any appearance of impropriety, I have decided to reimburse the I.A.F.F. for each out-of-pocket expense allowance claimed during the period of March 2010 through July 2015 where I worked outside of my domicile, as I understood the term, but within the greater Lansing area.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Asked how he interpreted the policy, Mr. Schaitberger stated that he, too, believed it was intended to apply to anyone who left his house, even though he generally only claims the per diem when he leaves town, and even though John Lund, a Labor Department official who performed a review of expense policies for the union, used the term “domicile” in his 2009 report to allude to the geographic area in which one resides, not one’s personal residence. “ ‘Regular domicile,’ I believe, means their home,” Mr. Schaitberger told me. Mr. Mohler, the president of the Virginia state firefighters’ union, said: “In our circles, ‘part of the deal’ is the phrase they use — it’s ‘part of the deal’ that guys do not speak up. You get to go to really nice places, have access to per diems, travel.” But, he added, “You have to sell your soul to get it.” Power of the Purse The combination of good will and fear that Mr. Schaitberger has created affords him enormous leeway in running the union. Committees stacked with allies enact his agenda while votes of the union’s board — on, say, major budget, personnel and policy matters — rarely go against him. In 2011, Mr. Schaitberger moved to create a roughly $1.5 million annual “Fighting Back” fund, from which the I.A.F.F. would send money to locals for as-needed campaigns — like running advertisements to discourage cities from closing stations and engine companies. The board unanimously approved the idea but, surprisingly, did not insist on retaining any control over the spending. Mr. Schaitberger is allowed to dispense the cash entirely as he sees fit, although spending data is available to board members online. (The Fighting Back budget is $1.2 million this year.) Mr. Schaitberger has also used his influence to do business with friends. Some of the insurance products that the IAFF Financial Corporation offers to the union’s members are brokered through SF&C Insurance Associates, owned by Jim Franzoni, one of Mr. Schaitberger’s closest friends for many years. The firm gets a cut of the business. In 2010, Mr. Schaitberger and his fiancée jointly purchased a house owned by Mr. Franzoni on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The law normally requires union officials to disclose such transactions in Labor Department filings. (One risk is that an interested party will underprice an asset to win favor with the officials.) Mr. Schaitberger only disclosed the sale in 2015 after the Labor Department, prompted by an anonymous complaint, deemed the transaction reportable. The union said the department did not determine that the sale price was inappropriate. When presented with these issues, Mr. Schaitberger repeatedly said the union’s lawyers vetted every step he took as president that might be legally controversial, particularly the purchase of Mr. Franzoni’s house, and that he had always deferred to them on what the law required. View From the Trenches One Tuesday in September, I traveled to Virginia Beach for an educational conference organized by the state’s firefighters’ union. Given that the I.A.F.F. is a democratic organization, the question of how rank-and-file firefighters feel about Mr. Schaitberger’s governing style is of more than passing relevance. I wanted to solicit some opinions. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:15:59.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
