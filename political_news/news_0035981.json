Builders, in turn, eschew condo projects in favor of apartment units, they claim.\nThe new elements of the city's proposed measure, which could get a final vote by mid-November, center on the way the city's building codes may be used in a defect claim.\nAdvertisement First, as long as a project is built and maintained in conformance to Denver's building code, it could not be called defective in a civil action, the ordinance states.\nSecond, building code violations could only be cited in a defects lawsuit if the violations can be linked to actual damage or injury, not if they merely represent a technical violation of the city's code.\n\"The kind of claims that will be allowed are those where a plaintiff can prove that some sort of negligence led to a defect that led to some sort of damage or injury to somebody,\" city attorney David Broadwell said.\nWhile one of the primary goals of the proposed ordinance is to minimize the number of frivolous claims filed in court, Broadwell said, homeowner protections wouldn't be sacrificed to get there.\n\"Our council is very sensitive to doing anything that could be perceived as anti-consumer,\" he said.\nCouncilman Kevin Flynn said that while something needs to be done to reform state law to improve the environment for condo construction, consumer rights are at the top of his mind.\n\"I want to make sure we're protecting the rights of people who are truly injured by a construction defect,\" he said.\nBut Jonathan Harris, president of Build Our Homes Right, said a brief reading of the ordinance Tuesday left him with doubts.\n\"It sounds like more of the same of giving builders a pass on this without taking responsibility for their product ,\" said Harris, a Denver resident who dealt with a long-time defects case at the Five Points home where he lives. \"If they build a product and they sell it to a consumer, they should back up their product.\"\nHe said the new element of Denver's ordinance only \"muddies the water,\" leaving it unclear as to who would determine whether a project was built to code.\nHe expressed disappointment at not having been consulted by the city before it drafted the measure.\n\"It looks like homeowners will be left holding the bag again,\" Harris said.\nThe construction defects issue dominated part of the legislative session in 2015, but a bill meant to reform the law failed to pass the House .\nA handful of communities — including Lakewood, Littleton, Aurora, Lone Tree and Commerce City — have taken matters into their owns hands by passing local measures to deal with the issue.\nDenver incorporated into its proposed ordinance parts of those measures.\nDenver's ordinance would require the consent of a majority of condo unit owners before defects litigation is filed. The city would also recognize the dispute resolution method written into the declaration of covenants as binding — not to be amended down the road unilaterally by a homeowners association.\nCouncilman Rafael Espinoza, an architect, said he was \"encouraged\" by the city's proposed ordinance. The city is hoping to see owner-occupied multifamily projects go up at its numerous rail stops as the FasTracks transit system is built out.\nBut he wondered whether the proposal would be enough to convince insurance companies to reassess the risk of building condos in Denver and in turn lower their policy rates for builders.\n\"If it's unable to get the insurance industry to budge, then it will do nothing to change this situation,\" Espinoza said.\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or @abuvthefold", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:12:51.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
