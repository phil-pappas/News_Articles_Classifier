When the Doe parents complained that their childrens kindergarten and first grade teachers were leading the class in unconstitutional prayers, their teachers allegedly told the Doe children to leave their classrooms and sit in the hallway while the rest of the class prayed. One of the children, a first grader, said that the teacher used her mean voice when she told the child to leave the classroom. Meanwhile, Cel Thompson, a kindergarten teacher, allegedly announced to the entire kindergarten class that Jamie [Doe] was not allowed to pray to God and then told Jamie to wait in the hallway while the rest of the class prayed. The Doe parents eventually pulled Jamie from the school after the kindergartener complained about feeling uncomfortable at school. Meanwhile, the older student, who is identified in the complaint as Jesse Doe, remained at the public school, where teachers allegedly began to pressure the first grader to participate in the daily prayers. Jesses science teacher, according to the complaint, told Jesse to make a good decision about the unconstitutional prayers. The gym teacher also allegedly encouraged the first grader to simply give up and start praying with the class. . . . Time for an email to the DOJ.
