You’d do that?” \nMr Little responded with this “yes. We will. It comes down to this in the end – that the fundamental moral obligation of every government is to act in the best interest of its citizens.” \nFull interview here http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/tpp-done-deal-labour-responds-video-6400126", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:29:56.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
