Removing GST from healthy foods will encourage New Zealanders to choose healthier lifestyles. \n\"The government needs to legislate to tackle obesity head on. Until then diabetes will remain a substantial health challenge for the whole country,\" says Mrs Stewart. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:52:52.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
