I sacrificed an animal to the god of the wilderness ... Yes, I drank the goat's blood.\"\nInvictus, whose name in Latin means \"majestic unconquered sun,\" has been accused by Adrian Wyllie, the former chairman of the Libertarian Party of Florida, of being a fascist white supremacist whose goal is to start a second American civil war.\n  Reid: Republicans 'puppets' of the NRA The minority leader urged his colleagues Monday to pass legislation to require mandatory background checks.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/05/15 9:14 PM Wyllie resigned earlier this month in order to draw attention to Invictus' \"violent fascist and neo-Nazi ideologies,\" which he elaborated on in an Oct. 1 statement on Facebook .\n\"I strongly believe that we must ensure that these violent ideologies are not associated with the Libertarian Party in any way,\" Wyllie wrote. \"Libertarians should always be the first to rise up against hatred, subjugation and violence. Since I could not in good conscience remain silent about this man or his followers, I had no choice but to resign.\"\nWyllie mentioned a conversation he once had with Invictus that made him believe the man was a danger to his party.\n\"In a private, face-to-face meeting with Mr. Invictus, I asked him directly, 'Do you actually intend to kill millions of people and start a civil war?'\" Wyllie wrote. \"His answer to me was, 'It's my religion.'\"\n\"I would never disparage anyone on the basis of their religion. But, since Mr. Invictus cites his religion as the motivation for his violent intentions, I believe it must be scrutinized,\" Wyllie continued.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner GOP: New tax rules will drive businesses overseas \"There is never going to be a perfect time to fix the tax code, but stalling ... got us into this problem.\"\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/05/15 7:59 PM Invictus defended himself to the Associated Press, saying that though he does not actually plan on inciting another civil war, the government is in the process of warring with its citizens, and the situation is bound to escalate.\n\"The only question is when are the citizens going to start fighting back?\" he told AP. \"I don't think I'm the only person who sees a cataclysm coming, but I think I'm the only person saying it, and I think that scares people.\"\n\"You do not initiate force,\" Invictus continued. \"If the government is waging war on citizens, we as citizens have the right to self-defense on government.\"\nThis line of thinking is what led Wyllie to resign, pleading to his party not to elect Invictus to the Senate.\n\"It is my sincere hope that the Executive Committee of the LPF reverse their position, and provide the new leadership with the authority to disavow and nullify this clear and present threat to our party, our nation, and our freedom,\" Wyllie wrote.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton's Keystone XL comedy falls flat among green groups Green groups seem too focused on oil exports to care about Clinton's \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/05/15 7:37 PM \"I write this in an attempt to convince the LPF that it must recognize the evil it faces, and have the courage to resoundingly reject it.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:52:34.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
