(Photo: Steve Helber, AP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \n( USA TODAY ) -- Donald Trump is clearly no fan of George W. Bush, and in an interview released Friday, the Republican presidential front-runner slammed the nation’s 43rd president for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks happening on his watch. \nSpeaking with Bloomberg , Trump was asked to explain “who Donald Trump is as a man” and how he would make the nation “feel safe” and “proud” — as Bush had after 9/11 and President Obama did after the Dec. 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut. \n“I think I have a bigger heart than all of them. I think I’m much more competent than all of them. When you talk about George Bush, I mean — say what you want — the World Trade Center came down during his time.” \nBloomberg’s Stephanie Ruhle then interrupted and said Trump couldn’t blame Bush for the attacks that left nearly 3,000 Americans dead. \n“He was president, OK? Don’t blame him or don’t blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign. If you look at Sandy Hook, those people are still begging for help. It’s a disaster.” \nNot surprisingly, Trump’s critique drew a sharp rebuke from one of his rivals. Jeb Bush, the former president’s younger brother, tweeted that Trump was “pathetic” to attack Bush over the terror attack, adding that “my brother kept us safe.” How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11. We were attacked & my brother kept us safe. — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 16, 2015 \nBush offered a similar defense of his brother at the second Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library last month. \nTrump fired back on Twitter Friday night, calling the former Florida governor “pathetic” as well. He also said he “wanted to be nice” in the Reagan Library debate by not making the argument about George W. Bush and 9/11 then. No @JebBush , you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2015 . @JebBush ,At the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice & did not mention the WTC came down during his watch, 9/11. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2015 \nThis is hardly the first time Trump has criticized the Bush presidency. In an interview earlier this month with Fox News , he called Bush “a disaster” and described the decision to go to war with Iraq in 2003 as “one of the worst decisions ever made.” Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1RO14AJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:39:40.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
