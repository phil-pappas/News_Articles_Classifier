The end result is that neglect by its parent agency has left the Copyright Office's services woefully outdated.\"\nThe white paper was commissioned by Hudson Institute's Center for the Economics of the Internet, and co-written by Steven Tepp and Ralph Oman . Mr. Oman served Republican Senators Hugh Scott and Charles Mathias as chief counsel for the Senate Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks, and then served as Register of Copyrights from 1985-1993. Today he is the Pravel Professorial Lecturer in Intellectual Property and Patent Law at The George Washington University Law School.\nMr. Tepp was an attorney on the Judiciary Committee staff of then-chairman Senator Orrin Hatch and later served in a variety of senior attorney positions at the Copyright Office for nearly a dozen years. He was then Chief IP Counsel to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global IP Center and is now President and CEO of his own consultancy, Sentinel Worldwide. Mr. Tepp is also a Professorial Lecturer in Law at The George Washington University Law School.\n\" George Washington and James Madison prioritized copyright,\" writes Mr. Tepp in the white paper, \"but through an accident of history it became a subsidiary concern of the Librarian of Congress. It is well past time to recognize and restore the importance of copyright and the Copyright Office as a driver of creativity and economic growth in America.\"\nMr. Tepp and Mr. Oman are available for media interviews.
