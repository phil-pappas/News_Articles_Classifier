The decision, released on Oct. 22, finds that zoning in the district allows “neighborhood places of worship,” and agrees with the builder’s claim that a mikvah meets that standard. \nThe developer filed the suit in December, 2014, stating that the board voted not to allow the mikvah based on an “irrational and illegal interpretation of the zoning law.” A spokesman for developer said the board’s ruling violated citizen’s rights to worship freely, and was “not consistent with American values.” \nMamakating Building Inspector Mary Grass, who considered the site an “area of worship” approved the mikvah. The Mamakating Planning Board granted site plan approval on June 24. But controversy arose over interpretation of “religious use” of the property, when two residents, Donna Matland and Hilmar Maier went before the ZBA and challenged the religious status of a mikvah. Board member Steven Prall likened it to a “swimming pool,” and other board members said it was merely an “accessory” to a synagogue. \nIn the Article 78 filing, the petitioner submitted statements from several scholars and experts in Jewish law in order to establish that a mikvah constitutes a neighborhood place of worship. Construction of a mikvah is actually required in a new community before construction of a synagogue. Rabbi Jacob Schacter, a professor of Jewish history, said “an individual’s immersion in the waters of a mikvah is a basic religious ritual for the purpose of restoring spiritual and family purity.” Rabbi Binyamin Hammer called the ritual “vital to those who observe Jewish laws.” Further submissions by the petitioner showed that immersion in a mikvah is “generally accompanied by the reciting of blessings or prayers.” \nThe developer had also asserted in the case that the ZBA imposed an additional requirement of “communal” worship in addition to “neighborhood” worship. The court found that the board could not add a condition that was not contained in the statutory language. \nThe developer had sought recovery of costs, but the court denied that request, stating that the board did not act with “gross negligence, or in bad faith or with malice” in denying the building of the mikvah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:11:57.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
