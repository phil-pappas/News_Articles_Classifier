Vincent Harris, the chief digital strategist for Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign, kicked off some of the skirmishing on Friday with a few knocks on former Florida governor Jeb Bush's fundraising numbers.\nBush raised about $13 million in the last quarter and ended up with about $10 million cash on hand, according to his report released Thursday, vastly more than Paul's campaign which reported raising $2.5 million and had about $2.2 million cash on hand.\nHarris argued those numbers are misleading.\nChattering class talking about $ as if it is sole importance to win in 2016. shows ignorance.\n— Vincent Harris (@VincentHarris) October 16, 2015 The amount Bush has spent already in Iowa and the place he is at currently is 1 of most under written stories & Rubio beating him in fl=bye\n— Vincent Harris (@VincentHarris) October 16, 2015 Asked for a response on Friday, Bush campaign spokespeople snarked back at Harris and the \"RandLive\" day-long livestream from earlier in the week that captured all the action (and the lack thereof) on the campaign trail.\n\"Surprised he didn't [livestream] this take, he should probably focus on the issues with his own campaign instead,\" Bush spokesman Tim Miller told POLITICO in an email on Friday.\nSimilarly, Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said \"Are we responding to the guy [whose] own campaign livestreamed him this week having to confirm he was still in the race? No.\"\nHarris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Bush campaign staffers, meanwhile, were going on the offense against rival Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, which raised $5.7 million and had just shy of $11 million cash on hand.\nThe tension between the Bush and Rubio camps were on full display Thursday afternoon, when almost immediately after the Bush campaign announced its fundraising numbers, the Rubio campaign sent out an email noting its superior cash-on-hand numbers (the Bush campaign has about $10.3 million).\nMiller pointed to a report that Rubio's campaign exaggerated its numbers.\nLying about budgets. Guess Marco picked up something in the Senate. https://t.co/mCSILB3VjK\n— Tim Miller (@Timodc) October 16, 2015 Campbell added to Miller's jabs.\n2 Qs: 1) Did we mislead you for a week regarding COH (no)? 2) Is debt applicable re primary dollars (no.) Discuss. https://t.co/HUTTi1i9fK\n— Kristy Campbell (@kristymcampbell) October 16, 2015 A Rubio spokesman declined to respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/VincentHarris/status/655055359514660864", "https://twitter.com/kristymcampbell/status/654849338032570368", "https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/655016591340339200", "https://twitter.com/VincentHarris/status/655056100530761728", "https://t.co/mCSILB3VjK", "https://t.co/HUTTi1i9fK"], "published": "2015-10-16T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:57:43.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
