The Creating IT Futures Foundation , the philanthropic arm of CompTIA, gives each member community and industry advisory council $10,000 with which to support one or two charities doing good works.\n\"This program demonstrates CompTIA's core belief in giving back to local groups through philanthropy,\" said Charles Eaton , CEO, Creating IT Futures. \"Not only do these charitable donations bring positive awareness to CompTIA and selected charities, they can serve as a vehicle for individual engagement for our members.\"\nCompTIA's Vendor Advisory Council (VAC) selected the San Diego Women's Hackathon and TechGirlz to receive contributions worth $5,000 each.\nThe San Diego Women's Hackathon, a twice-annual, 12-hour event is open to all female students ages 16 and older as they work collaboratively to design a website, game or mobile app that addresses a selected real-world challenge. With the help of CompTIA's grant, the hackathon will begin offering a career fair, where corporate recruiters can talk with participants about internships and job opportunities. The contribution also helps underwrite the organization's \"future hackers\" session offered to middle-school-aged girls, as well as transportation for girls living in low-income neighborhoods.\nTechGirlz offers workshops and summer camps for middle-aged girls. Their goal is to provide girls with fun, hands-on learning experiences with different forms of technology and to give them a chance to interact with women role models who have built successful careers within the IT industry.\nCompTIA's Partner Advisory Council (PAC) also selected TechGirlz as well as NPower to receive charitable contributions worth $5,000 each. NPower mobilizes the tech community and provides individuals, other nonprofits and schools opportunities to build tech skills and achieve their potential. Its Technology Services Corps provides free technology and professional skills training to underserved young adults and veterans. The CompTIA donation will enable 25 students to obtain an industry-recognized certification, which will help them secure or advance in a position in the technology field.\nCompTIA's Telecom Advisory Council (TAC) selected Folds of Honor and Computers for Youth to receive $5,000 each.\nAccording to Folds of Honor, 90 percent of the one million-plus spouses and children adversely affected by a loved one's deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan do not qualify for federal scholarship assistance. In addition to providing college scholarships, Folds of Honor also helps children in grades K-12 attend educational summer camps.\nComputers for Youth helps students, families and teachers in low-income communities harness the power of digital learning to improve educational outcomes. Computers for Youth pursues this mission with its groundbreaking K-12 learning platform, www.PowerMyLearning.Org , as well as its direct service initiative, the CFY Digital Learning Program . Computers for Youth has demonstrated tangible results impact on student achievement, student engagement, parent confidence and broadband adoption.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140416/75669\n releases/comptia-industry-advisory-councils-donate-30000-to-five-charities-300157407.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140416/75669", "http://powermylearning.org/learn/about-us/impact", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/comptia-industry-advisory-councils-donate-30000-to-five-charities-300157407.html", "http://www.comptia.org/communities/councils/vendor-advisory-council", "http://www.comptia.org/communities/councils/partner-advisory-council", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140416/75669", "http://www.powermylearning.org/", "http://www.npower.org/", "http://www.npower.org/Our-Programs/Technology-Service-Corps.aspx", "http://www.comptia.org/communities/councils/telecom-advisory-council", "http://cfy.org/", "http://www.comptia.org/", "https://www.foldsofhonor.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24780&Transmission_Id=201510120930PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24780&DateId=20151012", "http://cfy.org/what-we-do/the-cfy-digital-learning-program/", "http://sandiegohackathon.org/us", "http://www.creatingitfutures.org/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.techgirlz.org/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:26:18.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
