I believe the Hilux are better than the crap of a vehicle we call Humvees.\nWe trained Syrian troops, gave them millions of dollars worth of U.S weapons and the next day they handed them over to ISIS – now 43 elite vehicles are missing. What it sounds like to me is that the Obama administration is purposely arming our enemies for a possible attack on our troops who are stationed in Iraq.\nAfter we gave ISIS trained soldiers and weapons, all of a sudden there’s a big concern from the U.S counter terror officials to find out why there’s 43 vehicles missing.\nWhat did the officials think was going to happen once we provided Syria with elite equipment? Are they really that stupid?\nI can guarantee the American people that this is not the end of it. The Obama administration will continue to provide the “Syrian Rebels” with all the equipment they need.", "external_links": ["http://itmakessenseblog.com/files/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-6.47.52-PM-770x408-550x291.jpg", "http://itmakessenseblog.com/2015/10/20/isis-is-enjoying-new-trucks-courtesy-of-obama/screen-shot-2015-10-13-at-6-47-52-pm-770x408/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:58:12.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
