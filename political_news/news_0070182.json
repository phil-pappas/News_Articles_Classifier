To view our ad, click here: www.canadiansunitedforchange.ca .\nPrime Minister Harper [CPC Policy Conference, 2008]: \"We will emerge stronger than ever before.\"\nVoice Over: \"Ten years of Conservative talkâ€¦and the worst economy since World War Two.\"\nHarper: \"Our campaign platform laid out additional steps to move Canada forward.\"\nVO: \"Worst job growth. 1.3 million out of work . Worst job quality.\"\nHarper: \"Our early and decisive action has mattered.\"\nVO: \"Only G7 country in recession in 2015. Six straight deficits. The Conservatives are not working. It's time for a change.\"\nAccording to the national economic study, \"Rhetoric and Reality: Evaluating Canada's Economic Record Under the Harper Government,\" issued in July 2015: \"Since the initial election of the Harper government in 2006, and especially since it attained a majority mandate in 2011, Canada's economy has consistently disappointed . Across a wide range of core indicators (job-creation, growth, productivity, incomes, indebtedness, and more), this government has presided over what has indisputably been the weakest era in Canada's postwar economic history.\"\nThe same study further noted: \" The Harper government ranked dead last among postwar prime ministers in seven indicators, and second-last in another six. In the remaining three indicators, Harper never ranked better than sixth. Overall, Canada's economy performed worse under Stephen Harper than under any other postwar prime minister.\" ( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/jordan-brennan/harper-recession-new-approach-economy_b_8090708.html )\nCanadians United for Change was created in the Spring 2015 to promote economic development and help elect officials committed to creating jobs for hardworking Canadians.
