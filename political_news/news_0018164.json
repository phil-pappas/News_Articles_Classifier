Francyzk, raised longtime complaints from Marine Drive residents about noise and other issues. \nIt also cited plans by Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp. and the administration of Mayor Byron W. Brown to bring shops, restaurants and possibly housing and office space to Canalside, with the intent to add more vitality to the waterfront. \nThe Council’s nonbinding resolution also suggested that the waterfront agency consider moving the concert series to the festival grounds on the Outer Harbor, LaSalle Park or Broderick Park. \nThomas P. Dee, Erie Canal Harbor Development’s president, said in a statement that the agency has worked with Marine Drive residents and others to mitigate problems. Preliminary discussions about moving the series to the Outer Harbor have also been held with the promoters. \n“With the potential for additional development at Canalside, we realize that the size and location of our concert series might have to change in the future,” Dee said.﻿ \nThe series at Canalside had an average attendance of 12,500 for the dozen free Thursday concerts between June and August. \n“This past summer was unbelievable. The numbers shocked all of us,” Kwitchoff said, which makes him question moving the concerts at all. \n“You’ve got this incredibly successful series, and you don’t want to lose the energy that comes with those events,” Kwitchoff said. “It’s 12 Thursdays – 12 nights of the summer that raise the profile of the city and bring suburban people downtown. Parents and people from the suburbs now feel really comfortable going to those events, more than ever before.” \nKutzbach said Canalside remains the site best suited for handling concerts, with public transit and readily available parking as major reasons. \n“Every site doesn’t have proper infrastructure or has been developed in a way that’s amenable for concerts,” he said. \nFuntime Presents, Buffalo’s largest concert promoter, counts Alice Cooper, Elvis Costello, the Tragically Hip and the Black Keys among the acts that it has brought to the waterfront. \nBroderick Park, listed on the resolution, is off Niagara Street and can only be reached by vehicle from the Ferry Street Bridge. The park’s access makes it out of the question, Kwitchoff said. \n“That idea is completely ridiculous. Trying to funnel all the traffic that way would be a nightmare. It’s a nonstarter,” he said. \nLaSalle Park is also a poor choice, he said. The promoters have presented the Warped Tour and other shows there. \n“There are enormous drawbacks,” said Kwitchoff, including a lack of parking, inadequate electricity, conflicts with other park activities, security challenges and an existing stage that can’t hold weight, rendering it useless. \n“In today’s age, it’s not set up in a manner where you can see properly, or produce the show properly,” Kwitchoff said. \n“When we had a critical mass for the Warped Tour of 10,000 people, we realized it needed to move,” he said. “It was too hard to handle, and people had to walk over the bridge and park in the lower West Side,” Kwitchoff said. \n“The only reason we were able to do it for so many years there was because it was drop-off traffic, since the demographic was between 15 and 22.” \nThe promoters said that holding concerts at the Outer Harbor held the most potential but that the site needs significant improvements in transportation and infrastructure, including water and power lines. \n“We literally had to create an entire community for our concerts there,” Kwitchoff said. \nThe festival grounds, where concerts are held, require most people to park one to two miles from the concert site, even with a nearby lot and free parking on Fuhrmann Boulevard. Moving the site farther south, closer to Terminals A and B, where waterfront officials want to put housing and other development, would put parking on either side of the grounds. \nPutting staging there could also provide more protection from the wind, a major safety concern for outdoor concerts. \n“The only way I see this happening on the Outer Harbor is if the physical site where the concerts take place moves,” Kwitchoff said. “It’s not feasible at the current festival grounds for the long term.” \nPutting the stage on Canalside’s Central Wharf – where it was located in the first year – gets a thumbs-down from the promoters. The stage put too much weight on the wharf, and the location made it particularly difficult to get artists on and off stage, they said. \nSo does returning the series to Lafayette Square, where two hotels are now located. \n“It was already a nightmare down there from a production standpoint. It would be a mess now, and the hotels wouldn’t want it,” Kwitchoff said. \nKutzbach said he hopes that any decision to move the series from Canalside would be done in a thoughtful manner. \n“The concert series has been a beacon for Canalside. I can see needing to move it in the future, but there needs to be a real timetable and a real plan in place that is mutually agreed on with the producers of the event and the city,” Kutzbach said. \n“This has become a huge part of the city’s fabric, and needs to be treated that way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:53:18.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
