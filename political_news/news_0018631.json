He was 51. Crisp was born in England in 1845. Later that year, his parents emigrated and settled in Georgia. He became a Confederate soldier at the age of 16 and was captured by Union forces at the Battle of Spotsylvania and spent a year in a federal military prison.\nAfter studying law, he began his political career as solicitor general of Georgia’s southwestern judicial circuit, serving in that capacity for five years before being elected judge of the circuit’s superior court in 1877.\nIn 1882, Crisp won a seat in Congress, going on to chair both the Committee on Elections and the Committee on Rules. Crisp often found himself at odds with Rep. Thomas Reed (R-Maine) over tariffs and other issues. In 1891, when the Democrats took control of the House, they elected him to the speakership. He proceeded to reverse a series of rules Reed had promulgated as speaker — rules that enhanced the speaker’s powers — only to eventually recognize their value and reinstate many of them.\nIn 1894, Crisp declined an offer from the Georgia Legislature for a Senate seat. In a letter to his supporters, Quote: : “I wanted to go to the Senate, but the conditions in the House are such that after careful consideration I felt it was my duty to continue in the position I now hold, for the present, at least.”\nAfter Crisp’s sudden death weeks before the 1896 election, his son, also named Charles, won a special election to fill his father’s seat. He remained a House member until 1932, when he resigned to become a member of the U.S. Tariff Commission.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:51:09.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
