She also accused Shkreli's company of \"price gouging\" on Twitter.\n  Defense policy the newest battleground in budget fight  \nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/08/15 12:01 AM The stock market took notice. An index of biotech stocks dropped 20 percent after Clinton tweeted about Shkreli, according to Bloomberg data.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals saw its stock drop 17 percent after Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., requested the drug maker be subpoenaed to explain to Congress why it is raising drug prices. Cummings wants the House Oversight Committee to subpoena the company on why it increased the price of generic heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel more than 200 percent.\nBut despite the beating the stocks are taking, experts don't believe Wall Street will push drug makers to lower prices.\n\"We have seen this before,\" said David Nierengarten, managing director of the investment firm Web Bush Securities. \"Last year there was a similar controversy with politicians on pricing for hepatitis C drugs and the index dropped 20 percent again and recovered in the last few months.\"\nNierengarten also pointed out that biotech stocks have been on a roll. The industry average has increased 30-40 percent this year compared to 2014, he added.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Press sees Clinton's trade flip-flop as pure politics Clinton's about-face on the trade deal came Wednesday during an interview in Iowa with PBS's Judy Woodruff.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/08/15 12:01 AM \"A sharp runup contributes to a sharp decline,\" he said.\nOther analysts agree that the industry stocks will rebound.\nThe main reason why analysts are confident is that it doesn't appear Congress has the appetite to take on high drug prices.\n\"We continue to believe the government's role will be limited,\" said Sumesh Sood, analyst for Height Securities, in Bloomberg.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a wide-ranging bill with reforms to tackle high drug prices, but it has gone nowhere in the GOP-controlled Senate.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Conservative groups split on oil export bill A measure added to a bill lifting the ban on oil exports is prompting some supporters to withdraw support.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/08/15 12:01 AM Nierengarten isn't too scared if Clinton wins the White House next year.\n\"Republicans will continue to control Congress,\" he predicted. \"There is lower likelihood that action would happen on pricing. I would be skeptical any price controls would happen with a divided government or Hillary as president.\"\nThe pharmaceutical industry is vehemently opposed to price controls, saying that would hinder innovation of new treatments.\nHowever, the stock drop could have an impact on the pricing strategies used by drug makers.\nNierengarten said the most likely outcome is lower prices for \"drugs with marginal benefits.\"\nA good example is a cancer drug that may help a patient live only a month longer but cost $20,000 a month instead of more, he said.\n\"The innovative companies out there with the new drugs will be recognized by the market and separate themselves from the rest of the pack,\" Nierengarten said.\nTop Story Conservatives reject McCarthy, endorse Webster for Speaker About 80 percent of the caucus backed the decision in a meeting.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/07/15 5:16 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:33:01.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
