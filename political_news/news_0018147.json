Job openings fell in August, though new hires and voluntary quits ticked up.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 16, 2015 | 11:26 a.m. EDT + More The number of job openings in the U.S. fell at the end of August, as more workers were hired and despite the fact that the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs reached a five-month high.\nThere were 5.4 million positions up for grabs at the end of August, down slightly from July's record-high 5.7 million openings , according to a report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nBut it was still a great time to find a job. Despite the monthly downtick, there were still nearly 500,000 more vacancies in the labor market than were present in August 2014. Openings in the South climbed 198,000 year over year, while the Northeast saw a vacancy increase of about 50,000 positions.\nRELATED\nSeniors Miss Out on Social Security Bump \"The job openings are pretty much across the board. It's not just one area. A couple of years ago, we saw strong openings in tech and health care, and at the very low wage end, but very little in between,\" says Tara Sinclair, chief economist at employment hub Indeed. \"But in the last year and a half or so, that middle bed has really expanded in terms of job openings.\"\nProfessional and business services had 184,000 more open positions at the end of August than the sector held a year earlier, while health care and social assistance vacancies rose by 103,000 positions since August 2014. However, the report also noted that job openings in arts, entertainment and recreation fell by 31,000 positions year over year, while mining and logging saw a 14,000-vacancy reduction.\nStill, nearly 5.1 million workers were hired in August, making it the third-best month for prospective workers to get a job so far this year. Over the year, hires exploded in the Northeast and the South, as the regions provided jobs for 151,000 and 144,000 new employees, respectively. The relatively small number of job openings in the Northeast, coupled with the region's substantial hiring total, suggest that openings aren't posted for very long in the area.\n\"When you see [near-]record job openings, and really strong job postings on Indeed, that suggests employers have a lot of need,\" Sinclair says. \"Maybe they'll start really enticing job seekers with higher wage gains. The question is, then: How much effort do employers need to put in to attract people to their jobs?\"\nWages have been largely flat in recent years, and average hourly earnings in September actually contracted slightly from the month before. But employers may also need to focus on retaining their existing labor, considering more than 2.7 million workers quit their jobs in August.\nSee Photos\n4 Need-to-Know Excerpts From the Fed's Beige Book Quits are generally considered to be a sign of confidence among U.S. workers that they'll be able to quickly find an alternative means of employment, and August's quits numbers hit a five-month high, making it the third-highest month for such separations so far in 2015.\nLayoffs also climbed to 1.6 million separations, however, after dropping sharply in July. It's almost always a good thing for the labor market when the number of voluntary quits exceeds the number of layoffs, and it's worth noting that the bulk of layoff increases over the last year have been concentrated among government employees. Layoffs in the government are up more than 32 percent year over year but are virtually unchanged in the private sector.\nFriday's openings and separations data are some of the last economic readings the Federal Reserve will see before members of the Federal Open Market Committee meet in Washington at the end of the month to potentially chart an interest rate course .\nBut the positives in this report weren't overwhelming and do little to offset disappointing employment reports from August and September . Analysts generally expect the Fed to kick the can down the road to either December or some time in 2016.\nTAGS: economy hiring Bureau of Labor Statistics", "external_links": ["http://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hires%2C%20Quits%20Rise%20in%20August%27s%20Positive%20JOLTS%20Report&summary=Quits%20in%20August%20climbed%20to%20a%20five-month%20high.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hires%2C%20Quits%20Rise%20in%20August%27s%20Positive%20JOLTS%20Report", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hires%2C%20Quits%20Rise%20in%20August%27s%20Positive%20JOLTS%20Report", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9am7%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:58:04.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
