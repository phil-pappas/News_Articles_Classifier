Photo: Darrian Traynor\nEmbattled Victorian government MP Cesar Melhem's union record has been thrown into the spotlight again following claims he accepted a trip to the US, Europe and his home country of Lebanon at the expense of glass manufacturer ACI when he was an official.\nThe royal commission into union corruption is investigating nearly $500,000 in payments from ACI to the Victorian branch of the Australian Workers Union while federal Labor leader Bill Shorten was state secretary.\nFormer ACI employee relations manager Michael Gilhome on Thursday told the royal commission he took Mr Melhem on a study tour of glass works on behalf of the company in the mid-2000s.\nMr Melhem, who replaced Mr Shorten as Victorian secretary before being elected to the Victorian Parliament is due to front the commission for a second time next week.\nAdvertisement Mr Melhem does not deny going on the trip but disputes the price tag put on it, saying the $130,000 suggested to the commission was way too high for the tour.\n\"Quoting that figure is absolutely nonsense,\" Mr Melhem told The Age on Thursday.\nMr Melhem said he did not recall any flash hotels or expensive hotels and one night he ate pizza at the company's office.\nThe fresh evidence and Mr Melhem's appearance on the stand will be another major distraction for Premier Daniel Andrews and his government, as well as Mr Shorten.\nMr Melhem stood down as upper house whip in June after allegations against him were aired at the commission.\nWhen told of the travel claims on Thursday, one senior Labor figure said: \"Here we go again.\"\nMr Gilhome said the trip to the US and Europe lasted a couple of weeks and included the visit to Lebanon.\nThe pair stayed in Lebanon on the way home even though there were no glass plants there because \"it was on the way\", he said.\n\"We went across to America to visit [global glass company] O-I in the glass plants because O-I had just taken over, or virtually taken over, ACI and we came back via Europe.\"\nThe trip to Lebanon was \"maybe a week, maybe a bit less, I'm not sure\".\nAsked by counsel assisting Jeremy Stoljar, SC, what he was doing in Lebanon, Mr Gilhome said: \"We weren't doing anything particular.\"\nHe said Mr Melhem was \"just having a look at Lebanon on the way back home. This is where he came from.\"\n\"ACI picked up the tab for this trip?\" Mr Stoljar asked.\n\"Yes,\" Mr Gilhome said.\nMr Gilhome said he claimed expenses for himself and Mr Melhem.\n\"Would it surprise you if it cost in excess of $130,000?\" Mr Stoljar asked.\n\"I didn't know what the cost of the trip was,\" Mr Gilhome replied\nNeither he nor Mr Melhem prepared a report on the trip.\n\"It was going over just to talk to the O-I people and we certainly did that, introduced him to that,\" he said.\nMr Gilhome said it was the only trip he took with Mr Melhem and that it had been approved by the company.\nThe AWU's Victorian branch sent the company three invoices for \"paid education leave\" between June 2003 and June 2004, when Mr Shorten, now the federal Labor leader, was the Victorian and national secretary of the union.\nThe practice continued under Mr Melhem and ended under current AWU secretary Ben Davis.\nMr Davis has told the commission that he stopped the practice of paid education leave last year because he could not find a clause for it in the workplace agreement.\nMany within the Andrews government acknowledge the allegations against Mr Melhem are not a good look but are urging for natural justice to take its course.\nOfficially the Labor government is refusing to comment on the allegations saying \"the royal commission has a job to do and we won't be providing a running commentary\".\nMany argue that nothing should happen until the royal commission makes its findings given Mr Melhem is a backbencher.\nFor Labor to disendorse Mr Melhem without him being disloyal to the party or being charged with a criminal offence would be difficult and given Labor holds just 14 votes in the upper house, losing another number would be problematic.\nAlternatively, Mr Melhem could move to the crossbench of his own accord.\nThe state opposition seized on ACI's testimony with shadow industrial relations minister Robert Clark calling on Mr Melhem to give a full explanation of these latest allegations.\n\"Victorians workers are entitled to be angry if their union officials have compromised themselves by taking secret rorts or personal benefits,\" Mr Clark said.\n\"These allegations cast a big shadow over Mr Melhem's future. Unless he can provide a full explanation, voters are entitled to ask how Premier Daniel Andrews can allow Mr Melhem to remain in Parliament as a Labor MP. \"\nPeter Robinson, chief executive officer of ACI in 2003, told the royal commission on Wednesday he had not seen a series of invoices for $160,000 a year, which the company paid the union between 2003 and 2005.\nHe told the commission on Wednesday it was correct to say he had no idea how the invoices were paid nor what they were for before they emerged at the royal commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:29:06.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
