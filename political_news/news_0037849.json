But calling these weapons new is like calling your 1970 Chevelle SS new when what you've done is replace the spark plugs and brakes. The only difference is it's infinitely easier to change a car's brakes than to reliably update thousands of components in a nuclear bomb.\nWhat Vladimir Putin's blustering about is the B61 bomb. It entered the U.S. arsenal in the 1970s and is the oldest weapon in our nuclear stockpile. Originally designed for a 10 year life-span, the United States in 2012 started a Life Extension Program to update aged components in the weapon and enable it to be in service for 20-30 more years.\nThe United States is not refurbishing these weapons for fun of it.\nWithout updates, the B61's reliability would be severely degraded -- to the point that its ability to perform would be questionable. And these weapons are absolutely critical for transatlantic security. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization confirmed that in its 2010 Strategic Concept. And the alliance's 2012 Deterrence and Defense Posture Review notes that \"Nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's overall capabilities for deterrence and defence.\"\nThe Europeans are pitching in to keep that component viable. They are contributing funds to update the infrastructure that supports U.S. nuclear weapon deployments on their respective territories. This includes the modernization of security perimeters around vaults where weapons are stored. Only a fool would complain about improving the security of the most powerful weapons mankind possesses.\nThe Russian bear growls about U.S. and allied activity, even though Moscow deploys anywhere from two- to four- thousand short-range nuclear weapons close to NATO's borders. Oh, and Russia is moving full speed ahead in developing and testing new types of nuclear weapons, even as it aggressively maintains its large nuclear weapon production complex.\nAgainst Russia's thousands, the United States has about 200 tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. Reports differ on whether Washington is upping that number by 20 or swapping them in for old weapons that are being taken off-line awaiting upgrade.\nIt really doesn't matter. Even if the U.S. deployed five times more weapons to Europe than it currently has, Russia would still enjoy at least a 2:1 advantage in tactical nuclear weapons. Security obligations of the two countries are completely asymmetrical. The United States guarantees Europe's security. Russia threatens it.\nToday, there is no area on NATO borders where the alliance has military superiority over Russia. And Russia's military and nuclear weapon superiority is exactly the kind of \"strategic balance in Europe\" that Moscow wants to maintain.\nBut not offending Russia's feelings must not be a basis for U.S. nuclear weapons policy in Europe -- or anywhere else -- because Russia's goals are incompatible with U.S. foreign policy interests.\nRussian accusations that the U.S. is increasing tensions in Europe are even more ridiculous when one considers a string of Russia's actions aimed at destabilizing European security. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia. In 2014, it invaded Ukraine. Russia is also blatantly violating a bevy of arms control treaties and international obligations, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Vienna Protocol ...you get the idea.\nTo be fair, flawed U.S. policies have enabled and encouraged Russia's bad actions. President Obama's \"reset\" policy fed into Russia's worst aggressive tendencies and made the United States look like a patsy. As a result, Russia has successfully limited U.S. options and undermined U.S. interests throughout the region and beyond.\nMoscow's extensive efforts to undermine U.S. nuclear presence in Europe are but a continuation of its time-honored technique of denial and deception. Washington must not fall for it this time.\nAbout The Writer\nMichaela Dodge is a senior policy analyst for defense and strategic policy in the Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue NE, Washington, D.C. 20002; Web site: www.heritage.org.
