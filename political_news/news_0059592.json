Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of New York announced he would be supporting Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower for reelection in Eisenhower’s approaching contest with Adlai Stevenson, Powell’s fellow Democrat. The Harlem-based congressman had backed Stevenson in 1952. In breaking with the Democratic candidate, Powell cited Eisenhower’s “great contribution in the civil rights field.” The Eisenhower administration, he noted, strove to desegregate the District of Columbia and to make minority appointments to government agencies.\nPowell began to align himself with the Republican administration in May 1955 after arranging a meeting with the president. In the ensuing year, Powell challenged the administration on the House floor by adding anti-segregation amendments to major pieces of legislation. In a June 1955 letter to Powell, Eisenhower assured him that the administration will “work toward the eventual elimination of segregation from our national life.”\nIn 1944, Powell had run successfully for Congress on a platform of expanded civil rights for African-Americans: support for “fair employment practices, and a ban on poll taxes and lynching.” In 1961, after 15 years in the House, he became chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.\nFollowing allegations of corruption, his fellow Democrats barred him from taking his seat in 1967. He regained his seat in a 1969 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, but in June 1970, Powell’s constituents, reacting to his increasing absenteeism, favored Charles Rangel in the Democratic primary. After failing to get enough signatures to get on the November ballot as an independent, he resigned as minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and moved to Bimini in the Bahamas.\nIn 1972, Powell became ill and was flown to a Miami hospital from his home in Bimini. He died there on April 4, 1972, at the age of 63, from acute prostatitis.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF HISTORY AND PRESERVATION, CLERK OF THE U.S. HOUSE\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:07:15.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
