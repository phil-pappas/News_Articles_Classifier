Backed by U.S.-ally Turkey, Ahrar al-Sham has sought to recast itself as a player acceptable to Washington and the West, while distancing itself from al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria and its jihadi ideology.\nTo that end, Labib Al Nahhas, the group's self-styled foreign affairs director, has written opinion pieces in the Washington Post and Britain's Daily Telegraph that present Ahrar al-Sham as a moderate alternative and potential partner for Western governments.\nThe group has also vowed to defeat what it calls the Russian \"occupation\" of Syria after Moscow began launching airstrikes on insurgents last week. In a post on Twitter, its leader, Muhannad al-Masri, warned: \"The Soviet Union entered Afghanistan, where it faced its end, and its boys will face the same end in the land of the Levant, God willing.\"\nUnlike the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's branch in Syria, the Nusra Front, Ahrar al-Sham is not on the U.S. list of terrorist organizations. However, Washington remains suspicious because of its links to al-Qaida, especially since one of the group's founders was known to be close to al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\nA powerful, well-organized force with thousands of fighters spread across Syria and a large presence in the key provinces of Idlib and Aleppo, analysts say Ahrar al-Sham is positioning itself to play a major role in the U.S.-Turkish plan to set up an IS-free zone along the Syrian border with Turkey.\n\"Turkey has been really working very hard for more than a year trying to convince the Americans and the U.S.-led coalition that Ahrar al-Sham is not al-Qaida, that Ahrar al-Sham could be weaned off Nusra Front,\" said Fawaz A. Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. \"The Americans are very suspicious.\"\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said that Ankara has no plans to send ground troops into Syria, but instead wants to see Syria's moderate opposition forces take over areas currently controlled by IS near the Turkish border.\nConsidered the best-armed and organized militant group in Syria after IS and the Nusra Front, with tanks, armored vehicles and multiple rocket launchers, Ahrar al-Sham's push to rebrand itself comes at a time when the West and the U.S. desperately need allies inside Syria.\nA U.S. counterterrorism official told The Associated Press that Ahrar al-Sham clearly wants \"a seat at the table\" in post-conflict Syria.\nBut Washington remains skeptical that the group has truly broken away from the Islamic extremist ideology of its founders, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive intelligence matters.\nIn recent months, the group has made major military advances, capturing large swaths of the northwestern province of Idlib, including the provincial capital of the same name. Last month, the militants seized the last army air base in Idlib, making it the second province in the country to fall fully out of government hands, after Raqqa, which is controlled by IS. Ahrar al-Sham's advances have also brought it close to Assad's traditional stronghold on the Mediterranean coast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:31:29.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
