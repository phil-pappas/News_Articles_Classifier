Visa and MasterCard already use the new microchip card system, which replaces magnetic stripes.\nBy Tom Risen Sept. 30, 2015 | 5:08 p.m. EDT + More U.S. consumers and retailers are widely unprepared ahead of a Thursday deadline to implement new technology that will change the way Americans do business.\nMagnetic stripes on credit cards will head for history when retailers – not banks – will be held responsible for sales fraud if they do not accept new cards with more secure chip technology.\nRELATED\n6 Things You Need to Know About the New Chip Cards Visa and MasterCard have already switched to the new microchip card system, which President Barack Obama has touted as a move to protect customer information and prevent fraud. But many Americans and retailers are not prepared for the deadline set by the credit card industry.\nThe new cards, which contain microprocessors that encrypt the data of a transaction shared with sales terminals, have only been distributed to about 40 percent of U.S. cardholders , according to a survey last week from electronic payments company ACI Worldwide.\nConsumers have little role to play in the change-over – other than getting used to dipping their cards at terminals, rather than swiping them – but the ACI study said that more than two-thirds of card-holders have not received information from their banks about the switch and why it was necessary.\nThe benefit of the new card is that the transaction information it creates is unique, so the information on it cannot be reproduced and used for fraudulent purchases. The technology, which has been around since the 1990s, is widely used in Europe but has been slow to take hold in America. Big-box merchants like Target and Wal-Mart have made the switch, hoping to avoid another wave of sales data breaches , but only 27 percent U.S. retailers will offer chip card sales terminals as of Thursday, according to a survey by Strawhecker Group consulting firm.\nThe chip upgrade won’t fix all card security problems, as transactions made online or by phone aren’t affected by the change. But using the new system could prevent an estimated 37 percent of all U.S. credit card fraud, according to a research conducted the Aite Group consulting firm. It could also lead crooks in the U.S. to abandon card-fraud efforts and refocus their attention on Internet crime, according to a separate report by payments information service CreditCards.com.\n[ READ: Your Credit Card Is Changing: What You Need to Know ]\nThe deadline set by the card companies was meant to incentivize the switch, as Visa and MasterCard will no longer compensate card users who have not upgraded, leaving noncompliant retailers on the hook for any fraud or counterfeiting.\nBuying a terminal to read the cards may cost a business “between $500 to $1,000,” so smaller shops with a limited budget will have to decide if the investment is worth it to counter any risk of card fraud, says Sienna Kossman, a staff reporter for CreditCards.com. Mobile payments company Square is also releasing a new version of its mobile phone reader device that can process the new chip cards, so that could be a more affordable solution for small businesses, she says.\n“Typically fraudsters will target places that have bigger ticket items like jewelry or electronics,” Kossman says. “Smaller businesses do have time to migrate and figure out if it is the right thing to make that investment right away.”\nTAGS: credit cards fraud", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Retailers%20Unprepared%20for%20Credit%20Card%20Security%20Deadline&summary=Businesses%20that%20don%27t%20buy%20new%20terminals%20will%20be%20liable%20for%20fraud%20perpetrated%20by%20crooks%20exploiting%20the%20older%2C%20less-secure%20technology.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://aitegroup.com/report/emv-lessons-learned-and-us-outlook", "http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/online-fraud-surge-emv-1273.php", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Retailers%20Unprepared%20for%20Credit%20Card%20Security%20Deadline", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150929006599/en/Types-Retail-Merchants-EMV-Ready#.VgwdaflVhBc", "https://squareup.com/emv", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.aciworldwide.com/news-and-events/press-releases/6-out-of-10-us-consumers-with-credit-cards-are-not-ready-for-emv.aspx", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrho3%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Retailers%20Unprepared%20for%20Credit%20Card%20Security%20Deadline"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:02:35.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
