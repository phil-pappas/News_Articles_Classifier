Inflationary indicators continued to fall short of what the Federal Reserve would like to see as it considers raising interest rates in the U.S.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 15, 2015 | 10:35 a.m. EDT + More If an underwhelming jobs report, a widened trade gap and surprisingly soft retail sales data hadn't already sidelined the Fed from moving on interest rates in October, a data release Thursday suggesting the U.S. is again flirting with deflationary territory could give America's central bank even more reason for pause.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics ' consumer price index, which measures the prices paid by consumers for an eclectic basket of goods and services, fell in September for the second consecutive month. The index dipped 0.2 percent month over month and is currently flat over the year.\nThe energy component of the pricing index continued to serve as an anchor to the headline number, falling 4.7 percent last month to land 18.4 percent shy of where it was a year ago. Gasoline, in particular, dropped 9 percent in September and is down 29.6 percent over the year.\nSee Photos\n4 Need-to-Know Excerpts From the Fed's Beige Book \"Oil prices are tricky, because that is a large enough component of price measures that it can have a big effect with just one price change,\" says Tara Sinclair, chief economist at employment hub Indeed. \"And since that's largely a global price, that's why people exclude food and energy prices to get a less volatile, smoother number.\"\nSinclair points to core inflation that strips away notoriously erratic variables like gas and food prices. And this core number, which grew 0.2 percent in September and is currently up 1.9 percent year over year, seems to have firmed up in recent months. The Fed would like to see inflation pick up to 2 percent over the long term, but it's clear oil is the biggest drag on consumer prices at this point.\nNot that consumers are complaining, of course. For workers outside of the petroleum industry, cheap gas isn't necessarily the worst problem to have.\n\"Cheaper gasoline prices have given consumers more discretionary income to spend on clothes, restaurant meals and other things that have kept the U.S. economy humming along in September,\" Dan Wagner, founder and CEO of Powa Technologies, said in a statement this week.\nBut low oil also held back the prices paid by U.S. producers to generate goods and services last month, according to a separate producer price index released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nRELATED\nRetail Sales Fall Short as Holiday Season Looms The overall index dropped 0.5 percent month over month and was down 1.1 percent from September 2014. But the oil component plummeted 5.9 percent last month alone. Excluding energy and food, the Labor Department's alternative measure of inflation was flat over the month.\n\"According to the latest September [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting minutes, many committee members are beginning to lose confidence in the Fed's outlook for inflation to reverse course back to their longer-term objective of 2 percent,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a research note Wednesday. \"Instead, officials warned the need to wait on the sideline for further evidence that inflation was in fact stabilizing and increasing towards the Fed's 2 percent target.\"\nThe Fed cares significantly more about consumer price stability, but persistently low oil prices throw a wrench into the rate hike equation. Core consumer prices are getting close to the Fed's 2 percent objective, but analysts generally agree that there are enough clouds hanging over the economy at this point in time for the FOMC to delay a national interest rate hike beyond its next meeting at the end of October.\nTAGS: economy interest rates inflation", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=September%20Prices%20in%20U.S.%20Still%20Shy%20of%20Fed%27s%20Goal&summary=Most%20consumers%20aren%27t%20complaining%20about%20low%20fuel%20prices%2C%20but%20they%27re%20wreaking%20havoc%20on%20inflationary%20indicators.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=September%20Prices%20in%20U.S.%20Still%20Shy%20of%20Fed%27s%20Goal", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=September%20Prices%20in%20U.S.%20Still%20Shy%20of%20Fed%27s%20Goal", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe81l1%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:37:18.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
