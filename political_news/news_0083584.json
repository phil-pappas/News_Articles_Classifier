The actress interacted with her and even ushered her to an area where they could speak to each other comfortably, away from the crowd.\nThey then posed for pictures, and shared stories. Now isn’t that a sweet gesture by the former Miss World?\n‘Jazbaa’ also stars Irrfan Khan, however the actor is away from the country due to other work commitments, and has been unable to attend the film’s city promotions.
