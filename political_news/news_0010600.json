Share article \nThe notorious photographs of the Labour leader eating a bacon sandwich were blamed on the fact that Mr Miliband was not a \"morning person\" and rejected advice to wait to eat his breakfast. \nThere is also a suggestion that Mr Miliband was the driving force behind the interview with Russell Brand. The comedian initially offered a simple endorsement but Labour wanted to show that Mr Miliband had worked to win him over.
