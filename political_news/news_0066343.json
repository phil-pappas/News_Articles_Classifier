The liberal news media, pretending to care for blacks, kept these intellects locked up in their “news attic” like a they were a crazy aunt, hiding their persuasive and compelling intellectual views. Instead the corrupt US media, bullied and coerced by the Obama administration, promote serial liars like Jessie Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Obama as trumped up leaders of their community.\nNow the internet allows us all to share the remarkable brilliance and celebrate of the black intellectuals as well.\nLiberals Impugn This Powerful Intellectual Minority, Promote Dishonest Blacks Into Leadership\nDue to community prejudice against liberty-focused, self reliant gov’t, and peer pressure to shout for leftist urban policies like Detroit, San Francisco and Chicago have suffered through, these men and women have to undergo oppression and rejection from 90% of their peer group, something no man would do unless they were 100% convinced they were on the right path, and they are:\nThomas Sowell\nWalter Williams\nRev.

Jesse Lee Peterson\nEarl Hall\nIan C. Jordan\nPlease distribute and promote this, so everyone doesn’t get the idea all blacks think exactly like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Charlie Rangel, Elijah Cummings, Sheila Jackson Lee, Corrine Brown and Maxine Waters, all of them supremely self aggrandizing charlatans, willfully ignorant in politics, human behavior, history….and willfully ignorant/aware they are subjugating their peers in a system that history shows consistently produces spite, anger and violence toward freedom loving people. Sean Hannity had a group of black intellectuals tell their stories here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oP6u2NNs-8 . Blacks are a minority that really know how to hate a minority: Their own fellow blacks who chose freedom over subjugation and welfare.\nThe Democrat Agenda: Create America’s Palestinians\nThe Democrats are turning their black voters into the Palestinians of the middle east, pawns in a power game, unwitting subjects in a diabolical plan to promise them care, then encourage them to be the “problem child” of white America as Clinton did with the accused “black church burnings” and now the the lynch mob Zimmerman trial, fomented by DOJ visitors and racial stereotypes that all whites protecting their property with guns are racists. This stirring up of racial division, but then excusing Democrat violence, every time they need to get the public’s attention and secure more votes, is political coercion – a money for cooperation scheme, typical of socialist and communist politicians, the start of corruption. Blacks MUST separate from these malicious leaders at once, history is clear what is about to happen.\nGreek historian Polybius writes:\n“The people have become accustomed to feed at the expense of others, and their prospects of winning a livelihood depend upon the property of their neighbors; then as soon as they find a leader who is sufficiently ambitious and daring . . . they will introduce a regime based on violence.” Democrats are, again, organizing Lynch Mobs as we speak.\nhttp://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2013/07/09/who-is-racist-n1636228/page/full\nhttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/conservative\nhttp://www.tsowell.com/spracecu.html", "external_links": ["http://www.teapartytribune.com/2015/06/01/the-united-states-press-goebbel-esque-subjugated-news/", "http://www.teapartytribune.com//feed/https://www.facebook.com/TheEarlHallShow?fref=ts", "http://www.teapartytribune.com//feed/https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007944904182&#038;fref=ts", "http://www.tsowell.com/spracecu.html", "http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2013/07/09/who-is-racist-n1636228/page/full", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson", "http://www.teapartytribune.com/2015/06/03/democrats-organizing-lynch-mobs-again/", "http://www.blogtalkradio.com/conservative", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oP6u2NNs-8"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:37:28.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
