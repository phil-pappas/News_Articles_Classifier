They need to figure out what they want from that union. Leaving international borders unprotected because you want to allow your people to pass through is okay, but then don't start crying when other people start passing through them, too. They allowed this to happen, and now they have certain countries slamming their borders shut, or cutting down access, and it is creating another enormous humanitarian issue with the weather changing. A little late for those countries to blame this on the refugees, not after they allowed so many to just traipse right through all summer. Europe needs to get on one page here, but the nationalists over there are too scared to lose autonomy. Whatever. It's their mess, and they are smart enough to figure it out. We are also smart enough to figure out how to help by bringing in more families in need. The fact remains: A country can only assimilate a certain number of immigrants in a given amount of time. The numbers facing Europe do amount to an invasion. Here in the US we coped with the millions of the Latin American invasion more or less. But that was a cakewalk compared to what Europe faces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:22:59.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
