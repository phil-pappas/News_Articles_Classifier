The Court declined to make the declarations sought by the plaintiff and instead quashed the Minister’s decision and directed him to reconsider Professor Kelsey’s original request. \nAny suggestion that the Court passed judgement on the merits of the Chief Ombudsman’s decision is incorrect. \nEnds \nNew Zealand Police have arrested a 60-year-old Auckland businessman in relation to the criminal blackmail threat to poison infant formula with 1080, made public in March this year.
