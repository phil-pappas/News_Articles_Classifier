But we have the people, the policies and the momentum to carry us forward to another election success next May.\n“Winning a third term would be historic and unprecedented, making the SNP the first party since devolution to win three successive Holyrood terms in office.\"\nHer opponents said the SNP's record should be a warning against a third term.\nLibDem leader Willie Rennie said: “We have a recruitment crisis in our NHS, we have seen massive cuts to college places and falling literacy levels in our schools. Scotland can't afford another five years of the SNP.\"\nTory MSP Alex Johnstone added: \"The SNP clearly sees itself as being in a strong position, but it had that arrogance ahead of the referendum too.\nShare article \"And with both Labour and the Lib Dems a busted flush, the only pro UK option for voters is the Scottish Conservatives.\"\nLabour said the country needed \"a strong team of Labour MSPs so the SNP don't have it all their own way\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:59:34.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
