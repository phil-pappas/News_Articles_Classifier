Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., was approved unanimously by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and next goes before the full Senate.\nLawmakers say the bill solves a problem experienced by pharmaceutical companies that are granted a period, usually ranging from three to 15 years, during which they're allowed to sell their products without competition from generics. The period of exclusivity starts when the Food and Drug Administration approves a drug, even though the company can't start marketing it until the Drug Enforcement Administration gives the green light.\nThat means some drugmakers must wait to market their drug, sometimes for months, even though the clock has started ticking on their period of exclusivity. Last year, drugmaker Eisai sued the FDA after having to wait a full year before it received DEA approval.\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace â€¢ 09/30/15 7:01 PM The Hatch-Whitehouse bill would start the exclusivity clock when the DEA gives the go-head, instead of when the FDA approves it.\n\"It was with some discouragement that I came to Washington and have repeatedly seen difficulties with DEA in its administrative world, and I'm very glad the new DEA administrator appears to be paying attention to this,\" Whitehouse said at the hearing.\nThe House passed a version of the legislation in the spring, but it could run into some opposition as lawmakers face the problem of increasingly high drug costs. Some policymakers have proposed reducing exclusivity periods as a way of introducing more competition and lowering prices.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:19:05.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
