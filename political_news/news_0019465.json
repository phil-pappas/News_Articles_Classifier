But that victory has faded in the face of new obstacles. \nAt a crowded forum Wednesday evening at the Burlingame Recreation Center, the most common concern was how the authority's new approach -- a \"blended\" system in which Caltrain and high-speed rail share ground-level tracks -- will affect automobile traffic at the many intersections on the Peninsula where surface streets cross the rails. \nSeveral citizens told Ben Tripousis, the authority's regional director, they are concerned that increased traffic on the 51-mile rail corridor will cause nightmarish backups at intersections with grade separations, that is, automobile tunnels or overpasses. \nThe authority projects there will be as many as 20 bullet and commuter trains per hour once the system is fully operational by 2029. Caltrain anticipates that more frequent service will lead to \"significant and unavoidable\" effects on automobile congestion at some intersections. \nTripousis said a new automated system for coordinating the movement of trains will alleviate backups, as will Caltrain's plan to electrify the rail corridor. Caltrain's new electric trains will stop and start faster than the current diesel trains, shortening the intervals when crossing arms are down. \nThe authority will work with local communities to identify key intersections for grade separations, added Tripousis, pledging to work with cities to find \"bottom-up solutions.\" Advertisement \n\"Burlingame is not San Carlos is not San Mateo is not Redwood City. We want to ensure that we're addressing it in a meaningful, local way,\" said Tripousis. \"We're trying to ensure that connectivity is an important piece of what we're doing.\" \nMore than 100 people attended Wednesday's meeting for an update on the authority's plans for the Peninsula. The agency aims to finish the environmental review of the regional corridor by 2017. Tripousis said the authority could begin making improvements to the rail segment as early as 2018 or 2019, around the time Caltrain is working on its more than $1.5 billion electrification plan. The authority will pick up almost half that cost. \nThe authority is now beginning construction in the Central Valley on the first phase of the high-speed line running from San Francisco to Los Angeles and Anaheim. The second phase of construction, expected to wrap up by 2029, will extend the system to Sacramento and San Diego. \nMost of the people who spoke at Wednesday's forum were skeptical of high-speed rail. One lambasted the notion that trips from San Francisco to Los Angeles will take just two hours and 40 minutes, accusing the agency of \"phony math.\" Another complained about the prospect of train hours blasting more frequently along the tracks. \nBut some attendees supported the plan. Burlingame resident Marc Nevarez, 69, said that with freeway congestion worsening on the Peninsula, alternative forms of transportation are vital. \n\"You've got to be able to move from one place to another,\" said Nevarez, a San Mateo County native. \"Our kids and grandkids won't be able to move.\" Contact Aaron Kinney at 650-348-4357.
