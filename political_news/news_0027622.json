(AP) â€” Former Spokane Police Chief Frank Straub has filed a $4 million claim against the city, contending that due process was violated in his termination.\nStraub was forced to resign last month following complaints about his leadership style.\nHis sudden ouster as chief followed months of rumors about his explosive behavior with subordinates.\nIn his claim, Straub denies that he resigned. The demand letter from his attorney says he was fired.\nMayor David Condon on Thursday evening called the claim \"unfortunate\" and repeated that Straub resigned as chief.\nThe claim is a precursor to a lawsuit.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:06:05.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
