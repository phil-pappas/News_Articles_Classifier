Asa Hutchinson says he's not considering delaying upcoming executions in his state after those in neighboring Oklahoma were halted due to its prison system receiving the wrong lethal injection drug. \nHutchinson told reporters Friday he doesn't have any second thoughts about signing a new state law earlier this year that allows Arkansas to keep the source of its lethal injection laws secret. An attorney for eight death row inmates scheduled to be put to death beginning later this month is challenging the law and has asked a judge to halt the executions. \nThe Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday agreed to halt that state's pending executions after the state received the wrong drug for an execution earlier this week. Oklahoma has a secrecy law similar to Arkansas'. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
