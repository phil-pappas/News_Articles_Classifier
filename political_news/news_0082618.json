I spoke to people who had jobs back home, they had a house back home, they had a good life back home until the civil war broke out, until conflict broke out.\n\"The common theme from all of them was that they weren't asking for much. All they wanted was a home and they wanted some safety.\n\"It wasn't luxury, it wasn't mansions, it wasn't to live off the state. They wanted to work.\"\nOne conversation with a tailor from Aleppo in Syria reminded him of his own tailor grandfather's journey to the UK from Pakistan.\nHe said: \"I said to him that I hope that wherever he ends up in Europe he has the same luck that my grandfather had.\"\nMr Yousaf praised the \"heroic\" efforts of the humanitarian agencies on the ground but said refugees are met with little assistance or co-ordination, and face a 50km (31-mile) walk in sweltering heat to the capital Mytilene, and then a ferry onwards to Athens.\nShare article He said: \"I wouldn't put the blame on the Greek government. I would say that governments across Europe have single-handedly failed the refugees who arrive on the shore of the island of Lesbos.\"\nThe Scottish Government is providing Â£300,000 for humanitarian aid for those arriving in Europe and has pledged to accept at least 2,000 refugees.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-05T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:09:42.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
