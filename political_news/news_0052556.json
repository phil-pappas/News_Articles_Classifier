IDSC is the Egyptian cabinet's official think tank.\nThe group, which says it is not a Muslim Brotherhood group, said that it was defending the rights of the people who were killed in the dispersal of the Rabaa and Nahda Square sit-ins.\nThe group of hackers left anoother messages on both websites before they were pulled by the government.\n\"Where are the rights of those who were killed in Sinai or the rights of the police officers that were killed in explosions; where are the rights of those who died in 25 January or those who died in Rabaa or at the Presidential Palace clashes of 2013? Why do you insist on dividing us when we should be one hand!?\" said the hackers that signed the message as Egyptian citizens who were not Muslim Brotherhood members or President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi supporters.\nThe pro-Morsi Rabaa and Nahda sit-ins, which ended in a bloody dispersal by security forces, took place a month after the ouster of the Islamist president in July 2013.\nAccording to the National Council for Human Rights, a total of 632 people were killed during the dispersal, including eight police officers. The dispersal also left 1,492 injured and saw 800 people arrested, according to the report.\nIn 2013, the Egyptian government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a \"terrorist organisation.\"\nThe official cabinet website: http://www.cabinet.gov.eg and the IDSC official website: http://www.idsc.gov.eg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:41:06.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
