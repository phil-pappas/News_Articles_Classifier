RD Legal Funding, LLC (\"RD Legal\") is well aware of the delay responders with Zadroga awards are dealing with and is ready to offer a larger portion of their award upfront in a matter of days .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272766LOGO\nCurrently, a responder with a Zadroga award will receive a small amount upfront with the rest delayed until late 2016 or 2017. Roni Dersovitz , Founder of RD Legal, says \"The current structure of the compensation fund does not help alleviate the pressures some 9/11 First Responders are dealing with. Years of medical bills and living expenses add up, and many of the responders may need more than what they will initially receive from the VCF.\"\nRecently, the plight of the 9/11 First Responders has been in the news headlines. The 14 th anniversary of September 11 th just passed and the fight to extend the James Zadroga Act is gaining more attention. Many advocates and legislators for the responder community are fighting to get the act extended, using the media to relay their message, lobbying Congress, and enlisting celebrities to their cause.\nWhile these efforts continue, the financial challenges these heroes continue to face on a daily basis can be daunting. RD Legal is positioned to help them through their Zadroga funding program. Mr. Dersovitz says \"RD Legal has been involved with various organizations and advocacy groups associated with the 9/11 First Responders community since 2011. We will continue to offer our support and offer our financial solutions to members of the community if or when it is needed.\"\nIf you are a 9/11 First Responder with a Zadroga award, contact RD Legal and ask about their Zadroga funding program. Since 2011, RD Legal has provided funding to First Responders based on their compensation awards. For more information, please call 800-565-5177.
