Global sales from August 2015 were 3.0 percent lower than the August 2014 total of $28.6 billion . Regionally, sales in the Americas increased slightly compared to last month, but were down somewhat compared to August 2014 . All monthly sales numbers are compiled by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization and represent a three-month moving average.\n\"The global semiconductor market has endured a slight softening of demand in recent months, which has combined with currency devaluation and regular market cyclicality to slow sales somewhat,\" said John Neuffer , president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association. \"Despite recent market sluggishness, the global industry has posted higher cumulative sales through August this year than it did through the same point last year, which was a record year for semiconductor revenues.\"\nRegionally, year-to-year sales increased in China (4.4 percent), but decreased in the Americas (-3.5 percent), Europe (-12.4 percent), Japan (-13.0 percent), and Asia Pacific /All Other (-2.3 percent). The sharp decreases in Europe and Japan are due in part to currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. On a month-to-month basis, sales increased in Japan (1.3 percent) and the Americas (1.1 percent), but fell in China (-0.3 percent), Europe (-0.6 percent), and Asia Pacific /All Other (-2.1 percent).\nTo find out how to purchase the WSTS Subscription Package, which includes comprehensive monthly semiconductor sales data and detailed WSTS Forecasts, please visit http://www.semiconductors.org/industry_statistics/wsts_subscription_package/ .\nAugust 2015\nBillions\nMonth-to-Month Sales\nMarket\nLast Month\nCurrent Month\n% Change\nAmericas\n5.51\n5.58\n1.1%\nEurope\n2.83\n2.82\n-0.6%\nJapan\n2.63\n2.67\n1.3%\nChina\n8.17\n8.14\n-0.3%\nAsia Pacific/All Other\n8.71\n8.52\n-2.1%\nTotal\n27.86\n27.73\n-0.5%\nYear-to-Year Sales\nMarket\nLast Year\nCurrent Month\n% Change\nAmericas\n5.78\n5.58\n-3.5%\nEurope\n3.22\n2.82\n-12.4%\nJapan\n3.07\n2.67\n-13.0%\nChina\n7.80\n8.14\n4.4%\nAsia Pacific/All Other\n8.73\n8.52\n-2.3%\nTotal\n28.59\n27.73\n-3.0%\nThree-Month-Moving Average Sales\nMarket\nMar/Apr/May\nJun/Jul/Aug\n% Change\nAmericas\n5.62\n5.58\n-0.8%\nEurope\n2.87\n2.82\n-2.0%\nJapan\n2.54\n2.67\n5.2%\nChina\n8.08\n8.14\n0.8%\nAsia Pacific/All Other\n9.00\n8.52\n-5.2%\nTotal\n28.11\n27.73\n-1.3%\nMedia Contact\nDan Rosso\nSemiconductor Industry Association\n202-446-1719\ndrosso@semiconductors.org\nAbout SIA\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) is the voice of the U.S. semiconductor industry, one of America's top export industries and a key driver of America's economic strength, national security, and global competitiveness. Semiconductors – microchips that control all modern electronics – enable the systems and products we use to work, communicate, travel, entertain, harness energy, treat illness, and make new scientific discoveries. The semiconductor industry directly employs nearly a quarter of a million people in the U.S. In 2014, U.S. semiconductor company sales totaled $173 billion , and semiconductors make the global trillion dollar electronics industry possible. SIA seeks to strengthen U.S. leadership of semiconductor manufacturing, design, and research by working with Congress, the Administration and other key industry stakeholders to encourage policies and regulations that fuel innovation, propel business and drive international competition.
