Jim Gilmore plowed $43,000 of his own money into his nearly nonexistent presidential bid, just under half of his total haul for the three-month period that ended Oct. 1, according to a new campaign-finance report. Twenty-nine other donors combined to help Gilmore raise $106,000 — a substantially lower sum than even other bottom-tier candidates were expected to announce.\nHis campaign spent $71,000 — the bulk of which, $40,000, went toward the South Carolina filing fee — leaving him with about $34,000 on hand heading into the final quarter of 2015. His only other significant expenses include $5,000 for a state director in New Hampshire — Richard Lowrance — and $5,000 to Marcus Consulting, whose principal Boyd Marcus also worked on the campaign of Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a defection that infuriated Republicans at the time.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:50:59.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
