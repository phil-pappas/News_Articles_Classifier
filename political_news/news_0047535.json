But during Tuesday's debate, Sanders said \"all the shouting in the world\" won't keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. \nThe Vermont senator voted for a 2005 measure to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. Clinton opposed that bill in the Senate. \nGuns have emerged as a dividing line between the two leading Democratic presidential candidates.
