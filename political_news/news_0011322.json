Automotive window films, also known as window tints, offer a number of benefits including reduced fading and cracking of upholstery, better air conditioning efficiency, less glare and improved safety. In an accident, window film may help hold shattered window glass in place rather than projecting small glass particles into the car, potentially inflicting lacerations and eye injuries.\n\"While it's understood that taking sun safety precautions is important outside, such as applying sunscreen, many people don't realize the potential damage UV rays can cause to the skin while inside a car,\" said Darrell Smith , Executive Director of the International Window Film Association. \"Professionally installed window films offer significant skin protection by blocking as much as 99 percent of the sun's harmful UV rays that shine through car, home or office windows.\"\nResearch shows nearly 53 percent of skin cancers occur on the left, or drivers' side, of the body. Having window film installed on car windows offers protection from the sun and also creates a more comfortable driving environment by helping to deflect heat from entering a vehicle through unprotected glass.\nThe IWFA recommends consumers review the organization's law chart that provides information on the level of shading that is permitted in many jurisdictions. Most laws on vehicle window tinting are concerned with the levels of \"light transmittance\" and \"luminous reflectance\" the safety glass allows. In other words, states regulate how much light penetrates the glass and how much visibility the glass allows. If the windows on a vehicle are darkened to such a degree that light transmittance is below what is allowed, then the owner may be issued a citation.\nAbout the International Window Film Association\nThe International Window Film Association ( IWFA ) is a nonprofit organization of window film dealers, distributors and manufacturers that facilitates the growth of the industry by providing research, influencing policy and promoting consumer awareness of the many benefits of window film .
