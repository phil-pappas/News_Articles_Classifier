Why Do the Troops Have to Stay? \nThe decision comes as the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate, highlighted by the Taliban’s takeover of the city of Kunduz last month. Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani is more receptive to keeping U.S. troops in Afghanistan than former President Hamid Karzai . \nThe United Nations says the Taliban are now in more parts of Afghanistan than any time since their ouster. \nISIS has also gathered steam and recruits in the country, and al Qaeda elements still find safe haven in the Afghan mountains. \nThe decision came after a months-long comprehensive review that began in the spring and included conversations among Obama, Afghan President Ghani and Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah. \nSenior administration officials said the United States will continue to maintain two non-combat missions in Afghanistan — a counter-terrorism mission to “go after Al Qaeda, deal with terrorist threats,” and a training, advising and assisting mission for Afghan forces. Those are the same missions U.S. troops are carrying out today. How Many Will Remain in Afghanistan? \nObama said the United States will keep its 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of 2016, until the drawdown begins. \nBy the end of 2016, that number will decrease to 5,500 troops, but officials would not provide a timeframe for that decrease, saying it would be a decision that will come in consultation with commanders on the ground and allies. \nThe 5,500 troops will be stationed in Jalalabad, Kandahar, Kabul and Bagram. How Does This Differ From the Original Plan? \nToday’s announcement marks a stark contrast to the government’s former plan. \nOfficials had said that they planned to keep only about 1,000 troops on the ground by the end of 2016, with their main task being embassy security and working in a new security cooperation office. How Much Will This Cost? \nSeveral factors were considered as the president’s advisers crafted a plan, including cost implications and an analysis of risks to both the missions and the force. The officials said the president deeply wanted to ensure that forces would be adequately protected. \nThe cost estimate for this new plan is $14.6 billion for 2017, compared to the $10 billion originally planned for the Kabul-centric presence. \nPolitics Government", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:25:52.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
