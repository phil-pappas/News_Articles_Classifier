Cont'd", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "David just addressed the question at length. A reader’s view:\nCarly’s bump in numbers was manufactured by the media. As soon as she was given all the softball questions in the first debate, it was clear that there was a lot of people in the media or establishment that wanted her to be a candidate. Maybe it’s because they wanted to draw women to the Republican Party by saying “We're not sexist; we have a woman running!” Or maybe it’s simply a desire for ratings by trying to find a woman to fight with Trump on social media, but it's pretty clear she was never going to win. \nShe hasn’t held elected office, her stint at HP didn’t produce anything to cheer for, and she doesn’t have the anger of Trump or the crazy of Carson needed to draw strong support from the Republican base. There’s just not much substance there. \nHow another reader puts it: “Failed business leader = No Chance.” Another: “ If Carly Fiorina wants to end Planned Parenthood she should just become its CEO.” Oh snap. Another reader finds that Fiorina is “failing for three reasons”:\nFirst, she doesn’t understand how to play the media game. In a field with 14 other candidates, you need to be constantly in the news in order to stand out. Trump figured this out long before anyone else. Carson figured it out too. Say something offensive or controversial and you’re guaranteed to get media coverage. And best of all, it’s free. What has Carly Fiorina done to keep herself in the news? The controversy over Planned Parenthood has passed, so she can’t keep talking about that.\nSecond, Fiorina has no signature issue. When you think of immigration, you think of Trump. She tried to make abortion her signature issue, but Republican voters aren’t that excited to talk about abortion. [CB note: That claim is questionable, as least according to a Gallup poll from May concluding that “ Abortion Edges Up as Important Voting Issue for Americans,” especially among pro-lifers: “abortion more important to pro-life vote than pro-choice.” And then there’s a CNN poll from September 14 —two days before the most recent debate and in the heat of the Planned Parenthood controversy—concluding that “the share [of voters] calling abortion an extremely important issue is up 7 points to 27%.”]\nThird, Fiorina is the least “outsiderish” of the outsiders. Half of Republicans want an outsider. While that’s a huge percentage, it doesn’t appear to be growing. That means Carly is really only competing against Trump and Carson. But Fiorina is really an establishment figure trying to market herself as an outsider.\nClearly, she does well in debates. She may score another bump in the polls after next week’s debate, but you can’t win a nomination just on debate performances. What the Fiorina camp needs to figure out is who she can steal votes from. It’s obviously not Trump or Carson. Maybe she should go after Bush and show voters that she has a bigger pair than he does.\nAnother reader recommends:\nCarly needs to stop attacking Trump. It is not a winning strategy. She still has a realistic shot, but with Carson and Trump doing so well, it is going to be an uphill battle. I don’t think she should shuffle right. The GOP establishment candidates will be Cruz and Rubio. Rubio will get the fiscal conservatives and Cruz the social conservatives. There is no room for Fiorina on the right. \nIt’s a pretty incredible sign of the times when Cruz is considered an establishment candidate.\nMore Notes From The Atlantic A Military Officer Dissents on Jim Webb, and a Bernie San...

Sanders: \n\r \r \r If you are a low-income person, it is, depending upon where you live, very difficult to find normal banking. Banks don’t want you. And what people are forced to do is go to payday lenders who charge outrageously high interest rates. You go to check-cashing places, which rip you off. And, yes, I think that the postal service, in fact, can play an important role in providing modest types of banking service to folks who need it. \n\r \r \r Continue Reading Alfaguarilla / Shutterstock The Sexism of School Dress Codes Li Zhou These policies can perpetuate discrimination against female students, as well as LGBT students.\nMaggie Sunseri was a middle-school student in Versailles, Kentucky, when she first noticed a major difference in the way her school’s dress code treated males and females. Girls were disciplined disproportionately, she says, a trend she’s seen continue over the years. At first Sunseri simply found this disparity unfair, but upon realizing administrators’ troubling rationale behind the dress code—that certain articles of girls’ attire should be prohibited because they “distract” boys—she decided to take action.\n\r \r “I’ve never seen a boy called out for his attire even though they also break the rules,” says Sunseri, who last summer produced S hame: A Documentary on School Dress Code , a film featuring interviews with dozens of her classmates and her school principal, that explores the negative impact biased rules can have on girls’ confidence and sense of self. The documentary now has tens of thousands of YouTube views, while a post about the dress-code policy at her high school—Woodford County High—has been circulated more than 45,000 times on the Internet.\n\r \r Continue Reading Disney / Lucasfilm How Original Can The Force Awakens Be? Spencer Kornhaber and David Sims A discussion about the new Star Wars trailer’s throwback imagery, its seemingly chaotic worldview, and the surprising neo-conservative approval for the Galactic Empire\nOn Monday the new trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens dropped, and predictably, the Internet freaked out. There was a mad rush to buy tickets ; wild fan theories emerged on just what might be up with the conspicuously absent Luke Skywalker ; and perhaps more surprisingly, Bill Kristol offered a neo-conservative defense of the Galactic Empire . Fevers are running high as the film’s December 18 U.S. release date draws ever-closer, but there’s still so much we don’t know. Including this question: How original can the movie actually be? \n\r \r David Sims: Spencer, in your analysis of the trailer , you hit on the intense waves of nostalgia coming off The Force Awakens already . The chief villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), literally worships Death Vader’s melted helmet. Han Solo talks about the days of Jedi fighting the Dark Side like it’s ancient mythology. There’s all this chatter about the Death Star-like base glimpsed on the poster capable of blowing up whole solar systems. You’ve worried in the past that things look almost too familiar . But maybe that’s the meta-point J.J. Abrams is trying to make. Here’s a franchise inexorably scarred by George Lucas’s underwhelming prequel trilogy, ravaged by overuse of CGI, wooden acting, and those gosh-darn midi-chlorians. So might the only recipe for success be a return to that old-time religion? \n\r Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What Happened to Carly Fiorina? David A. Graham After she took the Republican field by storm in September, two polls show her slipping back into the second tier of candidates.\nRemember Carly Fiorina? It now seems forever ago, but in late September she was being heralded as the next big thing in the Republican primary field—the outsider candidate who could marshall establishment support, and finally slay the Trump dragon.\n\r \r Now look at the polls. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll Monday has her at 7 percent, running behind the much-maligned Jeb Bush. That’s down from 11 in late September . A CNN poll released Tuesday is even bleaker . She comes in fourth—tied with also-ran Chris Christie and behind Rand Paul, who’s on campaign deathwatch. That’s even worse than it seems, because in mid-September she was at 15 percent in the same poll, good for second place.\n\r \r \r Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters The Anti-Free-Speech Movement at UCLA Conor Friedersdorf Administrators and student activists at the university are attacking core First Amendment rights in a bid to punish expression that offends them.\nA half-century ago, student activists at the University of California clashed with administrators during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, a series of events that would greatly expand free-speech rights of people at public colleges and universities.\n\r \r Today, activists at UCLA are demanding that administrators punish some of their fellow students for expressive behavior that is clearly protected by the First Amendment.\n\r \r In the past, free-speech clashes have turned on whether Americans have the right to criticize their own government during wartime, to march as neo-Nazis past the homes of Holocaust survivors, to submerge a crucifix in urine, or to burn the United States flag. \n\r \r All of those things, the courts have ruled, are protected speech.\n\r \r Continue Reading Patrick Kovarik / AFP / Getty Images The Dos and Don’ts of Cultural Appropriation Jenni Avins Borrowing from other cultures isn’t just inevitable, it’s potentially positive.\nSometime during the early 2000s, big, gold, “door-knocker” hoop earrings started to appeal to me, after I’d admired them on girls at school. It didn’t faze me that most of the girls who wore these earrings at my high school in St. Louis were black, unlike me. And while it certainly may have occurred to me that I—a semi-preppy dresser—couldn’t pull them off, it never occurred to me that I shouldn’t .\n\r \r \r This was before the term “cultural appropriation” jumped from academia into the realm of Internet outrage and oversensitivity. Self-appointed guardians of culture have proclaimed that Miley Cyrus shouldn’t twerk , white girls shouldn’t wear cornrows , and Selena Gomez should take off that bindi . Personally, I could happily live without ever seeing Cyrus twerk again, but I still find many of these accusations alarming.\n\r \r Continue Reading Jeff Christensen / Reuters Trump Is Right About 9/11 Peter Beinart George W. Bush didn’t do all he could to prevent the attack—and it’s time Republicans confronted that fact.\nDonald Trump utters plenty of ugly untruths: that undocumented Mexican immigrants are “ rapists ,” that Syrian refugees are committing “ all sorts of attacks ” in Germany and represent a “Trojan Horse” for ISIS. But he tells ugly truths too: that “ when you give [politicians money], they do whatever the hell you want them to do .” And that “ the Middle East would be safer ” if Saddam Hussein and Muammer Qaddafi were still in power.\n\r \r His latest ugly truth came during a Bloomberg TV interview last Friday, when he said George W. Bush deserves responsibility for the fact that “the World Trade Center came down during his time.” Politicians and journalists erupted in indignation. Jeb Bush called Trump’s comments “pathetic.” Ben Carson dubbed them “ridiculous.”\n\r \r Continue Reading Christopher Griffith The Planet-Saving, Capitalism-Subverting, Surprisingly Lucrative Investment Secrets of Al Gore James Fallows The former vice president has led his firm to financial success. But what he really wants to do is create a whole new version of capitalism. \n“When i left the White House in 2001, I really didn’t know what I was going to do with my life,” Al Gore told me this summer, at his office in the Green Hills district of Nashville. “I’d had a plan”—this with a seemingly genuine chuckle rather than any sign of a grimace—“but … that changed!” After the “change,” via the drawn-out 2000 presidential election in which he won the vote of the populace but not that of the Supreme Court, for the first time in his adult life Gore found himself without an obvious next step. He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.\n\r \r Continue Reading Jessica Rinaldi / Reuters How Doctors Take Women's Pain Less Seriously Joe Fassler When my wife was struck by mysterious, debilitating symptoms, our trip to the ER revealed the sexism inherent in emergency treatment.\nEarly on a Wednesday morning, I heard an anguished cry—then silence.\n\r \r I rushed into the bedroom and watched my wife, Rachel, stumble from the bathroom, doubled over, hugging herself in pain.\n\r \r “Something’s wrong,” she gasped.\n\r \r This scared me. Rachel’s not the type to sound the alarm over every pinch or twinge. She cut her finger badly once, when we lived in Iowa City, and joked all the way to Mercy Hospital as the rag wrapped around the wound reddened with her blood. Once, hobbled by a training injury in the days before a marathon, she limped across the finish line anyway.\n\r \r So when I saw Rachel collapse on our bed, her hands grasping and ungrasping like an infant’s, I called the ambulance. I gave the dispatcher our address, then helped my wife to the bathroom to vomit.\n\r \r Continue Reading Stephanie Keith / Reuters The NYPD Is Using Mobile X-Ray Vans to Spy on Unknown Targets Conor Friedersdorf New York City won’t reveal how often cops bombard places, vehicles, or people with radiation—or if there are health risks for residents.\nDystopian truth is stranger than dystopian fiction.\n\r \r In New York City, the police now maintain an unknown number of military-grade vans outfitted with X-ray radiation, enabling cops to look through the walls of buildings or the sides of trucks. The technology was used in Afghanistan before being loosed on U.S. streets. Each X-ray van costs an estimated $729,000 to $825,000.\n\r \r The NYPD will not reveal when, where, or how often they are used.\n\r \r “ I will not talk about anything at all about this,” New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told a journalist for the New York Post who pressed for details on the vans. “It falls into the range of security and counter-terrorism activity that we engage in.” \n\r \r He added that “they’re not used to scan people for weapons.” \n\r \r Continue Reading Latest Notes A Military Officer Dissents on Jim Webb, and a Bernie Sanders Supporter Backs Him Not a Single Care in the World Quoted Who Owns the Copyright on 1921?
