He won that position last year, defeating two Tea Party favorites, Representatives Louie Gohmert and Mick Mulvaney.\nThe RSC has over 170 members in the House, which is more than two-thirds of the Republican membership.\nFellow lawmakers say Ryan, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and a former vice presidential candidate, is considering a run for speaker during the current weeklong congressional recess. Ryan has said repeatedly he is not seeking the speaker's job, but many lawmakers and even 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney have urged him to run.\nMcCarthy pulled out of the speaker's race last week after facing skepticism from conservative lawmakers who viewed him as too willing to compromise with President Barack Obama.\nBoehner, who fought a series of battles with Republican conservatives for much of his speakership, had planned to retire Oct. 30, but said last week he will stay until a new speaker is elected.\nNew federal rules don't hit...
