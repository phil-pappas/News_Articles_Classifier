Benett/amfAR15/Getty Images\nAs Olivier Rousteing's Balmain Army gets primed for tomorrow's Balmain x H&M launch event, it sounds like attendees should be preparing for battle themselves. A dance battle, that is. The Cut can exclusively reveal that tomorrow night's event will involve Paris Is Burning– style dance-offs on a custom-built staircase that will be part of the two-level runway. Kendall Jenner and Jourdan Dunn will be among the models in the lineup (after all, they did help the designer debut his collection at the Billboard Music Awards).\nEven if you didn't score an invite, you'll be able to see the action. H&M will livetweet, Periscope, and Snapchat the event — however, only invitees will be able to pre-shop the collection prior to its November 5 launch (preview our picks here ). And, as with previous H&M collaboration events, expect a blockbuster musical guest. According to our source, Rousteing is feeling nostalgia this time around. Interpret that as you will!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:21:02.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
