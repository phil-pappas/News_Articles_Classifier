On the whole, we’re hoping the report will help the issues surrounding legitimacy of future elections, certainty of electoral processes and enhancement of voter perception,” said Mr Gumbo. \nThe tabling of the report could come at the worst time for IEBC which has just about two years to the next General Election in August 2017. \nBut some PAC insiders who did not want to be named discussing a parliamentary report before it is tabled in the House disclosed that those mentioned adversely in the report are IEBC chairman Issack Hassan and former CEO James Oswago. The report has also mentioned a number of directors and managers who should also be investigated. \nMr Hassan is accused of flouting procurement procedures in hiring lawyers who represented the commission during the presidential election petition before the Supreme Court as well as for the other petitions after the 2013 General Election. \nThe presidential election petition was filed by Cord leader Raila Odinga in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the election of Jubilee’s Uhuru Kenyatta. \n“The committee was concerned that the chairman bypassed the secretariat, whose task would have been to get the lawyers for the commission and went ahead to hire them at the commission’s cost. This is against the law,” a PAC insider who disclosed the highlights of the report to the Sunday Nation said. \nIn the presidential election petition, Mr Hassan, who had been listed as a respondent since he was presidential election returning officer, was represented by lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi and Kamau Karori. \nOther lawyers who had been hired to either defend the commission or the chairman from the allegations raised by Cord leader Raila were Lucy Kambuni, Mohammed Nyaoga, Paul Nyamodi, Eric Gumbo, Nani Mungai, Hillary Sigei, Mahat Somane and Kimani Muhoro. \nMr Abdullahi and Mr Karori also held brief for IEBC in the case by Jubilee supporters Moses Kuria, Dennis Itumbi and Florence Sergon, who wanted the court to declare that rejected ballots should not be used to compute the final tally for each candidate. \nAt the end of the petition, the lawyers billed the commission more than Sh350 million. \nAccording to the judiciary, there were 188 election cases filed after the March 4, 2013 General Election. These were handled by more than 90 judges and magistrates across the country. \nMr Oswago is also being blamed for failing to follow the right procurement procedures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:09:20.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
