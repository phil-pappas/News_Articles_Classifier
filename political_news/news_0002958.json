For example, he said Monday, his father gave him a \"small loan of a million dollars\" that he had to repay with interest at the start of his career. 7,391 Re: Trump: My dad gave me a 'small loan' of a million dollars It's a stupid thing to say in a political campaign, but how can you really blame him? In reality it is a small loan to him. I'd be sweating bullets taking out a million dollar loan on anything, but that's just how it is. I also have relatives that think I'm obscenely rich because my house is worth about $220,000, which seems silly to me. But when you live in an old trailer, that's the way you are looking at it. I doubt anyone that was ever gonna vote for trump is going to change their mind because he's out of touch. Hell, that's practically why they are voting for him. Because he's very successful in the business world.
