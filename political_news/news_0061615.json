The nonproliferation deal was officially adopted Sunday after a brutal congressional review earlier this year that saw Democrats narrowly push forward the agreement over the strong objections of Republicans.\nAt the private reception, attended by White House Chief of Staff Â, Pelosi thanked the House Democrats who led the whip operation on the Iran deal, including Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, North Carolina Rep. David Price and Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky.\nMany Democrats were subject to an intense lobbying effort from pro-Israel groups to oppose the deal, a fact McDonough acknowledged in his remarks. McDonough said “science” and “the national interest” triumphed in the battle over the deal.\nPelosi, who took to carrying around a three-ring binder of statements from lawmakers in support of the deal, was praised by fellow Democrats for her work on the issue.\n\"Without each and everyone one of you this would not have happened,” Pelosi responded.\nFormer ambassador Thomas Pickering, along with Reps. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, Peter Welch of Vermont, Debbie Dingell of Michigan, Jerry Nadler of New York and another two dozen lawmakers attended the event.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:53:32.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
