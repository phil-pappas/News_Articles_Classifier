These include: the Alpha-1 Foundation , GBS/CIDP Foundation International , Hemophilia Federation of America , the Immune Deficiency Foundation , the International Patient Organisation for Primary Immunodeficiencies , the Jeffery Modell Foundation , the National Hemophilia Foundation , and the Platelet Disorder Support Association .\nPlasma protein therapies , which include plasma-derived therapies and recombinant analogs, are used to treat chronic, life-threatening diseases including bleeding disorders, primary immune deficiencies, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and certain rare neurological disorders. In addition, these therapies are used in emergency and surgical medicine.\n\"All of the member organizations of the American Plasma Users Coalition (A-PLUS) greatly appreciate PPTA making the public aware of the importance of the collection of plasma from the tens of thousands of voluntary donors and the manufacturers of plasma therapies which provide lifesaving treatments for our patients,\" said A-PLUS spokesperson, Larry LaMotte .\n\"We are delighted to have the support of so many patient organizations. Their participation is key in helping us achieve our goal 'to increase understanding about lifesaving plasma protein therapies and rare diseases.' By sharing their personal experiences, patients are able to convey the impact of living with a rare disease in a meaningful way. Their stories inspire us all every day,\" said Joshua Penrod , PPTA, Vice President, Source & International Affairs.\nPlasma, a biological material derived from humans, is used to create lifesaving therapies. There are more than 500 plasma collection facilities in Canada , Austria , the Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary , and the U.S. In addition to meeting regulatory requirements, the majority of these centers have achieved International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) certification. PPTA's voluntary standards program provides global leadership for the industry's goal of continuous improvement with a focus on safety and quality from the donor to the patient.\nAbout PPTA\nThe Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA), a global industry trade association, represents the private sector manufacturers of plasma-derived and recombinant analog therapies, collectively known as plasma protein therapies and the collectors of source plasma used for fractionation. These therapies are used by millions of people worldwide to treat a variety of diseases and serious medical conditions . PPTA also administers standards and programs that help ensure the quality and safety of plasma protein therapies, donors and patients.\nAbout the American Plasma Users Coalition (A-PLUS)\nA-PLUS is a coalition of U.S. national patient organizations created to address the unique needs of patients with rare diseases that use life-saving plasma protein therapies. The coalition represents more than 125,000 Americans living with chronic disorders who depend upon plasma protein therapies to lead healthy, productive lives.
