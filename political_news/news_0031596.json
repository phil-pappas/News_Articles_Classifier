(Picture Courtesy: Facebook) Remember just how boring those safety demonstration procedures can be before the flight takes off? We bet most of you just yawn through the whole routine without paying any special attention. But the flight attendant featured in this video will make sure that you not only pay close attention but also laugh your heart out during the drill.\nThe video shows him presenting the safety manual with a flourish in the beginning. After that he goes on to demonstrate how a seatbelt works and goes on to point towards the various emergency exit doors in the most hilarious way.\nHe mimes and gives a performance similar to a burlesque act throughout the entire session even when he has to teach the passengers how to use their oxygen masks. Not surprisingly, several passengers are heard chuckling in the background. This is definitely one safety demonstration that no one would ever want to miss!\nClick on the link below to watch the video:\nThere's no way you could miss this safety demonstration\nIs this the most entertaining flight attendant ever?\nPosted by Daily Mail on Wednesday, 12 August 2015 Tags: funny safety demonstration funny flight attendant crazy safety flight demonstration hilarious safety demonstration Also Read Amit Mishra wasnâ€™t in the room during alleged assault: reports Won't allow celebration of Godse's death anniversary in Mumbai: Congress Nitin Gadkari to lay foundation stone of 4-laning of NH-202 in Telangana Aditya Chopra begins prep for 'Befikre' in Paris", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail/videos/1020218588037889/", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/lifestyle-offbeat/article/watch-flight-safety-demonstration-will-leave-you-splits", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/funny-flight-attendant_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/funny-flight-attendant_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:29:57.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
