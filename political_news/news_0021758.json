Meanwhile, the CEI has been on a modest growth trajectory this year with the strengths widespread among its components. Taken together, the current behavior of the composite indexes suggests that the economy is likely to continue to grow into early next year, but the pace is unlikely to pick up.\nAbout The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® (LEI) for the U.K.\nThe composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component – primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.\nThe seven components of The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® for the U.K. include:\nOrder Book Volume, CBI Monthly Enquiry\nVolume of Expected Output, CBI Monthly Enquiry\nConsumer Confidence\nStock Prices, FTSE all share price index\nYield Spread, 10 years minus Bank Rate\nProductivity, Whole Economy Index\nTotal Gross Operating Surplus of Corporations\nFor more information including full press release and technical notes:\nhttp://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=2\nFor more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators:\nhttp://www.conference-board.org/data/bci.cfm\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is an independent business membership and research association working in the public interest.
