By David Catanese Oct. 21, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT\n+ More A hundred and four days from the kickoff caucuses in Iowa, Jeb Bush's campaign manager couldn't have been much farther away geographically.\nDanny Diaz, who was brought on in June to right a wayward campaign start, found himself in Berlin Monday as a featured speaker at The International Conference For Political Communications, where, before a mostly European audience, he ticked off selective polling numbers pitting Bush against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, touted early state advertising buys and trumpeted a handful of endorsements by elected officials.\nThe presentation appeared to be boilerplate for American political aficionados, but an organizer of the gathering afterward described Diaz as \"too heavy on machismo\" for the staid Germans in the room.\n[ RELATED: Donald Trump’s Supporters, and Why They Love Him ]\nBack stateside, a top official for a rival 2016 presidential campaign found Diaz's mere attendance at a conference 5,000 miles away from his Miami headquarters to be stunning in itself.\n\"We're negotiating who even gets off the day after Thanksgiving and he's spending a couple days in ... Berlin at a time when each day is 1 percent of the remaining campaign,\" the adviser rants. \"This isn't just some adviser, it's the manager. It's crazy.\"\nA Bush spokesman says Diaz made the commitment to speak before he took on the role as campaign manager and was only there for \"like five hours.\"\nDiaz's jaunt overseas for a quick speech may not seem incredibly consequential in this marathon race for president, but it doesn't display the sense of urgency that many Republicans now believe Bush must engender in order to mount a comeback.\nLess than four months before primary voting begins, Bush has sunk into second-tier status in the GOP nominating bout. He's stuck in a single-digit polling slump, idling between fourth and fifth place in the 15-candidate field , even after his allies have blitzed the television airwaves with more than $5 million in advertising. His much heralded fundraising prowess has also been neutralized, as he's raised essentially as much money as Sen. Ted Cruz this last quarter and saved less than the rogue upstart Ben Carson.\n\"What gave [Bush] the status of front-runner is the money that was known that he had raised. But this year, with the field this large, I'm not sure that money will dictate the outcome,\" says Iowa state Rep. Mary Ann Hanusa, who attended an early Bush event before endorsing Ohio Gov. John Kasich. \"The media called [Bush] the front-runner, but sometimes the voters have other ideas.\"\nWhat's more is that Bush has been exposed as an awkward communicator for his cause, having been continually emasculated by Trump's taunts and transcended by Sen. Marco Rubio's natural eloquence.\nWhen CNN's Jake Tapper probed Bush this past weekend about how he could assign blame to Clinton and President Barack Obama for the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, if he wasn't willing to acknowledge his brother was partly culpable for the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, Bush sputtered.\n\"Well, I, it's – the question on Benghazi, which is hopefully we'll now finally get the truth to, is, 'Was that, was the place secure?'\" he clumsily responded.\n[ READ: Why Is Jeb Bush Arguing With Donald Trump Over 9/11 and 'Kept Us Safe'? ]\nTrent Lott, the former U.S. Senate majority leader now also supporting Kasich, says Bush's serene persona struggles to command a room even when he's on message.\n\"I was out there for the Simi Valley debate. If you just listened to what he said it sounded pretty good, but if you watched him saying it, it wasn't as effective as you'd think. I can't quite explain what it is,\" Lott says.\nAdds an unaligned lobbyist familiar with Bush's gubernatorial runs: \"Jeb learns but it takes him time. He internalized the lessons from losing to [Lawton] Chiles and was a much better candidate his second time out. He's patient and disciplined and smart but could not ad-lib a fart. He will think of how to win this race sometime in 2017 and be ready to rumble in 2020.\"\nBush's last card to play – electability – seems to have withered away, too. Tested against Clinton in a battery of hypothetical general election matchups in the state of Pennsylvania earlier this month, Trump, Carson and Rubio beat her. Bush lost.\nThen, at the start of this week, a gut-punching set of numbers landed in the inboxes of Bush's team: The highly respected NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that more GOP primary voters say they can't see themselves supporting Bush (44 percent) than Trump (36 percent) – a staggering reversal from June.\nEven among Bush's admirers, there's a gathering sense he can't win this race anymore – that in order for him to become the nominee, his rivals have to lose it.\n\"I'm not sure he can climb over the others,\" says Mac Stipanovich, who advised Bush's unsuccessful run for Florida governor in 1994. \"They have to fall off the log. Republican primary voters are having a moment with the outsiders. It is my hope when we get further down the road that that moment will fade.\"\nAnd even if the outsiders ultimately fade or self-immolate, there stands Rubio, who is far superior to Bush stylistically and boasts a youthful shine and novelty that accentuates his rationale for a new generation of ideas. Bush's recent strike on Rubio's spotty attendance record as a senator seems more likely to resonate with the Beltway press pack than a New Hampshire voter. But since the two are so similar on policy, the menu of attack options at his disposal is limited.\nBush advisers are openly irritated by the presumption Rubio stands in any better position than their boss does at this point.\n\"If a first-term senator is the answer, what is the question?,\" says South Carolina Bush adviser Jim Dyke, who boasted about Bush's early organizational advantage over Rubio back in August. \"Their organization is Warren Tompkins [who is running Rubio's super PAC] and consultants in South Carolina. That's not how you win a primary. Last time Warren Tompkins won a presidential primary [was] in 1980. No campaign will be better organized than ours [in South Carolina].\"\nBut Rubio's favorables are consistently higher than Bush's, and while supporters of Trump , Carson and Carly Fiorina occasionally cite Rubio as a second or third choice, they rarely mention Bush as an option.\nBush's path to victory seems more elusive each day. And by most standards, his most viable track should have already begun to take shape. Sure, in late October 2011, there were polls that showed Herman Cain holding a small lead for the GOP nomination. But what's less cited is that eventual nominee Mitt Romney remained consistently in second place, always polling in double-digits and usually in the 20s .\n[ PHOTOS: The GOP's Hopefuls ]\nFrom that barometer, Bush isn't even close to where Romney was. His current polling looks most like that of Ron Paul, who stayed in the ongoing race until May 2012 but came in fourth place in terms of delegates. Romney's track was slow, steady and stable. Bush is now betting on a bottle-rocket surge of 20 points or more in the closing weeks before February due to a well-built ground organization. \"Fifty percent of New Hampshire voters decide in the last week,\" a Bush aide stresses. \"You have to chip away. This is not going to flip overnight.\"\nMike Murphy, Bush's longtime strategist now at the helm of his mammoth super PAC, described this phase of the campaign to Bloomberg this week as \"this funny casino of the preseason.\" He pointed to the mid-March hunt for delegates as when the race will be decided. And he scoffed at reporters' obsession with the rolling weekly national polls, describing them as \"meaningless\" and \"irritating noise.\"\nBut peek into the state-by-state contests and Bush is performing no better: sixth in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire, sixth in South Carolina, and third even in his home state of Florida.\nIt may still be silly season, but it is getting late therein. Bush is trying everything to change the free media equation Trump is dominating, but little is sticking. In lieu of that, the impression Bush lieutenants are attempting to leave is that he will be the prime, no-brainer fallback option when reality sets in.\n\"At best he's a safety school when everyone still thinks they are getting into Harvard,\" the lobbyist quips.\n\"Fourth/fifth in the polls is not acceptable,\" says David Aufhauser, a Bush fundraising chairman. \"But it is also not irreversible.\"\nHe urged Bush to achieve greater clarity on his issue matrix, to better harness the resources at his disposal through the deployment of surrogates, and to abandon any mantle of inevitability.\n\"Make clear you want to win,\" Aufhauser advises, \"Not that you should win.\"\nThe inevitability of Bush as the nominee has been supplanted by the inevitability held by Bush's team that Trump and Carson will slowly burn out, simply due to the normal laws of politics.\nBut as Stipanovich says, \"There is a gathering body of evidence that that time may not come. We keep waiting. If the party goes crazy or continues to be crazy, it will not nominate Jeb.\"\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: politics 2016 presidential election Bush, Jeb Trump, Donald Carson, Benjamin Rubio, Marco", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-donald-trump-and-ben-carson-increase-lead-over-jeb-bush/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Demise%20of%20Jeb%20Bush", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html#polls", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Demise%20of%20Jeb%20Bush&summary=His%20backers%20hope%20Trump%20burns%20out%2C%20but%20their%20candidate%20is%20starting%20to%20fade%20away.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_PA_101515.pdf", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-10-20/mike-murphy-of-right-to-rise-explains-his-theory-that-jeb-bush-is-still-the-candidate-to-beat", "https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/654751050218409988", "http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_16750-1442-1-30.pdf?150903152133", "http://www.vox.com/2015/10/18/9564267/donald-trump-jeb-bush-911", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZee006%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Demise%20of%20Jeb%20Bush"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:45:55.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
