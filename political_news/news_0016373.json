Staten Island. Baltimore. Places that became synonymous with civil unrest following the deaths of black Americans at the hands of police. \nHoping that a Virginia locality will not be added to that list in the future, Attorney General Mark R. Herring on Tuesday rolled out a plan to improve policing and make it safer. The plan seeks to promote mutual trust and positive relationships between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. \nParticipation in the training is not mandatory. Herring did not have a cost estimate for his initiative, but he said that his office will fund it. \n“We’ve got some of the best-trained law enforcement anywhere in the country. But at the same time, we know we could do better,” Herring said at a news conference in Richmond. \nHe said that the events in Ferguson, Mo., made him ponder how to avert such a crisis in Virginia. The fatal shooting of Michael Brown in August 2014 by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, sparked protests and a vigorous debate about the relationship between law enforcement officers and blacks. \n“Events across the country, and even in Virginia over the last year, have tested the relationships between law enforcement agencies and their communities, maybe like never before,” Herring said. \n“Fatal encounters between law enforcement officers and citizens, and the resulting community responses, have forced every community to take a close look at the way we police ourselves. \n“As we have seen, these incidents can either be moments that reveal the strength of character of a community, or they can reveal distrust and an unacceptable divide between the people and their police.” \nAccording to The Counted, a website by the British newspaper the Guardian, that tracks people killed by police in the United States, 20 people have been killed by law enforcement officers in Virginia this year — 16 by gunshot, two by Taser, two in a car crash. \n“Unfortunately, we have experienced officer-involved fatalities in Virginia, the circumstances of which are all unique. But we haven’t seen that kind of explosive reaction,” Herring said. \nIn the coming 12 to 18 months, the Attorney General’s Office will host a series of regional, multiday training sessions for officers focusing on the skills necessary for what Herring calls “effective 21st century policing,” mostly in underserved areas of the state where law enforcement agencies might lack the funding to offer these opportunities to their officers. \n“This dual-track training initiative will give new and experienced officers additional skills and tactics for safely dealing with potentially confrontational situations, and for ensuring that each member of the community is treated fairly and equally,” Herring said. “These are the skills that can build trust, encourage communication and interaction, bring communities and their police departments closer together, make communities safer, and ultimately, save lives.” \nLaw enforcement agencies statewide welcome Herring’s initiative, said Williamsburg Chief David Sloggie, president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police. \n“Every officer in Virginia deserves to receive the best quality training we can provide to ensure their safety and the safety of our citizens. Our goal is to ensure that the critical components of our basic and in-service training are consistent statewide in both content and quality,” Sloggie said. \nCarmen Taylor, president of the Virginia State Conference of the NAACP, also hailed the program. \n“I wish to thank Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring for including VSC-NAACP in the proposed review of necessary changes and implementation of new procedures within and from the state Attorney General’s Office,” Taylor said in a statement. \nmschmidt@timesdispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:20:03.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
