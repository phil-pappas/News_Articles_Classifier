Like Us on Facebook \nSome compared it to Comic Con, the long-running comic book festival that draws hundreds of thousands of people to San Diego each summer. Politicon had its share of costumed attendees, though, here, they weren't just doing it for kicks. \nEveryone had an agenda, and few were shy about expressing it. Question and answer sessions often got heated, as it did when comedian Jeff Ross momentarily debated the country's three-strike law with a disgruntled patron. The topic came up after Ross aired an upcoming Comedy Central special about his visit to a Texas county jail. \nControversial Conservative author Ann Coulter held meet and greet with fans; radio and podcast hosts broadcast live from various L.A. Convention Center halls throughout the weekend; even former Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann joined in discussions. \nThe amalgam of liberals and conservatives did generally agree on one thing: Politicon was a long time coming. Here are some images from the two-day event. \nPolitically-themed pieces of art lined the Politicon corridor. \nInside, patrons took a more blatant approach in sending a message. \n\"The Road to D.C.,\" a live action board game set up inside the Democracy Village, awarded participants who answered questions correctly. \nBachmann spoke with L.A. radio personality Larry Elder Saturday afternoon in front of a packed audience. The room stayed relatively silent as the former presidential candidate discussed turmoil in the Middle East . \nRoss hosted a Q & A session following the screening of his upcoming special \"Jeff Ross Roasts Criminals: Live at Brazos County Jail.\" When asked how he chose the jail, Ross quipped \"I roasted Charlie Sheen, I roasted Donald Trump. Let's roast criminals that aren't famous.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:02:44.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
