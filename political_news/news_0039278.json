Sky News understands that Mr Corbyn was invited to speak at Tuesday's annual conference of the Institute of Directors (IoD) following his victory in the party's leadership election last month.\nThe IoD's director-general, Simon Walker, is understood to have offered Mr Corbyn a platform to explain how he intends to build a working relationship with the business community.\nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was unable to attend the conference \"due to other commitments\".\nHis response will do little to ease anxiety among company bosses about Labour's business policies under his leadership.\nMr Walker told Sky News that the IoD's \"door is open\" to Mr Corbyn\" and that he hoped the Labour leader would speak at a future event organised by the body.\nTuesday's conference at the Royal Albert Hall in London will be attended by many of the UK's most senior business and political figures, with speakers due to include David Miliband, the former Labour leadership contender.\nLord Mandelson and Lord Lawson are due to debate Britain's future in Europe, while other panellists will include Antonio Horta-Osorio, the Lloyds Banking Group chief executive, and Anya Hindmarch, the fashion designer.\nLabour's economic credibility is also likely to be among the political talking points at the IoD conference.\nReacting to his speech at the Labour Party conference last week, Mr Walker said there \"was not much space for business in it\".\n“The recovery after the financial crash of 2008 has been difficult, but we would have liked to see more acknowledgement of the vital role the private sector has played in creating jobs and driving growth.\n“While we are more positive about the UK’s current economic performance, Jeremy Corbyn did identify several areas of concern that will chime with businesses. Improving our broadband infrastructure, stimulating manufacturing and building more houses are all goals we share.\n\"Only a few weeks into the job, we would not expect the new leader to be able to spell out the detail of his party’s policies, but until he does, it will be hard to judge whether he has credible solutions to the problems.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:37:27.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
