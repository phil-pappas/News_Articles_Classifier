CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDuring a recent vacation, Farrel Wade and his wife, Pattie, were invited to attend a fundraiser for Ben Carson that took place on a train ride in Ohio. \nPrior to that August train ride, Wade didn't know much about Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and author turned Republican presidential candidate. Upon meeting Carson, Wade found him impressive, he said. And having heard that a friend donated to Carson's campaign, the same friend who had invited the couple on the train ride, Wade and his wife each decided to do likewise — to the tune of $2,700, the maximum allowed by law. \nThe Wades are not alone. Donors from Springfield contributed $16,960 to Carson's campaign; it was the most from Springfieldians to any GOP presidential campaign as of last month, according to campaign finance records posted on the Federal Elections Commission's website. \nThe Wades are both retired — he worked at City Utilities and she owned a flower shop — and \"common people,\" said Wade, 78. They feel like Carson is like them. \n\"Well, we just believe in what he stands for and just like his attitude,\" said Wade, adding he liked that Carson was a political outsider and that he built a successful career after having grown up poor. \n\"Unlike most politicians, he's not mouthy or braggadocious,\" Wade said. \nLocal Democrats are making donations too. \nHillary Clinton was the top recipient of contributions, $17,233, from Springfield residents to presidential candidates as of last month. \nAmong Clinton's local donors was attorney Angie Acree, who contributed $365. Acree herself is more than a political contributor. She also is an organizer for Clinton's volunteer campaign in Missouri, she said. Acree said she was drawn to the campaign, in part, because of Clinton's promises to reform the nation's criminal justice system. \n\"As far as being a contributor to a campaign, I think a lot of people it's the way they put skin in the game, you know,\" Acree said. \"We can't do what the Koch brothers do and pour millions in. But we can pay for some office supplies or whatever it is these staffs need, and our little contributions in the big scheme of things is not going to make that much difference, but every little bit helps.\" \nPresidential campaign contributions can be tracked on the FEC website: http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do Here is a rundown of how much Springfield residents donated to the top presidential candidates as of Friday afternoon: \nDemocrats —", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:01:29.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
