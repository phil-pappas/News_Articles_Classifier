REUTERS/Brian Snyder More + \nBOSTON -- In the wake of a fatal shooting at a community college in Oregon, Hillary Clinton plans to propose four measures to tighten regulations on those who manufacture, sell and purchase guns. \nClinton, who supports universal background checks and a ban on military-style assault weapons, will outline her new proposals in two town halls on Monday in New Hampshire, according to a campaign aide.

REUTERS/Steve Dipaola \nThree of four of Clinton's proposals target loopholes in current federal laws that apply to those who want to buy guns. The politics of mass shootings and gun control \nClinton will call on Congress to require any person engaging in a high volume of gun sales, in particular at gun shows and on the internet, to be held to the same standards as sellers at gun stores. Including those venues as \"in the business\" of selling firearms under federal regulation would require sellers at gun shows and online to conduct background checks on potential buyers. On this measure, according to the aide, Clinton will promise to take administrative action as president to change the law if Congress refuses to act. Reaction of 2016 presidential candidates to Oregon shooting \nSeparately, Clinton will urge Congress to close the loophole which allows gun sales to go through without a completed background check when a check is not completed within three days. Clinton will call this loophole the \"Charleston Loophole\" because the exception allowed the man who allegedly shot and killed nine black churchgoers in a bible study group earlier this summer in Charleston, South Carolina to purchase the gun used in the attack. \nClinton will also propose passing more comprehensive legislation that bans all domestic abusers from buying or possessing guns. Under the current federal law, many who have been convicted of domestic abuse are prohibited from accessing guns but the law leaves out offenders in certain dating relationships. Clinton will seek to expand the law to include all domestic abusers and convicted stalkers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:17:07.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
