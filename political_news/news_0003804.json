[ Need for public space puts housing, parks, schools in competition ] \nThe high stakes are fueling a sense of urgency at campaign events, such as the forum on Monday. \n“Arlington faces budgetary pressures due to high commercial vacancy rates and higher than expected school enrollments,” Dorsey said Wednesday. “It is my duty to be as responsive as possible to groups and individuals by demonstrating my understanding of the issues and being as clear as possible on how I want to resolve them.” \nAt the Arlington Forest event Monday, there were questions on taxes, street repairs, trash and parking, in addition to the controversial proposal to include some affordable housing along with a rebuilt community center at Lubber Run Park. \nBut the moderator’s follow-up questions dealt only with whether candidates would pledge to oppose such housing, which the neighborhood group has strongly resisted. \nSome advocates say there is a danger in having so many special-interest group-driven forums — even as their own groups continue to push ahead with their agendas. \n“If all we have are negatives — don’t build that school here, keep housing out of the parks — what is the positive way forward?” asked Marc DeFrancis, an organizer with VOICE, a interfaith group focused on affordable housing. \nIts candidate forum is Sunday evening.
