And hard as it may also be to believe, it is one of the men who was closest to Nixon, Alexander Butterfield, who's letting the secrets out. Our Cover Story is reported now by David Martin: \nIt was the biggest bombshell of the biggest political scandal in American history: White House aide Alexander Butterfield revealing the existence of the White House taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee:\nQ: \"Are you aware of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the White House?|\nButterfield: \"I was aware of listening devices, yes, sir.\"\n\"When Butterfield gave that dramatic testimony in July 1973, it was a pivot point in Watergate,\" said reporter Bob Woodward, who -- along with Carl Bernstein -- famously exposed the machinations of the Nixon White House. Woodward had tried and failed to interview Butterfield, so he passed the name on to the Watergate Committee.\nMartin asked, \"Do you think the tapes would have ever been revealed had it not been for Butterfield?\"\n\"I think they probably would not have,\" Woodward replied. \n\"All the President's Men\" at 40 (\"Sunday Morning,\" 06/15/14) Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein reflect on Watergate, 40 years later (\"Face the Nation,\" 08/10/14) Watergate reporters: Nixon administration criminality was pervasive (\"CBS Evening News,\" 06/14/12) Bob Woodward's \"Secret Man\" (\"The Early Show,\" 07/07/05) W. Mark Felt, \"Deep Throat,\" dies at 95 (12/19/08) It turns out, Butterfield was sitting on a lot more secrets -- 20 boxes full of them -- which two years ago he turned over to Woodward. He told Butterfield that \"not in my wildest dreams\" did he ever think he would one day collaborate with Woodward.\nThe reporter said that when he walked into Butterfield's apartment and saw the boxes, \"I thought, 'Wow! Let's start looking!'\" \nThe result is \"The Last of the President's Men\" (published by Simon & Schuster, which is owned by CBS). In addition to the documents, Woodward spent 40 hours interviewing Butterfield, who for three years occupied the office next to the president's.\nButterfield said he was \"the first one to see him every day, last person to see him every night, attending to all of the immediate needs.\"\nAlexander Butterfield CBS News \nWhen Butterfield left, he took his files with him, including some documents classified as \"Top Secret.\" \"How did you just walk away with them from the White House?\" Martin asked. \n\"It was easy -- I just walked away with them,\" Butterfield replied. \"Well, I did the wrong thing. No one's supposed to do that. But I felt, to tell you the truth, that those papers were safer with me than with anyone. I'd been around classified documents -- that's no excuse -- but I'm saying I wasn't going to show these to the wrong person, and I was going to take good care of them.\"\nOne top secret document reveals Nixon's candid handwritten opinion of the bombing of Vietnam -- an angry scrawl across a report from his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger: \"We have had ten years of total control of the air in Laos and Vietnam. The result = zilch.\" \nAnd just the day before, Nixon had told Dan Rather of CBS News exactly the opposite: \"The results have been very, very effective,\" said the president.\n\nprev Next 1 / 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:58:57.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
