The average Smithtown home assessed at $5,500 would pay about $1,271.25 in annual taxes, an increase of $18.01.\nThe town's tax levy for 2016 is planned at $55.49 million, slightly above this year's levy of $55.04 million, town officials said.\nThe town could have appropriated another $500,000 and still stayed within the state's mandated tax cap, but Supervisor Patrick Vecchio said he didn't see the need.\n\"We can't tolerate extra expenditures when they're unnecessary,\" Vecchio said. \"We're not going to waste taxpayer money.\"\nMost Popular Cops: Homicide detectives probe overnight bar fight Police: Man ordered to leave hotel slashes cops Cops: Driver killed in crash with utility pole Insurer shutdown surprises brokers, doctors Mayor: Village incorporation has been 'a disaster' He said $1.08 million less was spent in the town's general fund, its largest, due to job vacancies and curtailing expenses in several departments.\nThe town also plans to continue a policy started this year of only filling jobs viewed as essential when employees leave or retire, said Vecchio. \"We're doing a little bit more with less people,\" he said. \"It's more efficient.\"\nThe town was also able to save money due to the allocations of projects and major equipment purchases in the 2015-2019 capital budget plan. For example, the town anticipates saving $200,000 in utility costs with the installation of LED streetlights, Vecchio said.\nIn addition, about $900,000 in health insurance and workers' compensation increases were mitigated by a decrease in required state pension contributions, the supervisor said.\n\"We were able to meet the tax cap because of the intense scrutiny of the departmental budgets and the supervisor's longtime policy of being fiscally tightfisted,\" said Comptroller Donald Musgnug.\nMusgnug also noted ways in which the town was able to repurpose salary savings into department budgets. The 2016 budget for the town animal shelter is about $689,000, roughly $2,000 less than this year's budget.\nThe about $35,000 reduction in the animal shelter supervisor's salary was allocated for trap, neuter and release services, adoption advertisements and the hiring of a part-time trainer to socialize eight dogs, he said. The position had been a point of contention for three members of the defunct shelter advisory council, who recently resigned.\nThe budget plan includes longevity and step increases for about 30 Smithtown Administrative Guild and 375 Civil Service Employees Association union workers, Vecchio said.\nThe best of Newsday every day in your inbox.
