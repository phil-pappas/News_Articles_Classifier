Bernie Sanders \nHe’s been known in his daily three hours on the radio to slide into humorous mimicry of public figures to make a point, but Michael Savage has developed a particular knack for channeling Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, nailing his voice and parodying his unapologetically socialist prescriptions for America. \n“When I take over in this country, the rich are going to pay their fair share,” says Savage’s “Bernie Sanders.” \n“Nobody has earned anything in this country,” he goes on, “except that was on the backs of others.” \n“And so I think the minimum tax rate for those making more than $10,000 a year should be at least 98 percent,” he says. \n“And I would make it graduated, so people should not say that I’m unfair.” \nAnybody making $20,000 a year should pay 99 percent. \nAnd it gets worse from there, with people over $50,000 paying 100 percent and anyone making $20 million paying 300 percent. \nIn another Sanders riff, Savage asks what the Vermont senator’s foreign policy might look like. \nWhat would he do with ISIS, for example? \nSee the entire Savage collection in the WND Superstore. \nThe first thing, says Savage as Sanders, is he would go to the leader of ISIS and ask: “Is there anything we could do economically to help you put down the knife and pick up the, ah, waffle iron? \n“That’s the first thing I would do, to help them get jobs in the needle trades in New York City amongst my many friends, and my wife’s friends, going back many, many years in the New York City needle trades.” \nOn his show last month, Savage asked a basic question about the Vermont senator: Where’s the management experience? \n“What has Bernie Sanders ever managed that would permit him to be a decent manager of a nation?” Savage asked. “Look what we’ve got with Obama, who never managed a lemonade stand. He didn’t even work his way through grade school. Nothing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:19:01.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
