After all, Saudi Arabia is a member of the board.\nBut as Saudi King Salman considers giving his blessing to the sentence handed Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, the case should also prove an embarrassment to the United States, whose alliances of convenience continue to force American values into compromising positions.\nAl-Nimr, arrested in 2012 at age 17, is to be beheaded and his body publicly crucified in a spectacle more commonly found in regions controlled by Islamic State than that of a longtime U.S. ally.\nAl-Nimr was convicted of terrorism for his participation in the Arab Spring demonstrations, which included such heinous acts as protesting, chanting anti-government slogans and using social media to express views critical of the kingdom's absolute monarchy.\nThe government also alleges he sheltered wanted men and participated in anti-government riots, but has provided no evidence of those claims beyond a confession of dubious merit commonly produced at Saudi Arabian show trials, which are largely conducted in secret.\nIn reality, the death sentence probably has more to do with the fact that al-Nimr is the nephew of an influential cleric critical of the government, who has also been sentenced to death. It reeks of North Korean-style generational punishment.\nSaudi Arabia has executed 134 people this year, most, it is believed, by public beheading, according to the United Nations. Further, according to Amnesty International, Saudi Arabia is one of the top three executioners in the world, behind China and Iran.\nThe United States likely has no pull with those other two states, but Saudi Arabia's position as a favored American ally affords the U.S. government the ability to relentlessly pursue the cause of al-Nimr. It should do so until he, and other prisoners held in contravention of American standards of the rule of law, receive a proper trial or are released.\nAnd then, perhaps, we should reconsider our relationships with tyrannical nations.\n(c)2015 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.)\nVisit The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.) at www.ocregister.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1731151", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1731151&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1731151&h=Does+the+US+really+need+allies+who+behead%2C+crucify+dissidents%3F"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:13:52.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
