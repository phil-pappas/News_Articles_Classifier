New powers set to be devolved in the Scotland Bill would be used extensively. \nHolyrood's health committee, which issued a report on health inequalities earlier this year, said that a baby born today in the richest parts of Scotland could expect to live almost 30 years longer than one born in the poorest.

There have been many reports on Scottish health inequalities over the years. This commission report is different because it is firmly focussed on what we can and must do in Scotland to tackle this enduring problem. Share article \n\"It is a national shame that we have some of the worst health inequalities in the developed world. We need to debunk the myth that there are no devolved powers available to take on this huge challenge and get on and do something about it. The commission recommendations come from a wide consultation with experts working in communities, the health service, local government, and trade unions; as well as from community engagement events. \n\"The testimonies we heard from people working heroically in their communities painted a graphic picture of the miserable reality of poverty and inequality and the inadequate policy and resources we put into tackling health inequalities in Scotland. If we are ever going to solve this issue we are going to have to fundamentally change our political priorities and choices taken in the Scottish Parliament.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:04:24.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
