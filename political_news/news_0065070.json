I am not surprised that many people sitting behind him say that he should get in his DeLorean, go back to 1985 and stay there!” \nAs the Tory berserkers whooped with glee, the chief comrade peered over his glasses with disdain. \nIt is quite clear Mr C - back in his ill-fitting brown jacket after the previous night’s Fred Astaire white tie and tails - has decided to adopt a headmasterly tone with those silly Tory boys from the Bullingdon Club. Promoted stories \nThere were heated exchanges on tax credits and Dave, “delighted” by his side winning the previous night’s vote to introduce the cuts, asked JC to explain the strange absence from it of Labour’s deputy leader, one Tom Watson. \nAs the Conservatives raised a collective cry of exaggerated bewilderment, the chief comrade began replying and paused amid the hullabaloo. As the noise eventually eased, Jezza politely snapped: “Thank you,” and Headmaster Corbyn continued. \nLater, Martyn Day, the SNP’s champion for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, suggested that when it came to the PM’s EU reform negotiations Scotland should be represented ahead of the key Brussels summit in December. \nIt was quite clear Dave was not really interested in the question but that the questioner was a Nationalist and so, delightedly, reminded him of the No vote in last year’s referendum. \nAnd with the supreme comrade in town, the PM pointed out how among the “golden era” deals being done with China was one to the tune of £2 billion in his very own constituency by Europe’s biggest bus-maker, Alexander Dennis. Share article \nBut the SNP benches reacted in excited disbelief because the PM had slipped up; the deal in question was not in Mr Day’s but, wait for it, the neighbouring one of Falkirk. \nThe animated Nationalist reaction earned a mild rebuke from the Speaker, who asked SNP MPs to “calm themselves”. Jezza, meantime, was very calm, playing with his iphone.
