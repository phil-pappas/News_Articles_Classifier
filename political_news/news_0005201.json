The former secretary of state's handling of the investigation, as well as her use of a private email server, have caused her to lose momentum in the polls, which show that 60 percent of independents view her as untrustworthy. Analysts say Clinton's lack of accountability with voters could create an opening for Biden to enter and succeed in the already crowded race.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama lets China off the hook for currency manipulation Treasury admits that the near-term trajectory of the China's currency is 'difficult to assess.'\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/19/15 5:42 PM Prior to CNBC's report, Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that Biden would likely enter the race on Monday or Tuesday, before the Thursday Benghazi hearing. In order for Biden to get on the primary ballot in every state, he would have to file his candidacy by Nov. 6.\nIf Biden does not announce before the Benghazi hearing on Thursday, some sources now say that the vice president will enter prior to the Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa on Saturday night, a crucial stop on the democratic primary campaign trail.\nTop Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:58:10.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
