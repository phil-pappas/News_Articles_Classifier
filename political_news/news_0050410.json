Average Brent prices fell 18% QoQ to $50.5 per barrel driving our average oil realization down by 22% QoQ to $43.7 /bbl. Discount to Brent for Rajasthan crude widened to 14.3% from 9.9% on sequential basis due to lower demand for heavy crude. Decline in Benchmark Brent prices was followed by greater incentive for processing light grades, driving the demand for light crude. Oversupply of heavy crude also suppressed the prices. Depreciation of 2.3% in the average exchange rate for Rupee against US Dollar partially offset the impact of crude prices. During the quarter, total profit petroleum was INR 674 crore ( US$ 104 million ) including INR 536 crore ( US$ 83 million ) for Rajasthan block.\nEBITDA for the quarter came in at INR 966 crore with a strong EBITDA margin of 43%. EBITDA was down 26% QoQ on account of lower realization and increase in overall operating cost due to increase in polymer injection volumes. We continued to maintain low water-flood operating cost at Rajasthan at $5.5 /boe aided by reduction in crude processing and facility maintenance costs. The water-flood opex was slightly up by 4% QoQ from $5.2 /boe in Q1FY16 due to lower production volumes resulting into increase in cost per unit. Ramp-up in the polymer injection volumes also lifted the blended operating cost by 11% QoQ to US$ 6.4 /boe.\nDD&A charges remained almost stable at INR 864 crore as compared to the first quarter, which is expected to continue at the current normalised level.\nA favourable movement in the currency resulted into forex gain of INR 381 crore , a 109% QoQ increase, on our investments and operating activities. The 3.3% depreciation in the Rupee against US Dollar emanated from quarter end exchange rate rising to 65.9 from 63.8 over second quarter.\nOther income declined by 68% QoQ to INR 120 crore due to timing difference in the maturity of our investments and mark-to-market losses on bond investments.\nThere was reversal of tax expense by INR 130 crore in the second quarter against charge of INR 141 crore in the first quarter. We posted profit after tax of INR 673 crore with a healthy profit margin of 30%. The profit was down by 19% QoQ mainly on account of lower EBITDA and other income, which was partially offset by higher forex gain and lower tax, as highlighted above. Earnings per share came down proportionately to INR 3.6 in the second quarter from INR 4.4 in the first quarter. Cash EPS was also down 34% QoQ to INR 5.5 due to lower EBITDA and other income.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was INR 986 crore . Net capital expenditure for the second quarter stood at INR 402 crore ( US$ 62 million ) with 80% of the investment made on development projects and 20% on exploration activities. Our closing cash and cash equivalent position was solid at INR 17,943 crore ( US$ 2.7 billion ), of which 68% is invested in rupee funds and 32% in dollar funds.\nOperational Review\nDuring Q2FY16, Cairn had a gross production of 18.9 mmboe from its three producing blocks where it enjoys 100% operatorship, of which net working interest production was 11.8 mmboe.

As a result of our focused efforts, we realized better efficiencies in our operations:\nProcurement savings of ~13% realized through constant focus on the cost reduction, mainly led by tapering of costs and negotiations with the vendors for new contracts across assets Well cost cut by approx.15% : Realized better cost efficiency for drilling and completion of well at Barmer Hill tight reservoir formation over one year. This is a result of various measures taken including optimizing the well completion designs, comparable rate of penetration with the global players, improvement in cycle time and leveraging lower service providers cost. Sustaining low Opex/boe at Rajasthan : The water-flood operating costs remain low at $5.5 /boe driven by decrease in the crude processing and facility maintenance costs.

Gross production was at 15.5 mmboe in Q2FY16 at an average of 168,126 boepd driven by in-line reservoir performance at Mangala and additional volumes from new infill wells at Aishwariya. Barmer Hill and Satellite Field production contributed ~5.5 kboepd on average in Q2FY16. During the quarter, a total of 15.2 mn barrels of oil was sold, at an average of 165,008 bopd, to PSU and private refiners across India .\nThe average crude price realization for the quarter declined to US$ 43.3 /bbl from US$ 55.8 /bbl, 22% lower QoQ largely on account of 18% QoQ drop in the Brent price from US$ 61.9 /bbl to US$ 50.5 /bbl. An expansion of the discount to Brent from 9.9% in Q1FY16 to 14.3% in Q2FY16 also implied a 4% lower realization per barrel for Rajasthan crude. The water-flood operating expense in Rajasthan remained low at US$ 5.5 /boe, slightly up by 4% QoQ due to lower volumes. Increase in the polymer injection volumes lifted the blended operating cost to US$ 6.4 /boe.\nRDG field in DA-1 witnessed a ramp-up in the gas production with the volumes rising by 58% to an average rate of 30 mmscfd in Q2FY16 from 19 mmscfd in Q1FY16. We achieved a record peak production of 34 mmscfd from RDG in August 2015 , and expect to produce more than our guidance of an average production of 25 mmscfd of gas from existing RDG infrastructure in FY16. Total gas production in the quarter was 2.8bscf. We successfully completed a 5 well hydro-frac campaign in the quarter, which helped us ramp-up production of the gas from the field. We are planning to commence a 15 well hydro-frac campaign in the next quarter to sustain the production growth.\nGas sales from RDG field increased 65% QoQ to an average rate of 15 mmscfd in Q2FY16 and touched a peak of 18 mmscfd in August, on account of optimization of existing infrastructure. Total Gas sales were 1.4 Bscf. In addition, we also produced and sold an average of 1,700 bopd of condensate from the RDG field.\nThe average facility uptime for the quarter was ~97%\nOur development projects continued to see traction in the second quarter:\nMangala EOR : Injection has been increased from 80,000 barrels of polymer solution per day in Q1FY16 to 200,000 polymer solution per day in Q2FY16. The injection ramp up plan is on track and impact of polymer injection on production has been seen, which is in-line with our expectation. Current polymer injection rates and production performance have reduced the risks significantly both from surface facilities and reservoir perspective. We expect to ramp up the polymer injection volumes to 400,000 blpd by end of FY16 as per our schedule.\nMore than 75% of the new wells are already drilled, and the work on drilling and surface facilities is ongoing as per schedule. Modifications to the existing facilities for handling polymerized fluids are nearing completion. Some of the pre-producer wells have also been converted into polymer injection wells as per the plan, which will eventually lead to ramp-up in the production.\nAishwariya Infill : As on date, 12 wells out of the 20 wells infill campaign have been brought online. Balance wells have been drilled and will be brought online progressively in the current fiscal year. Production from these wells has helped in arresting the natural decline in Aishwariya.\nBhagyam EOR : Front End Engineering Design contract has been awarded and it is in advance stage. Tendering for Rig, drilling & completion long lead items has also started while we await the FDP approval from our JV partner.\nAs indicated earlier, we expect an additional recovery of ~40-50 mm barrels of unswept oil still in-ground at the Bhagyam field. We estimated a capital cost for Bhagyam EOR project at ~US$ 260 mn , resulting in a development cost of ~US$ 5-6 /bbl.\nGas Development at RDG Field : Discussions on the pipeline are in an advanced stage with all stakeholders including Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). In addition to optimizing existing infrastructure, we are also progressing on the tendering process for the new gas processing terminal. We expect first gas from the new terminal in H2 CY17 subject to the pipeline approval.\nAishwariya Barmer Hill – Our constant efforts on cost optimization helped in finalization of the Field Development Plan and it is expected to be submitted to the JV Partner soon. Internal assurance process is completed, and discussion and alignment with the JV partner has been initiated to expedite the process. Under the current project, the recovery is expected at ~20-30 mn barrels of oil. The capital outlay for the project is estimated at ~US$ 300 mn , resulting in a development cost of ~US$ 10-15 /bbl.\nMangala ASP : The Mangala ASP Pilot was completed in Q4FY15 with encouraging results. Work is currently under progress to upscale the results from pilot to full field and review possible expansion options after completing performance matching and modelling of the completed pilot in Q1FY16.\nM&A Barmer Hill Appraisal : In Q1FY16 we brought online the balance 3 appraisal wells, hence all 15 wells of the Appraisal Phase are now producing for long term testing. The first phase of appraisal testing of other fields in Barmer Hill (DP, NL and V&V) has started.\nWe remain focused on monetizing the Satellite Fields through capitalizing on existing Rajasthan infrastructure and using cost efficient approach.\nA routine operational and statutory maintenance shutdown at the Mangala Processing Terminal was planned for Q3FY16. This has been rescheduled to Q1FY17. This delay would facilitate identifying additional shutdown work required to sustain polymer breakthrough regime.\nExploration\nIn-line with our re-phased exploration program, we continued testing of key wells in the new discoveries and acquiring new 3D seismic data over high priority areas.\nDuring Q2FY16, three wells were in various stages of fraccing and testing:\nAppraisal well Raageshwari Deep Main was drilled in Q4FY15. Two zones in the Volcanics section were fracced and tested in this well during H1 FY16. Zone-2 produced oil at the average rate of 220 bopd with gas rate of 0.35 mmscfd. Zone-3 in this well has been fracced and the flow back is imminent. One zone in the Fatehgarh formation is also planned to be fracced and tested in Q3 FY16. Exploration well NL-2 drilled in Q1FY15 has been put on extended test during the quarter. A zone in Barmer Hill formation produced oil at the rate of 350 bopd. Appraisal well DP-4 drilled in Q3FY15 has been fracced in the Barmer Hill formation and flow back is in progress. Successful testing of the key wells would increase the present resource base. The total drilled and tested hydrocarbons in-place remained stable at ~1.6 bn boe and total drilled but yet be tested hydrocarbons at ~0.8 bn boe as reported in Q1FY16.\nThe seismic crew acquired a further 123 sq km of high quality 3D data in the Airfield area in DA3, completing the program over that area. Till end of Q2FY16, 64% of the seismic program in Rajasthan block has been completed. The seismic data is expected to improve the understanding of the block and increase the resource base. A new technique on seismic inversion \"Sparse Layer Inversion\" is being selectively applied to improve the vertical resolution and mappability of reservoirs in key areas.\nDuring the current financial year, activity will continue to be focused upon appraisal of the Raag Deep Gas Field extension and the key oil discoveries at DP, NL, V&V together with Saraswati Basement with the objective of progressing these discoveries to development.\nRavva (Block PKGM-1)\nAverage Daily\nProduction\nUnits\nQ2\nFY16\nQ2\nFY15\ny-o-y\n(%)\nQ1\nFY16\nq-o-q\n(%)\nH1\nFY16\nH1\nFY15\ny-o-y\n(%)\nTotal Gross operated*\nBoepd\n27,162\n23,187\n17%\n29,563\n(8%)\n28,356\n24,169\n17%\nGross operated\nBoepd\n26,064\n20,596\n27%\n28,556\n(9%)\n27,303\n22,259\n23%\nOil\nBopd\n22,491\n20,491\n10%\n25,245\n(11%)\n23,861\n20,022\n19%\nGas\nMmscfd\n21\n1\n3310%\n20\n8%\n21\n13\n54%\nWorking Interest\nBoepd\n5,864\n4,634\n27%\n6,425\n(9%)\n6,143\n5,008\n23%\n* Includes internal gas consumption\nOperations and Development\nThe Ravva block continues to be an example of good reservoir management and operational excellence, having produced more than 273 mmbbls of crude and over 341 billion cubic feet of gas since inception in 1993, far greater than the initial resource estimates at the time of the PSC award.\nDuring the quarter, the block produced a total of 2.4 million boe at an average rate of 26,064 boepd, 27% higher YoY. Though the field is on natural decline, the decline rate is arrested by employing prudent reservoir management practices including sustained higher water injection rates and deeper gas lift injection.
