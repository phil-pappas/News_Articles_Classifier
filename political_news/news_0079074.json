More Supermarkets urged to promote British food \nMr Goldsmith is one of the wealthiest politicians in the Commons, having reportedly inherited £300m in 1997 from his father, the billionaire financier and hardline eurosceptic Sir James Goldsmith. \nHe also inherited his father’s non-dom status — which allows the holder to escape taxation of overseas income — before surrendering the status during the 2010 election campaign when it attracted controversy. \nHis privileged background was evident during the campaign to become Tory candidate for London mayor, when his mother, Lady Annabel Goldsmith, donated £50,000 to his campaign. \nBut Mr Goldsmith is far from the typical Conservative. Before becoming an MP in 2010 he was the editor of radical environmentalist magazine The Ecologist, and has since become a serial rebel in the Commons. \n“I suppose what may be awkward is that I’m willing to use my vote in a strategic way, when you’re supposed to have a lobotomy,” he told the FT after his election. \nLast month he called on the government to divert some of the foreign aid budget to Kew Gardens, a UN world heritage site that lies within his constituency. \nBut he has been open about his privileged start in life, saying his money allows him to support good causes. “I got a good hand and my job is to play it as well as I can . . . You can squander a privileged position.” \nMr Goldsmith was expelled from Eton after marijuana was found in his room (he says it belonged to someone else), although he acknowledged in 2011 that he “was never particularly innocent at school”. \nHe married Alice Rothschild in 2013 at a modest venue that could only accommodate about 40 guests. But the simple event at the London Wetland Centre was a far cry from his first wedding. He married Sheherazade Bentley in 1999 in a lavish ceremony for 350 at the Ritz Hotel. \nHis brother Ben is a financier who this year floated Menhaden Capital, a trust that will back companies that focus on energy efficiency, and his sister is Jemima Khan, a journalist and former wife of the cricketer Imran.
