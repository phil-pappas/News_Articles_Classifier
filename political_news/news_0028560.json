By Patrick Marley of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 15, 2015 2:38 p.m. (0) Comments \nMadison — Republicans who control the Assembly said Thursday they were redrafting their overhaul of campaign finance laws and Democrats accused the majority party of ramming the measure through with little review during a feisty committee meeting. \n\"We're elected to represent and make intelligent decisions and you are forcing us to go ahead in an unintelligent fashion,\" Rep. Fred Kessler (D-Milwaukee) told Republicans, at times slapping the table as he protested their move. \nRep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-New Berlin) accused Kessler of \"feigned outrage\" and said he was bullying Rep. Kathleen Bernier (R-Chippewa Falls), the chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections. \n\"It's all a bunch of baloney,\" Sanfelippo said. \"When the Democrats are in charge the exact same process is used.\" \nKessler said he wasn't bullying anyone. \n\"We are the ones being bullied when we are forced to vote on something we haven't even read,\" Kessler said. \nThe move came as Republicans were poised to advance a bill to overhaul the state's elections board and put off action on legislation that would allow people to use the Internet to register to vote. \nBernier announced at the meeting the Republicans had rewritten the campaign finance bill and would give Democrats about two hours before the committee will reconvene to vote on it and send it to the Assembly. The Assembly, in turn, is scheduled to vote on it on Tuesday. \nRepublicans have not yet explained the changes they are making to the campaign finance bill . \nAs originally written, the bill would double how much donors can give to candidates, boosting from $10,000 to $20,000 the amount someone can give a candidate for governor or other statewide office. The amounts would be adjusted for inflation every five years. \nIt would also keep in place a provision from a court ruling last year that allows donors to effectively get around the limits by giving as much as they want to political parties and campaign committees controlled by legislative leaders. The parties and committees could then pass all of that money on to candidates. \nThe bill also would rewrite laws that are out of step with court rulings that have loosened campaign finance restrictions. In one change, it would codify a state Supreme Court ruling from July that said issue groups and candidates can work together. \nThe bill was debated as the committee prepared to approve separate legislation that would eliminate the state Government Accountability Board and replace it with two commissions, one to oversee elections and one to administer ethics, lobbying and campaign finance laws. The accountability board consists of six former judges and has been responsible for all those duties for the last seven years. \nIn an amendment the committee adopted, the commissions would consist of six members each — three Republicans and three Democrats. Under the original bill, each commission would have had eight members. \nIn other changes to that legislation, the chairman of the commissions would have to be approved with a two-thirds vote. Every two years, a new chairperson would have to be selected, and that person would have to be affiliated of the opposite party of the previous chairperson. \nRepublicans in recent years have said they believe the accountability board has unfairly helped Democrats, in particular because of a probe into cooperation between Gov. Scott Walker's campaign and conservative groups in recall elections. The state Supreme Court shut down that investigation this summer. \nThe board members say they are guided by the law, not partisanship, and deny they have favored Democrats. \nThe committee was originally slated to take up a bill that would allow people with Wisconsin identification cards or driver's licenses to sign up online to vote. But Bernier put off a vote on that bill an aide to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said the measure would not be taken up by the Assembly on Tuesday, as had been planned. \nWhile the bill would allow people to register to vote online, they would still have to cast ballots in person or by mail.
