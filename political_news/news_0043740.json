(AP) â€” A man who had been arguing with two hunters in north Georgia was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement agents, authorities said Sunday. Two deputies were wounded.\nJohn Harley Turner , 36, of Talking Rock, died after a shootout erupted Saturday night after the dispute between Turner and the hunters, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement.\nTurner repeatedly threatened the hunters with a pistol for being near his property in Pickens County, the GBI said. The hunters called 911 and deputies responded to Turner's home, according to the emailed statement.\nWhen deputies arrived, Turner screamed at approaching deputies and pointed his pistol at them, the GBI said.\nPickens County Sheriff's Lt. Kris Stancil said officers spent 40 minutes requesting that Turner put his gun down.\nStancil said five deputies and two troopers ultimately shot Turner with non-lethal \"beanbag rounds\" from a shotgun. But Turner, who is white, continued shooting at the deputies and wounded Sgt. Travis Curran , 37, and deputy Todd Musgrave , 44, both white, according to authorities.\nThe GBI said deputies and troopers returned fire, killing Turner.\nStancil said Musgrave was shot in the back but had a protective vest designed to prevent serious injury. Stancil said Curran was hit in the right arm. The official says both deputies were released from the hospital early Sunday.\n___\nInformation from: WXIA-TV, http://www.11alive.com/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.11alive.com/", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:33:18.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
