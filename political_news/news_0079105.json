Well, this week, hundreds (literally, hundreds) of extras got the call to film a (faux) Democrat Convention at an old sports arena in Baltimore, the city where House of Cards is filmed. While all cast members had to sign non-disclosure contracts, and had to turn over cellphones so production staff could guarantee no one sneaked out photos of the set, one can assume that a convention means Frank is at least in the running for a second term. Robin Wright , the Emmy-nominated actress who plays Claire, is wearing two hats for season four, directing most of the episodes as well as acting. Kevin Spacey , whose Underwood has earned him critical raves, also serves as executive producer. One new face on the set since filming began this summer is Neve Campbell , who was announced as a cast member in the spring. No official word on Campbell’s character, but the buzz is that she’s no fan of the Underwoods. Look for season four of House of Cards to be released on Netflix toward the end of February.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:29:44.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
