But the government this year inexplicably scrapped plans to buy the required state-of-the-art radar, a $71 million expenditure it announced last November.\nPrior to publication, the AP repeatedly requested interviews with Valakivi, the armed forces commander and air force officials to discuss the issue. While they did not respond, Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Vega, who runs counterinsurgency efforts in the river valley, said that he knew of no military officials under investigation.\n\"Corruption exists, but we are always looking out for it,\" he said. \"If we know of anyone involved, we'll throw the book at them.\"\nAfter a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Valakivi tersely announced the opening of the investigation and called the AP's report \"tendentious.\"\nDrug czar Alberto Otarola accused the AP of \"irresponsibly offending Peru's image,\" in an interview published Thursday by the La Republica newspaper. He did not return phone calls from the AP.\nThe \"narco planes\" have touched down just minutes by air from military bases in the nearly road-less region known by its Spanish acronym as the VRAEM.\nAbout four times a day, they drop onto dirt airstrips, deliver cash and pick up more than 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of partially refined cocaine, police say.\nThe AP obtained video of two such transactions taken by drug police who said they were too outgunned by assault rifle-wielding sentinels to intervene.\nOne accused narco-pilot interviewed by the AP said some local military commanders charge $10,000 per flight to let cocaine commerce go unhindered.\nThe chairman of the anti-corruption nonprofit group Transparency International, Jose Ugaz, said he hoped AP's investigation would spur debate in the upcoming presidential campaign. The election is in April.\nMilitary drug corruption \"has been going on for some time, but unfortunately no one has done anything,\" Ugaz said. It was rampant during the 1990-2000 government of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori, whom Ugaz helped put in jail as public prosecutor.\nPresident Ollanta Humala, a former army lieutenant colonel, said on taking office in 2011 that combatting illicit drugs was a priority. His government has destroyed record amounts of coca leaf.\nBut that's not enough, says Sonia Medina, the public prosecutor for illicit drugs.\nTrafficking and related corruption in the police, military, courts and criminal justice system have gone \"from bad to worse\" on Humala's watch, she said. \"What we are doing in counter-narcotics is completely distorted, incoherent and inert.\"\nMost of Peru's cocaine production has merely shifted to the Ireland-sized VRAEM region, where there is no eradication.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:20:19.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
