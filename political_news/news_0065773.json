You hit snooze until the last possible minute and jolt awake in a panic. Your hair is greasy and you have zero time to figure out what to wear, much less take a shower. For those moments, this is the outfit you can throw on and head out the door without feeling like a complete mess.\nBegin with a cozy turtleneck in a rich color like this burgundy Nili Lotan one that feels as soft as Drake . Should you want a similar look at a much lower price point, Zara has an equally nubby option . Pair with a skirt that hits you at the hips and ankle boots (plus tights, when it's cold enough) and you're good to go. And that greasy hair? Sweep it up and use a sleek hairpin.\nPhoto: Jody Rogac Photo: Jody Rogac\nNili Lotan half cardigan stitch turtleneck, $995 at Nili Lotan ; M.M. La Fleur Chelsea skirt, $210 at M.M.
