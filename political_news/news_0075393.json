The studio has been criticized in the past for not highlighting its female superheroes in stand-alone films.\nThe next will be \"Captain Marvel,\" which has been pushed back to March of 2019.\nEvangeline Lilly portrayed the Wasp in the first Ant-Man film, which earned $409.8 million worldwide.\nThe announcement did not specify whether she or Paul Rudd, who played Ant-Man, would be reprising their roles for the sequel, but most actors in Marvel films are signed for multi-year, multi-film contracts.\nAlso coming in the summer of 2018 is \"Toy Story 4,\" which has been delayed a year.\nWalt Disney Animation Studios and John Lasseter, CEO of Pixar, said in August at the D23 fan convention, that the film will be a love story between Woody and Bo Peep, who have been voiced in previous films by Tom Hanks and Annie Potts.\nDisney also announced six untitled films for 2020, including three Marvel films, two Pixar releases, and one Disney Animation offering.\n\"Black Panther,\" starring Chadwick Boseman, was moved up five months for a February 2018 release.\n___\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
