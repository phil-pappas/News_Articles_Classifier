Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi presented three dossiers to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 's office alleging Indian involvement in fomenting unrest in Pakistan.\nLohdi told The Associated Press the dossiers include information about \"India's involvement and support to terrorism in different parts of Pakistan.\"\nOne dossier relates to Pakistan's tribal areas, another relates to Karachi, and the third to the southwestern region of Baluchistan, she said. \"So the idea is to really go to the international community through the U.N. secretary-general and to expose the kind of destabilizing actions that India is taking against my country.\"\nPakistan and India have a history of uneasy relations and they have fought two of their three wars over the disputed Kashmir region, which is claimed by both countries. Forces on both sides of the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir, have traded fire several times in recent weeks.\nLohdi cited the \"escalating tensions in the region\" as the reason Islamabad was taking this step. \"We believe that these actions must stop,\" she said, and she called for a return to dialogue. \"We're ready to go anywhere, at any level, to resume the dialogue process, but this dialogue cannot be on the basis of preconditions.\"\nShe said India had not responded to her move, and she said her country was \"disappointed\" at the response that India's foreign minister gave to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 's Wednesday speech to the U.N. General Assembly — in which Pakistan offered a four-point peace initiative.\nShe called India's response the following day \"non-serious\" and called on India, \"Why don't you put something on the table, too?\"\nShe said Pakistan is in conversation with the U.N. about \"how best to take this forward.\"\n___\nAhmed reported from Islamabad", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:14:54.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
