Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). (Danny Moloshok/Associated Press) October 21 at 5:21 PM The Oct. 18 front-page article “ Sanders the socialist embraces his moment ” said, “Twenty-four years after the end of the Cold War, many Americans no longer associate socialism with fear or missiles — or with failure, food lines or empty Soviet supermarkets.” That’s because the Soviet system of government was communism, not socialism.\nMost Americans who pay attention associate socialism — particularly what many, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), call democratic socialism — with European nations and Canada. By most measures, the residents of those countries are faring better than most Americans. Median per capita income has stagnated here in the past 15 years, but it has increased considerably in Canada and Northern Europe . Canadians and most Europeans get free health care and subsidized child care. They receive more vacation time and more generous unemployment benefits. They work fewer hours and live longer. Paid sick leave and parental leave are standard. And there is more opportunity in Canada and Europe to move up the social ladder.\nYes, the U.S. economy has outpaced those of Canada and Europe, but nearly all of the gains have gone to the 1 percent. Our winner-take-all economy works — for the uber-rich. The democratic socialist economies of Canada and Europe work for nearly everybody.\nElliott Negin , Washington\n●\nIt is clear that George F. Will has no understanding of what the movement led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is trying to achieve [“ Comfortable but envious ,” op-ed, Oct. 18]. Nobody is asking for income equality. Mr. Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, is trying to address the fact that there is a massive imbalance in how the benefits of a free capitalist society are shared. We would all like to win the lottery, but most of us are happy to ply our trades and create a comfortable, somewhat secure life, which is becoming increasingly difficult with the winner-take-all system we have in place.\nI suspect that Mr. Sanders would embrace Harry Frankfurt’s “doctrine of sufficiency” that everyone should have enough. The difficulty is in creating a society where a reasonable balance (not equality) is possible so that whether you choose to be a carpenter or a hedge fund manager, you can expect to be able to live a comfortable life. This shouldn’t be so hard to understand.\nChuck Newell , Herndon", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:21:44.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
