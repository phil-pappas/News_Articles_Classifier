However, the commission will send a \"letter of reprimand\" to the city council. The commission also voted to require that Zimmerman file the reports, but stopped short of recommending prosecution because it was a \"minor\" offense. \nThe forms Zimmerman failed to submit include candidate's final expenditures, donations and remaining funds. \nKVUE's news partners at the Austin American-Statesman report that council members rarely become targeted for ethics complaints outside the campaign season. This is also the first letter of reprimand issued to a sitting city council member since at least August 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:12:07.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
