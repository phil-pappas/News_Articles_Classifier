(Family photo) October 18 at 7:50 PM The Peace Corps is clearly pleased with itself for reaching record numbers of applicants, but is that a good thing [“ Peace Corps gets 23,000 volunteers ,” news, Oct. 14]? Lost in the Kennedy-era nostalgia and self-congratulation about a revamped application process is the agency’s long-standing record of failing to protect volunteers’ safety.\nEven after the 2011 Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act — named for a volunteer found murdered in her West African village, largely because of the country director’s failure to properly handle Puzey’s whistleblowing of sexual misconduct by a local — we’re seeing anything but volunteer protection.\nSexual assaults are occurring at a staggering rate of at least once a week (with well more than half of all incidents going unreported ). And more than once in recent years, the inspector general has confirmed volunteer deaths occurred as a result of negligent medical attention from Peace Corps doctors . Despite nominal attempts at rectifying this breathtaking incompetence, the numbers don’t lie — nor do the endless documented examples of the agency’s disregard for victims and their families .\nA 40-year high in applications? Let’s save the celebration for when the Peace Corps proves it is dedicated to ensuring its applicants and volunteers don’t get another title: victims.\nJ.
