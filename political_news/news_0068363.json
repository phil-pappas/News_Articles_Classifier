(Mike Sullivan/Roseburg News-Review via AP) more > By JEFF BARNARD and GOSIA WOZNIACKA - Associated Press - Friday, October 2, 2015 \nROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) - A gunman opened fire inside a classroom at a rural Oregon community college Thursday, killing at least nine people before dying in a shootout with police, authorities said. One survivor said he demanded his victims state their religion before he started shooting. \nThe attack shattered the first week of classes at Umpqua Community College in the small timber town of Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland. \nThe killer was identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, according to a government official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided the name on condition of anonymity. Authorities shed no light on his motive and said they were investigating. \nHannah Miles, a 19-year-old freshman, was in her writing class when her teacher got a call from security saying the school was in lockdown. She heard gunshots from a neighboring classroom. \nHuddled together in the locked classroom, the students and teacher heard a footsteps outside and a man’s voice call out to them, “Come on out, come on out,” Miles said. They remained quiet and didn’t open the door. \nPolice soon arrived, Miles said, and after students were convinced that it was indeed officers, they opened the door. \n“It was like a huge burden had been lifted,” she said. “A huge sigh of relief that we were going to be OK.” \nDouglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said at least two officers acted heroically in the shootout, but it was not clear if the gunman was killed by authorities or whether he took his own life. \nAt a news conference, a visibly angry Hanlin said he would not name the shooter. \n“I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act,” he said. \nLate Thursday hundreds gathered at a local park for a vigil for the victims. Many held up candles as the hymn “Amazing Grace” was played. \nMercer had been living at an apartment complex in nearby Winchester. Yellow police tape surrounded the building Thursday night. \nA neighbor, Bronte Harte, said Mercer would “sit by himself in the dark in the balcony with this little light.” \nHart said a woman she believed to be Mercer’s mother also lived upstairs and was “crying her eyes out” Thursday. \nSarah Cobb, 17, was in a writing class when gunfire erupted in the next room. She heard a shot, but thought a book had fallen. Then a teacher said they needed to get out, and the class ran out the door as she heard two more shots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:21:09.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
