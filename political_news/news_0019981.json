(AP) â€” John McCain and Lindsey Graham are wrapping up another trip to New Hampshire to boost Graham's presidential bid with a house party at the home of New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper. The house party concludes a three-day, 10-stop trip by Graham, a South Carolina senator, and McCain, an Arizona senator and two-time New Hampshire primary winner. Graham is struggling to gain traction among a crowded Republican primary field despite the support from McCain, who's traveled to the state to campaign alongside Graham several times. The weekend included stops at a Manchester bingo hall and diner, the Salem American Legion and the Raymond and Pelham VFW. Graham is focusing his campaign on national security issues. The two also campaigned in Rochester, Canterbury and Goffstown. fosters.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:28:10.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
