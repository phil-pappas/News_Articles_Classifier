Governments will then be required to ensure there is a surplus in \"normal times\".\nThis will be when the independent Office for Budget Responsibility judges that the UK is experiencing real GDP growth of less than 1% a year, as measured on a rolling four-quarter basis.\nLabour's previous leadership backed the move, despite calling it a \"gimmick\".\nThe U-Turn Image copyright AP Image caption There were anti austerity protests outside the Conservative Party conference in Manchester Soon after his appointment, Mr McDonnell said he would support the charter, saying Labour was serious about deficit reduction - although he had a markedly different approach to the Conservatives towards balancing the books.\nBut he has now pointed to a \"growing reaction\" to the \"nature and scale\" of public spending cuts, saying Labour will vote against the charter to \"underline our position as an anti-austerity party\".\nLabour will set out an alternative plan for tackling the deficit, he says.\nThe reaction Many Labour MPs agree the charter should be opposed, but are unhappy at the way the decision has been reached.\nMr McDonnell's predecessor as shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, says the decision to \"go from one extreme to the other... sends the wrong message to the general public\".\nMr Corbyn's supporters say the Parliamentary Labour Party should accept the mandate of his comprehensive victory in the leadership contest, with shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott saying some in the party are still \"coming to terms\" with his victory.\nWednesday's vote on the charter will not be the final time Mr Corbyn's leadership is tested in the House of Commons.\nNuclear weapons Image copyright PA An issue where Mr Corbyn's views are in direct conflict with party policy. Labour is presently committed to renewing the Trident missile system, but the party's leader is committed to opposing it, and has said he would not fire nuclear weapons if he were prime minister.\nMr Corbyn says Trident will form part of a defence review being carried out by shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle. But unless he can change Labour's policy - and a bid to get it debated at conference last month was rejected - he faces the unusual prospect of rebelling against his own party when Parliament votes on the issue next year.\nLabour MPs could be given a free vote, which means they will not be bound by party lines, to avoid this happening.\nSyria air strikes Image copyright AP David Cameron is hoping to build Commons support for air strikes on so-called Islamic State militants in Syria. Mr Corbyn is opposed to any military intervention, but not all of his MPs - or his shadow cabinet - share this view.\nThe divisions were underlined by a bad-tempered Twitter exchange involving shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott, who criticised Labour MP Jo Cox for proposing military action to protect civilians. Ms Abbott was branded an \"internet troll\" by Labour MP John Woodcock after she accused him and Ms Cox of wanting to \"support Cameron in his long held desire to bomb Syria\".\nIn his party conference speech, Mr Corbyn said \"the answer to this complex and tragic conflict can't simply be found in a few more bombs\".\nAlso at the party conference, Mr McDonnell suggested a free vote could be held, saying he did not expect consensus within the party and that he believed a vote on military action in Syria should be made \"on the basis of conscience\".\nWelfare cap Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There is a limit on the total benefits a household can receive The government's cap on overall household benefits had already split the Labour Party before Mr Corbyn took over, with 48 of its MPs opposing the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, which will reduce the cap to £23,000 in London and £20,000 in the rest of the country, in defiance of the then interim leader Harriet Harman's order to abstain.\nMr Corbyn has said he wants to scrap the cap altogether, calling the policy \"devastating\". But Owen Smith, his shadow work and pensions secretary, has said Labour is only opposing plans to reduce it.\nCrises averted", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/653117542886699008", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0D29/production/_86096330_029466863-1.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34369166", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-will-match-osborne-and-live-within-our-means", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6FC1/production/_86090682_029558941-1.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21A1/production/_86090680_029340621-1.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/BDE1/production/_86090684_022639634-1.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10C01/production/_86090686_009115938-1.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34508959", "http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/11/british-forces-ethical-solution-syria-humanitarian-crisis"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:35:38.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
