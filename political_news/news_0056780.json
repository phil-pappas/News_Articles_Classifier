Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif raised the Kashmir issue at the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) today.\nComparing the situation of Kashmiris to that of Palestinians, he said that the UN has persistently failed to resolve Kashmir issue. \"Palestinians and Kashmiris have their regions occupied by foreign forces. In 1997, when the composite dialogue was launched with India, Kashmir and peace were the main issue. Since 1947, the Kashmiri dispute has remain unresolved,\" Sharif said. He also said that consultations with Kashmiris was key for peace in the region.\nHe said that steps must be taken to demilitarise Kashmir and the relation between India and Pakistan should be marked by co-operation than violence. \"Pakistan neither wants to nor is engaged in any arms race in South Asia. Cooperation, not confrontation, should define relationship between India and Pakistan,\" he said. He also proposed Sharif a new four-point peace initiative including demilitarisation of Kashmir and Siachen and formalisation of border.\nHe also said that ceasefire violations by India was intensifying. \"Today, ceasefire violations along the Line of Control are intensifying. We propose that Pakistan, India formulise and respect the 2003 agreement.\" Pakistan called for UNMOGIP's expansion.\nSharif raised the issue of having a plebiscite in Kashmir during his talks with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and also demanded implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir. It is expected that he will also mention incidents of border violence and tension along the Line of Control that separates Pakistan and India in Kashmir.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:23:07.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
