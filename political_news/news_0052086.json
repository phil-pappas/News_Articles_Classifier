Posted 0 \nPro-life supporters around the country are rejoicing at the news released Friday that the US House of Representatives voted to end taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. The news seems almost impossible in the face of all the media support of the organization and the media's inability to accept that the tapes of abortion clinic personnel discussing the sale of fetal body parts were real. \nLiveactionnews.org gave this report: The U.S. House voted today on legislation to halt the taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, which has been caught harvesting the body parts of aborted babies, among other scandals. The House approved H.R. 3762, a reconciliation bill which cannot be filibustered in the U.S. Senate, on a near party-line 240-189 vote. The bill can pass the Senate chamber with 51 votes, rather than than the 60-vote threshold. H.R. 3762 places a freeze on certain federal payments to the abortion giant for one year. Only seven House Republicans voted in opposition to the measure, while one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn), voted in favor. Reps. Ken Buck (Col.) Bob Dold (Ill.), Richard Hanna (NY), Walter Jones (NC), Mark Meadows (NC) and Matt Salmon (AZ) were the seven Republicans who broke party ranks. \nIf the Senate passes the legislation, the President will have the final say. Since the bill is only calling for a one-year hold on support to Planned Parenthood, he may be willing to concede. Even so, with majority support, a presidential veto could be overridden. \nThe fact that the House has passed legislation that takes any money away from Planned Parenthood is hard to comprehend. Let us hold on to this victory and press forward to urge the Senate and the President to follow suit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:26:56.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
