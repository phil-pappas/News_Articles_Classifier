Why not ask the real question - how did anyone exchange classified information (with HRC) without realizing that it was not a secure site?

This classified stuff did not originate from HRC's private site - but it was purposefully sent there. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists to adapt the world to himself.
