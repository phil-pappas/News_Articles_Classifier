There is no change to New Zealand’s standard 20-year patent period, and efficient processes in New Zealand mean that it is unlikely there will be many applications to extend patent terms. \n“There are also provisions that allows the Government to rule out ISDS challenges over tobacco control measures. \n“However, we still need to see the details of the agreement, and a careful, thorough analysis is needed. There is a lot more to learn—and, to understand fully its impact on health, we still believe that an independent Health Impact Analysis is needed.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:44:30.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
