At the end of last month, Walker reported having less than $1 million in his bank account – a small fraction of what many of his rivals, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, had. Even struggling Rand Paul reported having more than double the Wisconsin governor. Those close to Walker say his cash-on-hand figure is still on the path downward, with expensive campaign vendor costs still coming in the door.\nIn the end, Walker’s campaign spent much and raised relatively little: Over the course of his less than three months in the race, he raised just over $7 million. The campaign had more than $161,000 in outstanding debts and obligations, some of them to printing and photography companies.\nWhen Walker announced that he was suspending his campaign, aides said a chief factor shaping his decision was his dire financial position. Hours before he dropped out, Walker huddled with a number of longtime aides in the governor’s mansion. There, they presented him with a detailed readout of his money woes.\nWalker’s report detailed a campaign that spent freely on staffers, outside consultants, and even Uber rides.\nHow much the 2016 contenders have raised By Kyle Cheney\nMany of Walker’s staffers, even relatively junior ones, reported making salaries of over $9,000 a month. His most senior adviser, campaign manager Rick Wiley, made over $16,000 each month.\nVendors also won out in the Walker rainmaking. Last month, the campaign paid FLS Connect, a data marketing firm, $50,000. In August, The Tarrance Group, a polling company, raked in over $35,000.\nThe campaign also spent big on transportation, with large sums spent on airlines like Delta and United and on rental cars. Then there’s Uber: In August, one staffer spent $102 on a single Uber ride during a visit to San Francisco.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:48:00.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
