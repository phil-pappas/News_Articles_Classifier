Andrew Cuomo spent all day Wednesday in Onondaga County without making a big jobs announcement.\nHe found a new home for Super DIRT Week and more tax credits for Anheuser-Busch, a move in the ongoing effort to keep the plant in Lysander, according to the governor.\nAnd he brought $16 million to build more housing for homeless people in Onondaga, Oswego, Madison and Cayuga counties.\nBut at the end of his \"Capital for a Day\" in Syracuse, there was no celebratory announcement for the region like he made in Utica in August . There, Oneida County officials learned that GE and Ams were moving to Marcy, bringing $2 billion in private investments and 2,000 jobs to the area.\nIn Cuomo's five years as governor, Buffalo has gotten its billion dollars and Rochester a $250 million investment in a photonics hub.\nSyracuse and Central New York, by contrast, have wracked up hundreds of millions of dollars in state economic aid for much smaller projects instead of for a single, economic game-changer.\nWednesday proved no exception.\nDuring his day-long visit to Onondaga County, the governor made two stops in Syracuse. He toured the construction at the Inner Harbor and the renovation of the Hotel Syracuse .\nCuomo's money announcements were in the suburbs – another round of tax credits to help Anheuser-Busch in Lysander and a $5 million grant to secure Super DIRT Week at a new raceway in Hastings, in Oswego County, for the next decade.\nCuomo talked about the state's growing investment in recreating the New York State Fairgrounds, which has grown to more than $60 million. He said the new fairgrounds, the Lakeview Amphitheater are just two of the local projects helping to improve the Syracuse area.\n\"Put that together with the Inner Harbor development, with the historic redevelopment of Hotel Syracuse, you start to feel the synergy among these projects and how that is actually a multiplier effect,\" Cuomo said Wednesday. (Those projects are supported with state money). \"It's exciting. You really get the sense that the arrow is pointed in a different direction.\"\nAll told, Cuomo and his aides dropped $77.8 million in Central New York on Wednesday in tax credits, grants and construction money to preserve jobs, help local colleges and boost tourism in the region.\n\"I think all of these things they announced are jobs,\" Assemblyman Bill Magnarelli, D-Syracuse, said of the spending, which ranged from rebuilding roads and bridges to creating a new lab among five area SUNY schools.\nWhile some area lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, acknowledged the lack of a jobs announcement here Wednesday, they also urged patience. Syracuse and Central New York are in the running for a competition to win $500 million in economic development money that will be awarded at the end of the year.\n\"I'm hoping to win the $500 million,\" said Will Barclay, R-Pulaski, who praised Cuomo, a Democrat, for the day-long event. \"I want him here. And I want him back. And I want our $500 million.\"\nMagnarelli agreed. \"I think there are jobs to be put back into Syracuse,\" he said. \"And I think they are coming.\"\nCuomo's economic development commissioner, fanned those hopes during an early-morning cabinet meeting at the Holiday Inn in Salina.\n\"I am bullish, bullish, bullish on Syracuse and Central New York,\" Howard Zemsky told the packed room.\nThere was some promise on the jobs front on Wednesday. The Port of Oswego Authority is considering a cargo distribution center for DeWitt. That could create 2,000 jobs. But it's a proposal that's part of the Syracuse region's application in Cuomo's competition for $500 million in Upstate economic development funds.\nLawmakers also commended Cuomo for bringing capital officials to the Syracuse area. During the day, rank-and-file lawmakers like Barclay got to talk with top Cuomo administrators, meetings that don't easily happen back in Albany.\nBarclay said he got to talk to Cuomo's top energy administrator about Entergy's threats to close the Fitzpatrick nuclear plant . Assemblyman Al Stirpe, D-Cicero, spent part of the day with the state's park commissioner talking about how to improve tourism and use along Lake Ontario's New York shoreline.\nStirpe also said he thought the agenda included extra help for homeless people and drug addicts because of recent headlines . \"It's not what you want to be known for,\" he said. But the need is there, he added.\nOther problems -- like Syracuse's struggling schools and its aging water system -- were barely addressed at all.\nThe Syracuse City School District did get some help -- $1.25 million to combat childhood obesity. Yet there was no working group session devoted to the school district, which has chronic problems with student discipline and achievement.\nSen. John DeFrancisco, R-Syracuse, didn't fault Cuomo for putting those school issues aside on Wednesday.\n\"I don't know what more he could have said, to be honest with you,\" DeFrancisco said about tackling the city schools' problems. Already, he added, the district got $1 million more than requested in this year's budget. \"You can only do so much. And after a while, throwing money into a situation isn't the only answer.\"\nDeFrancisco's only criticism of the day was the late notice for the dozens of meetings and events in the region.\n\"It's a great concept – but there needs to be more advance notice,\" he said, \"so that people can really gain access to it. Including the general public.\"\nChris Nyberg, the dean of agriculture, sustainability, business, and entrepreneurship at Morrisville State got about 48 hours' notice that the school was finally getting $12.9 million to build an Alternative Fuels Facility at the Madison County college.\nThe building has been at the top of the school's master plan for years. Its construction means a variety of ag-related disciplines – from farm operations to diesel technology to renewable energy – can all be under one roof.\nAnd, Nyberg said today, the new space will mean the school can attract more students who, as of now, are finding work after college. \"There is clearly an industry demand,\" he said.\nHere are some highlights from Wednesday's announcements:\nJobs\n$2 million in another round of tax credits for Anheuser-Busch InBev . Cuomo said the beer giant's investment in its Baldwinsville plant - which Anheuser-Bush announced in June - will help preserve more than 400 jobs.\nHigher education\n$18 million to establish the innovative 5-campus SUNY Labs to Jobs Consortium\n$12.9 million for a new Alternative Fuels Facility at Morrisville State College.\nRoads and bridges\n$11 million for ongoing improvements to State Route 104 in Oswego.\n$3.4 million to replace the North Burdick Street Bridge in Fayetteville.\n$2.6 million for the second phase of the South Street Reconstruction Project in Auburn.\nHealth\n$2 million to unify and expand psychiatric services at the Hutchings Psychiatric Center's Madison Street Clinic in downtown Syracuse.\n$1.25 million to combat obesity in the Syracuse city schools.\n100 additional patients will be able to seek treatment for opioid addictions at a treatment center at Conifer Park in Liverpool.\nHomelessness\n$7.9 million for 68 new housing units for the Rescue Mission in Syracuse.\n$6.4 million for the Auburn Housing Authority to help build 28 new units for permanent and transitional housing.\n$1 million for the Madison County Community Action Program to construct permanent housing.\n$500,000 to Oswego County Opportunities to rehabilitate transitional housing for homeless youth.\nParks & Rec\n$5 million to help move Super DIRT Week from the New York State Fairgrounds to the Central New York Raceway Park in Hastings.\n$2.6 million for a safe docking area in Brewerton for barges, tour boats, and pleasure boats on the Erie Canal.\n$750,000 to improve access to the new Lakeview Amphitheater from Onondaga Lake and the Loop the Lake Trail in Onondaga County.\n$90,000 to expand access to Cazenovia Lake at Helen L. McNitt State Park in Madison County.\nContact Teri Weaver at tweaver@syracuse.com , 315-470-2274 or on Twitter at @TeriKWeaver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:20:05.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
