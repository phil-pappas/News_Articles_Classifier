Nikki Haley said 281 roads remain closed after historic flooding washed away thoroughfares and severely damaged bridges. Cynthia Roldan/Staff × WEST COLUMBIA — South Carolina is returning to normal quickly from the historic, damaging flooding, Gov. Nikki Haley said on Wednesday.\nRoad closures are down 48 percent, from 541 to 281, Haley said during a press conference from the S.C. Emergency Management Division’s headquarters. Of the roads that are closed, 84 have bridges.\nThe Department of Health and Environmental Control is also moving swiftly to inspect the state’s dams, having already assessed 357, she added. The state is also “reconfiguring the way that we do dams in South Carolina.”\n“We are looking at, do we have enough engineers to monitor those dams, how are we going to go maintain those dams going forward and what’s the new plan for the new South Carolina as we go forward with that,” she said.\nDHEC Director Catherine Heigel added that the agency has learned from the floods what it does well and what they have to improve on, and is already working on it. Much of the challenge is that many of the state’s dams belong to private property owners. But the agency is aiming to inspect dams that could damage infrastructure or cause loss of life, if they were to fail, by Oct. 25, Heigel said.\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Jay Lucas announced through a written release that he has instructed the House’s budget writing panel to look into disaster costs. Members of the Ways and Means Committee will hold hearings with state agency officials to assess the impact of the flooding and the potentials costs of the recovery, he added.\n“At this point in time, it is clear that full assessments and exact estimates for the damage done are not yet known and may take time to determine,” Lucas said. “However, idly sitting back and waiting for these specifics is not an option. It will ultimately be the responsibility of the General Assembly to provide the means and method of recovery.”\nThe state’s most powerful lawmaker, Senate President Pro Tem Sen. Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, already warned Tuesday that recovery costs would have a “horrendous” impact on the state budget during the upcoming legislative year.\nLeatherman, who heads the Senate’s state budget writing panel, said legislators will likely revisit a borrowing plan that died last year after Haley likened the effort to running up the state’s credit card.\nHaley, however, said it was too soon to start discussing borrowing.\n“Right now, I’m just trying to get us through a storm,” she said. “In all honesty, we have not had time to think about the legislative session coming up. There will be a time and place for that.”\nReach Cynthia Roldan (843) 577-7111.\nReporter’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that DHEC had assessed 357 dams as of Oct. 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:49:30.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
