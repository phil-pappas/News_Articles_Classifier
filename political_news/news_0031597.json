Prakash has openly accused PeeCee and her family and he is in no mood of burying the hatchet.\nThings turned sour between Priyanka and her then manager, Prakash, when she suddenly terminated his services. Prakash filed a criminal suit against the actress in Andheri court, Mumbai.\nIt all started when Prakash accused Priyanka of not clearing his dues and her father for the whole incident. Things turned worse when Prakash blamed Priyanka for having Chhota Shakeel threaten him through phone calls on behalf of her.\nIn 2008, Priyanka’s father went to Police and filed a complaint against Prakash for interfering in his daughter’s privacy. Prakash ended up serving 67 days in jail.\nAfter Prakash got out of jail, he met Priyanka’s ex-boyfriend Aseem Merchant. The two decided to make a film together titled as ’67 Days’, which was a biopic on Prakash.\nSoon enough, Priyanka noticed that the film’s promotions revolved around her and sent Aseem a legal notice and the film was dashed.\n entertainment Bollywood Priyanka Chopra Prakash Jaju Also Read Kim Kardashian's 'Break The Internet' becomes the butt of all jokes Roundup 2013: The biggest Bollywood flops of 2013 Dhanush celebrates with Amitabh Bachchan First look: Priyanka Chopra plays cabaret dancer in 'Gunday'", "external_links": ["http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/11_47.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/tyutu7u_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/dfdf.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ertgrt.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/tyutu7u_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/B2.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/B1.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/dgfryt778_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/C5_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151019/entertainment-bollywood/article/priyanka-chopras-former-secretary-prakash-jaju-back-trashes", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/dgryty_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/C4_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/c2.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Screen-Shot-10-19-15-adfdft.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/dfdv.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/C1.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/tferg5t_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/c6.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/C4.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/c3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:17.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
