The chased car, driven by a 20-year-old, jumped the curb and smashed into her as she was walking her dog next to Branch Brook Park.\nShe suffered broken bones, a crushed right foot, cuts, bruises and bleeding on the brain. She was unconscious for two weeks on a ventilator, antibiotics dripping into a vein, and with a feeding tube in the ICU Ward at University Hospital.\nShe underwent many operations and is now in a New Jersey rehab facility. She cannot carry on a conversation and can only say a few words. Her right arm is useless, and she may never walk again.\nThis tragic event spurred me to look into police car chases. I found the website Pursuit Safety, a national organization that \"works to reduce avoidable police pursuits through consistently applied and restrictive pursuit policies and legislation.\" Their research has turned up sobering statistics:\n* 35 to 40 percent of vehicular police pursuits end in a collision.\n* 91.4 percent of chases are for non-violent crimes.\n* An average of one person a day is killed as a result of these chases, more than a third being innocent bystanders; one officer dies every six to eight weeks.\n* Thousands more face injuries that include becoming paralyzed and/or brain damaged.\n* There is no mandatory reporting of chases, so the numbers could be much higher.\n* If only violent felons were pursued, nine out of 10 chases would be eliminated.\nNew Jersey has a document entitled, \"Police Vehicle Pursuit Policy.\" It says police chases should be avoided as much as possible, but details 10 offenses that can be used to pursue vehicles. \nSome are very broad-based and give officers a wide latitude in decision-making. For example, under Aggravated Assault is found \"Attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another….\" Under Criminal Restraint: \"Restrains another unlawfully in circumstances exposing the other to risk of serious bodily injury….\"\nNote the words \"attempts to cause\" and \"exposing the other to risk….\" In these cases, no injury has occurred, and yet a police officer can begin a car chase.\nBloomfield reviews \nBloomfield Acing Police Director Samuel DeMaio said in an interview that, in Bloomfield, public safety takes precedence over crimes against property or crimes that do not present an immediate threat to the public. \nHe explained that police cars, as in other towns, have video cameras that scan license plates. When a red flag appears, indicating that a driver has an outstanding violation, police must decide whether to follow the vehicle or not, and they must check by phone with a supervisor as they begin to follow, to see whether they should continue or call off the pursuit. \nFor example, if this occurred during school hours, a chase would not take place. \nMr. DeMaio said that, once a month, there is a Pursuit Review Board meeting of all police with the ranking of captain or above in which all the chases are analyzed to see if they were warranted and if the necessary safety precautions were taken. \nTo determine this, the officers review all the videos of police pursuits, which a GPS records, that tell how fast the police car was going, the streets passed and how it was maneuvering. These videos can be used during the New Jersey mandatory in-service vehicular pursuit training for all police twice a year.\nThere are new technologies available to help avoid police chases, but they are expensive, and as an editorial on the Pursuit Safety website says, \"don’t take the place of safe and smart policy…. All departments should adopt a policy that requires adequate training of all police officers, only pursue violent felons, allow for complete and painstaking review of all incidents, and make available to the public all requested information.\"\n‘Safer Way’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:52:01.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
