Key Drivers of Asian Economies Variable Global: US policy direction will remain a source of instability in financial markets US monetary policy Federal Reserve weakly signals a December rate rise Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last month depicted a Fed that remained uncertain about the US economic outlook, particularly wanting to see if the risks from a China-led slowdown would undermine its recovery. The FOMC even contemplated allowing the unemployment rate to fall below its natural rate as a way of nudging inflation to reach its 2% target. Statements by several Federal Reserve officials including Vice-Chair Fischer this week showed that these uncertainties remained: While a December rate raise is still on the table, it is not a given. They were not confident that inflation would reach the Fed’s 2% target and were more worried than in the past that global risks could threaten growth and inflation prospects in the US. Weaker economic readings add to uncertainty: The Federal Reserve’s labour market conditions dropped to zero in Sep 15, down from 1.2 in Aug 15. The ISM nonmanufacturing index also dropped to 56.9 in Sep 15, down from 59.0 in Aug 15. \nImplications: Asian financial markets will become volatile again in the near term: Economic data is unlikely to be straightforward, and will pull expectations of a Fed rate rise hither and thither. Over the next few months, we remain confident that the US economy will surprise positively, which means the markets will eventually price in a high chance of a December rate lift off. Global growth and financial stability risks IMF and World Bank cut global forecasts, warn of financial risks The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its global growth forecast to 3.1% in 2015 and 3.6% in 2016. The World Bank cut its growth forecasts for developing East Asia and the Pacific to 6.5% in 2015 and 6.4% in 2016. The OECD indicator fell marginally to 99.9 in Aug 15, down from 100.0 in Jul 15: strength in developed economies especially Europe was offset by weakness in large emerging economies except India. The IMF has also warned of global financial risks rotating from advanced economies where they are diminishing, to emerging economies where the build up of foreign currency denominated private sector debt makes these emerging economies susceptible to the coming tightening of global financial conditions. Asian data: Export weakness except in Malaysia Taiwan: Economy decelerating Economic deceleration persists, led by trade funk Weak trade sector: Exports fell 14.6% y/y in Sep 15, a slight lift from a decline of 14.8% y/y in Aug 15. Imports dropped sharply by 24.5% y/y in Sep 15, further from a 16.7% y/y decline in Aug 15. Inflation not really turning around: After 8 months of deflation, consumer prices rose 0.3% y/y in Sep 15, from a fall of 0.4% y/y in Aug 15. However, much of this was due to the effects of the typhoon on food prices in September. Prices of non-tradables such as housing and services continued to stagnate or fall, suggesting that deflationary conditions persist. Malaysia: Exports Exports up, led by manufacturing sector, reflecting weaker Ringgit Exports increased 4.1% y/y in Aug 15, up from a 3.5% y/y increase in Jul 15. Led by growth in manufactured goods exports, August marks the third consecutive month of increasing exports. Imports contracted by 6.1% y/y in Aug 15, down from a 5.9% y/y increase in Jul 15. Trade surplus: Malaysia’s trade balance recorded a surplus of MYR10.2bn in Aug 15, up from Jul 15’s surplus of MYR2.4bn. \n(See below for a detailed assessment of Malaysia’s prospects) Philippines: Economy slowing down, albeit from a high base Economy entering a period of slowdown While CPI increased by 0.4% y/y in Sep 15, it still represents a slight dip from 0.6% y/y in Aug 15. Core inflation was 1.4% y/y in Sep 15. Industrial production dropped by 4.6% y/y in Aug 15, a slight relief compared to a 7.2% y/y fall in Jul 15. More encouragingly, manufacturing volumes are up. Meanwhile, exports fell 6.3% y/y in Aug 15, down from a 1.8% y/y decline in Jul 15. \nImplications: As the global economy continues to face headwinds, declining production and trade performance for the Philippines is unsurprising. As the base effect thins and El Nino risks come back into play, CPI inflation will rise. However, with disinflationary forces lingering in the economy, the upside correction to inflation is likely to fall short of the Central Bank’s target. Are Indonesian policies self destructive? Indonesia’s Third Economic Stimulus Package Stimulus provides only short-term relief Indonesia unveiled its third economic policy package with notable adjustments to the energy sector. The package included a IDR200/l price cut for diesel, improved safety nets for farmers and the working class as well as insurance plans against crop failures. \nImplications: The policies, which aim to reduce production costs for businesses maintain a focus on labour and small businesses – improvements of which will bolster growth. The risks posed by Indonesia’s series of economic policy packages lies within policy making itself, the extent of which could cancel out the positive efforts that are taking shape to create an enabling environment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership: Geopolitics at the fore but economic gains are potentially huge \nAfter five years of protracted negotiations, leaders of 12 Pacific Rim countries concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP), the most far-reaching trade agreement since the Uruguay Round of the 1990s. The TPP is important because (a) it covers about USD30 trillion of economic output, accounting for about 40% of the world economy; (b) It is much more than a trade deal, encompassing agreements on labour and environmental standards as well a non-tariff barriers; and (c) It has tremendous geo-political consequences, underscoring the US rebalance to Asia and signals a robust response to a rising China. \nHighlights of the TPP \nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement was negotiated in secret and few details are publicly known until the full text is made available. Box 1 summarises the highlights. \nBox 1: Highlights of the TPP Agreement 12 Pacific countries – namely, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, USA and Vietnam – agreed to cut trade barriers on an extensive range of industries from automobiles to agriculture to biologic drugs. The agreement will also promote higher labour and environmental standards in the signatory countries, along with more stringent protection of intellectual property rights. The TPP is designed to liberalise trade among member countries by slashing tariffs on an estimated 18,000 goods to promote economic links and support growth while creating higher-paying jobs and promoting innovation, productivity and competitiveness. TPP countries will also sign a side pledge not to artificially devalue their currencies to increase export competitiveness under the aegis of the pact. The period of exclusivity given to brand-name drug companies for newly developed biological treatments, after approval, is for at least five years, but lower than the 12-year period sought by US pharmaceutical companies. TPP negotiators agreed to having 45% of a vehicle’s content coming from countries party to the trade agreement in order to qualify for beneficial tariff rates. While there was progress in the right direction for the agriculture industry, the dismantling of longstanding barriers on protected industries was cursory. Japan has not moved significantly to remove protectionist barriers to its rice industry while Canada only opened up limited access to its dairy and agriculture sectors – 3.25% for the sensitive dairy sector and around 1.5-2.3% for various segments of its poultry market. \nImplications: The TPP is a geo-political game changer first; economic gains will come later \nFirst, this is primarily a geo-political victory for the US and Japan over China \nWhile the TPP is a significant achievement in economic diplomacy, the TPP is fundamentally a geo-political victory for the US as the centrepiece of the US pivot to Asia. This means that the US has scored a massive coup over China in their battle for influence and hegemony in Asia. The TPP was the only real mechanism to the US had to entrench itself in the Asia-Pacific in the face of a rising China which is showing greater assertiveness in maritime issues. The US was counting on this as the centrepiece of its foreign policy to counterbalance Chinese influence and belligerence in the region. This agreement gives those Asia-Pacific countries uncomfortably confronting an assertive China more leeway in dealing with China on the back of a more robust American presence. US allies in the region are also reassured of continued American commitment to the region. It puts China, at least temporarily, on the back foot after a year of moving forward on its major initiatives such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). However, we expect China to respond to this development in due course. \nSecond, the economic upside to member countries is potentially massive As the full text of the TPP agreement has not been released, it is not possible to work out the full benefits. However, the potential upside for participating countries is huge, at first brush (Table 1). Furthermore, estimates of gains accruing from trade agreements usually understate the real benefits as certain second- and third-order effects from free trade agreements may not be captured in initial projections. While the full benefits will take some time to filter through as there are opt-out clauses, long transition periods, etc, before the cuts in tariffs and easing of non-tariff barriers fully materialise, the economic gains are certain and will come in time. \nThird, stumbling blocks remain and ratification will be a drawn-out process \nWith the nitty-gritty of finalising the trade agreement out of the way, the next battles ahead are completing the “legal scrubbing” and getting national legislatures to ratify the TPP. When ratified, the TPP would be the largest pact governing global commerce in more than 20 years, since the conclusion of the 1994 Uruguay Round which created the World Trade Organisation. There will be a huge battle in the US Congress, it will take a lot of effort and skill on the part of the Obama administration to get it through Congress at a time when the US presidential election season is gearing up – this will be a close call but the TPP is likely to eventually pass given the support for the Trade Promotion Authority given to Obama. There is a real possibility that Malaysia might withdraw from the trade pact – especially if PM Najib feels that he does not have sufficient political capital to drive this through Parliament. However, not approving Malaysia’s entry into the TPP will be a mistake. We think that for Brunei, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Singapore, the approval of the TPP is a virtually a done deal. \nAssessment: Identifying the winners and losers \nThe TPP removes many trade barriers and facilitates the freer flow of trade and investment across member countries. Under the TPP, various standards will be harmonised to high quality norms, domestic industries will, to some extent, see their sheltered status be rolled back. Externally, non-participatory nations could see trade benefits being diverted to TPP countries. The crux is that member countries will have virtually free access to a combined market that comprises 40% of world GDP and will stand in better stead than their neighbours (and trade competitors) that are not party to the TPP agreement. \nWinners will be TPP countries from three categories \n1. Countries currently with the highest trade barriers \nCountries in the TPP agreement which currently do not have any or many free trade agreements and hence face high trade barriers will stand to benefit greatly when the TPP is in force. The reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers will allow for free and flourishing trade flows; export-oriented economies such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam stand to reap outsized gains. Vietnam will be a big winner from the greater access to Pacific markets given its heavy reliance on export-driven growth (Table 3). Furthermore, fellow TPP members US and Japan are the 2nd and 4th largest trading partners with Vietnam. The TPP will allow Vietnam to shift away from its economic orbit of China while the ending of tariffs for Vietnam-made products is likely to herald more inbound investment from foreign entities. Already, both Malaysia and Vietnam have seen more FDI of late and this influx of investment flows is bound to grow while Cambodian PM Hun Sen has bitterly criticised the TPP because he has seen FDI switch from Cambodia (which is not in TPP) to Vietnam. The North American economies – US, Canada and Mexico – will also stand to benefit from the increased access to vibrant and rapidly growing Southeast Asian markets. Japan will also benefit – this accord is the first-ever free trade agreement in any form between US and Japan. Japanese automakers will stand to gain from the increased access to US consumers. However, Japan’s agriculture sector will have its work cut out to remain competitive as domestic protections are gradually lifted. \n2. Countries which are forced to reform, or reform quicker \nWith the high standards demanded of countries party to the TPP, there will be a ramping up of reforms, spurring economies to attaining efficiency gains. A country like Vietnam which still confronts many barriers will reap the most benefits from the liberalisation and opening up of major economies in under the TPP. The trade pact also helps Japan considerably since it can use the TPP as a framework to better promote its own interests, such as the advancement of Abenomics and a structural overhaul of the Japanese economy onto a higher and more resilient growth trajectory. The TPP, will spur much-needed reforms of Malaysia’s state-owned enterprises and help improve its business climate.. \n3. Regional hubs \nThe TPP is expected to facilitate greater economic activity in the region. Increased flows of goods, services, capital, skilled labour and ideas will benefit regional hubs such as Singapore. Singapore is set to be a huge winner in facilitating and intermediating these flows, leveraging on its world class infrastructure and institutions, strong rule of law and stability to reap the economic gains from increased trade and investment links around the region. Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia, is also poised to benefit from the strengthened economic links, albeit to a smaller extent than Singapore. Obvious losers will be cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok, as economic flows are diverted from them to regional hubs in TPP countries. \nCountries which are not part of the historic TPP agreement will stand to lose out from trade and investment diversions, even as their neighbours and trade competitors benefit from the reduced tariffs and increased market access. Already, South Korea and Taiwan have indicated their interest in joining the TPP – this would strengthen the economic architecture. \nWithin ASEAN, Thailand could well be the biggest loser if it remains outside the TPP (Table 2). With its ASEAN neighbours joining the TPP, trade could be diverted away from Thailand as other countries become more competitive due to lowered trade barriers. Furthermore, should the rules of origin agreed upon by TPP members strictly confine the majority of manufacturing activity within member states, Thailand could potentially see some degree of relocation of production facilities. Malaysia: What can go right? \nThe political crisis sparked off by allegations of malfeasance at the state-backed institution 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) continues. In the past week, the pressure on Prime Minister Najib Razak has grown. The Council of Rulers, which brings together Malaysia’s Sultans who still command the respect of the majority Malays, issued a statement urging Najib’s government to complete the probe into 1MDB and take appropriate action against those implicated, a move that many interpreted as a gentle chiding for Najib. More worryingly, the country’s respected central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), issued an extraordinary statement implicitly criticising the Attorney-General’s Office for not pursuing action against executives of 1MDB. BNM went on to revoke three permissions it had granted to 1MDB under the Exchange Control Act, demanding 1MDB repatriate the amount of USD1.83 billion to Malaysia and submit a plan to BNM for this purpose. \nNevertheless, our view remains that PM Najib will survive the 1MDB scandal and that the economy is probably in better condition than appears to be the case. \nPolitical risks remain but Najib retains the initiative and could deliver an upside surprise Najib and his allies continue to dominate the ruling UMNO party and its Barisan Nasional coalition. The vast majority of UMNO division leaders and members of its Supreme Council have remained loyal to Najib despite all the allegations that have surfaced. When the UMNO Deputy President and then Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin appeared to question Najib’s role in the 1MDB issue, Najib was able to dismiss Muhyiddin as Deputy Prime Minister with the support of the majority of the UMNO top echelon. The talk is that Muhyiddin has struggled to attract support from more than 8 UMNO divisions out of the near 200 divisions while Najib has the loyalty of around 170. Najib also retains firm control of the key agencies in Malaysia: the police including the internal security service, the Attorney-General’s Office, the Speaker of Parliament, the majority of the traditional rulers, and other key government agencies. Najib has been in politics for close to 40 years and has built up a network of support across the country. He is a battle-hardened survivor of many political battles. He will certainly use the advantages of power to secure his position and has many options to do so. First, he knows who his principal enemies are and will be able to attack them or their family and business allies. Second, Najib can woo the opposition. He has already won over the Islamist party, PAS, which broke off from the opposition alliance and has been leaning towards a working relationship with UMNO. There is talk that Najib’s allies have approached the loyalists of jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim for a potential deal. Anwar’s treatment in jail is said to have improved remarkably in recent weeks. \nEconomically, fundamentals remain in place and show signs of a pick-up Electrical & electronics lifting exports: For a third straight month, Malaysia’s exports have increased with August posting a 4.1% y/y increase, up from 3.5% y/y in Jul 15. Chart 1 compares Malaysia’s export performance against its ASEAN counterparts, clearly illustrating Malaysia’s improving relative performance. More importantly, Malaysia remains one of the few countries with double digit y/y export expansion to China amidst its slowdown. Malaysia’s leading indicator could be beginning to turn (Chart 2). \nVulnerabilities to be offset by net benefits The Ringgit has depreciated almost 23% against the US Dollar since July 2014. However, unlike a similar fall post-Asian Financial Crisis, consumer sentiment is holding up and inflation has not spiked out of hand, as such the net effect of the real effective exchange rate (REER) is translating to economic benefits in terms of exports performance in the Malaysian economy. Undoubtedly the ringgit’s depreciation has translated to inflationary pressure on manufacturers – September’s Nikkei Manufacturing PMI remained contractionary at 48.3, but was up from 47.2 in August. The slower rate of contraction, however, was bolstered by strong export orders. As trade volumes to the US, Europe and Asia continue to strengthen, the downside to growth from manufacturing is likely to be offset. External vulnerabilities are less than they appear: Malaysia’s foreign exchange cover of short term debt of only 1.0 (worse than Indonesia) is misleading as 73% of short term debt is represented by Malaysian headquartered regional banks centralising their debt in the KL treasury. The debt in actual fact represents regional debt not just Malaysian debt. Malaysia’s increasing external debt position has also been of worry. However with more than 90% of this debt denominated in MYR terms and highly represented by inter-company loans, we believe that as a net investment creditor, Malaysia remains well insulated from tumultuous global market movements. Ahead of the government’s 2016 Budget, we can expect to see revisions to revenue earnings as GST revenues may not suffice to offset the loss of oil related revenues. We can however expect the government to hold the line on its current fiscal deficit target around 3.2% of GDP, which will include efforts to maintain a public debt position below its self inflicted ceiling at 55% of GDP – efforts of which will not trigger a downgrade in debt ratings and in turn maintain investor confidence. \nMultitude of opportunities Malaysia’s implementation of the goods and services tax was applauded by global institutions, however the lack of communication of its benefits to the public has left blame and dissatisfaction lingering on Prime Minister Najib Razak’s administration. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement similarly holds overarching benefits for the Malaysian economy; Malaysia’s trade position will firm ahead of Thailand and competitiveness in business process outsourcing will strengthen. The requirements of the TPP will face contention from various groups in Malaysia, a hurdle policy makers will have to overcome. However, there is the risk that should the Prime Minister’s political position further weaken, Malaysia will opt out of the TPP, which would be a negative for the economy.
