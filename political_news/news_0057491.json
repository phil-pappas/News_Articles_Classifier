In response, the Foundation has established the S.C. Flood Relief Fund to address the pressing needs of flood disaster victims – both short and long term. 100% of monies donated will go directly to local grassroots organizations aiding those in need. To donate, go to https://www.YourFoundation.org/SCFloodRelief .\nHarvest Hope Food Bank, a nonprofit food pantry that offers direct support to individuals via more than 400 member partners in 20 counties statewide, is the recipient of the first fundraising grant from the Foundation's S.C. Flood Relief Fund. The Foundation's board kicked off the fund with a $50,000 donation to start, and many local nonprofits are channeling their fundraising efforts to the fund via events and online campaigns.\n\"Our Foundation is in touch with other community foundations nationwide that have faced disasters, including those in New Orleans , Bismarck, ND and Nashville . Based on their experiences, we know that our community will need help for many months – perhaps years,\" said JoAnn Turnquist , President & CEO of Central Carolina Community Foundation. \"Every donation we receive will help our community recover and rebuild.\"\nThe Foundation serves eleven counties in the Midlands region of South Carolina , including those hardest hit by flooding. For 31 years, the Central Carolina Community Foundation has served the Midlands . Because the Foundation manages funds for nonprofits and private donors, and distributes grant monies and scholarships as part of its daily operations, the infrastructure is already in place to accept online donations and distribute 100% of monies donated to organizations helping flood victims.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected by the flooding,\" says Turnquist. \"The outpouring of support from friends and strangers has been tremendous. Clean up and rebuilding will take time, but we are resilient.\"\nAbout Central Carolina Community Foundation:\nCentral Carolina Community Foundation is a nonprofit organization serving 11 counties in the Midlands by distributing grants and scholarships and linking the resources of donors, nonprofits and area leaders to communities in need.
