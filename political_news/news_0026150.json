I applaud their life-changing work and wish them continued success.” \nWarman, who sprouted the Women’s League back in 1978, said she was impressed regarding James’s interest and caring for the developmentally disabled children who are serviced. \n“Her questions showed concern and understanding of the issues we face. It was a very refreshing and encouraging visit,” Warman said following the tour with James. \nBack in 1958, Jeanne Warman, Women’s League’s founder and executive director, birthed a set of twin boys only to discover that one had suffered severe brain damage due to anoxia at birth. The future for the boy seemed bleak, especially considering the time period. \nBack in the 50s, individuals with disabilities were generally cared for in oversized institutions that, at best, tended only the basic needs and at worst, neglected and abused them. \nIn the early 70s, news reporter Geraldo Rivera exposed the tragedies behind the doors of the Willowbrook institution on Staten Island, which led to its eventual closing. A class action lawsuit was brought on behalf of its residents for mistreatment, ultimately leading to the signing of the Willowbrook Consent Decree in 1975. \nThe law mandated a deinstitutionalized process and proclaimed the rights of those with mental disabilities to live in their own communities of origin. Once a time of simply custodial care for its residents, now saw more steps toward a “normalization” goal. \nPrint Friendly 10/08/2015 10:14 PM by Ryan Haas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:39:00.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
