But no one knows her better and has the benefit of knowing what it takes to do this job and do it well.\"\nIn 2012, Clinton was a top surrogate for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, delivering the best-received speech at the Democratic National Convention and hitting the road as the \"secretary of explaining stuff,\" talking about Obama's economic achievements in a way that broke through to voters. And in 2014, he was more in demand on the trail than Obama, campaigning for senatorial and gubernatorial candidates in purple and red states where the president wasn't welcome (still, most of those races did not go Democrats' way).\n\"We can send Bill Clinton back to the White House. We can send Hillary Clinton to the White House,\" Sen. Joe Manchin said Friday as he introduced the 42nd president, who he described as \"the best president we've ever had.\"\nBut Clinton's behavior during the 2008 Democratic primary highlighted his weaknesses, as he lashed out at the Obama team and at a media he saw as aggressively pro-Obama.\nObama's record on Iraq was \"the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen,\" he said in January 2008 in New Hampshire. Accused of playing the race card against Obama, Clinton insisted in an interview that the race card was actually being used against him, and got angry the next day at a 20-something embed who tried to ask about the comments.\nIn 2008, \"the benefit of Bill Clinton far outweighed the negatives,\" said Mo Elleithee, Hillary Clinton's 2008 traveling campaign press secretary. What got through to voters was that Clinton \"has a way of connecting with everyday Americans that is almost unparalleled in modern American politics,\" he said. \"He was a way of breaking complex issues down. Voters know this is someone who's fighting for me and who's got my back.\"\nFor all the coverage of the former president's criticisms of Obama and the press, \"we never saw that stuff penetrate and pop with real people,\" Elleithee said.\nStill, aware that what he says and can create major complications for his wife's campaign, Clinton has shown some restraint -- at least thus far.\n\"I shouldn't be making news on this,\" he told reporters trailing him at a Miami community service project in March, just days after his wife's reliance on a private email server during her time at the State Department became public. \"I have an opinion, but I have a bias,\" he added, making his views clear without providing cable news with a sound byte.\nIn the handful of interviews for which Clinton has sat over the past six months -- generally linked to Clinton Global Initiative events -- he's shown a defensive streak.\nIn interviews this week timed to CGI's annual meeting, Clinton blamed Republicans and the media for launching and stoking the email controversy. \"This is just something that has been a regular feature of all of our presidential campaigns, except in 2008 for unique reasons,\" he said in an interview with CNN released last weekend, bringing up the Whitewater scandal that began during his 1992 campaign and escalated and dragged on through his presidency.\n\"Ever since Watergate something like this happens,\" he added. \"And so I'd rather it happen now than later. And it was always going to happen. The other party doesn't want to run against her. And if they do, they'd like her as mangled up as possible.\"\nAsked about Clinton's comments, Hillary Clinton seemed to acknowledge that her husband sometimes gets defensive of her. \"I love my husband, and you know, he does get upset when I am attacked. I totally get that,\" she said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\nWhen it comes to scrutiny of the Clinton Foundation's donors and operation, the former president also gets defensive, asserting as he did earlier this week that \"even our critics will say we're much more transparent than similar organizations.\"\n\"It's a big country you can't be everywhere at once. I don't care how skilled you are as a candidate, you want to deploy as many of your best assets as you can. Having him out there is a big asset,\" Elleithee said.\nClinton slowly ramped up to Friday's speech after being been almost completely out of public view to a degree that's unusual for presidential candidates' spouses. He appeared at his wife's campaign launch rally on Roosevelt Island in New York City in June but otherwise only existing in the campaign's iconography alongside his wife, as a long-haired Yale law student and a glowing new grandfather.\nIn the late summer, Clinton started attending some of his wife's Hamptons fundraisers and appeared solo in Chicago in September after she was unable to headline a fundraiser. He's since done a few others, including two this week. He'll appear at another in Michigan later this month.\nHe started making his presence known to campaign staff back in August, visiting Brooklyn headquarters and drawing flocks of aides who were in elementary school when he was in the White House. On Wednesday, as the fundraising quarter wound down, the campaign sent three email asks in his name in hopes of eking out contributions before the midnight deadline.\nAs he closed his speech Friday, Clinton again poked at his rustiness, telling the crowd, \"look, you know, I haven't run for office in a long time and I don't think I'm very good at this.\"\nSome filling the cavernous Charleston Civic Center laughed. And when he finished several minutes later, they stood and cheered as the former president approached the rope line with his 1992 theme song \"Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\" blaring, ready to greet the loyal Democrats who'd come to see him.\n(c)2015 Bloomberg News\nVisit Bloomberg News at www.bloomberg.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1731891", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1731891&h=Bill+Clinton+returns+to+the+campaign+trail", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1731891&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:39:09.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
