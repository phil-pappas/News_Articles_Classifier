While it appears Trump had not firmly committed to the event on Oct. 8, the Chamber said both sides had an agreement, which came after Trump visited with Hispanic Chamber of Commerce representatives in New York last month.\n“Mr. Trump was unwilling to abide by the terms and conditions of the USHCC’s Presidential Candidate Q&A Series - the same rules that all participants have previously followed,” Chamber spokesman Ammar Campa-Najjar said in a statement to POLITICO. “The USHCC refused to change the format of the forum, show any favoritism, exclude any issues or topics, or grant any immunity from objective scrutiny of his policies.”\nTrump, meanwhile, told CNN that the Chamber is wrong.\n\"I never agreed to do an event. This is the first time I'm hearing about this. I mean, I never agreed,\" Trump told CNN in a phone interview. \"He wanted me to do an event because he probably can't sell tickets without me. Why would anybody do an event when he's a negative person?\"\nTrump’s own Texas state director called him a 'joke' By Ben Schreckinger\nThe billionaire businessman said he has other plans on Oct. 8, anyhow — a campaign rally in Las Vegas.\nTrump had stepped up some outreach to the Hispanic community after angering many in the community with his inflammatory comments calling many illegal Mexican immigrants “rapists” during his presidential announcement speech in June. He followed that with an aggressive immigration reform plan that calls for building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants.\nThe Chamber’s decision to schedule the Q&A with Trump had created tension within the group and with the larger Hispanic community, as many said the Chamber should not host the controversial businessman.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/02/politics/donald-trump-hispanic-chamber/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:17:35.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
