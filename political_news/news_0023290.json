a move which could pave the way for a licensing scheme for funeral directors to be brought in in the future.\nIt also sets out to regulate private burials, which take place at home or on a family's private land, and proposes allowing abandoned lairs to be restored for use in tightly-controlled circumstances and after at least 100 years have passed since the last interment.\nThe changes have been welcomed by industry bodies, with Bill Stanley of the Institute of Cemetery & Crematorium Management (ICCM) saying it \"applauds and wholeheartedly supports the Scottish Government's action in proposing new, fit-for-purpose burial, cremation and associated legislation that will meet the needs of a modern-day society\".\nShare article Richard Powell, secretary of the Federation of Burials and Cremations Authorities (FBCA), said they were \"supportive of the move to modernise the legislation in respect of burial and cremation\".\nJim Brodie, of the Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF), said: \"We are pleased to be engaged in partnership with the Scottish Government in reviewing and modernising the legislation surrounding cremation and burial.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:56:49.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
