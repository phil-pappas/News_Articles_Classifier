The removal of tariffs is an immediate advantage for Maori exporters and the agreement sets the stage for better gains in the future. New Zealand has been represented by arguably the best trade negotiators in the world in the TPP talks and we are confident that Minister Grosser and his team have landed the best possible deal for New Zealand.\"She said that it was critical that New Zealand took its place at the TPP table alongside other major economies. \"The TPP is about building partnerships through which we might grow our exports and trade potential. This agreement is the result of trade talks and negotiations led over time by both Labour and National, and it is important to remember that the TPP has the potential to benefit all New Zealanders.\" \nEstablished in 1987, FOMA is the largest national Maori economic network representing around 150 Maori Authorities with a collective asset base of around $9billion with interests largely in the primary industry. Many of FOMAs members are established exporters to Asia, North America and Europe. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:25:56.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
