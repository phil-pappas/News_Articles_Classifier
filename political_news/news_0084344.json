The 2015 cardiopulmonary resuscitation week'. Active players at the event - scheduled for Saturday 10 October - will include some 4 thousand fourth and fifth-grade Milanese and Lombard highschool students. Promoted by the European Parliament in 2012 to heighten awareness of the cardiac arrest issue, the 'Viva!' association chose highschool students as their key players, according to the guidelines set out in the new 'Good school' reform which includes first aid techniques in the school curriculum. On 10 October in the MiCo (Milano Congressi) pavilions in via Gattamelata 5, from 8.30am to 6pm, more than 500 doctors, nurses, instructors and rescue staff will share their knowledge and expertise with anyone present to show how a life can be simply and effectively saved in the event of cardiac arrest (to sign up: www.scuolasicura.it ). The event is also open to residents and representatives of sports associations who will be offered the chance, in the course of some training sessions, both morning and afternoon, to take the practical test in First Aid and how to use the defibrillator. Before being able to get the licence, however, participants will have to have attended a 2-hour theoretical FAD (on-line) cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation training course or will have to attend the practical lesson provided in various places and at different times precisely to facilitate participation (info on taking the FAD course and on taking part in the event can be found at: www.settimanaviva.it/news/2015/rianimamin ). RianimaMinExpo2015 is an event staged in partnership with AREU-118 Milano, Ospedale Niguarda and Rotary Milano as well as the IRC (Italian Resuscitation Council). The aim of the Italian Resuscitation Council is to give continuity to this experience, by providing fourth and fifth-grade highschool students in Lombardy with ongoing training. An essential step is about to be taken with the signing of a protocol agreement between IRC, Rotary, and the regional Schools Office. MiCo has responded to this event with all the technical-organizational skills that distinguish it, fully convinced of the validity of a truly outstanding project. distributed by This content was issued by Fiera Milano S.p.A. on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.fieramilano.it.
