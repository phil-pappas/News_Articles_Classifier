Buy this photo \n\"The fact that I've been reelected twice with substantial margins means that people must like the job I'm doing,\" he said, noting that Tenafly has no mandatory term limits. \nBut his opponents in the Nov. 3 election for the four-year mayoral seat — Nadia LaMastra, a three-term councilwoman on the Democratic ticket, and Ronald Cutro, a newcomer on the Republican ticket who generated the orange signs — claim to offer better visions and an approach more inclusive of the council. Buy this photo \nWhen listing her goals, LaMastra sounds strikingly similar to Rustin. She hopes to fund municipal infrastructure to keep up with wear and tear, spend more on maintaining the roads and parks and dedicate more resources for senior services, such as a senior center and a senior van — all items also on Rustin's to do list. \nLaMastra, who works for an attorney and does estate tax returns, concedes she may be similar to the mayor philosophically, but says her approach will be different. She vows to bring more transparency to the job and says she will be a team player. Government is about the vision of a whole group, she said, claiming that Rustin \"works on his own.\" Buy this photo \nShe also said she hopes to make it a top priority to preserve historic properties before it's too late. \"We need to have more meetings with the Historic Preservation Committee … and see if we can designate more properties historic.\" \nLaMastra's five council colleagues, all Democrats, back her bid for mayor, citing her community-oriented perspective and arguing that Rustin focuses on his own ideas to the exclusion of the council. \nBut LaMastra's opponents argue that there won't be much transparency or open discussion if seven Democrats are running the town. \nRepublican Cutro, the founder of an advertising agency and a longtime resident of Tenafly, says his success in the business sphere and people skills will be a boon to the borough. Among his goals are increasing parking in town, lowering taxes and improving services to senior citizens. \"I won't waste money on projects that residents don't want, such as a new police station,\" he said, noting the mayor and council touted a plan for an expensive new police station residents didn't want. \nLike LaMastra, he vows to bring more \"openness and transparency into running the town.\" \n\"I hope to accomplish a better relationship with the people of Tenafly, bringing it back to the small, bucolic town I grew up in,\" Cutro said, adding, \"I work very, very well with almost all people.\" \nBruce Baker, the head of the Republican Club, said that with Cutro, \"there will be a lot more open government. There will be more transparency.\" \nRustin said he has tried to keep politics out of Borough Hall business, saying that with no ties to either party, he sought to appoint both Democrats and Republicans to positions based on merit, and gathered input from everyone around the table. \nThe biggest challenge ahead, he said, is that \"we need to maintain the quality of our services without raising taxes.\" Over the past five years, the municipal tax rate increased by a tight 7 percent, he said, and all of his projects have been completed under budget. \"I'm proud to run on my record and not on promises that probably won't be kept.\" \nHis opponents accuse him of micromanaging, and he has aroused criticism for his support of the Tenafly Nature Center's proposal to build an elaborate new center in a new location. That idea was eventually rejected in a referendum. He was also derided for knocking on the door of a family on Christmas Eve to order them to remove a holiday display they had put up without a permit. \nBut his activism has also earned him fans. \nFor example, when the century-old Mackay Lowe property on Knickerbocker Road was on the cusp of being sold and turned into lots with 10 homes, he tried to ward off the development, arguing that the property deserves to be preserved and seeking more time to find a preservation-minded buyer for the nearly 7-acre site. As of yet, he has not gotten any offers. He also has supported public food programs, created a campaign to promote health, snowplowed the driveways of senior citizens and organized a summer concert series. \nWhat he's most proud of, he said, is that people feel comfortable reaching out to him. \nRustin's supporters point out he brings the added benefit of free time. Retired from his own business, he spends hours at Borough Hall and driving around in his lime-green Porsche on public business. \"Peter is so big on accessibility he gives out his home phone number so that people can call him about the silliest things, like a squirrel in their attic,\" said Alan Cohen, Rustin's campaign manager. \nBut Rustin's critics say that accessibility and involvement are part of the problem.
