Peers will vote on a rarely-used \"fatal motion\" tabled by the Lib Dems which would scrap the proposed changes entirely.\nLabour is backing a rival motion which calls for the welfare changes to be delayed pending an independent analysis of their impact and until transitional arrangements to help those affected are put in place.\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell denied this delay would effectively also kill off any changes to welfare.\n'Above politics' \"No, I think it is a real offer to George Osborne to see if we can make sure people are properly protected,\" he said. \"This is becoming above politics. I know what a U-turn looks like and how it can do damage to you but we need a U-turn on this.\n\"If you change your mind on this, we will not make any political capital on this. If the Lords do throw this out tomorrow and put it back to the government, I've said to him 'If you change your mind, bring back a policy in which people are protected, not a political stunt but a real protection, we will not in any way attack you for that. In fact we'll support you.'\"\nHe suggested Labour would be prepared at a future date to co-operate with the government in examining the tax credits bill.\nMs Morgan said the Conservatives had been clear in their manifesto that they would make substantial changes to welfare, and tax credits cuts had been specifically approved by MPs.\nShe said it would be \"constitutionally unprecedented\" for the House of Lords to block a measure introduced via secondary legislation.\n\"They should be very mindful about what they are doing,\" she said. \"That is not the Lords' job.\"\nWhat are tax credits and what are the changes?\nTax credits are a series of benefits introduced by the last Labour government to help low-paid families. There are two types: Working Tax Credit (WTC) for those in work, and Child Tax Credit (CTC) for those with children.\nUnder government proposals, the income threshold for Working Tax Credits - £6,420 - will be cut to £3,850 a year from April.\nIn other words, as soon as someone earns £3,850, they will see their payments reduced. The income threshold for those only claiming CTCs will be cut from £16,105 to £12,125.\nThe rate at which those payments are cut is also going to get faster. Currently, for every £1 claimants earn above the threshold, they lose 41p. This is known as the taper rate. But from April, the taper rate will accelerate to 48p.\nThere will be similar reductions for those who claim work allowances under the new Universal Credit.\nRead more about the changes", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34572807"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:47:31.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
