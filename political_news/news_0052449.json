Afghan troops, backed by U.S. advisers, are fighting to retake Kunduz from the Taliban, which attacked the city Sept. 28.\n\"Unfortunately, the Taliban have decided to remain in the city and fight from within, knowingly putting civilians at harm,\" Campbell said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton hits Sanders: 'I am not in favor of making college free for Donald Trump's kids' Hillary Clinton hit Bernie Sanders for the first time Monday on NBC's \"Today.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/05/15 10:46 AM He said he had not suspended or made changes to the train, advise and assist program in Afghanistan.\nCampbell will testify Tuesday at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the situation in Afghanistan.\nDoctors Without Borders, also known as M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, released a statement Sunday calling for an independent investigation of the strikes, which they call \"a grave violation of International Humanitarian Law.\"\n\"Under the clear presumption that a war crime has been committed, MSF demands that a full and transparent investigation into the event be conducted by an independent international body.
