Get over it, guys Who else has money in tax havens? Labor faces questions Has the Labor Party given up already?\nAfter 25 days of Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministerial reign, a handful of polls and the release of four policies, the opposition has flicked the switch to class warfare, the politics of envy and another scare campaign.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nAnd it's lame.\nAdvertisement In an amazing revelation, Labor has discovered - yet again - that Turnbull made millions of dollars in business before being elected to Parliament.\nHe has a nice house or two. A not-insignificant investment portfolio partly based in a Cayman Island tax haven (which, to be fair, a few Australians could similarly claim). And, apparently, questions to answer about his tax affairs.\nExcept, of course, that as political attack dog Senator Sam \"Dasher\" Dastyari conceded on Wednesday when firing the initial salvo, the investments are \"all legal and disclosed\".\nThe elevation of Turnbull to the prime ministership had, most Australians hoped, offered a moment when after eight long years of Rudd-Gillard-Abbott politics as trench war, there could be a reset of the political debate.\nMaybe ideas will matter again, politicians from all sides muttered out of the sides of their mouths; maybe we can put the last few years behind us.\nSadly, it appears not.\nThose polls show nothing more than Labor and the Coalition neck-and-neck, an improvement in the Coalition's standing, but hardly a cause for panic; Turnbull is more popular than Shorten by quite a margin, but that is to be expected during the honeymoon any new prime minister enjoys.\nBut Labor strategists, after releasing four actual policies in the last four weeks and a just a handful more in a so-called \"year of ideas\" that has mostly been anything but, appear to have lost their nerve.\nAt one level, the strategy makes sense. Though it's debateable how closely people have engaged with it, Shorten has taken a hit during trade union royal commission hearings this week, with evidence from former Thiess John Holland executives that he did a deal while leading the Australian Workers Union that \"sold out\" the 36-hour week and, more significantly, that he was part of early discussions about the deal and $100,000 so-called side payments .\nSix more days of hearings remain and there's a possibility that Shorten will be recalled. A cynic might conclude it could be part of the \"hey, look at that Rich Guy, he's different to us\" attack on Turnbull.\nIn launching its attack on Turnbull, Labor may find that it has traded short term gain for longer term pain.\nThe questions about Turnbull's wealth certainly played well on the TV news bulletins on Wednesday evening.\nBut there is a bigger question that remains unanswered.\nWhile Australians don't like tall poppies (so the truism goes), nor people born with a silver spoon in their mouth, do we actually begrudge a (mostly self-made) man or woman their success?\nOne of the lessons of the Howard years was that we actually don't - the former prime minister pitched his political messaging squarely at aspirational voters, did not engage in class warfare and for 11 and a bit years prospered, thank you very much.\nIn contrast, Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan's class warfare rhetoric fell flat (remember those polls?) and Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey's actual class warfare (also known as their first budget) became a political suicide note.\nShorten, aware of the fine line he must walk, tied himself in rhetorical knots as he sort-of but not-quite attacked Turnbull on Thursday before question time - though he asked no questions in the parliament.\n\"Is the Liberal Party of Australia really expecting us to say Malcolm Turnbull buying into a million dollar investment fund in the Cayman Islands is the same as you and millions of other Australians who pay your ordinary superannuation every day?\" he asked.\nAnd: \"Theoretically on paper everyone could put $1 million into the Cayman Islands. The issue is most people don't have that\".\nAs a political message, it was as clear as Shorten's March response about what he believed in.\n\"What I fundamentally believe and I think it was Martin Luther King who said this best, but it's, I think true then and it's true now, is everybody is somebody\".\nAs a Liberal strategist remarked on Thursday: \"If they keep this up we'll just do deals with the Greens, who are looking much more sensible than Labor at the moment\".\nIn question time, the opposition pressed its attack on Turnbull's personal wealth but even as the frontbench probed, Labor's backbench sagged as the attack on the Prime Minister landed flat.\nWhile Labor could have been asking about the economy, Turnbull noted, instead they were focused on \"just another shabby smear campaign\".\n\"Lucy and I have been very fortunate in our lives. We have more wealth than most Australians, that is true...we've worked hard, we've paid our taxes, we've given back,\" he replied to Labor's Tony Burke.\n\"If the honourable member wants to go round wearing a sandwich board saying, 'Malcolm Turnbull's got a lot of money', feel free.\"\nWith the political ground shifting and Australians seemingly welcoming a reset political debate, Labor may well find that pursuing the political high road reaps longer term benefits.\nThe low road may lead to nothing more than perdition.\nFollow us on Twitter\nFollow James Massola on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:16:48.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
