Of the more than 250 risk professionals who responded, 31% said yes, while 69% said no or they were not sure.\nThe results are another red flag, signaling that many companies have yet to develop a comprehensive cyber risk management strategy. And they need to understand and clarify the roles of the key stakeholders . Companies unsure whether all of their key stakeholders have been identified - from the risk manager to the CEO to customers and suppliers - could be in for an unwanted and costly surprise.\nEmbracing one's role as a cyber risk stakeholder can make a difference to a business as a whole. For example, if well-trained employees flag a suspicious email that was an attempt to infiltrate the company, everyone benefits. If a facilities manager knows how to respond should an attack interfere with critical systems, everyone benefits. If a risk manager communicates the potential risks to various stakeholders, including third-party vendors, everyone benefits. And the list goes on.\nTo hear more about cyber risk management, listen to a replay of Marsh's New Reality of Risk webcast or visit Marsh's dedicated cyber web page on www.marsh.com .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273190-INFO\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273189LOGO\n releases/have-you-identified-all-of-your-cyber-risk-stakeholders-300152973.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY17861&Transmission_Id=201510020900PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY17861&DateId=20151002", "http://event.onlineseminarsolutions.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=lobby.jsp&eventid=1034554&sessionid=1&key=7D56E93D443E215209A807F3CBE32594&eventuserid=124452668", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.marsh.com/", "https://www.marsh.com/us/risk-in-context/risk-managers-cybersecurity.html?utm_source=us-publicrelations&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cyber15", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273190-INFO", "https://www.marsh.com/us/risk-in-context/seven-cyber-risk-stakeholders.html?utm_source=us-publicrelations&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cyber15", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151001/273189LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273189LOGO", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/have-you-identified-all-of-your-cyber-risk-stakeholders-300152973.html", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151001/273190-INFO", "https://www.marsh.com/us/campaigns/cyber-campaign.html?utm_source=us-publicrelations&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=cyber15"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:16:08.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
