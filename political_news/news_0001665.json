He said public debt will drop below 100 percent of annual economic output in the next few years.\nCyprus is expected next year to conclude a 10 billion euro ($11.36 billion) rescue deal it agreed with creditors in March, 2013 that forced a grab of uninsured deposits in its two largest banks and shuttered the second largest lender.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
