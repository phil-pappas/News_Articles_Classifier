Tom Daschle and George Mitchell Washington (CNN) The allure of a golden autumn afternoon beckoned Monday to President Barack Obama, who shrugged off the confines of his presidential motorcade for a walk to lunch.\nHe only had to go two blocks -- he was dining with former Sens. Tom Daschle and George Mitchell at the Metropolitan Club, just off Lafayette Square near the White House.\nBut the stroll through closed-off streets was a rarity for the President, who normally travels in his bomb-and-bullet proof limousine.\nHe chatted along the way with his chief of staff Denis McDonough and Katie Fallon, his legislative director. Like many an urban office dweller, he carried with him a to-go cup of tea.\nA year ago, Obama underwent a period of cabin fever that prompted similar walkabouts. He surprised tourists near the National Mall when he made the half-mile trek from his office to the Interior Department.\nRead More He took a group of working parents out to lunch at Chipotle (or, as he called it, 'Chipotle's').\nAnd lured by a warm spring day, he took McDonough out for afternoon coffee at a Pennsylvania Avenue Starbucks.\nThe term the wandering commander-in-chief used for his adventures: \"The bear is loose.\"\nIt reflected his own perception of the White House as a cage, replete with armed guards, controlled movements and pesky reporters at every turn.\nDuring speeches, Obama has sometimes lamented the stifling nature of his job -- and eagerly anticipated breaking free when he leaves office in January 2017.\n\"I'll be honest with you -- I'm looking forward to life after being president,\" he said in Ethiopia this summer. \"I won't have such a big security detail all the time. It means I can go take a walk.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:33:39.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
