In North Charleston, which has a contested mayor’s race and many contested City Council races, 287 had cast absentee ballots, or about 0.7 percent.\nIn Mount Pleasant, which has four council races and a recreation referendum, only 92 of 58,636 registered voters have voted absentee. And 313 more have requested absentee ballots.\nSouth Carolina doesn’t have early voting per se, but the state allows voters to cast early, absentee ballots for one of many reasons. Some of these include that the voter is older than 65, has a disability, has to work on Election Day or will be out of town.\nAbsentee voting has been an indicator of turnout in general elections, where the lines can be long. But there also may be less of a push this year because there are fewer races and areas involved in municipal elections.\nReach Robert Behre at (843) 937-5771 or at twitter.com/RobertFBehre.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palmetto-politics/id897497885?mt=8"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:49:54.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
