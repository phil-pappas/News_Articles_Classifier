Displays of medical marijuana are also not allowed to be visible and not even patients are allowed to touch the product until packaged. \nMetropolitan Wellness Center General Manager Vanessa West has been in the medical cannabis business for the last decade. She started out in San Diego, where she says the typical patients were Caucasians in their 20s. \nIn Washington's south east neighborhood, the most patients are African Americans in their 40s. \nMarijuana laws have gotten stricter as they've made their way toward the Atlantic, West said. There's also the stigma of pot users and the criminal repercussions of using and possessing the drug that isn't apparent there.

If you are a pot smoker, you are still viewed as being lazy, or a criminal or someone who doesn't have aspirations.\" \nThe wellness center serves about one-third of the nearly 4,000 patients registered in the district's medical marijuana program. \nBehind the locked door in the lobby, the center serves medical marijuana from smokable buds to oils and a raw vegan cold-pressed juice. That's the only thing available in edible form in the district. Edible marijuana will not be allowed in Maryland. \nWhile Anne Arundel County will be debating measures to restrict medical marijuana operations, other Maryland jurisdictions are welcoming the economic investment. \nIn Washington County, Green Thumb Industries, or GTI, received unanimous approval from the local planning commission for a growing and processing operation outside Hagerstown. \nThe company, which operates a 45,000 square-foot facility in Rock Island, Il., wants to develop a 20-acre parcel in western Maryland. GTI partners Sterling Crockett and Ben Kovler told The Capital they are putting a $12 million investment into the local economy, which includes acquiring land, the building labor and equipment. \nWhile the investment might be local, all application fees and yearly license renewal fees — which can be more than $100,000 — is sent to the state. \nWhile the focus for GTI is on cultivation, they are also considering where they could put a dispensary and \"figure out where we're welcomed,\" Kovler said. \nFor West, the dispensary's undisclosed location works for and against them. \n\"No one knows we're here,\" she said. \nStill, along with the privacy, people shouldn't be ashamed for finding relief in what they are selling, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:12:52.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
