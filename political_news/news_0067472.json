Grace Beahm/Staff × When city officials floated curbing late-night bars on the peninsula last year, young people erupted like a well-shaken Pabst Blue Ribbon. \nMayoral candidates make bids for youth vote \n“One of the primary issues that I talk about and think about is creating a world-class transportation system. And a lot of that is looking to include a variety of options for getting around, not just getting around in your car, but a real emphasis on public transit, a big emphasis on sidewalks and bike lanes and connecting neighborhoods so you can get around without a car. ... I think that young people like that I am looking at transportation in a way that works for them.”— Ginny Deerin \n“What our campaign is doing is focusing on the affordability factor with regard to millenials. Because millenials are people who are just starting out. Their salaries are not at a level where most of them can afford to live downtown particularly, where the cost of housing is pretty high and the cost of living is pretty high.”— William Dudley Gregorie \n“I think a lot of young adults who come here and want to stay here … like that new vibrancy, that new vitality that Charleston has and I believe strongly that we need to keep that going. And I think that appeals to not only young people but to creative folks and young business people as well.”— John Tecklenburg \n“Issue-wise, things that I have done or supported I think resonate really well with a lot of young folks... I’ve been a big supporter of growing tech and knowledge based industries in South Carolina. I’ve helped fund incubation and innovation and things like that through funding into the Department of Commerce.”— Leon Stavrinakis \n“I want to encourage young people to get involved with issues that matter to them and make themselves available at all levels. It’s critical. We’re making decisions now that are going to affect them down the road, so it would be good to get them involved” - Toby Smith Armed with social media savvy, they created parody Twitter accounts for Mayor Joe Riley and Police Chief Greg Mullen, circulated a caricature of Riley’s face with the tagline “Go to bed, Joe,” and started the hashtag #Joehibition. They placed ads on the radio protesting the moratorium on late-night bars and gathered more than 2,000 signatures on a petition on Change.org. \nFor more information on the Nov. 3 elections, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android . Bars and restaurants on King Street might as well be the millennial headquarters — it’s where many of them work, relax, perform and celebrate. If anything was going to rally and unify this diverse group of 18- to 35-year-olds, it was talk of a bar ban. “The businesses on upper King Street have really drawn the attention of the youth in Charleston,” said John Barry, a 23-year-old West Ashley resident who attended a mayoral forum last month for the first time. “This will be my first time voting because I’ve never felt like I would be directly connected to it. And I think that the decision made by Charleston in November will really lay the framework for how we evolve as a city in the years to come.” Ignited by the moratorium and looking to have a say in deciding Charleston’s first new mayor in 40 years, young people have registered to vote, held concerts to draw attention to city issues and participated in public forums. And Charleston’s mayoral hopefuls say they are specifically targeting the 18- to 35-year-olds. “We certainly are reaching out to young folks, and have a lot of young folks that are helping with our campaign,” said John Tecklenburg, one of six candidates running for mayor. Only time will tell if any of this will mean a stronger turnout of youthful voters on Election Day. The last mayoral election in 2011 drew a voter turnout of about 18 percent overall. Often, municipal elections held on a year without a presidential election means fewer voters show up to polls, according to an Urban Affairs Review study. A 2014 Census Bureau study of recent presidential elections, with their higher turnouts, showed that younger Americans overall consistently under-voted relative to their eligibility while older citizens had higher voting rates. Still, people 18 to 35 make up 30 percent of the city’s population and roughly a third of registered voters overall, making millennials the largest demographic with as much power as any other age group, according to the city and 2013 census data. “They can control this election if they all come out and vote,” said Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, who is running for mayor for the third time. Banding together The most visible group to emerge in response to the nightlife discussions was the BACE League , an acronym for business, art, culture and entertainment. It’s an organization composed of members of the food and beverage, hospitality and entertainment industries who are mostly under the age of 35. It’s led primarily by Parker Hastings, a local attorney who also works part time for local restaurants and Charleston Pedicab; Elliott Smith, an attorney and local musician; and his girlfriend, McKenzie Eddy, a musician and former owner of King Dusko, a King Street nightclub that closed earlier this year. The bar moratorium is the reason they all got together, but at the first meeting, Smith said it was obvious that the group’s central concern went deeper than cocktails. “They weren’t saying like, ‘How do we keep the bars open?’” he said. “The discussion essentially centered around, ‘How can we get more involved with ordinances that get passed, understand them, have a voice in them?’” They laid out a two-part plan: In the short term, get to know city officials and get involved with the moratorium discussion, and in the long term, incorporate more young people in the civic process, starting with their right to vote. The short-term goal was reached when many BACE League members were invited to participate in a Late Night Activity Review Committee to discuss compromises that would both promote a vibrant nightlife scene while also solving public safety and noise issues within nearby neighborhoods. On the civic participation end, the group has held about a dozen voter registration drives at local music venues, bars and restaurants focused on young voters. Hastings said he dropped off 230 registration forms that the BACE League had collected, primarily from people younger than 35, at the Charleston County Board of Elections and Voter Registration a few weeks ago. They kicked off the voter drive initiative at the album release concert for Brave Baby, a local band, at the Charleston Music Hall in May. A brief video aired during set break told the crowd of about 800 young people to “look around” and realize that “the people in this room represent an important voice for Charleston’s future,” encouraging them all to register, vote and stay informed on city issues. More than a hundred people filled out registration forms that night, Smith said. BACE League also helped organize a mayoral forum that was attended by candidates Ginny Deerin, state Rep. Leon Stavrinakis, Tecklenburg and Gregorie. “(Seeing) more than a hundred young people looking at the mayoral candidates, and the mayoral candidates paying attention to us as an actual voting bloc, I mean, that was amazing,” Eddy, one of the BACE leaders, said. “We would have never imagined that at our first meetings a year and a half ago.” ‘What youth vote?’ There’s a common perception that young people generally don’t participate in politics, especially city-level politics. And that’s not unfounded. While young people may vote in presidential elections, they often aren’t involved with the local elections because municipal politics aren’t as publicized. Plus, students and young professionals “tend to be more transient and they tend be moving around more-so than folks that are more settled down,” own homes, or have children, according to Gibbs Knotts, chairman of the political science department at the College of Charleston. When BACE members first started speaking with officials about the perspectives of younger voters, Smith said the general reaction was “What youth vote?” “Overall, it didn’t seem like city officials were used to hearing the perspective of millennials,” he said. But many young voters who showed up to forums over the past few months said the divide seems two-sided. “I think there might be a sense that a lot of the municipal issues are, in some ways, predetermined. Or that there’s not much that we as individuals could do about it,” said Daniel Herr, a 26-year-old grad student who lives on Johns Island. “A young person’s vote is going to be very important in this election and a lot of people dispute that,” said candidate Deerin. “A lot of people are like ‘Oh, young people aren’t going to vote.’... I don’t believe that. I think they are going to make a huge difference in this election.” Next generation Beyond just getting votes, candidates have a vested interest in supporting predominantly youth-driven industries because they create jobs and diversify Charleston’s economy. At the recent food and beverage forum, Tecklenburg and Stavrinakis said they were against the late-night bar moratorium because it was bad for business. All of the candidates also said they would feel committed to supporting local musicians by encouraging live music across the city. Both of these industries are important to the young professional workforce, who are often driving the growth of the technology sector, said Ernest Andrade, the director of the Charleston Digital Corridor Foundation. “The workforce on peninsular Charleston is younger now than it’s been in the past 25 years. ... If you look at the industry in downtown Charleston that’s had the most expansion, it’s the technology industry,” he said. “The young professional workforce, they expect the music venues, they expect a very thriving food and beverage scene.” And since tech businesses continue to compete to draw top talent from all over the country, he said, it’s important that the city remain a desirable place for young people to live. “Charleston is by nature becoming rebranded as a destination for food and music and this culture hasn’t really been exposed until now. The brand of Charleston has been very ... horse-and-carriage, quaint little town for a long time,” Eddy, of the BACE League, said. “The music industry, the tech industry, all these industries are developing here and it’s becoming an actual place that people who are just graduated from college or are young can live and make a living.” Smith said that’s why this change in leadership may also foster a surge of participation from young residents. “We are in a position in Charleston where there are enough young, creative, forward-thinking type people to disrupt the status quo,” he said. “That’s really what it comes down to.” Reach Abigail Darlington at 937-5906 and follow her on Twitter @A_Big_Gail Enlarge People from the Charleston food and beverage industry listen to four of the six candidates for mayor during a debate held at the Trident Technical College Palmer campus.
