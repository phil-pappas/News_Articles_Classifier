(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) October 11 at 6:54 PM Regarding the Oct. 7 Metro article “ Metro links decline in ridership to service ”:\nReducing carbon emissions from transit is central to creating climate-smart cities, a key component of President Obama’s Climate Action Plan and new international climate efforts.\nDiversion of 50 million trips or more off Metro over the past five years, as suggested by the article, represents a significant addition to our region’s carbon footprint.\nTo help slow climate change, our region must double down on use of Metro and build on our high rate of bicycle commuting. That means matching renewed investment in Metro with a public commitment to choose low-carbon transit whenever possible.\nJad Daley , Alexandria\nThe writer is director of the Climate-Smart Cities program at the Trust for Public Land.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:09:52.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
