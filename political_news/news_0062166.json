Ivory Coast’s president Alassane Ouattara is widely expected to win a second term as the West African nation votes, five years after a disputed poll that spilled over into the worst violence the country has experienced since independence.(AP Photo/Schalk van Zuydam)\nAssociated Press Oct. 25, 2015 | 2:09 p.m. EDT + More By The Associated Press\nElections are being held in eight countries around the world on Sunday. Here is a glance at what's at stake:\n— ARGENTINA: Argentines are weighing continuity versus a financial overhaul as they vote for the successor to President Cristina Fernandez, a polarizing leader who dominated national politics for 12 years. Her chosen successor, Daniel Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires province and a former vice president, is the front-runner, according to polls published last week. Polls close at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT). First results expected around 10 p.m. EDT (0200 GMT).\n— GUATEMALA: In the first election since the previous president and vice president were ousted after mass protests over corruption, comedian Jimmy Morales, a political neophyte, is heavily favored to win. Polls close at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT). First results expected around 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT)\n— HAITI: With more than 50 presidential candidates and no clear front-runner, a December runoff seems inevitable in the impoverished Caribbean nation. Polls close at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT). Results not expected until late November.\n— IVORY COAST: Incumbent President Alassane Ouattara is widely expected to prevail over a divided opposition and perhaps secure enough votes to avoid a runoff in the first presidential election since a disputed vote five years ago triggered violence that killed more than 3,000 people. Polls closed at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT). Official results expected within five days.\n— POLAND: A parliamentary election is expected to shift power from the centrist, pro-market Civic Platform party to the socially conservative Law and Justice party, which favors more welfare spending to help the poor. Polls close at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). Exit polls are expected Sunday night and official results on Monday.\n— REPUBLIC OF CONGO: A constitutional referendum is being held to decide if the country's longtime president is eligible for a new term. Under current laws, 71-year-old President Denis Sassou N'Guesso is barred from seeking re-election when his second term expires next year. The referendum asks voters to change the constitution to scrap a two-term limit and 70-year-old age limit for candidates. Polls close at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Results could come by Friday.\n— TANZANIA: Tanzanians turn out in large numbers to vote in general elections in which the ruling party, in power for decades, faces a strong challenge from a united opposition. The ruling party candidate, John Magufuli, is battling a former prime minister, Edward Lowassa, who defected to the opposition earlier this year, in a presidential race many analysts say is too close to predict. Polls closed at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT). Results expected within three to four days.\n— UKRAINE: Elections for local councils and mayors are seen as a test of strength for President Petro Poroshenko's government and the oligarchs accustomed to running regions of the country. Voting is not taking place in parts of eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed rebels, and was scrapped at the last minute in Mariupol, a major port and steel city that rebels have been trying to capture for over a year. Polls close at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
