The ferry lost power after the collision, but it was not in any danger of sinking, they said.\nFerry operator Shun Tak Holdings said a preliminary inspection found damage to the boat's rear wing and the engine room.\nAs of 7 a.m. Monday, the injury count stood at 124, including five people in critical condition, Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said.\nTV news channels showed passengers, some with bandages on their heads, arriving at a Hong Kong pier and being taken to waiting ambulances.\nIt was the fourth accident in two years on the busy hour-long ferry route between the coastal Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong. Vessels depart around every 15 minutes on the route, which operates around the clock, taking passengers from the Asian financial center of Hong Kong to Macau, a former Portuguese colony now known mainly for its glitzy casinos.\nIn a similar accident in November 2013, 87 people were hurt when a Macau hydrofoil hit a floating object off an outlying Hong Kong island. Last year, a ferry hit a breakwater in Macau's harbor and another collided with a mainland Chinese cargo ship in separate incidents that left dozens injured.\nHong Kong's nautical safety has been in the spotlight since the city suffered its biggest maritime tragedy in decades in 2012 when a boat and commuter ferry collided, killing 39 people and injuring about 100.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
