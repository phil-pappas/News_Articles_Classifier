An optimistic campaign. A campaign from the heart. A campaign consistent with his values, our values, and the values of the American people. And I think it’s fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won’t be a scripted affair — after all, it’s Joe.” \nKaufman’s letter, which was sent late Thursday, was first reported by the Associated Press. The letter comes after reports that former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s strong performance in the first Democratic presidential made it more difficult for Biden to enter the race and rationalize a campaign. \nBut Kaufman said Biden’s top consideration remains whether his family can withstand another presidential campaign. The vice president and the Biden family have been considering a campaign just months after the May 30 death of Beau Biden, the vice president’s eldest son and former Delaware attorney general. \n“All of you know well that the first and foremost consideration will be the welfare and support of his family,” Kaufman said in the letter. “That’s Joe Biden. He has been clear about this and it is as true today as it has been for the past several months. He is determined to take, and to give his family, as much time as possible to work this through.” \nStarkey reports for The News Journal.
