It’s very difficult to win a debate when you don’t have the opportunity to speak the same amount of time on issues as the others did.” \nHe added: “It’s a reality that the debate was being portrayed as a showdown between Mrs. Clinton and Bernie, but if you’re going to be invited to participate and people are going to judge whether you, quote, ‘won’ or not, at least you should be able to have the kind of time that’s necessary to discuss the issues that you care about, that you’ve worked on.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:52:57.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
