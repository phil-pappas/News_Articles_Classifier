We have, at the moment, got a two per cent (council tax) increase in the budget but that is because we don’t know what is going to happen in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement. Promoted stories \n“It might be that don’t have to do it but if we haven’t consulted on it, we can’t do it. We don’t find out our settlement (grant from the Government) until Christmas so we can’t be any more specific with what we are doing with council tax at this stage until then.” \nCllr Sanders added: “It is the first one (Autumn Statement) following the General Election and one would expect more radical change that you would not normally get. \n“It doesn’t stop us continuing to drive efficiency. We have driven out a hell of a lot of costs since 2006. It has been £12million of costs which is approximately 25 per cent of our operating costs and yet we haven’t cut a single service.” \nThe local authority has created the new council plan two years ahead of schedule as it says it has been able to deliver most of the objectives in the Council Plan 2013 to 2017, including bringing John Lewis and Waitrose and Network Rail to the town, regenerating housing in Oakridge and Popley and starting major road improvements such as Black Dam Roundabout. \nCllr Sanders added: “We have managed to bring forward, one way or another, policies that support these actions and we have done quite a lot. \n“What we are now looking at doing is laying the foundations for the future. We have established all the policies by doing a number of things and we are saying this is the direction we want to go in but now we have to put in place things that will enable the borough to develop for the first half of the 21st century because the decisions we are taking over the next four or five years will actually set the framework for the way the town in particular, and the borough as a whole, will develop during that time.” Share article \nHe continued: “Our goal with the plan and budget is to try and combine our strong ambition with effectiveness so that we deliver a Basingstoke and Deane that is somewhere really fit for the 21st century, where there are places people want to live, facilities people can enjoy and everybody can enjoy the prosperity and everybody can share it so that it is not restricted and we have removed as much division in our society as we possibly can.” \nIf the consultation is agreed at the meeting, the public will have their say on the proposals between October 30 and December 14.
