John Kasich, also assured Yost “ that ODE would continue to cooperate with your office to facilitate completion of this audit.” \n\nGunlock noted that he was personally responding to a letter Yost sent him and had not asked the 19-member board, which meets later this month, to weigh in. \n\nYost spokeswoman Brittany Halpin said the auditor hopes the full board will reconsider. She noted that Columbus schools waived attorney-client privilege to release documents to Yost during his investigation into student-data tampering in the district. \n\nLast month, the state board tabled a request by some board members for an independent investigation into former school choice chief David Hansen’s scrubbing of charter-school-sponsor evaluations to inflate their ratings. \n\nGunlock and others who opposed the independent probe argued that Yost was looking into the matter and the department also had turned over documents involving the evaluations to the state inspector general for possible review. \n\n“They really don’t want this looked at. They’ve thrown up road blocks every chance they can. That only leads you to conclude they are hiding something,” said A.J. Wagner, a board member from Dayton who sought an independent probe. \n\nGunlock defended his decision, saying “I’m not giving up attorney-client privilege ever...this is all on principle. I’m not trying to hide anything. Everyone is entitled to attorney-client privilege.” \n\nGunlock said he does not think his decision jeopardizes Yost’s probe. \n\n“We already admitted it was done wrong. We pulled (the evaluations) back and nobody lost money or did anything that hurt anybody,” he said. \n\nWagner, an attorney, said he doesn’t take attorney-client privilege “lightly,” but under these circumstances, it is outweighed by the public’s right to know what happened. \n\n“This is a public agency,” he said. “Do you fall on the public’s right to know or a one-time waiver under limited circumstances?” \n\nIt’s not clear whether the full board will vote on whether to provide the requested communications to Yost. Gunlock, noting Yost’s letter requesting the information, was sent to him and not the full board, said he did not intend to place the matter on the agenda of the board’s next meeting, Oct. 19-20. \n\n“It’s a decision that should be made by the full board,” said Stephanie Dodd, a board member from Hebron. \n\nccandisky@dispatch.com \n\n@ccandisky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:37:52.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
