Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz were in New York around the same time as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, national security adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. Modi was in New York between 23 and 25 September and Swaraj was in the city between 30 September and 3 October. \nThe meeting between the two NSAs was agreed to at a meeting between the prime ministers in the Russian city of Ufa in July. The NSAs were to meet on 23-25 August to discuss all issues related to terrorism, according to the understanding arrived at in Ufa. These talks were to be followed by those between the chiefs of the border forces of the two countries, as well as senior army commanders, aimed at ensuring that a 2003 ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan holds. \nBut the NSA-level talks in August were called off after India expressed strong objections to the Pakistani NSA meeting Kashmiri separatists in New Delhi ahead of the talks with Doval.\nThe fresh initiative proposed last month floundered after Pakistan insisted the meeting between the foreign ministers be held either immediately before or after the NSA talks, according to one of the people from the Indian side cited earlier. \nPakistan’s proposal to hold foreign minister-level talks was seen by India as an attempt by the former to convey to its domestic audience that the almost-seven-decade-old Kashmir dispute was discussed by the two countries—something that India is open to discussing but not at this time, according to Indian officials. \nA person familiar with the developments on the Pakistani side, however, contradicted the Indian version of events on Thursday, stating that it was India that approached Pakistan for a meeting between NSAs. The contact, the person said, took place in the weeks preceding the visits to New York by the Indian and Pakistani delegations. But the person admitted that India did not agree to the foreign minister-level talks “that we had proposed”.\nWhen asked whether India had proposed the talks, foreign ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said: “We stand by the Ufa understanding. The Ufa understanding is very clear. The two NSAs are to meet to discuss all issues connected to terrorism, the directors general of (India’s) BSF (Border Security Force) and the Pakistani Rangers and the DGMOs (directors general of military operations) are to meet to discuss the issues on the border... So we remain committed to this particular understanding. We have said that we are ready for an NSA-level dialogue. The last time Pakistan walked out of this saying you are not allowing us to do this and we can’t accept that. We remain committed to the Ufa understanding that if Pakistan is willing to have a dialogue of the two NSAs on all issues connected to terrorism, we are all for it.”\nOn a question regarding news reports that the US could be considering a civilian nuclear deal with Pakistan similar to one signed with India in 2008, Swarup said: “Whosoever is examining that particular dossier should be well aware of Pakistan’s track record in the area of proliferation. And when India got this particular deal, it was on the basis of our own impeccable non-proliferation track record.” \nThe reference was to charges against Pakistan that it has shared nuclear weapons-related expertise with countries such as North Korea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:11:51.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
