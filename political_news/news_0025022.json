University spokesman Kendrick Callis said the suspected shooter was still on the loose as of early afternoon. He said the campus is on lockdown and classes have been cancelled.\nHouston and campus police didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Police and emergency vehicles were at the scene, though no additional details were available.\nThe incident occurred just hours after another shooting near the same housing complex. The university said in a statement posted on its website that the earlier shooting occurred early Friday morning, and that the school was increasing police presence on campus. No other details were immediately available and it's not clear if the shootings are linked.\nThe university has about 9,700 students.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
