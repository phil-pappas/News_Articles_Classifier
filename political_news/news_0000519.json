Morton , MD, MPH, ASMBS President, who served as moderator for the Summit, which was held in September. \"That's why there is intense and growing interest in how we can work together to better help our patients with obesity and related diseases. Obesity is the medical equivalent of economic inflation - obesity increases costs and decreases the effectiveness of medical interventions. We are paying for obesity already. Let's coordinate and provide care the right way.\"\nSpecialists in obesity medicine, bariatric surgery, orthopaedics, diabetes, heart disease, reproductive medicine, sleep medicine, anesthesiology, nutrition, behavioral health, dentistry and oncology discussed prevention and treatment strategies for obesity, patient access to treatment, care coordination and how to further engage patients themselves in the treatment of obesity. Representatives from the insurance industry also participated.\n\"Treating obesity is central to the management of type 2 diabetes,\" said William Herman , MD, MPH, who represented the American Diabetes Association. \"Medical care is so siloed. We need to move from a piecemeal approach to one that is more comprehensive.\"\nRecently the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association issued a joint scientific statement on cardiovascular disease in adults with type 2 diabetes , which for the first time includes discussion and recommendations on bariatric and metabolic surgery, focuses on blood pressure and blood glucose control, cholesterol management, aspirin therapy, and weight management through lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical approaches.\nAnother group that is becoming increasingly focused on obesity treatment is the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the world's leading professional organization representing physicians who care for people with cancer. Last October, ASCO called for increased education, research and advocacy \"to reduce the toll of obesity, both as a leading cause of cancer and complication in the care of cancer patients.\"\nJennifer Ligibel , MD, who leads the ASCO Energy Balance Working Group, presented data at the Summit that illustrated a strong connection between obesity and cancer, a connection she says is not well recognized, especially in the general population.\n\"Over the next 20 years, obesity is likely to be the most preventable cause of cancer,\" Dr. Ligibel said. Dr. Ligibel told the group she envisions potential collaborations in research, education and policy activities.\nCollaboration was the key word as the group discussed how they could work together to improve patient care through a multidisciplinary, comprehensive approach to obesity.\n\"The AASM recognizes that healthy sleep helps prevent obesity, and that helping our patients with obesity lose weight is an integral part of sleep apnea treatment. This conference is a great step towards whole person healthcare,\" said Timothy I. Morgenthaler , MD, Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine and past president, American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).\n\"We are thankful to be included in the Summit. The dental office can play an important role in assessing for and monitoring chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, which are significantly linked to obesity,\" said Lindsey Robinson , DDS, who represented the American Dental Association. \"Dental care professionals can be an important part of the multi-disciplinary care team to manage patients with chronic diseases and reduce obesity prevalence in society.\"\nMany said the AMA's classification of obesity as a disease brings a new critical focus and sense of urgency regarding obesity prevention and treatment to the general public, healthcare professionals, payers and policymakers.\n\"It's important we work together with physicians at all levels,\" said Mary Anne McCaffree , MD, a member of the AMA Board of Trustees, who said the AMA will focus on prediabetes detection and treatment, as well as detecting hypertension at its early states, as part of a strategic initiative. \"We do none of this alone, but in a collaborative effort.\"\nStacy Brethauer , MD and Shanu Kothari , MD from the ASMBS served as co-chairs of the summit. Other ASMBS representatives in attendance included Raul Rosenthal , MD, Ninh Nguyen , MD, Alfons Pomp, MD Chris Bauer, MSN, RN, CBN and Karen Flanders , MSN, ARNP, CBN.\nPlanned activities from the Summit include the development of joint guidelines and symposia, a Healthy Hospital Initiative, an obesity treatment app, an educational curriculum, and collaboration on a legislative agenda, among other initiatives.\nNational Obesity Summit on the Provision of Care for the Obese Patient Participating Organizations\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND)\nAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)\nAmerican Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)\nAmerican Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)\nAmerican Association of Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE)\nAmerican Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology (ACG)\nAmerican College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM)\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)\nAmerican College of Surgeons (ACS)\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)\nAmerican Dental Association (ADA)\nAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA)\nAmerican Heart Association (AHA)\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA)\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA)\nAmerican Sleep Apnea Association (ASAA)\nAmerican Society for Bariatric Physicians (ASBP)\nAmerican Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE)\nAmerican Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS)\nAmerican Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)\nAmerican Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)\nEndocrine Society\nInternational Society for the Perioperative Care of the Obese Patient (ISPCOP)\nNational Lipid Association (NLA)\nObesity Action Coalition (OAC)\nStrategies to Overcome & Prevent Obesity Alliance (STOP)\nThe Obesity Society (TOS)\nBlue Cross Blue Shield\nOptum\nPacific Business Group on Health\nWillis-Towers Watson\nAbout Obesity\nStudies have shown individuals with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals, as well as an increased risk of developing more than 30 obesity-related diseases and conditions including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.\nAbout the ASMBS\nThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in obesity, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved outcomes for morbidly obese patients.
