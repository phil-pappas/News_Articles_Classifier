Charles Martland! | Politics", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "(Before It's News)\nFellow Conservative,\nBy now, we all know the story about Sgt. 1 st Class Charles Martland, the Bronze Star recipient and Army Green Beret who was discharged from the army for taking a stand and confronting a confessed serial child rapist in Afghanistan.\nIt wasn’t just anyone, either… The man was a local Afghan police commander.\nA local mother had come to Martland’s unit and begged them to do something about the police chief who kidnapped and raped her young son.\nWhen Sgt. Martland confronted the police officer and asked whether he was abusing young boys, the Afghan laughed in his face and dared him to do something about it.\nSgt. Martland lost his temper. He put his hands on the police officer and pushed him over.\nNow the Army is using this one incident as an excuse to kick this American hero out of the military. It’s disgusting!\nDon’t let the Army do this to this American hero! Draw your line in the sand and DEMAND that Congress reinstate Charles Martland!\nThey don’t care that Sgt. Martland received a Bronze Star for valor. They don’t care that he spent 11 years fighting for this country.\nAll these career bureaucrats care about is that Martland has a blemish on his record.\nThe sad truth is that the Obama administration hasn’t done a thing. President Obama could put a stop to this. All he has to do is make a call.\nUnfortunately, Sgt. Martland’s plight has fallen on deaf ears in the White House.\nSo, the Executive Branch refuses to fix this. That leaves Congress as the last chance to save this hero’s military career.\nRepresentatives Vern Buchanan (R-FL) and Duncan Hunter (R-CA) have introduced House Resolution 451, an effort to force the Army to reinstate Sgt. Martland .\nWith all the chaos surrounding this week’s Speaker of the House election, this resolution has fallen by the wayside. But now that Congress is getting back into the swing of things, these Congressmen are pushing for a vote as early as this week!\nThere are now 34 Congressmen who have signed on and cosponsored this common-sense resolution. Every day, more Congressmen sign on.\nNow is the time to strike! Sgt. Martland’s last-ditch appeal is just days away. If he loses his appeal and Congress does nothing, then it’s over.\nYou CANNOT allow that to happen!\nDon’t let the Obama administration get away with this! Demand that Congress pass H. Res. 451 and force the Army to reinstate Sgt. 1 st Class Charles Martland!\nThe Obama administration’s true colors have been revealed. By even considering discharging this hero, the administration and Pentagon have proven that they care more about the rights of Afghan child rapists than distinguished American heroes.\nH.Res 451 is quite literally the most common-sense piece of legislation ever written in Congress. It essentially has 4 major points.\n“ (1) Members of the United States Armed Forces should not be punished for standing up to child rapists;\n(2) Putting the interests of Afghan rapists ahead of American war heroes is a national disgrace;\n(3) The Americans who should be punished are those who created and condone the immoral and reprehensible policy that encourages members of the Armed Forces to ignore child rape; and\n(4) The Secretary of Defense should immediately order the reinstatement of Sergeant First Class Charles Martland as a member of the Army. ”\nAnyone who opposes this resolution has no business serving in any capacity.\nWe have a chance to change the course of our national history. If we do nothing, then we will send a clear message to this administration, and future administrations, that they can get away with punishing American heroes like this.\nThat is unacceptable.\nIf you won’t stand to fight for Sgt. Martland, then who will?\nWe’re running out of time! FaxBlast Congress now and force them to pass H. Res. 451 to reinstate Sgt. Martland into the Army!\nSincerely,\nJoe Otto\nConservative Daily", "external_links": ["http://www.conservative-daily.com//feed/https://app.advocacytoaction.com/campaign.aspx?id=1514&#038;utm_source=blog&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=1514", "http://store.truthgear.net/collections/frontpage/products/credit-card-knife", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/advocacytoaction.com/319_12fa7903-b8ec-4a32-b9b8-6364851e161e.jpg", "http://www.conservative-daily.com//feed/https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hres451/BILLS-114hres451ih.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:40:06.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
