She has overseen the project from day one through to now where we are in the preparatory stages of negotiating with the Crown. Outstanding things have been achieved under Lorraine’s management: obtaining a mandate from NgÄpuhi which has been recognised by the Crown, the appointment of negotiators, Terms of Negotiation being signed and taking the NgÄpuhi settlement to the point of negotiations. \n\"When the NgÄpuhi settlement legislation is enacted in Parliament in the coming years, and our people set off on a journey of advancement, it will be in no small measure because of the drive and determination of Lorraine.\" \nMs Toki acknowledges it was a very difficult decision to make particularly during this challenging time for NgÄpuhi, however, personal circumstances have meant making some important decisions. \n\"Although stepping down as Project Manager, the advancement of my people will always be in my heart, and I wish the TÅ«horonuku IMA board, negotiators and project team well for the important mahi ahead. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:30:27.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
