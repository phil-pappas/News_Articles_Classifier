According to Harrington, the serious trouble began when Texas stopped accepting expired visas and identification cards issued by the Mexican consulate -- called \"matriculas\" -- from parents seeking birth certificates for their children. \nHarrington suggests the tightened list of accepted documents suspiciously coincided with a rise in immigration and border security as political hot topics around 2011. \"That's the question,\" Harrington told reporters after a hearing Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Hearing continues over birth certificates \n\"Why did they tighten it?\" asked Harrington. \"There were no identity issues going on then. Why do all of a sudden we have to have another set of regulations?\" \nJudge Robert Pitman, an Obama appointee, warned the state against trying to minimize the importance of a birth certificate, which he described as 'akin to a fundamental right' of U.S. citizens. Pitman questioned what problem the state was trying to fix by raising the barriers to getting one. Attorneys for the state replied that data to indicate fraud wasn't readily available. \nState attorneys questioned the reliability of the matricula, and suggested that parents or other relatives in the case simply hadn't exhausted all the options available to get that birth certificate. In a statement after the hearing, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, \"We stand in defense of the state of Texas, including the policies put in place to protect Texans' most sensitive information and documents.\" \n\"In this case, a birth certificate is the key to a person's very identity, and these vital documents must be protected by requiring basic, common-sense forms of identification in order to obtain copies,\" wrote Paxton. \"With identity theft a growing national concern, now is not the time to relax our requirements and accept forms of identification that may not sufficiently prove that a requestor is who they say they are.\" \n\"I thought a lot of what the state said was insulting to people,\" said Harrington, who asked Pitman to grant a preliminary restraining order providing immediate relief for families in desperate need of the services available to their children. \n\"It's not easy at all,\" said Harrington, \"And these are people with great personal sacrifice to be in this country, who do a lot of the very menial jobs that we have in this country and are here for the same reason that our ancestors came here, to have a better life for their kids.\" \nThe Mexican government argues new matriculas are more secure, and has filed a brief in support of the families. According to the governor's office, the issue did not come up on Gov. Greg Abbott's September visit to Mexico, in which he met and discussed a number of issues with Mexican officials, including security. \nAsked about the lawsuit Friday, Abbott pointed to questions raised about the previous matricula's security by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. \n\"When you consider the almost 20 different types of documents that people can use to obtain the birth certificates, it's clear that there's no politics behind it,\" Abbott told KVUE. \"It's a law enforcement mechanism where we are following a federal base protocol not to recognize the matricula.\" \nHarrington argues it's about more than just matriculas, but a two-tiered system with citizen children whose parents are undocumented. \"Why do they have to do something different than everybody else does,\" asked Harrington. \nPitman could issue a preliminary injunction, but acknowledged Friday such an order would have to be carefully worded. The issue could also go to a trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:04:39.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
