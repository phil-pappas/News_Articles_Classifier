We can no longer facilitate this war\nTrevor Timm\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/america-yemen-crisis-is-partly-our-fault\n…………..The United States and the United Kingdom are actively aiding and abetting Saudi Arabia while the country indiscriminately kills thousands of civilians in Yemen in what amounts to war crimes by almost anyone’s definition. The two western powers, who often purport to care about democracy and human rights, are also helping the Saudi monarchy – one of the most repressive regimes on the planet – cover up those crimes at the UN. These actions are abhorrent, and it’s shameful the brewing scandal has hardly received any attention from the US political establishment or television news.\nThe New York Times, the rare exception to the giant shrug much of the American media has given this critical subject, recently published a harrowing front-page story on the rash of indiscriminate bombing – conducted in response to Houthi rebels who have attacked the sitting government – that has been killing scores of civilians with direct help from the US. That report came before the latest and deadliest attack on civilians yet: last week, a Saudi strike killed at least 130 innocent people at a wedding, mostly women and children. Over 500 children have been killed since the start of the strikes.\nIt would be hard for the US to give more assistance to Saudi Arabia as they commit these atrocities without actually dropping the bombs themselves: the Saudis are using cluster munitions (banned by treaty in the vast majority of countries around the world) supplied to them by United States defense contractors. They’re dropping those bombs using American-made fighter jets. The US military, far from being a neutral observer, is actively providing the Saudis with intelligence and logistical assistance for their air strikes. And the US is finalizing a deal to give even more weapons to the Saudis. The Obama administration has already sold them more than $90bn of military weapons over the past five years……………..\nAmnesty Intl. calls for stopping arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia\nDeadly bomb blast hits mosque in Yemen’s capital Sana’a\nIran’s deputy FM meets Yemeni delegation in Tehran\nSources: Gaps Widening between Yemen’s Fugitive President, PM\nYemeni sources disclosed that differences between\nfugitive President Mansour Hadi and his Prime Minister Khaled Bahah have\nincreased after the Tuesday attack on a hotel in the city of Aden where\nthe latter was staying.\n“Tough disputes have risen between Hadi and Bahah after the recent attacks,” informed Yemeni sources said on Wednesday. Mansour and Bahah have been running a fued for the\npast several months, and their differences grew noisy when a number of\nSaudi officials worked out a plan to replace the fugitive president with\nhis premier in order to encourage the revolutionary forces back in\nYemen to work with him and allow him to start a new government. He noted that Saudi Arabia has decided to hold an\nemergency meeting to be attended by UAE and Bahraini troops as well as\nforces loyal to Hadi and Bahah in an effort to bring some coordination\namong its allies. Meantime, an informed Yemeni source said that\nseveral Saudi and Emirati officers were among the casualties of the\nrocket attack on Aden’s Qasr Hotel where Bahah stayed. On Tuesday, rocket-propelled grenade attacks on\nhotel of residence of former Yemeni prime minister in Aden killed at\nleast 18 of his Emirati guards. Bahah escaped to Saudi Arabia once again after his UAE guards were killed in the attack. A number of officials from the former Yemeni regime, including Khaled Bahah, were reportedly staying at the hotel. An unspecified number of individuals have also been wounded in the attacks. It is not clear if any of the former Yemeni officials said to be residing at the hotel are among the casualties. However, other reports said Khaled Bahah escaped unharmed. Sources also said Khaled Bahah and his cabinet members were evacuated by a UAE helicopter. Saudi Arabia has been striking Yemen for 196 days\nnow to restore power to Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. The Saudi-led\naggression has so far killed at least 6,448 Yemenis, including hundreds\nof women and children. Hadi stepped down in January and refused to\nreconsider the decision despite calls by Ansarullah revolutionaries of\nthe Houthi movement. Despite Riyadh’s claims that it is bombing the\npositions of the Ansarullah fighters, Saudi warplanes are flattening\nresidential areas and civilian infrastructures.
