Hillary Clinton’s campaign had always planned to deploy the former president as a rainmaker this fall, and people involved with her fundraising operation expect him to start pitching in for the top pro-Clinton super PAC too. Yet — to no one’s surprise — Bill (a.k.a. “The Big Dog” in Clintonland) gradually is expanding his influence into other facets of her White House bid, using media interviews about his charity work to make the case for his wife’s candidacy and, according to senior Democrats close to the campaign, quietly participating in high-level discussions about 2016.\n“He’s such a battery charger,” explained one longtime Clinton friend and Washington ally — changing the metaphor in mid-sentence to reflect the campaign’s summer swoon. “He’s like paddles on the heart.”\nHillary kicked off her campaign this spring while nudging her husband to the sidelines — and emphasizing that she, not he, was firmly in control of her second presidential run.\nDonald Trump, Hillary Clinton dominate Facebook in early states By Hadas Gold\nBut a lot has changed over the last couple of months, and Bill — still a force of political nature — is just too important to remain sidelined. His wife raised a mere $2 million more than Sanders in the last three months, fueling doubts about a campaign that was once seen as a waltz to the nomination, if not the White House. And he’s become increasingly restive, people close to him say, as his wife faces declining poll numbers and a Vermont-based insurgency by a challenger who wasn’t on their radar a year ago.\n“Does he help? Of course he does. He is the most gifted public leader of our time. He is the most beloved figure on Earth — with the exception of Pope Francis. After the Obamas and the Bidens, of course, he was the MVP of the 2012 presidential election,” said veteran Clinton ally and strategist Paul Begala, who works with Priorities USA, the main pro-Clinton super PAC.\nThe recent conclusion of the Clinton Global Initiative meetings in New York marks an acceleration in Bill’s political activity, starting with three closed-door fundraisers in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan.\nHillary’s Brooklyn-based campaign staffers deny they have made a major strategic shift: Bill was always supposed to start increasing his campaign work. But his walk-on role as human cash machine is becoming a speaking gig, too, with a Friday stint headlining a Democratic Party dinner in West Virginia and an upcoming appearance on Stephen Colbert’s show.\nPrivately, people close to the campaign — including donors and aides — are seeing the former president invoked increasingly in email chains, whether as a participant in strategy sessions or as the source of an idea or a scrap of political intel. “You see his name a lot more now,” said one Clinton friend.\nExactly how the Democratic Party’s most popular living ex-president will be rolled out in the coming months still the subject of ongoing discussion among Clinton confidants and the campaign’s top brass in Brooklyn, people familiar with those discussions say. He still has Clinton Foundation events on his schedule through at least the end of 2015.\nBut some decisions have been made: Bill won’t start flying into Des Moines or Manchester anytime soon, for example. In addition to raising money, he will likely slowly start ramping up his own political travel, seeking to energize Democrats beyond the early-voting states — particularly in places like West Virginia, where the local party infrastructure has fallen on hard times, and where her campaign has signed an agreement to help raise money for state Democrats.\nAnd, say Democrats helping craft the pro-Clinton fundraising strategy, he will likely begin to raise money for Priorities USA — though no specific plans have been made on this front, either.\nWhen Hillary Clinton met David Koch By Kenneth P. Vogel\nThe Clinton campaign always expected to tap Bill’s political skills in late 2015. The ex-president wanted to get the foundation’s annual New York summit out of the way before diving fully in, friends told POLITICO, but he has kept close tabs on 2016. That’s included reaching out to Obama-era donors who are new to Clinton circles, and appearing at a handful of private campaign cash events featuring his own longtime supporters.\nWith his wife struggling against Sanders in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the assistance couldn’t come soon enough, some Democrats say.\n“They will use him appropriately, but make no mistake: He’s very important to her and very important to this campaign. And he’s a very popular guy,” said another longtime family friend and adviser.\nStill, some influential party figures remain wary of the example of 2008, when Hillary was more focused on proving that she wasn’t running for her husband’s third term. Bill eventually played a very public role in that race, but many Democrats still whisper that he helped cost her South Carolina due to his rhetoric about then-Sen. Barack Obama — like his infamous “fairy tale” remark , which the former president has said was misinterpreted.\n“One of the things that he has to be careful about is making sure that this is Hillary’s campaign and she’s the focal point,” explained Clinton friend and campaign fundraiser Jay Jacobs, who is in favor of Bill’s broadened role. “Just by the nature of his personality and the natural way people are attracted to him, it becomes something they have to be careful about.”\nBut the former president’s presence is already starting to be felt on the campaign trail.\nHis customary round of television interviews surrounding the foundation summit was more political than ever this week, though he has yet to sit for a single Q&A arranged by the campaign itself. And after he appeared at just one of Hillary’s public events during the first six months of her candidacy — her kickoff speech in New York — her campaign sent supporters three separate emails in his name in the final hours of the third fundraising quarter this week.\nKissing up to Clinton: The 15 most over-the-top emails By Nick Gass\nHe appeared in Atlanta and Leawood, Kansas, on Thursday for closed fundraisers, before another in Bingham Farms, Michigan, next Wednesday.\nThose three are the only campaign money events currently on his schedule, but like Friday’s dinner in West Virginia, each of these meetings is far from the early-voting states dominating Hillary’s schedule and in places where local Democrats could use a jolt heading into 2016.\n“The party apparatus, the big-b Base, people that make the gears move? They’re still really, really important. And who better to go out there over time and get those gears going and make those people smile and make them energized?” said another Clinton confidant familiar with Bill’s plans.\n“I don’t think that there is a ‘Deploy Bill Clinton Day,’” this person said. “And it’s not like, ‘Hey, where’s Bill? We need him today!’ He’s in the net-gain business. He’s focused on that every day.”\nGlenn Thrush contributed reporting.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:00:47.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
