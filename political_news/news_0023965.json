Blood says he gets up at an “ungodly hour” to exercise before his wife wakes. Then he relies on a support system of friends and his religious faith to get him through any rough patches.\nAs a result, Blood says he and his 78-year-old wife, a two-time cancer survivor who has advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and some memory problems, have never been closer. He’s also founded an online magazine, Caregiver Harbor, to provide resources for others helping their loved ones.\nIf you’re a caregiver and can’t imagine how Blood manages to fulfill all his responsibilities and still maintain a good attitude, then you’ve probably put your own self-care on the backburner. Here are three reasons to make yourself a priority.\nReason No. 1: You may no longer be able to care for your loved one.\nA main reason to focus on self-care is because, without it, your own health may diminish to the point where you are no longer able to act as a caregiver.\nA 2011 study from the National Alliance for Caregiving tracked the health of 1,222 people who provided care for someone with Alzheimer’s disease . Over an 18 month period, the study found caregivers’ self-reported health declined and their health care usage increased. Overall, they had double the visits to the emergency room and nearly triple the visits to physicians as similar aged non-caregivers. While the study encouraged further research, it did suggest that respite services for caregivers could improve their health.\nEven if your health doesn’t deteriorate to the point where you can no longer care for your loved one, you may find you’re not as attentive. “On bad days, I’m not picking up on signals [from my wife] like I do on good days,” Blood says about what happens when he neglects his self-care.\nReason No. 2: You may lose friends and have a lower quality of life.\nJane Wolf Waterman, a family care coach, author and founder of the elder care support organization Parenting Our Parents, says no amount of research can adequately convey the real-life experience of caregiving. “The numbers don’t reflect how personally alone and scary caregiving can be,” she says.\nShe compares it to raising children except that you’re helping someone who will need more help, not less, as time goes on. What’s more, while parents have access to a variety of communal resources – from playgroups to moms’ morning out groups – Waterman says caregivers don’t often have that same “village” rallying around them.\nAs a result, caregivers must be proactive about maintaining ties to family and friends and keeping active in outside interests. “Many caregivers lose their friends and become as isolated as the person they’re caring for,” says Pamela D. Wilson, known as The Care Navigator and author of “The Caregiving Trap: Solutions for Life’s Unexpected Changes.”\nBeyond losing friends, caregivers who neglect taking care of themselves could find their work suffers if they have a job. Depression is another risk. A 2006 assessment of caregivers for the Family Caregiver Alliance found that 40 to 70 percent of caregivers have symptoms of depression.\nReason No. 3: You may put yourself at risk for an early death.\nThe most compelling reason to take care of yourself while caregiving? Failure to do so could mean you pass away prematurely.\nPeople who experience caregiver strain have a 63 percent higher mortality risk than noncaregivers, according to a 1999 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association that evaluated 392 caregivers and 427 noncaregivers. However, subsequent research published by the Association for Psychological Science called those findings into question.\nDespite the conflicting data, Wilson doesn’t doubt there is a link. After 15 years of working with caregivers on a daily basis, she says, caregivers “tend to ignore their own health.”\nWilson points to actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed in an equestrian accident in 1995, and wonders if caregiving played a role in his wife Dana’s death at age 44. “She cared for him all those years and then was diagnosed [as a nonsmoker] with lung cancer eight months after he died,” she says. While there is no definitive link, Wilson is adamant caregiving can take a toll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:40:28.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
