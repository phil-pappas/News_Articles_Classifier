The Supreme Court has directed Setalvad and her husband to adhere to the conditions imposed by the Bombay High Court, while granting them relief. \nThe Supreme Court also sought response from Teesta Setalvad and her husband on the Central Bureau of Investigation’s petition to cancel their bail in a FCRA violation case. \nThe Supreme Court had on 12 October terming as a “mistake” its earlier order of extending interim bail granted to Teesta Setalvad and her husband, indicated that the bail was granted by a two-judge bench instead of three. \n“It was a mistake,” a bench comprising justices AR Dave and Adarsh Kumar Goel ruled when senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for the activist, said the bail expired on October 15 \n“It is a three-judge bench matter… place it before the appropriate bench,” the court said and asked Sibal to mention it before the chief Justice to make available a special bench to extend the relief. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:12:30.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
