The activists threw black ink at Kulkarni for organising a book launch for the former Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri.\nBoth Chavan and leader of opposition in state assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil blamed Shiv Sena for its double standards and pointed out that it is the same party that allowed its Union minister Anant Gite to take oath as Union minister in presence of Pakistan Prime Minister. They questioned as to why Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray did not oppose the presence of Pakistan Prime Minister, who was sitting next to him during the swearing-in ceremony.\nChavan said that even though Kulkarni represented an ideology which the Congress opposed, the incident of blackening his face would have a long-term impact. He said that Shiv Sena on one hand gave the slogan Shivshakti Bhimshakti and on the other hand, it was acting against the constitution laid down by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar.\nChavan said that Shiv Sena's patriotism was hypocrisy. Criticizing the state government for failing in maintaining the law and order situation, Chavan said that government is on a clean chit spree where it gives clean chits to its ministers as well as to Sanatan Sanstha activist Samir Gaikwad without waiting for the due process of law to take its own course.\nThe former chief minister also said that it was now for the government to arrest the Shiv Sena activists who were involved in the attack on Kulkarni.\nVikhe-Patil said that after prime minister Narendra Modi's Mumbai visit on Sunday it was evident that BJP does not give any importance to Shiv Sena since there was no formal invitation extended to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for the foundation laying ceremony of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's proposed memorial at Indu Mill land in Dadar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:11:45.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
