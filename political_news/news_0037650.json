REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson More + \nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the details of the last two Democratic debates scheduled for early next year. \nDemocratic presidential candidates will gather in Wisconsin on February 11 and then in Miami on March 9, DNC spokesperson Miryam Lepper confirmed to CBS News. PBS will host the Wisconsin debate -- the Democratic party's fifth -- while Univision and the Washington Post will take the helm on the sixth debate in Florida. \nThe calendar for the final debates had not been finalized when the DNC first publicized its schedule in August . \nThe national party has faced increasing pressure from contenders like former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to increase the number of debates . But last month, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, R-Florida, said the party is \"not changing the process.\" \nRepublicans have already held two debates over the last couple months, but Democratic candidates will convene for their first in Las Vegas on Tuesday. \nOther debates on the Democratic party's schedule: a KCCI/Des Moines Register debate on November 14 in Iowa, an ABC/WMUR debate on December 19 in New Hampshire, and an NBC News/Congressional Black Caucus Institute debate on January 17 in South Carolina. \nCBS News' Hannah Fraser-Chanpong contributed to this report.
