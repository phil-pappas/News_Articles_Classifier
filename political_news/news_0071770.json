I don't want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people literally are in decline in their lives. That is not my motivation. I've got a lot of really cool things I could do other than sit around, being miserable, listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that. \" -- at a town hall in Charleston, SC\nU.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Jacksonsville Landing in Jacksonville, Florida October 24, 2015.

And in all fairness he wants to stay in. But I have some numbers, he's cutting everybody - 40 percent across the board, and everyone's agreed to it. And me, as a businessman - we have a lot of businesspeople here - me, as a businessman said, 'Well if he's cutting everybody 40 percent, and every single person has agreed to it, why didn't he make that deal in the first place?' Does that make sense? In other words, if he's going to cut 40 percent, you make the deal in the first place. You don't wait until you're failing. So he's failing.\" -- at a rally in Jacksonville, Florida \nCBS News' Donald Judd and Alan He contributed to this compilation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:23:28.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
