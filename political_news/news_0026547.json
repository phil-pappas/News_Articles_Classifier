The play, part of Aditya Birla Group's Aadyam initiative, was staged in Delhi and Mumbai over the past few months to packed houses. It was with a bit of a surprise, therefore, that Akash Khurana agreed to our request for a meeting. Why meet him now when all the reviews had been out for a while (the play was first staged in May this year) and the play would only be staged next year, the theatre director and actor seemed to be wondering. And although Aadyam was a big success, both in Delhi and in Mumbai, where the plays were staged (\"The kind of audience we got for Aadyam in four months, is what we usually do in two years for our plays,\" Khurana guffawed), we convinced him that we also wanted to meet the man who has been acting, directing and writing for the stage for the past three decades.\nHaving worked extensively with theatre veterans such as Satyadev Dubey, Sunil Shanbag and Naseeruddin Shah, he is currently involved with Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie, Brian Friel's Faith Healer and the bilingual version of Vijay Tendulkar's Mitrachi Goshta. But for somebody who's done his MBA in Marketing, Khurana is self-admittedly not good at marketing the arts. \"I'm too condescending of the mediocrity and the people around to bother to market them, specially the arts. Faith Healer brings in 50 people, while 150 turn up for Tuesdays with Morrie. Personally, I do what I like and make sure I deliver quality,\" he says. The same philosophy works for AKVarious, helmed by his son Akarsh Khurana. \"In December, AKVarious completes 15 years and 50 shows. If you analyse those 50 plays, the diversity alone will put all other groups under the scanner,\" he adds.\nDiversity and innovation are also the key to Khurana's body of work. \"NCPA Classics (for which he did Mitrachi Goshta) and Aadyam are both two ends of the spectrum. All else that I've done falls in between. In that sense, it's a great signature. I can retire now,\" he laughs. We pretend we didn't hear him say the 'R' word. \"Well, I might just get stuck in something before that happens,\" he says with a grin, making us wonder what else he's got up his sleeve. Guess we will just have to wait and watch. We're sure it will be worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:08:15.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
