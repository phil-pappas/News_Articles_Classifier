My Barber still has them in the shop, but he cuts out all the nude pictures (I wonder what his wife thinks when she gets home and finds a pile of porn cut outs on the coffee table) it still looks about 80% of the size they are un-censored. Personally I think it'll slow the rot for a few years rather than save the ship, if you weren't starting from where they are now, I don't think anyone would be investing a pile of money into new magazines,. I think their best years financially recently were when oddly they did very well in the ladies fashion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:54:20.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
