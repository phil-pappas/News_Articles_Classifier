Cruz was asked whether he believed he could beat Trump based on his principles, in an interview with WABC's Rita Cosby that will air on Sunday,\n\"I think that's right. I think in time I don't believe Donald is going to be the nominee and I think in time the lionâ€™s share of his supporters end up with us,\" the freshman senator predicted. \"And I think the reason is what I was just saying, that if you look to the records of all the Republican candidates there's a big difference between my record and that of everyone else if you ask, who has stood up to Washington?\nHe continued: \"Who's taken on not just Democrats, but taken on leaders in their own party? Republican leadership, whether was leading the fight to stop Obamacare? Whether it was leading the fight to stop executive amnesty? Or actually, just going back to last week. You know at the last Republican debate in California, every Republican candidate stood up there and said, 'we need to defund Planned Parenthood.' But last week, when we had an epic drag down fight in Washington, not one of them showed up.\"\nCruz, who has declined to criticize Trump, unlike some of his GOP presidential rivals, reiterated that he is \"glad\" he is in the race and that his candidacy has reflected favorably on his own positions.\n\"And I'll note, you know I think the most beneficial thing Donald Trump's involvement in the race has been, I think his involvement has been tremendously helpful to my campaign, because it's framed the central question of this primary. As who will stand up to Washington? And if that's the central question, the natural next question, that any voter will ask is okay, well who actually has stood up to Washington? Who has a record in that regard?\" he asked.\nTrump senior adviser Daniel Scavino appeared to disagree with that assessment on Twitter early Friday: \"@TedCruz expects 2get #Trump2016 supporters...saying @realDonaldTrump will not get the #GOP nominee. I disagree!\" he wrote.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://soundcloud.com/wabc-rita-cosby/ted-cruz-interviewed-by-wabc-radio-host-rita-cosby-100815", "https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/652338869682208768"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:59:25.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
