Gigina was in a motorcade easing a route in Bucharest for Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea .\nPresident Klaus Iohannis called on Prime Minister Victor Ponta and Oprea to address the situation.\nThose at Sunday's demonstration in Bucharest called for Oprea's resignation. Many Romanians think that government ministers abuse their positions by overusing motorcades, which often block traffic in the busy capital.\nSome 300 motorcyclists drove through Bucharest late Saturday in solidarity with Gigina's family, and hundreds of others have protested his death on social media.\nPonta criticized opposition politicians and journalists on Saturday, saying they were using a tragedy for political gain.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:45:01.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
