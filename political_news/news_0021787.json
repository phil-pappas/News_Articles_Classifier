We want it to come to Parliament on Tuesday so that we can finish with it. \n“We shall pass a vote of confidence just like we did with Kaimenyi; it won’t even take an hour,” he insisted. \nThis is the second time that a Motion to impeach the Devolution CS has been filed in the National Assembly. \nIn 2014, a similar attempt was made by Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi. \nThe MP, however, dropped it at the last minute and failed to turn up to move the motion in what he later said was a result of intervention from President Uhuru Kenyatta. \nThe current motion was filed by Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter who has managed to collect at least 97 signatures. \nURP MPs who had appended their signatures have, however, been asked by Deputy President William Ruto to write to the Speaker of the National Assembly to withdraw them, to avoid ‘embarrassing the President in the House.’ \nSome of the MPs have complained that the matter, though an issue of Ms Waiguru’s integrity on matters of governance, has been turned into a Jubilee and Cord contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:51:15.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
