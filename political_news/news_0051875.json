(Video via CTV ) \nHis late father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, also held the position as Canadian prime minister. Justin's win establishes, as CTV calls it, \"Canada's first political family dynasty.\" (Video via Liberal Party of Canada ) \nBecause Canada does not have term limits, the conservative incumbent prime minister Stephen Harper held office since 2006. \nTrudeau's Liberal party also won a surprise majority, taking 184 of the 338 seats in parliament. The party was in third place in the Canadian House of Commons before the election.
