He mentioned this only two days later before the magistrate, when he said that Mr Khan had taken drinks on that evening, and he had asked the actor to drive slow.\nAdvocate Desai referred to Mr Patil's cross-examination before the magistrate during the earlier trial in 2007, when he had admitted to being silent on these aspects in the FIR.\nSo his statement before the magistrate implicating Mr Khan does not have any evidential value, Advocate Desai argued. The actor is currently out on bail. Arguments will continue today.\n entertainment Bollywood Salman Khan 2002 hit and run case Also Read Aamir celebrated Eid by watching 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' with family Ranveer Singh joins Deepika and Priyanka on the sets of 'Bajirao Mastani' Watch: Ranbir Kapoor's special message for Javed Sheikh's family No horsing around for Jacqueline Fernandez at the derby", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/entertainment-bollywood/article/salman-khans-lawyer-questions-value-police-bodyguards", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-khan-relationship-14-07-2013_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/salman-khan-relationship-14-07-2013_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:46:35.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
