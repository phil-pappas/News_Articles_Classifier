New Zealand First wants to speed up that process,\" says Mrs Martin. \n\"Manukura shows why we did not need the Education Act 1989 changes implemented by the National Government to allow Charter Schools. \n\"The mechanisms were already in place allowing schools wanting to deliver an education reflecting faith or a special educational philosophy to operate. \n\"New Zealand First made the commitment in its 2014 Manifesto to repeal the 2013 amendments to the Education Act 1989 that allowed the creation of charter schools alongside a review of the Designated Character Schools section in the Act. \n\"Manukura’s success in gaining special character status reinforces there is no need for charter schools in New Zealand,\" says Mrs Martin. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
