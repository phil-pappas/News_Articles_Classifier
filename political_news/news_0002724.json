PHOTO | SULEIMAN MBATIAH | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Speaking at Nakuru’s Mazembe grounds on Sunday, Mr Mudavadi who received defectors from Jubilee and Cord told politicians to desist from the ‘fixing’ debate as it was taking Kenyans back to the days of Post-Election Violence. Mr Mudavadi said nation could not be led from two extreme positions by leaders who could never compliment anything good from either side or even hold talks. Advertisement More by this Author \nAmani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has condemned the ongoing ICC witness 'coaching' debate. \nHe said the talk of who fixed who could degenerate into tribal animosity and violence like the one experienced in 2007/08. \nSpeaking at Nakuru’s Mazembe grounds on Sunday, Mr Mudavadi who received defectors from Jubilee and Cord told politicians to desist from the ‘fixing’ debate as it was taking Kenyans back to the days of Post-Election Violence. \n“Nakuru which is normally a haven of peace bore the brunt of the violence, people have not healed, others have not been compensated and yet the politicians are going round rekindling bad memories and dividing Kenyans on tribal grounds,” he said. \nThe former Deputy Prime Minister who was on a two-day tour of Nakuru urged Jubilee and Cord coalitions to tone down their politicking and attacks on each other. \n“All politicians should be preaching unity and that is why I am appealing to the two main coalitions to cool down their temperatures and stop the blame game for the sake of Kenya and her development,” he said. \nMr Mudavadi said nation could not be led from two extreme positions by leaders who could never compliment anything good from either side or even hold talks. \n“We want a country where people can dialogue, we are one nation and were elected by Kenyans to lead them and not to keep fighting over everything,” he said. \nHe also accused some leaders of using the much hyped prayer rallies for the ICC duo to create acrimony. \n“We have the freedom of speech, assembly and worship but please do not abuse the forums to send negative and inciting messages,” he said. \nhe was accompanied by Sabatia MP Mr Alfred Agoi among other leaders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:58:07.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
