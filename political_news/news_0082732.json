However, campaigns such as the GetUp one have been described as “ inconsistent at best, racist at worst ” as they only ever target young black R&B and rap acts while ignoring the misogyny rampant in the white-dominated genres of folk, indie, metal, rock and so on \n• New Zealand followed suit with it generating much debate throughout the week. Here is just a snippet of the commentary on Chris Brown’s admission into New Zealand – \no Judith Collins stated “ we've got enough wife-beaters in this country, [Brown] should just bugger off ”. Green MP and spokesperson for women Jan Logie came out against Collins stating she “ can't talk about Chris Brown without making her own apologies...and acknowledging the harm [she has done] ”. Collins replied with a list of actions she took “ to protect women and children during[her] time as minister [of Justice] ” \n• The day after 22-year-old Parmita Rani left her controlling husband Mandeep Singh, he waited in the foyer of her central-Auckland language school to stab her to death.

Let a woman MP know that we are relying on them to pledge to ‘pay the job not the gender’ \nLatest research: \n• Many young people partly blame victims for domestic violence, with more than half believing it is acceptable to track their partner electronically , an Australian study shows. Disturbingly, twenty per cent of the 16 – 24 year olds surveyed believe that women often say no when they mean yes \n• Women who feel objectified may be more likely tobecome victims of sexual assault, a study of US college students suggests. It found that many women whofeelobjectified beginto obsessively monitor their looksfrom an outsider’s perspective . That can lead to decreased sexual assertiveness and a higher risk of becoming victimized \n• If full gender parity were to be achieved, the contribution of women to global GDP growth could double between 2014 and 2025, adding as much as $28 trillion or 26 percent to the global economy . This is roughly the combined size of the economies of the United States and China today \n• Women aren't in leadership positions because they just don't want the jobs as much as men do , says research from Harvard Business School. Women had no doubt they could \"realistically attain\" the same level of success as men, but they listed lower ideal positions indicating that they value power less than men \n• A sexual conduct survey taken at Harvard University has shown the widespread sexual contact that exists within the college . About one sixth percent of female seniors reported completed or attempted penetration that was nonconsensual during their time at Harvard, when figures for nonconsensual touching were included, the above number almost doubled to 31.2 per cent \n• Companies with diverse executive boards outperform peers run by all-male boards, according to research from Grant Thornton.
