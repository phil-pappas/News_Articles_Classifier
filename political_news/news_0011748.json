The band has eyes on playing armed forces' galas and the like next summer, and are up for entering the Eurovision Song Contest as Britain's representatives next year. \n\"We have booked a rehearsal room in the Commons later this month for our first try-out together: at the moment, we can't even be sure that we will gel together musically,\" said Ms Jenkins. \"If we do, who knows. There is an armed forces gala next June which would be a good moment to perform. \n\"We agreed it would be hilarious to enter a sceptical song into the Eurovision Song Contest, such as Queen's 'I Want To Break Free',\" she added, appearing to momentarily forget that pretty much the only rule about the Eurovision Song Contest is that the song has to be an original. \nShe stressed that it was still early days for the band and no final decision had been made on the name or set-list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:33:36.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
