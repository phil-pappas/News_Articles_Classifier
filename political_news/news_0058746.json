These practices violate accepted medical standards, as reflected in federal law, and are Medicaid program violations that justify termination.” \nThe state also wrote in the letter that Planned Parenthood “failed to prevent conditions that would allow the spread of infectious disease among employees, as well as patients, and the general public.” It also said, “your staff were not trained in infection control and barrier precautions with regard to the handling of fetal blood and tissue or they failed to comply with the minimum standards that mandatory training requires…” \nThe Health and Human Services Commission said it had a “prima facie case of fraud” against Planned Parenthood based on “whistleblower” cases with claims alleged in federal court, specifically Reynolds vs. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast; and Carroll vs. Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. \nIn the Reynolds case, Texas stated that the whistleblower “alleged sufficient evidence of fraud to assure the federal court handling the matter that the case was worth pursuing, after which Planned Parenthood promptly settled the lawsuit for $4.3 million.” \nIn the letter, the state told Planned Parenthood, “Your termination and that of all your affiliates will not affect access to care in this State because there are thousands of alternative providers in Texas, including federally qualified health centers, Medicaid-certified rural health clinics, and other health care providers across the State that participate in Texas Women’s Health Program and Medicaid.” \nTexas Governor Greg Abbott released a statement Monday about the move that read in part, ““The gruesome harvesting of baby body parts by Planned Parenthood will not be allowed in Texas and the barbaric practice must be brought to an end.” \nThe move by the state of Texas could trigger a legal battle similar to the one currently going on in Louisiana. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal ordered his state to block funding in the wake of the same videos. \nPlanned Parenthood in Louisiana has challenged the state’s right to end funding for cancer screenings, ob/gyn exams, and other health services. On Monday, a federal judge ordered Louisiana to continue providing Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood clinics for 14 more days.
