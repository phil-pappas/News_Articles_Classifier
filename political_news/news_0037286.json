Mere hours afterward, the University of Mississippi Staff Council passed its own resolution in support of the university removing the state flag. If the Faculty Senate acts similarly, hopefully the administration of the University of Mississippi—who has the final say—will concur, and the flag will come down.... ...At the first scent of racial dissent, roaches with white power tattooed on their forelegs scurried onto campus to feed and intimidate, waving their Confederate flags and yelling to the student body that black lives don’t matter. Others spoke out with similar intensity on Facebook. Ole Miss is betraying the state of Mississippi, they said. The flagship university should not undermine the state, or challenge its authority on the issue of the flying of the state flag. In a Facebook post, Mississippi Republican Senator Chris McDaniel blamed the passing of the resolution on the “passion and poison of a liberal administration.” I imagine that it’s easy for those who confuse political correctness with being a decent person to treat progress as an impediment. Luckily, the Associated Student Body Senate of the University of Mississippi doesn’t think so. The student senators have acted in such a way that not only acknowledges that black students have voices, at a volume that calls out oppression on an institutional level.
