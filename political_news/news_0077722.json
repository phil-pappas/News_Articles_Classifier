Posted on 0 \nThe media assumes it is comical and ridiculous that Rush Limbaugh doubts NASA on the presence of water on Mars. \nThe people at Politico unquestionably enjoyed this brief jab at Rush Limbaugh: “ Rush Limbaugh pans evidence of water on Mars as part of 'leftist agenda' .” Flowing water on Mars? That’s just part of the liberal agenda, Rush Limbaugh says. The conservative radio talk show host addressed NASA’s announcement on Monday that it had found evidence of flowing water on present-day Mars, and — spoiler alert — he doesn’t believe it. “OK so there's flowing water on Mars. Yip yip yip yahoo. Hey, you know me, I'm science 101, big time guy, tech advance it, you know it, I'm all in. But, NASA has been corrupted by the current regime,” Limbaugh said on his show, according to Media Matters. “Don't know how long it's going to take, but this news that there is flowing water on Mars is somehow going to find its way into a technique to advance the leftist agenda.” Limbaugh said that although he wasn’t entirely sure what the agenda was, he was going to “assume it would be something to do with global warming.” \nI didn’t hear the radio program, but Rush was delivering on the spot radio commentary and probably free-associated from one topic to another. NASA has certainly been willing to spread lies for the sake of climate change superstition . \nBut Limbaugh is absolutely right to ask if NASA can be trusted to restrict their high-profile announcements to pure science and wonder if there is an agenda that involves other considerations. \nThe Washington Post’s story on NASA’s loud announcement included plenty of hints that skepticism would be warranted. You may feel like you've heard about the hunt for liquid water on Mars before -- and the researchers involved know it may seem played out. But science has yet to truly prove that water flows on Mars once and for all, and doing so could completely change the way we view the planet. This new data is a big step in the right direction. \"Liquid water is a sexy topic, and we’re like the thousandth time someone has discovered water on Mars,\" Lujendra Ojha, the Georgia Tech PhD candidate who led the research announced Monday, told The Post. \nA step “in the right direction”? Is that neutral observation? Or a quest for wish fulfillment? \nBut the real reason to question NASA’s objectivity is to realize that they are constantly searching for increased funding from Congress. To do this, they need to propose “important” research projects. So, if NASA can develop a “sexy topic” that captures the public’s imagination, then they get more money. \nIt makes a lot of sense to keep this in mind. The really ridiculous attitude is to pretend that NASA is completely objective and neutral when the “do science.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:20:07.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
