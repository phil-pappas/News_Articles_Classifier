There is an absolute requirement in the Health and Safety Act Work Act for this. As there is also in the Construction Design & Management Regs (and many more too)With the transient and multicultural workforce the building industry employs, there is really no other way than having a centrally administered system to carry out training and prove a minimum level of competence.There is also the issue of English as a second language and low (often non-existent) levels of literacy.As with any system (run on a shoestring) it is open to abuse. There are not enough folk employed by the principal contractors to do a proper job of checking up on the cards, so workers know they can get away with it.Similarly, dodgy providers will exploit any opportunity to make a quick buck.If the HSE were properly funded and had more experienced inspectors out on site, this would be cured quite quickly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:37:56.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
