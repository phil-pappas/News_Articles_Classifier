Prompted by undercover videos shedding light on the practice, Republicans quickly started a major campaign against Planned Parenthood, including trying to block its federal funds and probing the group through three congressional investigations.\nCommentators across the political spectrum agreed Richards emerged relatively unscathed from a House Oversight hearing last week, in which Republicans spent nearly five hours questioning her and trying to portray the group as a wasteful, extravagant organization that doesn't need taxpayer dollars.\n\"The only thing more painful than watching Republicans not do anything about Planned Parenthood is watching them try to do something about Planned Parenthood,\" wrote National Review's Rich Lowry.\n\"Certainly there were some missed opportunities,\" said Casey Mattox, an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom. \"There were questions that went unanswered that should have been answered.\"\nAn initial hearing at the House Judiciary Committee last month fell somewhat flat, too. Republicans there focused on the procedure of abortion but didn't produce any specific evidence that Planned Parenthood illegally profited from the fetal tissue or performed partial-birth abortions.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Press sees Clinton's trade flip-flop as pure politics Clinton's about-face on the trade deal came Wednesday during an interview in Iowa with PBS's Judy Woodruff.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/08/15 12:01 AM The controversial videos got more attention at a subsequent Energy and Commerce hearing, where Rep. Joe Pitts aired some of the footage showing a top Planned Parenthood official talking about \"crushing\" certain parts of a fetus to keep desirable organs intact.\nBut recent polls have shown that despite the Republican efforts, Planned Parenthood's favorable rating is largely unchanged since the videos were released. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last week found 45 percent of Americans view the group favorably, compared with 30 percent unfavorably, a shift from a 47-31 percent favorable/unfavorable rating when the videos were first released in July.\n\"The Planned Parenthood hearings left Planned Parenthood as strong as ever,\" said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C.\nThat's disconcerting to abortion foes, who had hoped the anti-Planned Parenthood campaign would turn more people against the group, which provides more abortions than any other organization. They acknowledge that Republicans, to a large degree, haven't used the congressional hearings to their advantage.\nMattox said that if he were in the place of House Republicans, he would have drilled Richards on why Planned Parenthood clinics provided tissue to a company called StemExpress, which promised \"financial profits\" to its suppliers.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Conservative groups split on oil export bill A measure added to a bill lifting the ban on oil exports is prompting some supporters to withdraw support.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/08/15 12:01 AM In some of its marketing materials, the company California StemExpress said clinics can benefit financially from providing fetal tissue. \"By partnering with StemExpress … you will also be contributing to the fiscal growth of your own clinic,\" the materials say. Federal law allows clinics to be reimbursed for overhead expenses of obtaining the tissue, but they can't profit from it.\nMattox said Republicans also should have focused on the fee per fetus Planned Parenthood has admitted receiving from tissue companies, which ranges from about $40 to $60. Lawmakers brought up that topic briefly during the hearings, but it wasn't one of Republicans' biggest talking points.\nThe Judiciary hearing is again supposed to focus on abortion and how Planned Parenthood doctors carry out the procedure. Besides Thayer, it also will feature an obstetrician-gynecologist.\nDavid Christensen, a lobbyist for the Family Research Council, said he wants Republicans to drill down more into how abortions are performed, their effect on fetuses and women and whether Planned Parenthood has unethically altered methods.\nIn some of the videos, top Planned Parenthood officials referred to changing the way an abortion is performed to keep desirable organs intact. The group has said it hasn't altered abortions in ways that would make them unsafe for women, but Republicans are skeptical.\n\"I don't think that's been focused on enough,\" Christensen said. \"I think the hearing tomorrow with a number of doctors can look at the science and the medical process of the abortion methods.\"\nHouse Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, was widely ridiculed after presenting Richards with a chart showing that the number of Planned Parenthood's abortions is skyrocketing while its breast exams are plummeting — but grossly distorted the trends, making them appear much more dramatic than they actually are.\n\"After watching Cecile Richards masterfully dodge critical questions and avoid messaging revealing that Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider, I am hopeful that tomorrow's hearing and witnesses will lead with science and facts,\" said March for Life President Jeanne Mancini.\nTop Story Conservatives reject McCarthy, endorse Webster for Speaker About 80 percent of the caucus backed the decision in a meeting.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/07/15 5:16 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:33:00.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
