That is the theme for Tokelau Language Week which begins today. \nPacific Peoples Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says the theme, which translated in Tokelauan is Totō hau tōkiga nei, aua na tupulaga e fāi mai, encourages Pacific communities in New Zealand to lay a strong cultural path for their children to follow. \nTokelau Language Week is the last of seven Pacific language weeks being celebrated this year. \n\"The themes of our Pacific language weeks have focused on enriching New Zealand with Pacific cultures, and treasuring and using our languages at home and in the community,\" Mr Lotu-Iiga says. \n\"The future of Pacific languages and cultures lies with our younger generations. It is important they keep their ties to their heritage.\" \nAt the last Census, 7176 people in New Zealand identified as Tokelauan. Only 32 per cent of them can speak the language and that number is declining. \nCelebrating Pacific languages opens the door for people to help preserve those languages. Taking part helps educate our nation and advocate for Pacific languages. \nThe 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May. \nA list of events marking Tokelau Language Week can be found at www.mpia.govt.nz \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:58:34.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
