It is the most laughable excuse for a hacked together piece of social programming I’ve seen in a very long time. Check out this still I took from TNN’s video for example:\nThis scene was supposedly in a mansion somewhere in Augusta, Georgia.\nNot only was I a builder and designer of very high-end cabinetry before I got sick (and I still have the cad-files to prove it) I was also for a while, a builder of TV, stage and film sets (and I have the IMDB page to prove that).\nThis piece of crap cabinet is beyond laughable. If some millionaire (and I have worked for many) paid you to build something for them and you installed this, they would have you shot and drag this piece of shit from their home.\nLook how it sticks out into the doorway. They didn’t even bother making it fit the flat (fake wall) behind it.\nIt’s made of crappy #2 pine and luan (cheap Malaysian 1.4″ plywood) with the cheapest pulls on the planet.\nThe guns are supper cheap and notice the circa Apocalypse Now M-16 cheapo assault rifle prop right dead center in the middle.\nWhen I saw this, I just laughed out loud.\nThe rest of the show is apparently just as bad. I feel sorry for the actors in this piece of shit. But that’s what they get.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ry3KKen35s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "http://willyloman.wordpress.com//feed/https://willyloman.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/laugh.jpg", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/willyloman.wordpress.com/35661/", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=willyloman.wordpress.com&#038;blog=1287042&#038;post=35661&#038;subd=willyloman&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/willyloman.wordpress.com/35661/", "https://willyloman.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/laugh.jpg?w=468&#038;h=262"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:43:50.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
