The technology is an integrated system for controlling train movements, such as emergency breaking, and it has become a priority after an Amtrak derailment in May killed eight people .\nThe current deadline to install the technology is Dec. 31, and some members of Congress have proposed an extension until 2018. Boardman said without the extension, Amtrak service would be hit hard.\n\"There will be significant impacts to our service\" if Congress doesn't give railways additional time to install PTC, Boardman wrote in the letter obtained by the Washington Examiner. \"The potential impacts would also be substantial since a vast majority of our network would be inoperable without an extension of the deadline.\"\n  Trump on eminent domain: 'It's wonderful' 'It's called economic development,' Trump says of eminent domain.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/06/15 7:08 PM The Government Accountability Office told Congress in a September report that it should grant the Federal Railroad Administration the authority to extend past the Dec. 31 deadline, which it said would be unattainable due to high costs and technological glitches, among other factors.\nRep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said extending past the deadline is important.\n\"Completion of the Positive Train Control mandate by the end of the year is not achievable, and extending the deadline is essential to preventing significant disruptions of both passenger and freight rail service across the country,\" Shuster said in a press release . \"Railroads must implement this important but complicated safety technology in a responsible manner, and we need to give them the necessary time to do so.\"\nMembers of the House Transportation Infrastructure Committee introduced the Positive Train Control Enforcement and Implementation Act on Sept. 30, which would extend the deadline for full Implementation of PTC to the end of 2018.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump warns of bigger threat to U.S. than immigration The billionaire candidate decries currency manipulation and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/06/15 6:46 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:17:02.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
