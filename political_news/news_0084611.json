Mohan Reddy, referring the industry body’s interaction with starups in the Silicon Valley during the Prime Minister’s recent visit to the United States. Mr Reddy said that Nasscom’s interactions at the Silicon Valley has “encouraged US venture capital companies and mentors to look more closely into India startup community and also for Silicon Valley companies to look for talent in India. Indian start-ups got an opportunity to look for funding and also partnering with valley professionals.” Mr Reddy has chaired Nasscom sessions on startups during the PM’s visit to the US. “Nasscom’s message at the event was that India is open and connected... The key drivers are large English speaking population and open policies of the government for international business... We are seeing Silicon Valley startups launch in the US first and then launch in India as a second market,” he explained. business latest Nasscom Tax relief Also Read Gas prices hiked by Rupees 16.50 per cylinder DoT rejects Vodafone request to extend licences in 7 circles Arun Jaitley promises rational tax regime and easier business environment Senior BMW Executive arrested in Hyderabad on charges of cheating", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151002/business-latest/article/nasscom-tax-relief-startups-bvr", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/tax-2_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/tax-2_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:40:30.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
