She was starting to move goods back in when her home was flooded again this month. Brad Nettles/Staff × Angela Dinenna knew when the flooding at her home in the Shadowmoss subdivision reached her porch it was time to get out. \nInsurance resources \nThe S.C. Department of Insurance — www.doi.sc.gov — has a consumer services office. It can be reached toll-free at 800-768-3467. \nFor information about the National Flood Insurance Program, go to www.floodsmart.gov. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is asking property owners with damage to register online at DisasterAssistance.gov or call 800-621-3362. The water kept rising. The retired 73-year-old said she eventually had 4 feet of rain in her West Ashley house. She wouldn’t return for a couple of days, and she can’t live there in its current state. Making matters worse, Dinenna was still recovering from a previous flood that required her to make repairs and put belongings in a portable storage unit. Then, the rain returned. “This one was really, really bad,” she said. Dinenna was among the local residents with flood damage who turned up Wednesday at a one-stop event organized by the state Department of Insurance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and some insurance carriers. It was held outside the North Charleston Coliseum, where people could get help filling out claim forms and get answers to their questions. “I think this is great, ... as many folks as possible should get out and do this,” Dinenna said. Ray Farmer, director of the S.C. Department of Insurance, was on hand. “Our job in a catastrophe like this is to be available to help our citizens understand what’s in their policy, what’s covered and what’s not covered, and then, if they need assistance getting to their insurance company, we can certainly help them,” he said. He urged property owners with flood damage to register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “I would encourage anyone to go online with FEMA and at their website and follow their procedures and fill out the form,” he said. Also, he recommended that people stick with the process, because sometimes claims can be denied for minor issues that can be easily corrected, such as a missing signature. “So don’t give up right away,” Farmer said. “Take a look at ... what the letter is requesting you to do.” The statewide damage total to homes and businesses is still being tallied, but it’s expected to exceed $1 billion. Farmer has said his agency will have a more accurate estimate in a few weeks, after insurers start reporting their claims data. He also reminded property owners that flood damage caused by rising water isn’t covered unless they have a special policy from the National Flood Insurance Program. “A lot of the damage that we’ve seen is damage to homes, and if you’re not in a low-lying area, chances are you may not have flood insurance,” he said. In Dinenna’s case, her Shadowmoss home is covered, though she said money can’t replace some of the losses. And she knows floods. She experienced one in 2007 and then another in August. “This is the worst one,” she said of the historic rain that swamped South Carolina this month. “I’ve never had all the damage that I have had right now.” For now, she’s staying with a friend in Charleston, and she hopes to be back in her house by Christmas. “There’s not much I can do except try to do the best I can,” she said. “See if I can get some help, and if I can, I will.” Reach Allison Prang at 937-5705 or follow her on Twitter @AllisonPrang.
