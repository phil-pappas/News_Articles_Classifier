This is one more step along the way to running a more efficient council so we can deal with the challenges of reduced government funding.\" \nThe proposals on \"organisational development\" were discussed in private last month by the personnel committee, which deals with human resources at the Guildhall. \nPlans to hire staff are typically discussed in public. \nConservative councillor Rose Burns was last night expected to urge the council to wait until the results of an independent review of Silver Hill and boundary changes at next year's election before staffing moves were agreed. Share article \nShe was also expected to call for a public council debate, adding in her question to last night's full council that the Guildhall is dealing with an \"unprecedented\" number of complex projects. \nThe proposals were discussed by cabinet as the Chronicle went to press yesterday, in a session which excluded the public and media.
