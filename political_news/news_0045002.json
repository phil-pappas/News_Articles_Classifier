Promoted stories \nMr Mundell said the Conservative Government was now keen to transfer the powers in 2017, which was “significantly earlier than anticipated” and that it would “not stand in the way of that happening”. \nHe explained: “Because we know that the new tax powers are at the heart of the devolution package in the Scotland Bill, we want them to come on stream as quickly as possible. I would like that to be in 2017.” \nHe explained that the final date for the transfer would be agreed by both London and Edinburgh as part of the so-called “fiscal framework” talks, which are on-going. These cover how the £30 billion annual block grant will be adjusted to take into account Holyrood’s new tax-raising powers. \nBut the Secretary of State stressed: “2017 is an achievable and desirable time for these new powers to take effect.” \nHe added: “It would mean that the Scottish Government elected next year would have to include plans for these new powers in its first Budget. So when people go to the polls next year, the parties will need to present their plans for income tax and they’ll need to be honest about what they will mean for Scottish taxpayers.” \nIn response, a spokesman for the Scottish Finance Secretary said: “The Tories just need to get on with the job of delivering more powers for Scotland and a deal which meets the spirit and letter of the Smith Commission recommendations. \n“What is currently proposed fails that test as it limits Scottish Ministers’ ability to use the new powers and retains vetoes for UK Ministers.” \nHe added: “We still need to reach agreement on a fiscal framework that gives the Scottish Government flexibility to use the new powers effectively, to boost the economy and create jobs and we have made it crystal clear that we will not support any proposed deal which risks leaving Scotland worse off.” \nThe enhanced-revenue powers are set to reduce the £30bn annual block grant by £11bn while the assignment of VAT will reduce it by a further £4bn but there will be a £2.5bn addition because of the Scottish Government taking on extra spending responsibilities, particularly around welfare. So the block grant will be reduced to around £18bn once the new powers kick in.

If you compare it to the SNP’s proposal for full fiscal autonomy, that has a £10bn black hole in it,” he added.
