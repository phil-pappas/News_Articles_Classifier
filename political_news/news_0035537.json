Malick Sidibé had set up shop as a portrait photographer 10 years before, and his pictures capture the tensions and exuberance of people new to independence and modernity.\n“Karim Keïta” (1967) is a young man in a smart suit, white shirt, striped tie, and porkpie hat who could easily be a contemporaneous New York hipster. The five women in “Mariage (Wedding)” (1967) wear gowns that show the influence of European and African couture. They are already in a different social realm than Seydou Keïta’s “Reclining Woman” (1950s-1960s), with her indigenous hair ornaments and traditional pose, or that photographer’s “Man Leaning on Radio” (1955), memorialized with his prized possession.\nSidibé and Keïta are two of the best-known African portraitists, but the Met has on display more than 80 works by indigenous photographers from as early as 1880-85. Several are by unidentified photographers, such as the “Portrait of a Woman” (c. 1910), a picture of a Senegalese who displays her elaborate native gown, jewelry and coiffeur but seems timorous before the camera. All the pictures represent collaborations between the photographers and their subjects, self-presentations rich in ethnographic, psychological and historical details: Africans the way they saw themselves and wanted to be seen.\nENLARGE ‘Ramona Rebekah Lodge, No. 83, I.O.O.F.,’ (late 19th century).

Hunt/Collection Blind Pirate, New York/International Center of Photography Hunt’s Three Ring Circus: American Groups Before 1950 1285 Avenue of the Americas Art Gallery\n1285 Avenue of the Americas\n212-857-0000\nThrough Jan. 8, 2016\nW.M. “Bill” Hunt is a teacher, writer, curator and collector of photography. This show, curated in collaboration with the International Center of Photography, showcases his extensive collection of pictures of groups, all sorts of groups: swim teams, graduating classes, beauty pageant contestants, company employees, social clubs and military, political and religious aggregations.\nIn a hand-tinted picture from 1886, ranks of “Veteran Firemen” stand in their uniforms and helmets alongside a pumper. Fraternal organizations like the Independent Order of Odd Fellows allowed a mobile population to make friends and business contacts: Benjamin Freeman’s “Lodge No. 197, I.O.O.F.” (May 22, 1901) shows the brothers assembled wearing vaguely medieval costumes with swords and spears and shields, and one man holding a zither. Many of the works are in period frames, some quite beautiful and several eccentric.\nTo take these pictures, a photographer needed the talents of a movie director and frequently specialized panoramic cameras. Imagine the effort that went into “The Human Liberty Bell, 25,000 Officers & Men, at Camp Dix, New Jersey, General Hugh L. Scott, CMDR” (1918), shot from above by Mole & Thomas. And Bill Hunt would be expected to have a special affection for the picture by E.J. Kelty, Century Photographers, of the band, acrobats, clowns, barkers and ringmaster of “Hunt’s Three Ring Circus, Northport, Long Island, New York” (June 26, 1931).\nMax de Esteban: Heads Will Roll Klompching Gallery\n89 Water St., Brooklyn\n212-796-2070\nThrough Oct. 30\nENLARGE Max de Esteban’s ‘The Inadequacy of Any Sensible Standard’ (2013). Photo: Max de Esteban/Klompching Gallery Max de Esteban, born in Barcelona in 1959 and educated at Stanford University, is a peculiarly protean artist: His first major body of work consisted of highly stylized portraits of disaffected European youths, his second of cyanotype-like X-rays of midcentury electronic appliances. And now we have “Heads Will Roll,” his Photoshopped collages of apocalypse. Photoshop can be used to alter the digital files of individual images and to merge images in fanciful combinations. It is easy to do, but hard to do well; the trick is to create a collage with portents of meaning—and yet do it without being too literal, like a rebus. Using bits and pieces drawn mostly from pop culture—movies, the Internet, magazines and newspapers—Mr. de Esteban does this. The nine works at Klompching are dreamlike intimations of catastrophe.\nThe largest element of “A Technological Construct of Totality” (2013) is a human body bound with heavy ropes and seemingly suspended. It is not clear if the body is that of a man or a woman, and it is rendered in a pale green. The background color is a brownish red; a woman’s head stares out at us from the bottom of the image without apparently noticing the green figure, and other body parts in varying scales are also incorporated.\nThe main element of “Defined by Catastrophe” (2013) is the silhouette of a car set at an impossible incline against a burst of yellow; the background is a pale blue figured with negative and positive portraits of someone in a Chairman Mao uniform.\nMr. Meyers writes on photography for the Journal. His photo book “Outer Boroughs: New York Beyond Manhattan” was published earlier this year by Damiani.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU410_NYPHOT_P_20151016150613.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU410_NYPHOT_M_20151016150613.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KU284_NYPHOT_JV_20151016114255.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:29:09.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
