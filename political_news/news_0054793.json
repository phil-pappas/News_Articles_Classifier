Sadly this is symbolic of the dysfunction and mistrust that has characterised this Council's performance on Syria and too many of the conflicts that rage in the region. And it must stop.'' \nSpeaking to media afterward, he said it was astonishing that in a week in which many countries' leaders and foreign ministers were in New York for the General Assembly the best the Security Council could do was have a discussion. \n\"I just wanted to call it as it is. The Security Council is failing in its obligations and talking about the issue of terrorism, as important as it is, actually we've got a first obligation to stop people being killed. It's a pretty serious indictment on the Security Council and I thought we should say so.'' \nRussia is chairing the Security Council for September and called the debate on co-operation in fighting terrorism in the Middle East and Africa. However, the meeting coincided with Russia confirming it had begun air strikes in Syria at the request of the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. \nMr McCully said that undermined Russia's role as chair of the Council, in which it had called the debate on co-operation against terrorism in Syria. He said Russia's role as chair gave them a special responsibility to find a way to address the issues. \n\"To be frank on a day when the Russians themselves were calling for this Security Council debate, to have airstrikes start with no warning and no clarity about what was actually being hit wasn't the most helpful sequence of events.'' He would not speculate on whether it was deliberate timing. \nMr McCully said there were competing narratives between the US and Russia and New Zealand had tried to steer a middle path to ensure a transition in Syria which did not not result in the collapse of its institutions. That would involve the players already in the region - including Syria's leader Bashar al-Assad. \nHowever he did not believe there should be impunity for the Assad regime from any responsibility for mass atrocities. \nNew Zealand campaigned on the need for reform of the Security Council during its bid to get a seat on it. Prime Minister John Key is expected to make the same call in his address to the General Assembly tomorrow. \n- By Claire Trevett of the New Zealand Herald in New York Â»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:31:27.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
