He is an active member of the Pakistan -based Foundation, helping them raise funds and promote awareness.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279355\nHealth officials estimate that Pakistan requires more than eight thousand units of blood each and every day. Its transfusion needs outstrip the supply, making the work of the Fatimid Foundation and the country's blood banks more urgent than ever. A fairly high prevalence of Hepatitis B & C viruses found in potential blood donors has had a serious impact on the collection and supply of safe blood. This already-dire situation is further complicated by the danger of spreading HIV infections, even though the incidence of HIV in Pakistan is low.\nThalassemia is passed on from one generation to the next. They affect the body's ability to make hemoglobin and red blood cells. The bone marrow of people who suffer from thalassemia doesn't produce enough hemoglobin or red blood cells and leads to oxygen shortages in the body. This in turn causes anemia and fatigue.\nIn extreme cases of thalassemia, patients may require regular blood transfusions. One of the principle goals of the Fatimid Foundation is to help such patients by providing reliable, quality blood banking. The foundation also strives to make sure that only FDA/CE approved materials and equipment are used in the treatment of thalassemia, haemaphilia and other genetic blood disorders, and to engage only the best and more professional staffing and care in blood banking and haematological services.\nThe Fatimid Foundation serves thousands of patients throughout Pakistan , providing thousands of bags of healthy and fully screened blood products each month. The blood is destined for people suffering from thalassemia, haemaphilia, and other blood disorders. Most of the recipients of these life-saving blood products are children. There are Fatimid centers in Karachi , Lahore , Peshawar , Multan, Quetta, and Hyderabad , with new centers in other Pakistani cities in the planning stages.\nDr. Syed Azhar Rizvi is proud to be associated with the important work of the Fatimid Foundation. He volunteers for Fatimid foundation and is currently practicing in New York . He is a Board-certified psychiatrist and addiction specialist, and a specialist in chronic pain. He received his medical education at the University of Texas at Austin and at Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago .\nAbout: Dr. Syed Azhar Rizvi raises funds and awareness on behalf of the Fatimid Foundation.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-syed-azhar-rizvi-helps-fatimid-foundation-achieve-objectives-300164337.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-syed-azhar-rizvi-helps-fatimid-foundation-achieve-objectives-300164337.html", "http://www.slideshare.net/syedrizvi01", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279355", "https://vimeo.com/drsyedazharrizvi", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY35123&Transmission_Id=201510212004PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY35123&DateId=20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:24:29.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
