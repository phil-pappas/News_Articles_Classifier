Kelly, a former federal prosecutor, was hired by Mayor Martin J. Walsh to investigate City Hall in the wake of the federal Teamsters probe in which five Local 25 union members are accused of threatening a film crew over jobs. comments 164 shares Tweet The private legal team hired by Mayor Martin J. Walsh to investigate City Hall in the wake of the federal Teamsters extortion probe will be paid $910 an hour, according to the contract.\nAttorney Brian T. Kelly, a former federal prosecutor who helped convict mobster James “Whitey” Bulger, will be paid $625 an hour while his associate will earn $285 an hour, a copy of the contract obtained by the Herald states.\n“I’m going to cut to the chase and find out what happened,” Kelly said last night. “We are conducting the investigation already. We will try to be as efficient as possible.”\nKelly, now in private practice at the powerhouse law firm Nixon Peabody, will lead the probe after an unnamed City Hall official was cited in a federal indictment of five members of Teamsters Local 25 accused of threatening a film crew over jobs for union workers in June 2014.\nThe indictment stated a City Hall “representative” called the Omni Parker House and the swanky French restaurant Menton to tell them the Teamsters planned to picket upcoming events they had featuring the “Top Chef” cooking reality show. Both establishments then canceled their “Top Chef” deals.\nThe union workers are accused of threatening violence and hurling racial and homophobic slurs at members of the cable show’s production crew in a scheme to force them to hire Teamsters last summer.\nThe Herald has learned the City Hall caller was Kenneth Brissette, the mayor’s director of tourism, sports and entertainment. Brissette has not been charged. He has been unavailable for comment.\nKelly told the Herald he has already started his “internal investigation” of City Hall to “determine the proper procedures” were followed.\nHe will submit his final report, he said, to the mayor’s legal department. “Whatever we find we will report it,” he said.\nA “summary” of his report will be made public, said Laura Oggeri, spokeswoman for Walsh, “pending any legal or other issues.”\nKelly’s pay is “a reduced rate,” Oggeri added.\n“The city expects Attorney Kelly’s work to be swift but comprehensive,” she said in a statement. “Attorney Kelly is reviewing an isolated incident. Mayor Walsh believes that Attorney Kelly will be able to provide an objective review as to what happened and facilitate any necessary cooperation between the city and the U.S. Attorney’s office.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Lawyers+in+Teamster+probe+to+get+%24910+an+hour"], "published": "2015-10-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:30:21.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
