Biden said from the White House Rose Garden that he had run out of time to raise enough money and set up a campaign. He did not endorse Clinton or anyone else in the unsettled battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. \nHere's a look at some reactions to the decision. \n___ \n\" Joe Biden is a good man and a great vice president. Serving alongside him in the Senate and then the administration, I saw first-hand his passion for our country and our people... I am confident that history isn't finished with Joe Biden . As he said today, there is more work to do. And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton . \n___ \n\"The guy has a storied career. I disagree with him on philosophy, on policy, but he's clearly a great guy and served with distinction. ... I thought he would have been a pretty competitive candidate for the Democratic nomination.\" \n—Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush . \n___ \n\"By the time Joe, I mean the vice president, was getting comfortable with running, there just wasn't enough time. I could just cry, seriously, because I also know how qualified and capable he is to serve.\" \n—Terri Goodman of Dubuque, Iowa, who kept in touch with Biden for decades. \n___ \n\"I thank (Biden) for his continued service to the nation and his support of the middle class ... I also commend @VP's outlining of an agenda to make college free, fight economic inequality, close tax loopholes & protect dignity for all.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, via Twitter. \n___ \n\"I think he did the smart thing because, frankly, I don't know that he would have won. He wouldn't have gotten the nomination. I don't think he probably would have. And frankly, I really want to run against Hillary, I really do.\" — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump . \n___ \n\"@JoeBiden is one of the most decent, compassionate public servants our nation has produced — I respect his decision & wish him the best.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley, via Twitter. \n___ \n\"Democrats are now left with a socialist or a candidate under FBI investigation. Let's embrace our conservative principles, and we will win.\" \n—Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal , via Twitter. \n___ \n\"@HillaryClinton will likely be the D nominee. I'm the only GOP candidate who defeated the Clinton machine.\" \n—Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, via Twitter. \n___ \n\"With @JoeBiden out of the race, democrats are left with a choice between socialism and corruption. Cc: @HillaryClinton @SenSanders.\" \n—Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul , via Twitter. \nRead more: http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/joe-biden-not-running-2016-candidates-react-215016#ixzz3pErK839o", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:32:45.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
