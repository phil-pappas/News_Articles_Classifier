These included the environmental impacts of aviation; alternative fuels research; developing a global approach to air traffic management research; supersonic aircraft; and wind tunnel testing. The IFAR Steering Committee also proposed a strategy to ensure the group's long-term sustainability.\n\"IFAR membership is growing and the group is maturing with every passing year,\" said Jaiwon Shin , associate administrator of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate in Washington and current IFAR chair. \"More and more countries understand that forming a cohesive group to leverage our respective resources can make real progress on solving many of the global aviation issues we all face.\"\nIFAR participants commended NASA for its leadership in alternative fuels and air traffic management research and development, and its supersonics working groups. They agreed these working groups should continue their important work for the foreseeable future. Research into aircraft efficiency, noise and weather, which is led by the German Aerospace Center, French aerospace lab ONERA, and Netherlands Aerospace Centre also were highlighted as focus areas warranting innovative collaborations.\nIn addition to its scientific and technical expertise, IFAR promotes exchanges among young aviation scientists and engineers. During a Young Researchers Conference held at this year's summit, 18 participants from a number of countries, including the United States , Germany , Japan , and South Africa exchanged views on the future of aviation as contributions to IFAR's own vision.\nThe next IFAR summit will be hosted in the fall of 2016 by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute in Daejeon, Republic of South Korea .\nFor more information about IFAR, go to:\nhttp://www.ifar.aero\nFor more information about how NASA is with you when you fly, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\n releases/nasa-global-aviation-leaders-talk-green-aviation-and-more-at-annual-summit-300156907.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-global-aviation-leaders-talk-green-aviation-and-more-at-annual-summit-300156907.html", "http://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24076&Transmission_Id=201510081517PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24076&DateId=20151008", "http://www.ifar.aero/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:01:54.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
