Sens. J.P. Morrell, Karen Carter Peterson, Danny Martiny and Jack Donahue have been automatically elected because no one else is running their races.\nReps. Scott Simon, Kevin Pearson, John Schroeder, Julie Stokes, Cameron Henry, Bryan Adams, Greg Cromer, Walt Leger, Tom Willmott, Helena Moreno, Sherman Mack, Neil Abramson and Paul Hollis also get to keep their seats because no one is challenging them.\nConrad Appel, R-Metairie, is the only local senator to face opposition in the primary, though there is also one open senate seat in the New Orleans area. Sen. David Heitmeier is stepping down. His open Senate district includes portions of Algiers, Gretna, Terrytown, Harvey and Belle Chasse.\n. . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
