Supreme Court to waive interim deadlines imposed on the General Assembly. Carl Epps, attorney for the plaintiffs in the 22-year-old case of Abbeville County School District vs. South Carolina, said the filing made Wednesday aims to do “our best to eliminate any dispute that we have with the state.” Epps offered to amend the order to eliminate the expert panel and allow the court to appoint a court expert. The response also requests the Supreme Court eliminate several interim target dates, as long as the Legislature produces a plan to improve education in rural and poor districts by the end of the 2016 legislative session. Plaintiffs sided with the court, however, against the state’s leaders’ argument that the court is violating the separation of powers doctrine. On Monday, Gov. Nikki Haley and other Republican leaders asked the state Supreme Court to throw out the Sept. 24 order that requires the Legislature produce that plan by Feb. 1. The order came with several target dates, including an Oct. 15 deadline calling for the creation of a panel of experts that would review the plan to improve the schools and prepare a written report for the court. In a statement Wednesday, House Speaker Jay Lucas said the plaintiffs’ petition validated the state’s leadership’s argument and confirms that the plaintiffs believe the House’s panel that’s been working since earlier this year to find a solution is making progress. “The court’s arbitrary deadlines and improper super-panel will not help the House and the plaintiffs reach our common objective of reforming South Carolina’s education system,” Lucas said.
