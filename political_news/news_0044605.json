First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race , the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday. Republican critics of Mrs. Clinton have for years tried to tie what they say was her mismanagement at the State Department to the attack, but that argument has largely been relegated to conservative news media, not a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. In the new film, Mr. Krasinski, best known for his role in “The Office” television series, plays contractor Jack Silva, who survived the attack. James Badge Dale, from “World War Z,” plays Tyrone S. Woods, another contractor, who did not. Scenes in the film’s trailer align with a draft, from late last year, of a script by Chuck Hogan, based on a book by Mitchell Zuckoff. In it, Mr. Hogan does not mention Mrs. Clinton, or, for that matter, President Obama, or almost any other identifiable Washington official. The film, which is still being edited, is faithful to Mr. Zuckoff’s account, and strains to avoid political tilt, according to people briefed on its progress who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “While the events have been the subject of continuous heated debate, few have heard or seen the story told from the perspective of these brave men because it has been largely lost amidst the political back and forth,” Erwin Stoff, a producer of the film, said in a statement. In any case, “13 Hours” promises to leave millions of viewers — with his “Tranformers” series, Mr. Bay has become one of the world’s most popular filmmakers — pondering uncomfortable questions about Benghazi precisely when the Clinton campaign will be working to put the issue away. “We’re reminders of the sacrifice they’re not prepared to make,” says Mr. Dale’s character, “Rone” Woods. It is one of several biting lines about the gap between officialdom and those mired in ground truth, this one delivered in a military bull session just before the attack. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Republican-led congressional investigation into the attack in Benghazi led to Mrs. Clinton’s current headaches about her use of a private email server at the State Department, after the committee discovered she had conducted official business exclusively with a private email account. During Tuesday’s Democratic debate in Las Vegas, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s closest competitor for the party’s nomination, stood up for her by saying, “The American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails.” Democrats are pushing to shut down the Select Committee on Benghazi, before which Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to testify on Oct. 22. Last week, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, implied that the purpose of diving into the 2012 attacks on the compound in Libya had been to damage Mrs. Clinton politically. “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?” Mr. McCarthy said in a striking moment of candor the Clinton campaign promptly seized on. “We put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?” But in the coming months, at least some issues that have figured in the congressional investigation — particularly, whether the State Department provided insufficient protection for Mr. Stevens during a visit to the Benghazi diplomatic compound on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks — will come alive on the silver screen. “Republicans have already made clear they will use this movie to revive theories discredited by their own party’s investigators to continue their admittedly partisan attacks against Hillary Clinton,” said David Brock, the author of “The Benghazi Hoax” and the founder of Correct the Record , an outside group that defends Mrs. Clinton. “Maybe Hollywood will have better luck creating a conservative fantasy” than congressional Republicans have, he added. A spokesman for the campaign did not respond to requests for comment. One stinging tag line at the end of the script points out that a C.I.A. base chief who tried to delay the security contractors from aiding Mr. Stevens was nonetheless awarded an agency medal. (American officials have said that the C.I.A. security team paused to try to get support from Libyan militia allies.) It fulfills a sarcastic soldierly prediction in the script, made at the height of the action, that the base chief would be rewarded for his poor decisions. Mr. Bay, whose films are known more for heat than enlightenment, has been publicly coy about his own political leanings. “I don’t feel the need to go out and tell people what to believe politically,” he once told an interviewer, who tried to build a case , in Mother Jones, that Bay films like “Armageddon” and “Bad Boys II” carried conservative messaging. Whether “13 Hours” makes an impression will depend partly on whether it can “jump the theaters,” said Christopher Lehane, a political consultant who has worked with the Clintons and helped promote Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11.” A political film with impact has to generate “questions from the press and public” and circulate information beyond theatrical viewers, Mr. Lehane said in an email last week. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:19.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
