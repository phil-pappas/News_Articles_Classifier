But is Justin Trudeau ready to lead? Canadian Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau waves on stage in Montreal on Tuesday after being elected prime minister.\nBy Paul D. Shinkman Oct. 20, 2015 | 3:21 p.m. EDT + More Canada's newly elected prime minister appears poised to re-examine the country's role in international affairs, ushering in a shift in policies that could conflict with what the U.S. has grown to expect from its partner in the war against Islamic extremism.\nThe young, idealistic and largely untested Justin Trudeau successfully rallied public support against Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper and his government, which over 10 years in power expanded its fight against extremism abroad and at home. Canadians had begun to question policies that were designed to give the government greater powers to root extremists out of its Muslim citizenry and which frequently over the last decade placed the country in lockstep with the war footing of its southern neighbor.\nRELATED\nJustin Trudeau, Son of Former PM, Elected Canada's New Leader \"It is a referendum on Canadian foreign policy,\" says North American policy expert Christopher Sands, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Stephen Harper was assertive in terms of the use of the military and engagement with allies. It's not just that he has CF-18 aircraft doing runs in Iraq … it's also that he has troops and trainers in Ukraine, he's got them on the Polish border reinforcing the NATO front.\"\nThe 43-year-old Trudeau, the son of Pierre Trudeau, one of the country's most dynamic leaders, will likely follow through on two key points of his national security portfolio early in his administration. The liberal leader is widely expected to pare back Canada's combat support for the anti-Islamic State coalition led by the United States, favoring a more humanitarian role. And Canada may also back away from direct support for the plan to train regional fighters in Iraq and Syria to combat the Islamic State group themselves – a strategy that has so far flummoxed the U.S.\nDomestically, he has already expressed support for part of the much discussed Bill C-51 the Conservatives introduced into Parliament, which in its current language grants the Canadian Security Intelligence Service authority to foray beyond its traditional role of strictly gathering and analyzing intelligence and be granted the ability to disrupt terrorist threats itself. Trudeau has criticized that element of the bill, but will likely support it by bestowing some element of the government with greater oversight of the country's national security apparatus.\n\"We know CSIS played key roles in disrupting plans to carry out violence against Canadians, including a plot to place bombs on VIA Rail passenger trains,\" Trudeau said in remarks in February . \"However, we would now ask CSIS to do something new, and this new direction must be monitored so that we can be sure we are getting it right.\"\nCanadians appeared to overwhelmingly support the sentiment, rejecting the underlying rhetoric that led to the change in policy and which some said bordered on Islamophobia. Harper during his campaign backed measures that would force women to remove their traditional niqab when taking the citizenship oath of allegiance and that would strip citizenship from Canadians convicted of terrorism.\nSupport for enhancing anti-terror provisions gained momentum a year ago in the wake of a suspected Islamic extremist's attack on the Canadian Parliament and after a separate incident in which a man who had recently converted to Islam struck two Canadian soldiers in his car in Quebec. The debate over the powers of intelligence and defense agencies closely mirrored America's own grappling with the need to provide security while protecting civil rights.\nGeneral anxiety throughout the country had allowed Harper to ramp up defense spending during his tenure as the country took a larger role in the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group.\nRELATED\nAfter Parliament Shooting, Canada Forced to Reconsider Anti-Terrorism Security Canada, with a tradition of maintaining a peacekeeping force, spent almost $20 billion on its military last year, compared to a U.S. defense budget 35 times that. It makes up for its smaller force by relying heavily on close partners, such as the U.S., to sell it weapons and develop new technologies (like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that Canada under Harper considered buying), and on allies like the British for bolstering its ability to gather intelligence overseas.\nStill, Canada has not always mirrored U.S. interests internationally and has found its own policies shifting depending on what party is in power. Trudeau's father, Pierre, re-engaged with China a year before President Richard Nixon's historic rapprochement. Under Harper, Ottawa adopted a stronger policy in support of Tel Aviv, breaking from Canada's traditional role as an equal broker between Israelis and Palestinians.\nBut Canadians, like their American neighbors after voting for change in 2008 might have to endure a short honeymoon period as Trudeau finds his footing on international affairs.\n\"It's Trudeau's turn to face the 'hopey-changey' challenge,\" says Jeremy Littlewood, professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa and a security policy expert. \"But reality will impinge on the desire to change. We probably will see a change in tone, a potential change in focus, but that doesn't mean we should expect many substantial changes in the next three, six, 12 months.\"\nThe Canadian government, he adds, will probably find itself \"hemmed in by reality.\"\nThe young incoming leader will, like Barack Obama, be forced to face the realities of security in a world where extremists can move easily through flowing populations, including hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war.\nAnd he will have to explain that to a population yearning to return their country's legacy to one of a unique voice, defined as a \"middle power\" that embraces multiculturalism and generally opposes war.\nTAGS: Canada Islamic State national security elections world news Best Countries", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=How%20Trudeau%27s%20Liberal%20Win%20in%20Canada%20Changes%20the%20Fight%20Against%20ISIS", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=How%20Trudeau%27s%20Liberal%20Win%20in%20Canada%20Changes%20the%20Fight%20Against%20ISIS&summary=Another%20Western%20nation%20has%20voted%20for%20hope%20and%20change.%20But%20is%20Justin%20Trudeau%20ready%20to%20lead%3F&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=How%20Trudeau%27s%20Liberal%20Win%20in%20Canada%20Changes%20the%20Fight%20Against%20ISIS", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.liberal.ca/remarks-by-justin-trudeau-on-anti-terrorism-act/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedozi%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:27:00.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
