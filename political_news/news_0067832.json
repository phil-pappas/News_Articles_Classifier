Not at the conflict of interest that reflects a lack of judgment on the part of an individual, but at the salary and compensation of a part-time private college employee. There is a push for the federal government to do something to make college more affordable to more students. Government need not be involved.\nFrom 1999 to 2005, I was president of Webb Institute, a private engineering college that provides full-tuition scholarships to every student admitted. It controls its budget and keeps salaries under control. New York University clearly has no sense of fiscal judgment, and I believe it represents the rule, not the exception, when it comes to overcompensation.\nThe boards of trustees at most colleges are usually filled with senior executives who are well compensated in their own positions. That they bring a mindset that condones and approves runaway compensation for university staff is unfortunate, but it is also unconscionable, if not immoral. The place to start making college affordable is at the colleges themselves. Not to try is a failure in leadership. It can be done, if there is a will.\nRonald K. Kiss , Rockville\nThe writer is president emeritus of Webb Institute.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:23:26.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
