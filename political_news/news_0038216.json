Joseph Kyrillos with Governor Christie in 2012. A former ally of Christie, Kyrillos backs Jeb Bush for president. \nState Sen. Joseph Kyrillos was U.S. Attorney Chris Christie’s main man in Trenton, a trusted confidant with an encyclopedic knowledge of the State House’s traditions and treachery. \nThese days, Kyrillos is now former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s Man in Trenton. And with the press of a button in the Senate chamber Thursday, Kyrillos delivered a political black eye to Christie, now a Republican candidate for president alongside Bush. \nKyrillos, who broke from Christie in January by defecting to Bush’s presidential campaign, stunned the tense chamber by casting a crucial Republican vote to override a Christie veto for the first time since the governor took office in 2010. \nIt was stunning because speculation centered on other Republicans who would vote to overturn Christie. While Kyrillos’ unhappiness with Christie was widely known in the Senate, few expected the mild-mannered and cautious Monmouth County veteran to cross the line and publicly defy his old friend. \nYet, there he was tarnishing one of Christie’s favorite talking points on the 2016 campaign trail. Christie has cited his success in staving off more than 50 attempts to overturn his vetoes as proof of his vise-like skill in controlling his own party in Trenton. If elected president, Christie argues that he’ll impose the same discipline on a fractious caucus. \nNow, Thursday’s vote not only undermines the boast, it suggests a turning of the tide in Christie’s Trenton. It signals that Christie, not only unpopular with New Jersey voters, may no longer have the muscle to keep the dissidents muzzled in his own New Jersey GOP. \nThe three veteran Republicans who voted for the override – Kyrillos, Sen. Christopher Bateman of Somerset and Chris Conners of Ocean County – are no longer worried about the facing the consequences of facing Christie’s wrath. \nAnd the fact that Kyrillos, one of Bush’s New Jersey’s fundraisers, had a role in peeling back Christie’s Teflon, added a new wrinkle to the drama. Hindering Christie, even in a small way, helps Bush, who is competing with Christie for the same pool of establishment donors and activists. \nKyrillos, who slipped out of the Senate without talking to reporters, denied any political intrigue in a short statement on Twitter. He said it was strictly policy that prompted him to support the overturning of Christie’s veto. \"Don’t read any politics into it, just the right thing to do as I see it,\" he wrote. \nThe original measure that Christie vetoed swept through the Legislature with unanimous bipartisan support and without a peep of dissent. If it becomes law, it would allow judges to first check with law enforcement officials before expunging mental health records of gun buyers. \nTo most legislators, it represented a small but necessary hurdle for potential gun buyers – the kind of hurdle that’s consistent with New Jersey’s centrist tradition on gun control. It was also something requested by the courts and supported by law enforcement officials. \nBut Christie, who is trying to boost his profile with conservative primary voters in the South and Midwest, vetoed the bill last month, and instead called for a more comprehensive reform of mental-health laws. Many of the bill’s supporters derided Christie’s veto as a ploy, an attempt to give Republicans who voted for the bill – and several who actually co-sponsored it – an excuse for supporting his override. And for a while it seemed to work – an override attempt failed last month. \nSenate President Stephen Sweeney, a Gloucester County Democrat who is eyeing a run for governor, scheduled Thursday’s second override vote with his own twist of melodrama – he placed the Senate in \"House Under Call,\" which made attendance mandatory. But he also vowed to schedule more votes if Thursday’s didn’t succeed. That meant Republicans who once supported the measure would be repeatedly under pressure to justify their flip-flops. \n\"It was not going to go away,\" Sweeney said. \nBut there were other reasons why the vote succeeded in the Senate this time. \nWhile Kyrillos’ and Christie’s relationship slowly crumbled over the past few years, Kyrillos also reflected the slow-boiling discontent among Republicans, who had tired of Christie’s strict party line enforcement. \nMany felt that they had become pawns in Christie’s presidential ambitions. They were forced to rubber-stamp some of Christie’s conservative policies, even though those votes violated their long-standing moderate records. He successfully pressured several moderate Republicans not to override a veto of Christie’s $7.5 million cuts to women’s clinics, including those run by Planned Parenthood. That was something that none of them would have considered doing during the tenure of Gov. Christie Whitman in the 1990s. \nRepublicans also grumbled privately that they had little to show for all their solidarity. They were rarely mentioned amid Christie’s boasts of bipartisan cooperation with Democrats. Many felt that Christie gave short shrift to Republican legislative races and tapped the Republican Party coffers to pay for his mounting legal bills in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. \nAnd they resented Christie’s 2013 attempt to replace Senate Republican leader Thomas H. Kean with his ally, Sen. Kevin O’Toole of Cedar Grove. \nChristie has kept order by threatening to punish those who dare to cross him. Bateman faced the consequences of defying Christie. He said one of his recommendations for a judgeship remained stalled for nearly six months after voting against a Christie-backed plan to realign the state’s higher education system. \n\"I think in the future, if [senators] strongly disagree with him on something, then I think you will probably see more of this,\" Bateman said. He also said, \"I think he should have let people vote their conscience on this. It’s a common-sense bill.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:54:49.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
