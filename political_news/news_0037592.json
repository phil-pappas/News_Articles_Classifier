Scott Walker's decision to appoint a campaign donor to lead his troubled economic development agency. \nWalker appointed Mark Hogan to replace Reed Hall as CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in September. The Senate confirmed the appointment on a 23-9 vote Tuesday. \nAccording to government watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Hogan has given Walker's campaign $24,375 since 2005. Federal campaign finance records show he gave $10,000 to Unintimidated PAC, a super PAC that Walker's former campaign managers formed to support Walker's 2016 Republican presidential bid. \nWEDC has been plagued by gaffes and missteps since Walker created it in 2011, including failing to demand proof that award recipients were creating or retaining jobs and making contracts with recipients that didn't conform to state law. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:35:36.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
