Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said during an interview on CBS’s “Face The Nation.” \n“Unless you’re on the committee, you have no idea what we’ve done, why we’ve done it and what new facts we’ve found,” Gowdy said. “We’ve found new facts that don’t have anything to do with her.” \nThose who are suggesting that the probe is politically motivated, Gowdy added, “don’t have any idea what they’re talking about.” \nHis comments come ahead of Clinton’s scheduled testimony before the committee — slated for Thursday — and as Gowdy’s fellow Republicans increasingly suggest that the investigation was engineered to sabotage Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid. \nEarlier this month, House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) appeared to admit that the probe had been created simply to help cast shadows on Clinton’s run. \n“Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee. What are her numbers today?” McCarthy said on Fox News. “Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.” John Locher/AP Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Thursday. \nDays later, upstate Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.) told a local radio show that a “big part of this investigation ... was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton.” \nClinton has seized on the comments to help discredit the House Select Committee in recent weeks. \nIn an interview taped Friday, Clinton said she didn’t know what to expect from her highly anticipated appearance Thursday before the committee. \n“I don't know that I have very much to add,” she said, pointing out that eight separate congressional investigations have proven the “conspiracy theories” about her aren’t true. \n“It’s pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing, they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee, with an overwhelming focus on trying to as they admitted drive down my poll numbers,” she told CNN. “I’ve already testified about Benghazi. I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:34:02.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
