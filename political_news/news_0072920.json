He said the project when implemented would engage 1,500 youth in the constituency. \n'The project would lay emphasis on agriculture mechanization and high -skill and intensive programme in poultry farming,' the aspirant stressed adding that he would seek the collaboration of companies, organizations and departments like the DIZENGOF Company of Ghana and the Crop Science Department of University of Ghana to support the programme. \nTouching on security, Armiyawu Abdul-Rahim said he has already donated building materials worth GHC 3,000 for the development of the community police station at Teiman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:50.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
