For example, the media reported last year that the DHB had spent $1.3 million on a wide range of external consultants in 2012-13 ( http://www.asms.org.nz/news/asms-news/2014/05/02/southern-dhb-looking-for-answers-in-wrong-places/ ). \n“This latest funding for a temporary head of financial is just another example of short-sighted thinking that involves throwing money at a problem seemingly indefinitely,” he says. \n“What we need to see in a more general sense is greater investment in the senior doctors working at the DHB’s hospitals. They, and others on the clinical front line, have expertise the DHB should be drawing on. \n“If the Commissioners and hospital managers create a culture that encourages clinical engagement, that will lead to better decision-making, less waste and an improvement in the DHB’s financial position. Patients and hospital staff want to see a smarter approach to these issues.” \nMr Powell concluded by noting that Southern DHB desperately needed a new engaging leadership culture if it was to get out of its difficulties. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:19:41.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
