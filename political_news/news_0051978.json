Lord Bramall, a former head of the Army and a D-Day veteran, has made it clear to friends that the allegations are “utter rubbish” and told of his sadness that his wife died in the summer before he could be cleared. Police raided the home of Lord Bramall in April as part of its inquiry into astonishing claims that children had been murdered by a child sex gang, whose members allegedly also included Sir Edward Heath and Lord Brittan. Leon Brittan at his London home last year The Telegraph has confirmed that the raid on Lord Bramall’s house was instigated solely on the testimony of one man, known only as “Nick”. “I wish this investigation to be over at the earliest opportunity. I am particularly concerned that Lord Bramall, a Field Marshal and war hero, who is in his 90s, should not be placed in the same position as Leon Brittan and that he dies before the public knows there is not a scintilla of truth in all this.” Harvey Proctor Senior officers are now said to have serious doubts about the evidence of “Nick”, amid growing concern that detectives within Operation Midland had been too ready to believe his claims, which at one stage they wrongly labelled “credible and true”. Lord Bramall’s wife, who was suffering from dementia, died in the summer while he remained under a cloud of suspicion. Harvey Proctor – a former Tory MP also accused by “Nick” of being part of the gang – has called on police to close the inquiry and exonerate Lord Bramall before any more damage is done. He told The Telegraph: “I wish this investigation to be over at the earliest opportunity. I am particularly concerned that Lord Bramall, a Field Marshal and war hero, who is in his 90s, should not be placed in the same position as Leon Brittan and that he dies before the public knows there is not a scintilla of truth in all this.” A friend close to Lord Bramall said yesterday: “The whole of this is utter rubbish. All the accusations come from one man called Nick. It is absolute lies and fantasy. “Lord Bramall is hoping the police will very soon realise that they have nothing, and that they have no evidence. In the meantime all he can do is sit at home and wait. The whole thing is completely mad. There is not one iota of truth in it. It’s been incredibly upsetting for him. Reputations don’t seem to carry much weight. “It’s a terrible thing for him to put up with at the end of his life given how much he has done for his country. “He is very modest about his record as a war hero and head of the army but he has an impeccable record and these allegations make no sense. “He feels terrible at what happened to Lord Brittan who died before he was fully cleared. It was awful for Lord Bramall that his wife died in the summer before he has been cleared. “But he doesn’t want people to want him to be cleared just because of the strain and because they feel sorry for him. He wants to be cleared because he hasn’t done anything.” The comments of Lord Bramall’s supporters will put further pressure on police amid growing consternation that its high-profile investigations into historic VIP abuse are unravelling. Operation Midland was established in November 2014 after the alleged victim gave a series of statements to Exaro, an investigative news website. Superintendent Kenny McDonald described the claims of “Nick” as “credible and true” – a statement for which the Met have since apologised. Friends of Lord Bramall said last night: “Police should never have said Nick’s claims were true. It was turning the law upside down.” Exaro said it was sticking by the evidence of “Nick” despite claims by BBC’s Panorama that it could find no proof to back his claim that a child was killed. Nick’s other allegations are not substantiated either. It is understood that on at least some dates that “Nick” alleges he was abused by Lord Bramall, the retired Field Marshal was out of the country. The abuse inquiries were triggered by a claim in the House of Commons by Tom Watson, now Labour’s deputy leader, that a “powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10” needed to be properly investigated. Tom Watson Mr Watson is also under intense scrutiny for interfering in a separate rape allegation made against Lord Brittan dating back to 1967. Police had concluded there was no evidence to pursue the case and closed the inquiry, but Mr Watson wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions demanding that Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, be interviewed. His intervention, it is understood, led to a senior police officer, Det Chief Insp Paul Settle, quitting the rape inquiry because he felt his authority had been undermined. Lord Brittan died in January not knowing he had been cleared of the rape allegation. His alleged role in the gang that is supposed to include Lord Bramall, Sir Edward Heath, Harvey Proctor and others, remains under investigation. Mr Watson made a partial apology on Friday for calling Lord Brittan “evil” in a newspaper article after his death and admitted he was wrong to do so. Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, yesterday accused Mr Watson of failing to go far enough. “[Tom Watson is] incapable of doing the decent thing and apologising for the hurt he has caused,” he tweeted. What are these allegations all about? These are horrific claims of murder, torture and sexual abuse of children by politicians and celebrities at a flat in Dolphin Square, Westminster, and other locations. A separate inquiry is looking at claims of abuse at a guest house in Barnes, south-west London, allegedly visited by VIPs. Who is making the claims? There is one principle witness to the murder claims – a man known only as Nick, who told police in October 2014 he knew of three children killed by the gang. His testimony led to police setting up Operation Midland to investigate. Another witness, called Darren, said he was aware of two possible murders. Police can find no evidence to corroborate this. In the past Darren had been jailed for making hoax bomb calls and had falsely confessed to murder and rape. Who is in the alleged gang? Supposedly it included former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, ex-home secretary Lord Brittan and two former heads of the intelligence services, all of whom are dead. Police have interviewed Field Marshal Lord Bramall and Harvey Proctor, a former Tory MP. Mr Proctor said in August that police had accused him of trying to castrate Nick. At what stage are the investigations? Initially police were confident Nick was telling the truth and described his evidence as “credible and true”. Some senior officers have since expressed serious misgivings amid fears Nick is a fantasist. Scotland Yard has said it was wrong to say his allegations were true. What do the VIPs say? Mr Proctor says the claims are not only false but not credible either. Friends of Lord Bramall want him exonerated as soon as possible. Lord Brittan’s family say it is disgraceful he remained under a cloud of suspicion until his death from cancer in January What’s this got to do with Tom Watson? In 2012 the MP claimed in the Commons that a paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10 must be investigated. Hasn’t he apologised? Mr Watson said last week he was sorry for saying of Lord Brittan after his death: “He is close to evil as any human being could get.” But he has not apologised for telling the Director of Public Prosecutions that Lord Brittan should be interviewed over a 1967 rape claim. Police had said the case should be dropped due to lack of evidence. In the end, Lord Brittan was cleared of rape, but he was never told this in his lifetime. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:04:21.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
