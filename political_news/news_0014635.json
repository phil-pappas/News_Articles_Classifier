Pakistan Cricket Board’s match referee fined Aamir 150 percent of his match fees for violating the code of conduct during a Quad-e-Azam Trophy qualifying match between Sui Southern Gas and PIA in Faisalabad. Aamir was docked for using abusive language and arguing with the PIA players including Test batsman Faisal Iqbal in the match that Sui Gas won. The PCB chief was clearly upset with Aamir's behavior who is presently on a rehabiliation program designed by the board for him, Salman Butt and Muhammad Asif after they completed their five-year bans for spot fixing in September. While Butt and Asif are yet to play any domestic cricket, Aamir is appearing for Sui Gas as the ICC had given him special relaxation before his ban ended under a new clause of the anti-corruption code. sports Cricket Muhammad Aamir pakistan Cricket Board Also Read N.Srinivasan has cataract surgery, chooses to remain mum on Supreme Court observation Varun Aaron follows Pujara’s example, eyes a county stint Bowlers put Hyderabad on top Felt I and my country were insulted, says boxer Sarita Devi", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/sports-cricket/article/pcb-warns-pacer-muhammad-aamir-behave", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Mohammad-Amir_AP_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Mohammad-Amir_AP_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:40:41.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
