That is a legitimate issue that we've got to address.\"\nThe Black Lives Matter movement grew on social media around the protests in Ferguson, Missouri after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teen Michael Brown in August 2014.\n\"There is a specific concern as to whether African-Americans in certain jurisdictions are not being treated fairly or are subject to excessive force more frequently,\" Obama said.\nHe cautioned that pointing out bias against black Americans by police should use data rather than anecdotes and avoid painting the picture with \"a broad brush.\"\nAmodei wins House passage...
