Supreme Commander was yelling: “East, west and south … Four aircraft. Leave the bases, leave positions as soon as possible. Leave everything, and arms and ammunition.”\n“It is dangerous. Our three hundred targets have already been hit.\nEverybody listen up. Here’s aircraft. Where are you? Come in.” “I see four Russian aircraft.\nWhen they are finished with strikes, transfer weapons. Find warehouse that is deeper than 15 meters so the projectiles can not penetrate it. Be sure that tanks, armored vehicles and guns every day move to another location and do not use them except in an emergency because they record … they all record. “\n ”Turn off all cell phones and do not use them and do not even talk on the walkie-talkie with the main commanders who are on the front lines.”\n“The most important thing, from all positions and facilities remove the flag of the Islamic state. When you remove the flags, leave the bases and positions on the entire territory of the Caliphate.”\n“My brothers, my brothers, do not be afraid …. we will win, we will destroy Bashar Al-Assad, the Russian army will be destroyed in Syria, and Putin’s end will be in our hands in the name of Allah, if Allah allows it.”\n—\nIZAKOVIC\nSaudi clerics are calling for holy “jihad” war against Russia for Syria campaign\nFSA “threatens” Russia with “second Afganistan”\nUS Defense Chief Warns: Russians Will Die\nAshton Carter warns that due to its Syria attacks, Russia will in coming days ‘begin to suffer casualties,’ indicating domestic attacks.\nhttp://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/201599\nUS Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said Thursday Russia will soon begin to suffer casualties after dramatically expanding its military support for long-time ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n“This will have consequences for Russia itself which is rightly fearful of attacks…in coming days, the Russians will begin to suffer from casualties,” Carter said at a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels dominated by the Syrian crisis.\nThe warning comes after the US State Department said Wednesday that most of Russia’s barrage of airstrikes in Syria are not hitting Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists as it claims.\nRussia conducted its first airstrikes in Syria last week, claiming it had been targeting ISIS in the Homs and Hama districts of the country, but an unnamed American official later said the targets were US-backed “moderate” rebel groups fighting ISIS.\nWhile the airstrike campaign began on September 30, on Wednesday Moscow ramped up its war by unleashing cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea.\nIt apparently seeks to win back territory from rebel groups for its ally Assad, and likewise Iran has been sending in hundreds of troops to help in the massive offensive.\nCarter hints at new U.S. approach to supporting Syrian rebels\nObama Weighs “Syria Retreat” As White House Ends Training Of Moderate Rebels\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-09/obama-folds-white-house-weighs-syria-retreat-it-ends-training-moderate-rebels\n……………..the NYT confirmed that the de-escalation process has begun, when it reported that “the Obama administration has ended the Pentagon’s $500 million program to train and equip Syrian rebels, administration officials said on Friday, in an acknowledgment that the beleaguered program had failed to produce any kind of ground combat forces capable of taking on the Islamic State in Syria.”\nPentagon officials were expected to officially announce the end of the program on Friday, as Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter leaves London after meetings with his British counterpart, Michael Fallon, about the continuing wars in Syria and Iraq.\nA senior Defense Department official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there would no longer be any more recruiting of so-called moderate Syrian rebels to go through training programs in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Instead, a much smaller training center would be set up in Turkey, where a small group of “enablers” — mostly leaders of opposition groups — would be taught operational maneuvers like how to call in airstrikes.\nTo be sure, the admin tried to soften the blow: moments ago Reuters added that “The U.S. military program to train and equip Syrian rebels is not “ending” but is instead being refocused, a senior U.S. defense official said on Friday, ahead of an announcement on overhauling the troubled U.S. effort.” No matter how one diplomatically phrases it though, at this point the wheels are in motion.\nWhich brings us to our own conclusion from last week:\nIf Russia ends up bolstering Iran’s position in Syria (by expanding Hezbollah’s influence and capabilities) and if the Russian air force effectively takes control of Iraq thus allowing Iran to exert a greater influence over the government in Baghdad, the fragile balance of power that has existed in the region will be turned on its head and in the event this plays out, one should not expect Washington, Riyadh, Jerusalem, and London to simply go gentle into that good night.\nIt is precisely this scenario that U.S. “intelligence” just realized, and why Obama is now sounding the retreat. The only question is whether Putin, who is now on the offensive across the mid-east region, agrees to take Obama’s olive branch, or whether he continues the “campaign to end ISIS”, in the process creating the biggest shift in the mid-east balance of power with a Russia-Syria-Iran-Iraq axis, and with China waiting patiently in the wings.\nUS scraps Syria rebels training program\nRussia: US-led coalition inefficient in fighting Daesh\nThe NATO-Russia Face Off In Syria\nBy Pepe Escobar\nhttp://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article43075.htm\nSo a Su-30 enters a few hundred meters into Turkish airspace for only two minutes over Hatay province, and returns to Syrian airspace after being warned by a couple of Turkish F-16s.\nThen all hell breaks loose as if this was the ultimate pretext for a NATO-Russia war.\nNATO, predictably, went out all rhetorical guns blazing. Russia is causing “extreme danger” and should immediately stop bombing those cute “moderate rebels” the coalition of the dodgy opportunists refuses to bomb.\nBut wait; NATO is actually too busy to go to war. The priority, until at least November, is the epic Trident Juncture 2015; 36,000 troops from 30 states, more than 60 warships, around 200 aircraft, all are seriously practicing how to defend from the proverbial “The Russians are Coming!”\nStill, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu – he of the former “zero problems with our neighbors” doctrine – actually “warned” Moscow that next time Ankara would respond “militarily”.\nUntil, of course, he backed down; “What we have received from Russia …is that this was a mistake and that they respect Turkey’s borders and this will not happen again.”\nThe incident could have been easily defused – via military to military communication – without the posturing.\nBut Ankara – NATO’s eastern flank – is under immense pressure from ‘Exceptionalistan’. It’s no accident Pentagon supremo and notorious neocon Ash Carter “conferred” with Ankara about the incident.\nCarter of course is the most stellar practitioner of the official Beltway diktat; “By taking military action in Syria against moderate groups’ targets, Russia has escalated the civil war.”\nSultan’ Erdogan, right on cue, and straight from Strasbourg (no, he was not campaigning for the European Parliament) doubled down: “Assad has committed state terrorism, and unfortunately you find Russia and Iran defending (him).”\nAnd yet ‘Sultan’ Erdogan won’t go down in history as the catalyst for the much-awaited NATO-Russia Hot War 2.0. At least not yet.\nOnly bomb if we say so\nEnter Dr. Zbigniew “Grand Chessboard” Brzezinski, growling in a FT Op-Ed that Washington should “retaliate” if Moscow does not stop attacking US assets in Syria. “US assets” means CIA-trained “moderate rebels”. And after all, “American credibility” is at stake.\nDr. Zbig – Obama’s prime foreign policy mentor – insists bombing CIA-trained “rebels” accounts for “Russian military incompetence”. And the American counter-attack should be to “disarm” the “Russian naval and air presence.” Now that’s how you go for a NATO-Russia Hot War 2.0.\n Dr. Zbig admitted though that “regional chaos could easily spread northeastward,” and then “both Russia and then China could be adversely affected.” Who cares? What matters is that “American interests and America’s friends…would also suffer.”\nThis is what passes for prime geopolitical analysis in the ‘Empire of Chaos’.\n‘Sultan’ Erdogan, for his part, remains restless. Moscow has already evaporated his so cherished three-year-old dream of a no-fly zone over northern Syria.\nThere is an actual no-fly zone all over Syria now in effect. But it’s managed by Russia.\nAnd that explains why there’s already full spectrum hysteria for more US Congress sanctions on Russia. How can a no-fly zone be imposed over Syria when Russia got there first?\nAnd it was all going so swimmingly for the ‘Sultan’. Ankara – at the insistence of Washington – had finally thrown open its air bases to fight ISIS/ISIL/Daesh, but as long as this was part of a regime change operation in Damascus. And for that, Ankara would get its no-fly zone.\nEnter ‘The Sultan’s’ recurrent nightmare; the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its sister organization, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n‘The Sultan’ simply cannot accept the PYD advancing to the western bank of the Euphrates to help in the fight against ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. ‘The Sultan’ wants to “contain” the PYD in Kobani.\nThe problem is the PYD – supported by the PKK – is the only reliable ‘Empire of Chaos’ ally in Syria. Yet ‘the Sultan’ could not help himself; he got into a war – again – against the PKK. Washington was not exactly amused.\nAnd then there’s the key corridor from the Bab al-Salam border crossing down to Aleppo – controlled by Ankara-supported goon squads. That’s Ankara’s bridge to Aleppo; without it, not the slightest chance of regime change, ever. The fake “Caliphate” was threatening to take over the corridor. So action was imperative.\nRussia’s spectacular entry into the war theatre threw all these elaborate plans into disarray. Imagine a complete liberation of northeast Syria as soon as the PYD – with help from PKK fighters – is weaponized enough to smash the ISIS/ISIL/Daesh goons. And imagine the Russian Air Force providing air cover for such an operation, with extra coordination by the Russia-Syria-Iraq-Iran central in Baghdad.\n‘The Sultan’, in desperation, would have to maneuver his F-16s against such an offensive.\nAnd then we might really have a NATO-Russia five seconds to midnight scenario – with terrifying consequences. ‘The Sultan’ would blink first. And NATO would collapse into the ignominy it never left – back to its elaborate “Russia is invading” drills.\n#SYRIA: #Su30SM fighter’s short entry in the Turkish airspace caused by Hmeymim airbase location & weather conditions pic.twitter.com/0a8e74sEBe\n— Минобороны России (@mod_russia) October 5, 2015\nSay hello to my geopolitical jihadi tool\nNext steps for the Russian campaign would be to pay close attention to the road linking ISIS/ISIL/Daesh’s capital, Al-Raqqah, around which jihadis are fighting for the control of oil and gas in Sha’ir and Jazal. And then there are pockets east of both Homs and Hama, and in al-Qaryatayn. Moscow – slowly, surely, methodically – is getting there.\nWhat the Russian air campaign has already graphically exposed is the whole rotten core myth of the new Jihad International.\nISIS/ISIL/Daesh, Jabhat al-Nusra and assorted Salafi-jihadi goon squads have been kept up and running by a massive financial/logistical/weaponizing “effort” – which includes all sorts of key nodes, from arms factories in Bulgaria and Croatia to transportation routes via Turkey and Jordan.\nAs for those Syrian “moderate rebels” – and most of them are not even Syrian, they’re mercenaries – every pebble in the ravaged Sykes-Picot desert sands knows they were trained by the CIA in Jordan. The desert pebbles are also aware that ISIS/ISIL/Daesh goons have been infiltrated into Syria from Turkey – once again, across Hatay province; and vast swathes of ‘the Sultan’s’ Army and police were into the game.\nAs for who pays the bills for the lavish weaponizing, talk to the proverbial “pious wealthy donors” – incited by their clerics – in the GCC, the petrodollar arm of NATO.\nNone of these goon squads could possibly thrive for so long without full, multidisciplinary “support” from the usual suspects.\nSo the hysterical/apoplectic/paroxystic rage enveloping the ‘Empire of Chaos’ betrays the utter failure, once again, of the same old “policy” (remember Afghanistan) of using jihadis as geopolitical tools. Fake “Caliphate” or “rebels”, they are all NATO-GCC’s bitches.\nTo add insult to injury, a frustrated ‘Sultan’ has also been forced to annex himself to a slightly changing Washington position – which now rules that “Assad must go,” yes, but it may take some time, as part of a yet to be defined “transition”.\n‘The Sultan’ will remain a pile of nerves. He does not give a damn about ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. Washington now does – sort of. He wants to smash the PYD and the PKK. For Washington, the PYD is a helpful ally.\nAs for Moscow, ‘the Sultan’ better watch his neo-Ottoman step.\n‘The Sultan’ simply cannot afford to antagonize ‘The Bear’. Gazprom will expand the Blue Stream pipeline into Turkey. It would be by 3 billion cubic meters; instead it will be by 1 billion cubic meters. According to Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, it’s due to technical capabilities.\n Yet Ankara better get its act together, because even that extension may evaporate if there’s no agreement on the commercial terms of TurkStream, the former Turkish Stream. Ankara is under tremendous pressure from the Obama administration. And ‘the Sultan’ knows very well that without Russia all his elaborate plans to position Turkey as the key energy transit hub from East to West will vanish in Anatolian scrub. In the end, he may even get regime-changed himself.\nPutin challenging U.S. for dominance in Middle East?\nGovt will build case for bombing in Syria in parliament\nIran welcomes Russia’s “decision to start serious fight against terrorism in Syria”\nSyria: Iranian Revolutionary guard announces death of one of its general in Aleppo region\nSyria MSM reports addressed by Russian FM", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMEkHoVshMI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTVDMLGpTGE", "http://www.vecernji.hr/svijet/panika-medu-dzihadistima-skidajte-zastave-i-bjezite-svi-1029559", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/J65cK0UUGrI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MMpfgt0CP8s", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4lYCw07NhVk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDrUj8aadZ8", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-09/obama-folds-white-house-weighs-syria-retreat-it-ends-training-moderate-rebels", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8hkjUhJDKA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pihdx-i8VQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hv9XzDX2_XY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XPnRwGIsdjA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/YAt3oGnSwBs", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4429GlnZiQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_H-XNYJhRI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AeRtw0itHjo", "http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/201599", "http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article43075.htm", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ljqf1qGyjqg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlUrOG-HRWk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TMpqzhBj3Q", "http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=29811", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrZp3LiAH50", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a48Up9EHwRU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yi2nRU9z5Uw"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:51:37.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
