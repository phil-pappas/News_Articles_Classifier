Courtsey of NoLabels.org \nPresidential candidates from both sides of the aisle are coming together for the first time in New Hampshire on Monday. GOP candidates Donald Trump, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic candidates Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will all give remarks. \nThe convention is run by a non-profit out of D.C. called No Labels.

Kelly Ayotte and Gov. Maggie Hassan, who this week announced she is running for Ayotte’s Senate seat, will also be there. This will be the first major appearance the two have had together since the announcement. \nMore than 2,000 people are expected to attend.
