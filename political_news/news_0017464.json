Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn. Both have been integral in the efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\"Chairman Blackburn and our members will have the resources and the subpoena power to get to the bottom of these horrific practices, and build on our work to protect the sanctity of all human life,\" Boehner said.\n\"Those who get paid to kill children are doing a lot of other immoral -- as well as illegal -- activities as well,\" Pavone said. \"This new congressional panel will be another step in making that happen.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:34:00.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
