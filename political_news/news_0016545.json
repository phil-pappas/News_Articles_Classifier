From a Bournvita ad, to playing the young Aamir Khan in Dhoom 3 to portraying emperor Ashoka on TV, Siddharth already has an impressive resume. The youngster, however, has other dreams too besides the silver screen. The national-level gold medalist gymnast wants to win an Olympic medal for India.\n“My mother says I need to be beautiful from within. ‘Be different, be dedicated and be the one and only,’ she says. Keeping these in mind I always work hard and put in my best in whatever I do,” says Siddharth, adding, “Having won a National Gold Medal in gymnastics. I wish to win a medal in the Olympics and make my country proud.”\nThe Class X student adds, “Whatever little time I get after finishing shooting for Ashoka, I come home and study. My brother and my mother are always there to help me in my studies. Gymnastics being my first love, I make it a point to give enough time for practice too.” About the show, he says, “After performing the pivotal character of Ashoka, I have come to know so many facts about the emperor. I am totally in awe of this character.\n“I had to undergo rigorous training for three months for the role. This included horse riding and sword fighting. But being a gymnast, it was not very tough for me…it was another feather in my cap.” He says his mother helped a lot in his journey. “I must thank my mum for she is always trying to correct my diction. The show has some very tough Hindi… I have also studied Sanskrit,” says the boy from Allahabad, adding, “As the going gets tough, I become tougher, all thanks to my mother, who runs an NGO and a beauty parlour.” Siddharth is also at pains to add that acting was never on his radar. “I had no inclination towards acting. But after watching me in the Bournvita ad, they called me for the audition of Dhoom 3 to play Samar and Tahir, the dual characters of Aamir.\n“I still remember when I first went to Aamir’s residence, he was rehearsing for his characters in Dhoom 3 and I was watching him. After I auditioned, he came up to me and said ‘you are brilliant, you do not have to watch me, I will have to watch your brilliant performance’. This really boosted my morale.” Aamir also gave Siddharth some acting tips. “He told me, ‘you need to get into the character thoroughly, don’t get distracted by people around you. Always remember to give your best’.”\n“Shooting with Aamir and Katrina Kaif was a great learning experience for me. Especially the support I got from Aamir is unforgettable. Both Aamir and Katrina are grounded actors,” he says, adding, “In Dhoom 3, Samar’s character was slightly difficult as I had to practice stammering for the role. But I am happy that I could perform both the characters to the best of my abilities.”\nOne day, he hopes to make it big in Bollywood. “I wish to work under the Yash Raj banner and Dharma Productions. I have not got any offers yet but I have to complete my studies and practice gymnastics too.”\nHe realises that replicating the success he got as a child is not an easy task as an adult, especially in the industry. “I do not know my future, but yes, I wish I am more successful as an actor when I grow up,” he says. There are also rumours that his role in Ashoka might be curtailed as the makers are planning a leap in the show. But Siddharth says, “I do not have an idea about the time leap. I am enjoying doing the show and if at all I am replaced, I will take it in my stride. All I am interested in is giving my best at this moment.”\nSiddharth also leaves us with a message for children his age: “Respect your elders — especially your mum and dad. Someone up above is always watching over you. You will get success only if you respect your parents and work hard for a better future.”\n Siddharth Nigam Emperor Ashoka Omlymic Medal sunday chronicle Also Read ‘Initially I wore my jeans under the sari’ Couture for the classy home Thrill zone of virtual money ‘I don’t know why one would hide his marriage’", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Siddharth%20Nigam.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Siddharth%20Nigam.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/commentary-sunday-chronicle/article/olympic-medal-all-i-want-says-siddharth-nigam", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:15:18.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
