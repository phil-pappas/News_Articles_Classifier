Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, and ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., preceded the much-awaited testimony of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with a debate over whether the hearing was a pursuit for the truth of what happened in the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens or a Republican witch hunt designed to derail Clinton’s presidential ambitions. \n“Questions linger because previous investigations were not thorough,” Gowdy said. “This investigation is the first to review 50,000 relevant documents because we insisted they be produced, from the State Department, the Department of Defense, the CIA and even the White House, and the first to examine Secretary Clinton’s emails sent over a private server.” \nGowdy argued that if previous investigations were serious and thorough, “Why did they fail to examine Ambassador Stevens’ and Secretary Clinton’s emails, and interview witnesses present at Benghazi during the attack?” \nGowdy assured Clinton the investigation was not about her, but about the “fundamental obligation of government to tell the truth” about what happened to Stevens and the three other Americans who died in the Benghazi attack. \nFind out what really happened: Aaron Klein’s “The REAL Benghazi Story” exposes the ongoing cover-up \nIn his opening statement, Gowdy also explained that the delay in calling Clinton as a witness was caused by the discovery in March that she had a private email server, causing the panel to subpoena and review relevant emails she sent and received on the private server. \n“It was a lousy way to run an investigation to proceed without Ambassador Stevens’ emails and yours,” Gowdy charged, citing the previous investigations into the Benghazi attack, including the one conducted by the State Department’s Accountability Review Board. \nCummings charged in his opening statement that the “problem was the Republican caucus did not like the conclusions of the previous investigations.” \n“So Republicans set up this select committee with an unlimited budget, unlimited time and no rules, and they set it loose to focus on Secretary Clinton because she was running for president.” \nCummings cited House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s statement in an interview that the Benghazi committee helped drive down Clinton’s polling numbers in the presidential race. \nHe argued that Clinton was testifying alone, without being accompanied by the secretary of defense and the head of the CIA, because the investigation was not an independent, bipartisan effort to find the truth but a political charade to discredit Clinton with “wild Republican claims.” \n“The select committee has spent 17 months and $4.7 million, and all we have obtained are some emails from Ambassador Stevens and Secretary Clinton that only confirm the conclusions of the previous eight investigations,” Cummings concluded. \nIn her opening statement, Clinton said, “I’m here to honor the service of Ambassador Stevens and the other three brave Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi. \n“I knew Ambassador Stevens, and he found his way to get into Libya to work with those brave Libyans opposing the murderous Gadhafi regime by entering Benghazi in a Greek cargo ship. Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:30:59.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
