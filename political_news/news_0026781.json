Ryan has put forth a number of budgets and policy proposals that call for deep spending cuts. Some of those cuts take aim at an important tool for poor parents: child care subsidies. The sky-high cost of child care in the U.S. can dwarf a parents income, particularly a low-income parent. Child care subsidies help defray that cost, allowing a parent to find a place to leave their children while going to work and knowing that they dont have to rely on family members or unsafe, unstable arrangements. Without them, however, poor parents can face a tough choice between continuing to work and simply staying home because the cost is too high. At the same time, however, hes often said that more poor people need to be in the workforce and combat what he sees as a culture problem where they dont value work. He has often cited the welfare reform enacted in the 1990s as a model of success. But by imposing incredibly strict work requirements in the name of forcing more poor people to work, the changes ensured that people who rely on cash benefits, mostly poor, single mothers, have had to hunt down any kind of job to stay enrolled. That can quickly eat into their work/family balance and take them away from time they may have spent raising their children. Today, any poor mother who needs welfare but also wishes to spend time at home raising her children will find it tough to do so. Ryan lives off government welfare, raising his welfare check every year, while attacking the poor in true anti-Christian fashion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:47.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
