'Our politics should never be about life and death because God in his own wisdom will choose a leader for us,’' President John Mahama said. \nAddressing the Grace Pentecostal Branch of the Assemblies of God Church at Effiakuma, a suburb of Takoradi in the Western Region, the President also emphasized the need for Ghanaians to continually support him in prayers as he delivers on his mandate as President. '….Even if men of God need prayers then those of us in authority in the secular world even need more prayers because the Bible even says we should pray for those in authority so that he will give them divine guidance to be able to do what is right in the sight of God.' \n‘Ghana is favoured' The President was also convinced God's favour is on Ghana, saying 'Ghana is the only country that has not suffered civil war.''Our nation is favoured, and our nation is great,' he added. \nHe recalled that although Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence, the economy started experiencing some challenges after the transition. 'Ghana was recognised in the whole community and celebrated as the first sub saharan African country to have independence but by the 1970s and 1980s; the country fell to the bottom of the pit…Our economy was struggling, there was no light, …to make matters worse there was no food…' \nHe was however quick to add that the country was able to surmount its challenges 'because of God's favour.''Gods favour was on the country and we were able to overcome all that. Ghana is rising again; today we have the fastest growing middle class in Africa. Nobody goes to the next door to beg for iced water.In every house, everyone has a TV in his room'.
