Maria Tomasia, chairwoman of the city’s Board of Election Commissioners, said six people voted Saturday morning and about 12 voted Monday morning in the at-large and Ward 4 races. Polls were open from 8 a.m. to noon on both days, in City Hall. “Not that many calls, either,” Tomasia said, explaining that elections staff hadn’t received the usual amount of questions from residents wondering where to vote, whether they’re registered, and so on. “But that will change by (Tuesday) morning,” Tomasia said. Elections staff said absentee ballots still were coming in Monday, but totaled 211 at about 2 p.m. Polls for the preliminary at-large and Ward 4 City Council election will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, at 36 voting locations across the city. Voters in all 36 precincts will be able to vote for up to FIVE of the 11 at-large candidates, who appear on the ballot in the following order: Naomi R.A.
