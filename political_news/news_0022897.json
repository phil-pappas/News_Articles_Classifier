The complaint made on Tuesday relates to an incident in January 2013, when the Seattle nursing student was assaulted by a social acquaintance at an apartment. She reported the assault by phone in June, and was told the Special Victims Unit would handle the case. According to the New York Daily News, Lieutenant Adam Lamboy and Detective Lucazs Skorzewski arrived to take the womans statement on July 5. They later encouraged her to join them for lunch and drinks at a waterfront bar in Seattle. What a crock. Wonder if these men believe women are nothing more than breeder cows, too?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:23:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
