Promoted stories \n\"The Chilcot Inquiry has still to be published and these revelations will need to be looked at very seriously.\". \nThe ex-premier told the Chilcot Inquiry that Mr Bush would have understood he was ready to support military action if the diplomatic route was exhausted. \nThe briefing note, prepared for Mr Bush in March 2002 ahead of his Crawford summit with Mr Blair later that year, emerged after a court ruling in the US led to the publication of thousands of emails received by Hillary Clinton. \nFormer Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said the content of the memo did \"not come as a surprise\". \n\"This is yet more confirmation, if any was needed, that Tony Blair in spite of what he said publicly and in the House of Commons at the time had made up his mind willy nilly to support George W Bush whatever the circumstances,\" he said. Share article \n\"I have no doubt that even at this stage the Chilcot Inquiry will regard this as a remarkable piece of information.\" \nA spokesman for Mr Blair told the content was consistent with what he had said publicly before.
