The Labour frontbencher made the concession after writing a letter calling on Chancellor George Osborne to perform a U-turn on reform plans as they stand.\nIt comes amid a threat of rebellion among Conservatives over the Government's austerity policy.\nThe Chancellor wants to slash £4.4bn from the welfare bill with tax credits firmly in the firing line.\nMr Osborne is facing not just dissent from a number of his own MPs and Cabinet colleagues, but also the risk that the reforms could be thrown out by the Lords, where a vote will take place on Monday.\nPlay video \"Murnaghan In A Minute\" Video: Murnaghan In A Minute But Mr McDonnell told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he could support Mr Osborne's reforms in future.\nHe said: \"I have written to George Osborne today to say, 'I know what a U-turn looks like and how it can damage you but we need a U-turn on this one.\n\"So I have said to him, 'Look, if you can change your mind on this we will not make any political capital out of this'.\n\"If the Lords do throw this out tomorrow and put it back to the Government, I have said to him, 'If you change your mind and bring back a policy in which people are protected - not a political stunt but a real protection - we will not in any way attack you for that, in fact we will support you.\"\nPlay video \"Vince Cable On Tax Credit Cuts\" Video: Vince Cable On Tax Credit Cuts Mr McDonnell added: \"These are people who go to work, look after their kids, do everything asked of them, and they are going to lose, on average, about £1,300 a year. Two-hundred thousand people could be forced into poverty.\"\nThe shadow chancellor said that Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who also appeared on the programme, was one of Mr Osborne's Cabinet colleagues who opposed the measures.\nShe defended the policy, which she insisted was in line with the Conservatives' election pitch.\nBut Mr McDonnell claimed that he expected the Education Secretary \"to be one of my allies behind the scenes that convinces George to turn on this issue\".\nPlay video \"Tax Credits Are 'Here To Stay'\" Video: Tax Credits Are 'Here To Stay' Ms Morgan told him: \"I expect to be called many things but I'm not sure I'm one of your allies on this.\"\nScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has voiced her concerns, saying it was wrong claimants faced a \"cliff edge\" when their state help is slashed in April.\nA number of Conservative ministers and party advisers have also privately expressed deep concerns over Mr Osborne's handling of the reforms, according to The Sunday Telegraph.\nPeers are due to vote on Monday on a Labour motion to block the measure unless the Government sets out \"full transitional protection for a minimum of three years\" for existing claimants.\nPlay video \"Lib Dem Opposes Tax Credit Changes\" Video: Lib Dem Opposes Tax Credit Changes The Liberal Democrats want a \"fatal\" motion that would kick out the policy entirely but have been criticised as they have in past called for the Lords to be scrapped.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:19:38.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
