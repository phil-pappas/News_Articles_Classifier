The regulation, aimed at improving grid reliability, lowering costs and encouraging clean energy, remains in effect as the litigation continues. \nThe nine-member court could be split 4-4, with conservative Justice Samuel Alito recusing himself from the case. An even split would uphold the lower court ruling. \nChief Justice John Roberts said during the oral arguments he was concerned about the federal government exercising too much authority over retail electricity markets, which are traditionally overseen by states. \n\"You have to have some sort of limiting principle, otherwise FERC can do whatever it wants,\" Roberts said. \nJustice Anthony Kennedy, who often casts the deciding vote in close decisions, asked questions that would indicate he could favor a narrower ruling against the government that would allow FERC to rewrite the regulation. \nFERC says the program affects only the wholesale electricity markets. One of the regional groups that operates the wholesale markets, PJM Interconnection LLC, estimates that demand-response has saved customers in its area between $9.3 billion and $11.5 billion in one year. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham ) \nFive Democrat candidates square off in the first debate in Las Vegas.
