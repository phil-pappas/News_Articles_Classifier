But in Washington, D.C., a local startup by the name of Cove is working to carve out a niche angle on the industry. Related Here's How 6 DC Co-Working Spaces Compare \nIn late October, Cove will open its ninth D.C. location in less than two years, representing the addition of seven District-based franchises in just 12 months. The newest location will be placed in Chinatown and will be one of Cove’s largest, spanning two floors, 1,400 square feet and enough space to also host local tech events. It is located at 829 7th St NW. The latest move follows an expansion to Boston. But CEO/co-founder Adam Segal tells DC Inno he’s just getting started. Cove CEO Adam Segal is just getting started \nSegal called the Chinatown location a “central hub” in the Cove network for D.C. residents, as it’s conveniently located near multiple WMATA metro lines and is positioned within walking distance of both the capital and residential areas like Shaw. Before the end of 2015, the tentative plan is to add a 10th location, focused in NW D.C., but Segal declined to name the specific neighborhood where it would be based. \nCove’s offerings are also different from WeWork, Segal explained, because they’re designed to be more like “neighborhood productivity spaces.” The design is aimed at today’s “on-the-go, always-on” consumer, the company says. What exactly does that mean? \nThe Cove co-founder and Harvard alum said that Cove memberships are largely cheaper and more flexible than WeWork in addition to being a natural extension of neighborhoods—less like an office and more like a coffee shop. “neighborhood productivity spaces\" \nCove doesn't offer private office spaces, individual desk plans or other membership-specific amenities, it’s all open space without tiers. And it layers these services overtop a social media-esque app experience that can connect users in realtime. \nIn essence, the iOS/Android Cove app showcases public, member profiles by providing an avenue to share basic personal information. Members use a QR code displayed from the app to sign-in for sessions. The other major component of this app is that it can track, with user consent, where users are spread between locations, making it easier to network and work with the same people consistently. \nFor reference, WeWork sells $45 per month memberships for access to common areas, up to $400 per month for “desks” and up to $625 per month for offices. Cove’s whole membership structure is different, so it’s difficult to compare, because there is the option of paying for just a chunk of time or per hour. Also like WeWork and UberOffices, another D.C. competitor, Cove sells an unlimited monthly membership option. Cove’s prices range from anywhere between $59 and $249/mo. depending on usage and plan. \n“Cove is accessible, open and convenient, we want our spaces to be part of people’s daily routine—somewhere between the gym, a meeting or an appointment,” Segal told DC Inno. \nIn May, Cove raised a $2.8 million Series A round led by a group of unnamed angel investors and institutional funds in the retails space. Extras \nDC Inno got a sneak peek into the new Chinatown Cove, prior to its completion and we have a few photos to share. These images of the space are before any build out occurred. Right now, Tandem Legal Group occupies the space, so you'll see their brand and setup.
