(Photo: Zak Neumann/For the Des Moines Register) \nDavenport — In the last two weeks, Bernie Sanders has danced on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" joked about his oft-disheveled hair and lightheartedly discussed his \" ample supply of underwear. ” \nOn \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" he did a spot-on impersonation of Larry David, who has won widespread praise for his own recent impersonation of Sanders on “Saturday Night Live.” \nAnd on Friday evening, Sanders was set to headline a rock concert with a lineup of a dozen artists in front of a crowd here of more than 2,000 supporters. \nWhile it might seem like standard politicking, it's a softer side for the usually all-business Vermont senator. The candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has long eschewed personality politics and has criticized the mainstream media for covering politics like entertainment, rather than focusing on issues. Sanders slams press, says focus should be on middle class \n“He definitely comes off as this kind of gruff, grandfatherly guy. But that’s part of his whole appeal,” said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University professor and an expert on pop culture and television. “Yes, he comes off as harsh, but his harshness isn’t directed at a bunch of kids cutting through his lawn. His harshness is directed at governmental institutions and politics that many people are clearly upset about.\" \nExperts say Sanders may be working to soften his image — a fine line to walk for a candidate who has become beloved for his high-octane policy speeches and unvarnished appearance. \nThompson said Sanders is the second most interesting character in the race right now, next to Republican candidate Donald Trump. The senator plays well on television, Thompson said, and his recent talk show appearances, along with the first Democratic debate, are all working to expand his reach beyond hardcore supporters. \n\"I think what's happening is he is kind of growing into the character that the world seems to have created for him,\" Thompson said. \nThe Sanders campaign says it isn't doing anything differently and that Sanders isn't trying to alter his image. \n\"Bernie is going to be Bernie. There is no version 2.0 or 3.0,\" said Robert Becker, the campaign's Iowa director. \"He's the original, authentic and he’s been this way forever.\" \nIt's simply that as Sanders' poll numbers have gone up, so too have his interview requests and television invitations. The latest Des Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll shows his support at 41 percent among likely Democratic caucusgoers — up six points from two months ago. He trails front runner Hillary Clinton by 7 points Iowa Poll: Clinton up by 7, but gap tightens \nFor their part, Sanders' supporters seem to like him just the way he is. \nShasta Worthington, a 34-year-old Des Moines independent, said Sanders isn't grumpy — he's angry. Worthington, a disabled Navy veteran who works at VA Central Iowa Healthcare System, said she's drawn to Sanders' authenticity and consistency. \n\"I think it’s a good thing because so many people are fed up. They start to see that passion in him,\" she said. \"If he were just polished like Hillary Clinton, people wouldn't be able to relate to him. They need that passion, that fire.\" \nJohn Deeth, an Iowa City Democrat who blogs about politics, has attended a handful of Sanders' events this campaign cycle. He was on hand for Sanders’ appearance last weekend at the Johnson County Democrats Fall Barbecue. Deeth said he's noticed a slight softening of Sanders’ demeanor. \n“He’s still almost all issues, issues, issues and very intense,” Deeth said. “There’s occasional personal references now. You know, he acknowledges having grandchildren, which for Bernie is really getting to the gut.\" \nSanders will shake a few hands and snap selfies after campaign events. But with hundreds of people at even his smaller events, there isn't much room for one-on-one politics. But Deeth, who isn't publicly supporting a candidate this year, said Sanders doesn't necessarily have to worry about those personal interactions. \n”I think his appeal is all about the ideology and the issue branding. I think the people who are drawn to him are people who have a different expectation. They’re explicitly rejecting the politics of personality.\" \nThat likely allows Sanders to get away with more than some other candidates. \nJennifer Lawless, a professor in American University's School of Public Affairs, said a candidate's anger or grumpiness would generally be a liability. \n\"But the thing that offsets that a little bit is that it does seem quite real,\" she said, \"especially given people’s reaction to Hillary Clinton, which is that she’s a little bit too staged and a little bit too strategic in how she comes across. Sanders' juxtaposition, I think, is very salient to voters.\" \nSanders can do well with joking around on talk shows or playing up his \"SNL\" portrayal, Lawless said, so long as he isn't hamming it up too much. Overexposure can sometimes appear desperate. \n\"If he dances on 'Ellen' and it seems like he’s genuinely having fun, that’s fun. The problem is when it looks like candidates are doing anything they need to do and being anything they need to be to appeal to voters. And I don’t think people think that about Bernie Sanders,\" she said. 'We're not superstars' \nOn Friday afternoon, \"Bernie's All-Star Band,\" an ensemble of a dozen artists, rehearsed for the evening's performance at the Adler Theater in downtown Davenport. The group was planning an acoustic set, followed by a speech from Sanders and a later electric jam set. \nJill Sobule, a singer-songwriter best known for her 1999 single \"I Kissed a Girl,\" said she's been a Sanders fan since long before he announced his presidential bid in April. She said she was enthused by Sanders' ability to draw new people into the political process with his progressive agenda. \n\"He's like my old Jewish grandpa and he's invigorating a younger generation,\" she said Friday. \nIn some ways, she said, the collection of guitarists, drummers and singers were a fitting tribute to Sanders' populist message. \n\"We're not superstars,\" she said. \"We're working artists.\" Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1S1ABzP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:54:48.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
