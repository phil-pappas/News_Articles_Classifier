The issue has arisen in the wake of Russia’s air operations over Syria and growing global suspicion that the US itself has played a key role in arming, funding, and intentionally perpetuating the terrorist army across Syria and Iraq.\nABC News in their article, “US Officials Ask How ISIS Got So Many Toyota Trucks,” reports:\nU.S. counter-terror officials have asked Toyota, the world’s second largest auto maker, to help them determine how ISIS has managed to acquire the large number of Toyota pick-up trucks and SUVs seen prominently in the terror group’s propaganda videos in Iraq, Syria and Libya, ABC News has learned.\nToyota says it does not know how ISIS obtained the vehicles and is “supporting” the inquiry led by the Terror Financing unit of the Treasury Department — part of a broad U.S. effort to prevent Western-made goods from ending up in the hands of the terror group.\n“This is a question we’ve been asking our neighbors,” Faily said. “How could these brand new trucks… these four wheel drives, hundreds of them — where are they coming from?”\nNot surprisingly, it appears the US Treasury is asking the wrong party. Instead of Toyota, the US Treasury’s inquiry should have started next door at the US State Department.\nJust last year it was reported that the US State Department had been sending in fleets of specifically Toyota-brand trucks into Syria to whom they claimed was the “Free Syrian Army.”\nUS foundation-funded Public Radio International (PRI) reported in a 2014 article titled, “This one Toyota pickup truck is at the top of the shopping list for the Free Syrian Army — and the Taliban,” that:\nRecently, when the US State Department resumed sending non-lethal aid to Syrian rebels, the delivery list included 43 Toyota trucks.\nHiluxes were on the Free Syrian Army’s wish list. Oubai Shahbander, a Washington-based advisor to the Syrian National Coalition, is a fan of the truck.\n“Specific equipment like the Toyota Hiluxes are what we refer to as force enablers for the moderate opposition forces on the ground,” he adds. Shahbander says the US-supplied pickups will be delivering troops and supplies into battle. Some of the fleet will even become battlefield weapons..\nThe British government has also admittedly supplied a number of vehicles to terrorists fighting inside of Syria. The British Independent’s 2013 article titled, “Revealed: What the West has given Syria’s rebels,” reported that:\nSo far the UK has sent around £8m of “non-lethal” aid, according to official papers seen by The Independent, comprising five 4×4 vehicles with ballistic protection; 20 sets of body armour; four trucks (three 25 tonne, one 20 tonne); six 4×4 SUVs; five non-armoured pick-ups; one recovery vehicle; four fork-lifts; three advanced “resilience kits” for region hubs, designed to rescue people in emergencies; 130 solar powered batteries; around 400 radios; water purification and rubbish collection kits; laptops; VSATs (small satellite systems for data communications) and printers.\nIt’s fair to say that whatever pipeline the US State Department and the British government used to supply terrorists in Syria with these trucks was likely used to send additional vehicles before and after these reports were made public.\nThe mystery of how hundreds of identical, brand-new ISIS-owned Toyota trucks have made it into Syria is solved. Not only has the US and British government admitted in the past to supplying them, their military forces and intelligence agencies ply the borders of Turkey, Jordan, and even Iraq where these fleets of trucks must have surely passed on their way to Syria – even if other regional actors supplied them. While previous admissions to supplying the vehicles implicates the West directly, that nothing resembling interdiction operations have been set up along any of these borders implicates the West as complicit with other parties also supplying vehicles to terrorists inside of Syria.\nGeneral Keane: Hitler-like Putin is a thug; We should bomb the Russian airbase in Syria!\nWarhawks: U.S. Officially in “Proxy War” with Russia, Putin Is the New Hitler\nU.S. Secretary of State Ashton Carter whines about Russia’s “unprofessional behaviour”\nReport: Saudi Arabia increasing weapons supplies to foreign-backed militants in Syria\nDeadly trail left by retreating Syrian jihadists in Bahsa village\nIraqi Forces Advance on IS\nIraq War: Army finds ‪American‬ parachutes, supplied ‪ISIS in ‪Baiji‬ oil refinery 10/10/15\nURGENT: Hezbollah Commander Killed in Syria’s Idlib\nA ranking Hezbollah commander was killed during the clashes in Northwestern Syria on Saturday.\nSenior Hezbollah Commander Hassan Hossein al-Haj, also known as Abu Mohammad al-Eqleem, has reportedly been killed during the heavy fighting in Idlib countryside today.\nReports said the commander was accompanying the Syrian army troops in an operation to win back the town of Mansoureh in Sahl Al-Qab region near Hama province.\nIdlib is the scene of heavy fighting between the Syrian and Hezbollah troops who are backed up by the Russian air force and the terrorists who have been occupying part of the province for the some long time now.\nEarlier today, the Russian bombers carried out precise attacks on militants’ positions and destroyed the Takfiri terrorists’ operations room in Idlib.\nThe Russian fighter jets hit a center of the terrorists in Khan Sheikhoun region in the Southern parts of Idlib four times and destroyed a five-story building that was the militants’ main base and arms depot as well.\nThe Russian Air Force also pounded the command center of militant groups in Idlib province today.

The Sukhoi Su-34 and Su-24SM planes destroyed 60 terrorist targets,” Makushev said.\nThe intensity and effectiveness of airstrikes by Russian air force against the ISIL targets significantly increased in the past 24 hours, inflicting heavy casualties among terrorists.\nAccording to Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff, Lt. Gen. Igor Makushev, the Russian Sukhoi Su-34 and Su-25SM strike aircraft destroyed six command and communication posts, six ammunition and fuel depots, 17 training camps, three underground bunkers, 16 fortified positions, a vehicle repairs facility, 17 vehicles and two multiple-launch rocket systems.\nIn addition, directs hits by Russian KAB-500S precision guided bombs destroyed the headquarters of the Liwa al-Haqq terrorist group.\n“Radio intercepts confirm that this airstrike killed two IS(IL) high-ranking field commanders and about 200 terrorists,” the general said.\nRussia’s Sukhoi Su-25, Su-24M and Su-34 attack aircraft, with the support of Su-30 jets, commenced precision airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria on September 30, following a request from Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nAccording to the Russian Defense Ministry, since the beginning of the air campaign Russian air forces have carried out about 140 strikes against terrorist positions, including command centers, training camps and ammunition depots. Russian warships in the Caspian Sea fired 26 cruise missiles on ISIL targets on Wednesday.\nElsewhere, the Syrian army backed by the Russian warplanes continued offensives on Friday to break the siege of a strategic military airport in the Eastern countryside of the city of Aleppo.\nThe Syrian troops, backed up by the Russian airstrikes, took full control of the village of Al-Jaboul in the nearby areas of Aleppo’s Kowaires Military Airport.\nThe Russian warplanes launched several precision strikes on ISIL positions in Al-Jaboul village opening the path for the Syrian ground force to win back the village.\nThe ISIL terrorists have besieged the Kowaires airport for over 2.5 years now, but the airport itself is under the Syrian army’s control.\nThe Syrian army’s helicopters supply foodstuff and other needs to the Syrian troops defending the airport.\nMeantime, military sources said that the Syria army has shot down the terrorist groups’ spy drone in Beit Hleibiyeh in the Northern countryside of Lattakia.\nA hostile surveillance aircraft operated by the terrorist groups was shot down by the Syrian troops as it was flying over the coastal province of Lattakia, the sources
