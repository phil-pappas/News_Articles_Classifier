Christmas Island, where almost 200 Kiwis are being held, is one of the worst, with a recent spike in self-harm and attempted suicides. \n\"If they were being held in any other foreign jail, I imagine Mr English would be somewhat concerned. \n\"As it is it’s taken almost a year for the Government to get off its comfy backside and start talking, and that’s only after publicity around these arrangements forced its hand. \n\"A comment here and a half promise there isn’t good enough. \n\"This is a human rights issue. Kiwis are getting a rough deal in Australia. Bill English should stick his reputation where his mouth is, get on a plane and sort it out.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:19:52.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
