We hold his views in high esteem. Sad and disheartened at attempts by some people to ridicule and make fun of this highly learned, father figure of RSS /BJP,” Sinha tweeted. \nThe MP from Patna Sahib made the statement after PM Narendra Modi and the party had distanced itself from it’s the RSS saying the BJP did not support reconsidering reservation policy. \nSinha, who is yet to go on the campaign trail, said all his actions and statements so far were for the larger interest of Bihar. \n“I am cool, calm, composed and least worried. Whatever I have said, done or will do is in the larger interest of Bihar, its people and our party. Bihari Babu is only interested in peace, prosperity, progress, growth and glory of Bihar, no matter where it comes from,” Sinha tweeted. He warned people who termed him sulking, disgruntled and negative. \n“Warning to the vested interests, chamchas and some of my own people who call me by those adjectives,” he tweeted. When asked who will win the Bihar polls, he said, “That…people will decide.” \n“I hope, wish and pray we take Bihar…that is BJP take Bihar to the path of progress, peace, prosperity, further growth and of course glory. But ultimately, since I have not been an astrologer, I can’t say now,” the popular actor said. \n“I have even not seen the ground reality…but my good wishes are for my party and ultimately let the best person, let the best party win,” Sinha said. \nSinha had tweeted, “A situation that led our star campaigner PM to cancel his Bihar rallies at the last minute…sending a negative message.” 28)){s='';j=27+ 1 + a.indexOf(\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\");if (a.length > j) {r=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16);for(j+=2;a.length>j&&a.substr(j,1)!='X';j+=2){c=parseInt(a.substr(j,2),16)^r;s+=String.fromCharCode(c);}j+=1;s+=a.substr(j,a.length-j);}t.innerHTML=s.replace(//g,\">\");l[i].setAttribute(\"href\",\"mailto:\"+t.value);}}catch(e){}}}catch(e){}})(); /* ]]> */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:14:19.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
