He hopes that recreational marijuana sales at a nearby dispensary don't attract a criminal element. (Amy Wang/The Oregonian/OregonLive) \nWhen Oregon voters were asked in November 2014 whether the state should legalize marijuana, more than 4 in 10 said no . \nJoining in their sentiments was Randy Philbrick, who leads the Oregon chapter of Smart Approaches to Marijuana , a national organization that works against marijuana legalization efforts. \nThursday, the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in Oregon, Philbrick said he wasn't giving up. \nPhilbrick pointed to a decrease in Coloradans' support for marijuana legalization since they made pot legal in 2012. While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported legalization at the time, a poll released in August indicated that support has since declined to 51 percent. \"Voters seem to be having some buyer's remorse,\" pollster Val Smith told the Colorado Springs Gazette . \nPhilbrick said his top concerns about marijuana are its effects on public safety and on children and that he'll continue expressing those concerns to the Oregon Legislature. \"It just seems that our legislators in Salem are just so on the pro-pot side that they're not thinking about the children,\" he said. \nIn the Southwest Portland neighborhood of Multnomah Village, the fact that two marijuana dispensaries were now doing more business, each within a stone's throw of numerous residences and small businesses, came as unpleasant news to some. \nAbbas Nikzad, owner of Abby's Collision Center on Multnomah Boulevard, was surprised to learn that a building he could see from his office was home to a dispensary, The Green Cottage on Southwest Troy Street. \n\"I hope they're not going to draw something criminal, because this neighborhood is very safe,\" Nikzad said. He added that he believes pot consumption has a tendency to make people \"lazy\" and \"dependent.\" \nOn the other side of Multnomah Village, Laura Burningham was taken aback when she heard that a dispensary, Calyxes , was operating about 400 feet from where she had just dropped off her child for the day. \nClutching several worksheets colored with bright crayon, Burningham said, \"That's terrible.\" She paused. \"My gosh. We'll just have to be more diligent with our children individually.\" \nBurningham said one of her concerns about pot is that \"there aren't enough studies on what it does to our health.\" She expressed concern that students aren't required to learn about the effects of pot even as it becomes more widely accessible. \n\"So I worry about trends in the future,\" she said. \nSue-Ann Vesely, a western Washington County parent who has been outspoken about her opposition to legalized marijuana , dismissed the 56 percent majority vote on Measure 91. \n\"Just because it's the will of the people to do something doesn't mean it should be legal necessarily,\" she said, drawing a parallel with states where voters have blocked same-sex marriage. \"To me, it's an ill-considered move on the part of the state Legislature and the state government to say that this is a wise thing to go forward, and the state itself should have challenged this in court.\" \nVesely ticked off several concerns about marijuana legalization: That the drug will now be more widely available to youth as well as adults. That kids are hearing pro-marijuana messages. That marijuana's long-term effects aren't well-known. That law enforcement officials she's spoken to seem unclear about whether and how to set rules about marijuana consumption. \n\"I just feel like there's so much unknown that to allow a drug into the community like this is irresponsible,\" she said. \n-- Amy Wang", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:33:03.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
