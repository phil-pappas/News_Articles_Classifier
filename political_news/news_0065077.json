Many migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa expressed bewilderment and disappointment because they had been told as they began their journeys in Turkey that the hard part would end once they reached EU countries like Croatia and Slovenia. (AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\nAssociated Press Oct. 22, 2015 | 7:40 a.m. EDT + More By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press\nVIENNA (AP) â€” Fear that pent-up pressure could translate into violence by asylum seekers led Austrian police to open barriers Thursday at a crowded collection point. But any relief appeared temporary, with thousands more on their way in their search for safe haven from war and hardship.\nThe police move came just a day after thousands of migrants broke through police obstacles at the same collection center at the Spielfeld border crossing with Slovenia. This time, police said they removed barriers to relieve pent-up pressure that could have triggered violence among those waiting for transport to shelters.\nSome of those involved Thursday followed instructions and regrouped outside the barriers but many continued walking northward away from the border, police said. On the Slovene side, more than 1,000 migrants were waiting for entry, either to apply for asylum to Austria or to transit to other prosperous EU countries further north.\nThe flow of people over the so-called west Balkans route has shifted, with migrants now entering Croatia instead of Hungary after Hungary erected a fence along its border to Serbia. From Croatia, they move to Slovenia, which has struggled to deal with the increasing numbers.\nAuthorities there counted 12,616 people entering the country on Wednesday. The relatively small nation has said it can handle no more than 2,500 entries per day, and has accused Croatia of sending too many people through.\nIn Madrid, an EU People's Party congress urged swift action. \"The right to seek asylum must be respected for those in need of protection, while swift and effective return and readmission measures for those not qualifying must be put in place,\" said an \"emergency resolution\" adopted by the congress.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
