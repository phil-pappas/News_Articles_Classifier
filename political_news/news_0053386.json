Bernie Sanders and 18 percent for Vice President Joe Biden, who is still in the process of deciding whether he wants to undertake a third bid for the White House. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb took in just 1 percent, while former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. and Sen. Lincoln Chafee failed to register. In the previous CNN/ORC national poll of Democrats, Clinton picked up 42 percent to Sanders’ 24 percent. In the same survey, Biden took in slightly more last time, at 22 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:27:23.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
