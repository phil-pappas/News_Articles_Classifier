We will announce the date for this election at a later date, and I’m confident we will elect a new Speaker in the coming weeks.”\n>> Photos: John Boehner over the years   \n\n>> Sign up for the Dispatch Politics newsletter for all the latest news \n\nBoehner, a fastidious man who once listed his hobbies as “cleaning his apartment,” insisted Thursday that he wasn’t frustrated to leave behind a GOP caucus in disarray. \n\n“There’s never a good time to leave,” he said. “There’s always something hanging out there.” \n\nHe admitted that the Congress is far more polarized than it was 20 years ago. \n\n“The Congress reflects their constituents,” he said, “and as we’ve watched over the last 20 years people were getting hundreds of times more information about their Congress than they ever got before…it’s tended to pull or push people into one or two camps, leaving fewer people in the middle.” \n  \njwehrman@dispatch.com \n@jessicawehrman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:36:37.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
