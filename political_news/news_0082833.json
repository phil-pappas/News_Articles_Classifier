An arrogant and head-strong government has been forced to reconsider in the face of organised, sustained community opposition. There’s a lesson in that.\" \nMr McCourt says the Turnbull Government’s commitment to only shelve the policy ‘until after the next election’ shows the fight is not over. \n\"We congratulate our Aussie counterparts. Now that fee deregulation is dead in the water, it’s important that the pressure is kept up to bury it. We stand in solidarity with Australian students in that battle.\" \nMr McCourt says with student debt mounting on both sides of the ditch, student groups in New Zealand were just as prepared to fight to defeat any moves to deregulate New Zealand tertiary fees or reimpose crippling interest on student loans. \n\"The Australian and New Zealand public share a deep commitment to equality of opportunity. We believe education should be everyone, not just those whose parents can pay no matter the cost. Attack equality of opportunity at your peril.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:25:25.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
