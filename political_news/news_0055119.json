Their combined budget deficit over the next five years will exceed US$1tn, he said, as oil prices have plunged to about US$50 a barrel from about US$115 in June 2014, pressured by oversupply and weak demand.\n\"Most people today believe that oil prices may come up a little bit from where they are today...By 2020, we are expecting to see oil prices in the lowand mid 60s rather than the numbers they were used to,\" said Ahmed. \"That means that most of these countries will need to undertake a process of sizeable and sustained adjustment on the fiscal side.\"\nThose adjustments should include finding ways to cut public spending and diversify income away from oil, said Ahmed, pointing mainly at the need to cut subsidies and reduce the public sector wage bill. \n\"Most nationals of the GCC countries work in the public sector, and that's a model that has to change over the next few years,\" he said. \nAhmed applauded a recent move by the UAE to lift subsidies on fuel as a 'good example' for other GCC countries. \nCapital spending on projects should also be moderated with the focus on efficiency. \"Capital spending has increased a lot in many of these countries. Some of these projects are already being slowed down; others are being postponed. But in all cases you can look at the efficiency,\" he said. \nAs for income diversification, Ahmed said GCC countries, known for their low-taxation systems, could look at taxing consumption to raise revenues outside the oil sector. \n\"There are difficult choices ahead. But it is important to set out for each country what they want to do in each of these areas and to lay out a medium-term plan,\" he said. \n\"GCC countries have very wisely built up financial savings during the time when oil prices were high. That puts them in a very strong position today to face the shock of the magnitude of lower oil prices that we are seeing today,\" said Ahmed. \nThese countries should use these some of those financial buffers 'to make the process of adjusting to new oil price more gradual, [and] take more time to do it'. \nÂ© Muscat Daily 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:11:58.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
