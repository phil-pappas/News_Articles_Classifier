All but two of the 24 states filing challenges are led by Republicans. They deride the plan as an illegal overreach that will kill coal mining jobs and drive up electricity costs.\nThe Obama administration and environmental groups counter that the rules are needed to cut carbon emissions while curbing the worst impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. They also say the plan will spur new clean-energy jobs.", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:47:39.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
