No ifs, ands or buts about it, Gunn said. It needs to be a Republican or the member would have as much influence as a donkey at the Kentucky Derby. Gunn warned attendees at the Neshoba County Fair back in August that to send a Democrat House members to Jackson would mean “your district has no influence in the direction of the state. Your district has no influence on shaping policy.” Republican House members throughout the state are running on that theme.
