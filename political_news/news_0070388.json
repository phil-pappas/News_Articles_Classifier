Courtesy of Zachary King When Sundiata Bronson graduated from the Minneapolis Police Department Recruit Academy in 2009, a career among those of the thin blue line represented a fresh start for the then-26-year-old. A steady paycheck in a respected profession also meant he could forget about his money woes, as evidenced by being served with two eviction notices the previous year.\nTwo years into the job, Bronson earned the department's \"Lifesaving Award,\" a commendation \"for acts that contribute to the saving of a life.\"\nAt the time, no one knew that the hero would end up being outed as a sadist who'd cost Minneapolis taxpayers more than $500,000.\nEarly in the morning on June 18, 2012, Zachary King was walking on a downtown Minneapolis sidewalk toward his car. A handgun was tucked in a holster beneath his shirt. King had a permit to carry the weapon.\nA handful of Minneapolis police officers were nearby. “Hey you! What’s that bulge under your shirt?” one asked.\nKing stopped, slowly raised both his hands, and said, “I have a conceal and carry permit. That’s my gun,” according to court records.\n<div Officer Joshua Stewart pushed King hard against a wall. King again reiterated he had a legal permit to carry.\nStewart pulled the weapon off King's person then yelled “Gun! Gun! Gun!”\nThree other officers, including Bronson, took him to the ground and started hammering away.\n\"Throughout the beating, … King continued to tell the Officers that he had a permit to carry in his wallet, but the Officers ignored,\" records read.\nThe pummeling stopped after officers pulled out King's wallet and retrieved the gun permit.\nThe beating required that King be taken to Hennepin County Medical Center by paramedics. Stewart and Bronson also went to the hospital. When medical personnel began snapping photographs of King's injuries, Bronson tried to get them to stop.\nKing was hauled off to the Hennepin County Jail, where he was booked with obstruction of justice. All charges against him were ultimately dismissed.\nSix months later King filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and four officers. Stewart and Bronson were named as instigators.\nThe city attorney decided that a settlement was better than duking it out in court. Last week, the Minneapolis City Council agreed to pay King $122,000.\nIt was hardly the first big pay out that Bronson, who quit the police force last year, has cost the city.\n<div class=\"ads middle placeholder\" data-vmg-track=\"2nd ad\" data-vmg-ad=\"Middle\" data-vmg-format=\"lazy\"></div>His MPD career spanned not even five years. However, in just the past two, the city has come to the table to settle six brutality lawsuits involving Bronson, which have cost Minneapolis almost $521,000. A seventh case is pending.\nRepeated messages left at Bronson's Blaine home were not returned.\nBronson's life appears now to have come full circle. His financial woes from years past have been resurrected. According to Anoka County property records, his house was foreclosed upon earlier this year before being auctioned off in August.\n</div> <div class=\"article-footer\"> <ul> <li class=\"em em-a\"> <span class=\"legend\">Contact: </span><a href=\"/about/contact?author=6524189\" title=\"email\">Cory Zurowski</a> </li> <li class=\"legend\">Follow:</li> <li class=\"tw tw-a\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoryZurowski\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"twitter\">@CoryZurowski</a> </li> <li class=\"fb fb-s\"> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/citypages\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"facebook\">City Pages</a> </li> <li class=\"tw tw-s\"> <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/citypages\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"twitter\">City Pages</a> </li> </ul> </div>", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/CoryZurowski"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:37:11.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
