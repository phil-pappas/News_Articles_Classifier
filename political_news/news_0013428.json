(\"NuGene\") (OTCQB: NUGN), a developer, manufacturer and marketer of advanced skin and hair care lines utilizing adipose derived human stem cells and stem cell media, announced today that it has filed additional provisional patents to extend the intellectual property around its proprietary stem cell formulations.\nThe Company has filed two provisional patent applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for inventions relating to electro-active dressings and bandages. These include inventions combining electro-active sterile dressings and NuGene's proprietary human adipose derived stem cell culture media.\nHuman adipose-derived stem cells produce a variety of growth-promoting and healing materials such as growth factors and cytokines. Electro-active wound dressings produce local electric fields by providing electrical half-cells in proximity to treat the skin. Management believes that this innovative intellectual property may combine the benefits of the growth factors and localized electric fields to promote healing of wounds.\n\"Combining the effects of stem cell media with electro-active dressings may create a powerful new healing regimen,\" stated Dr. Sanjay Dhar , NuGene's Executive Director of Research and Development. \"The stimulation provided by electro-active dressings and the properties of human adipose-derived stem cell media may prove to effectively promote better and faster healing with less scar tissue. We believe that seeking protection for our applied research through the patent application process enhances the value of our intellectual property portfolio.\"\nSkin is the largest organ in the human body. Soon after it is damaged, the body's repair work starts as new skin tissue is formed. The proliferation and direction of growth factors and stem cells to the site is a key component of this process. NuGene is investigating the enhancement of healing by combining its proprietary stem cell media with micro-current electro-active dressings. The company intends to apply this technology to both medical and aesthetic fields.\nAbout NuGene International, Inc.\nNuGene International, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets proprietary regenerative cosmeceutical products based on adipose derived human stem cell and human stem cell media. The US Department of Health and Human Services calls regenerative medicine the \"next evolution of medical treatments.\" The regenerative medical market which includes cosmeceuticals and pharmaceuticals was estimated at $7.2 billion in the US in 2014 and is expected to rapidly grow in the coming years according to RNCOS Business Consultancy Service Global Cosmeceuticals Market report. NuGene's current cosmeceutical products and pharmaceutical products under development are based on proprietary stem cell based regenerative formulations derived from non-controversial, adult human stem cell derived media obtained from adipose tissue. NuGene's products combine its in-house advancements, proprietary technologies, and patent pending formulations. The company has four patents pending covering 15 unique applications. NuGene's goal is to leverage its knowledge and expertise to develop age defying cosmeceutical skincare and hair care products in addition to pharmaceutical products based on the same regenerative science platform.
