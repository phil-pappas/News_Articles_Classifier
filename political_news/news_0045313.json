They earn an estimated $8 an hour less than a comparable male-dominated job. \n“We look forward to working with the government to help put an end to discrimination against women who are underpaid simply because they are in workforces that are primarily female.” \nMore than six years ago the Department of Labour’s Pay and Employment Equity Unit found that education support staff were paid significantly less than a comparable male-dominated job. \nThe Unit was disestablished by the current government in 2009 but a number of pay equity cases filed by unions, notably the Terranova Aged Care case, have continued to advance the campaign for equal pay. \n“We are very confident our rights under the law are secure but have always believed that negotiating a way forward is a sensible approach.” \nHowever Louise Green says NZEI will pursue the case for education support workers through the Employment Court if progress is not made through the Working Group. \nends NZEI Te Riu Roa \nNew Zealand Educational Institute \nNZEI Te Riu Roa members work in every community in New Zealand, leading and advocating for quality public education.
