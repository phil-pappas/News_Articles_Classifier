The potential is certainly there, as under this new State statue, there is absolutely nothing to prevent it.\nBut first, the usual BS propaganda camouflage:\nTargeting California’s recent record-low voter turnout, Governor Jerry Brown on Saturday signed a measure that would eventually allow Californians to be automatically registered to vote when they go the DMV to obtain or renew a driver’s license.\nThe measure, which would also allow Californians to opt out of registering, was introduced in response to the dismal 42% turnout in the November 2014 statewide election.\nThat bill and thirteen others the governor signed Saturday, will “help improve elections and expand voter rights and access in California,” Brown’s office said in a statement.\nThe issue is not access or insufficient voting rights. In this country in 2015 it's grotesquely TOO easy to vote. Nor is “record-low turnout” something that can be “remedied” by eradicating whatever was left of the integrity of the California election system. Registering people to vote “indiscriminately” is not going to force them to the polls on Election Day. There are more holes in these labored justifications than a Swiss cheese the size of the Chrysler Building.\nHere , though, we start getting closer to the real motivations behind New Motor-Voter:\n[T]he Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to electronically provide to the Secretary of State the records of each person who is issued an original or renewal of a driver’s license or state identification card or who provides the department with a change of address , as specified. The person’s motor vehicle records would then constitute a completed affidavit of registration and the person would be registered to vote, unless the person affirmatively declined to be registered to vote during a transaction with the department, the department did not represent to the Secretary of State that the person attested that he or she meets all voter eligibility requirements, as specified, or the Secretary of State determines that the person is ineligible to vote . [emphasis added]\nThe first item is an awfully big net, and doesn't even attempt to pretend to limit this blizzard of State personal identification documentation to just U.S. citizens. Indeed, more than half of all California driver's licenses issued this calendar year-to-date have gone to illegal aliens – and now, they're illegal voters as well. The second gets the emphasis completely backwards, essentially creating an “honor system” where illegals have to volunteer the fact that they're illegals in order for State officials to nix their accompanying registration to vote – something that State officials have no intention of doing, or they wouldn't have enacted this obscene voter fraud-entrenching law in the first place.\nIn the words of Klingon War timeline Jean-Luc Picard, “They're not even bothering to cloak themselves” – other than to gratuituously insult our intelligence:\n“The New Motor Voter Act will make our democracy stronger by removing a key barrier to voting for millions of California citizens,” [California Commissar of State Alex] Padilla said Saturday. “Citizens should not be required to opt in to their fundamental right to vote. We do not have to opt in to other rights, such as free speech or due process.”\nCalifornia is removing a key barrier to voting for millions nationals who shouldn't have a right to vote at all. Citizens have every right right opt into or out of their “fundamental right to vote” – it's called staying home on Election Day, which more than half of California voters did last November. Perhaps the ruling Dems should have asked themselves instead why that was the case instead of trying to force universal voting, but then that's their base totalitarian instinct, which they couldn't overcome even if they had the slightest desire to do so. Due process can be opted into or out of as well, as citizens can waive that right. And free speech is something leftwingnuts don't believe in and wish to stamp out for anybody who disagrees with them in the slightest.\nIf there's any solace or consolation to be had from this story, it's that the Right isn't exactly losing any ground in the “bluest” State in the country expanding its electorate to all of Latin America. This far more constitutes “running up the score”.\nI still say the next step is a bill constructing a wall around Mexifornia – not to keep illegals out, but to keep everybody else in. So my advice to the denizens of the Gibbs Pocket and whatever other “red” enclaves might still exist down there: Get out while – and if – you still can. Because it's only going to get worse.", "external_links": ["http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article27528796.html", "http://politicalpistachio.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1461", "http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-gov-brown-on-motor-voter-bill-20150917-story.html", "https://www.vdare.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mexiforniadriverslicense.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:09:10.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
