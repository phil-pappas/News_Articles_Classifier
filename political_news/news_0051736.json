Hillary Clinton believes that it is important to engage a range of people on policy.\"\nClinton has made police reform a priority in her presidential campaign. Her first speech as a candidate was on addressing police brutality with body cameras and in July, Clinton told a largely black audience in South Carolina that it is time for the United States to confront \"systemic racism.\"\nBut Clinton's overtures to the community of activists have not been universally well received. During an event outside St. Louis in June, the presidential candidate said, \"All lives matter,\" a phrase seen as a slight to the Black Lives Matter movement.\nClinton and Black Lives Matter activists also had a frank and at times tense discussion behind closed doors in New Hampshire in August. Though the activists appreciated Clinton meeting with them, they told reporters after that they never heard \"a reflection on (Clinton's) part in perpetuating white supremacist violence\" and that Clinton \"gave the answer she wanted to give.\"\nBut Clinton has not been the most targeted Democratic presidential hopeful to feel the brunt of Black Lives Matters protests. Seconds after Vermont independent senator Bernie Sanders took the stage at an event in Seattle in August, a dozen protesters from the city's Black Lives Matter chapter jumped barricades around the stage and grabbed the microphone from the senator. They eventually shut down the event.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:56:02.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
