The Heritage Foundation ranks representatives and senators on a scale of 1 to 100 and while the greatest high school wrestler in the history of Ohio, Jim Jordan (151 wins -1 loss), scores high only 2010 Colorado senatorial candidate now Congressman Ken Buck is rated 100. In the Senate Ted Cruz and Mike Lee also have perfect scores.\nCongressman Jordan has declined to run but as co founder of the House Freedom Caucus he would have considerable support on the right should he change his mind. Jeb Hensarling of Dallas also declined to run. Hensarling started his political career as an aide to the late Senator Phil Graham and could probably get the votes of the entire Texas Republican delegation should he reconsider giving him a considerable edge. Jason Chaffetz was briefly a candidate but withdrew and endorsed Ryan.\nDaniel Webster was elected to the House on the Tea Party wave of 2010. He has held sundry elective offices almost his entire adult life. He is a past Speaker of the Florida House of Representative and the longest serving legislator in Florida's history. One could make the case that he was part of the establishment but he is not part of the Washington establishment. He sponsored Florida legislation requiring that all women seeking an abortion must first be given an ultrasound. He and his wife home schooled their children long before it was fashionable and he is a distant relative of the nineteenth century orator of the same name.\nParenthetically the average Republican scored 68 on the Heritage scorecard. Boehner's rating is unavailable but Mitch McConnell's rating is 54. So why are House Republicans falling in line a behind prima donna RINO who promises not to try too hard to live up to the onerous obligations of the job? Hell, Peyton Manning probably wants Sundays off and a lifetime no cut contract too. It's hard to believe Congressional Republicans have not heard from the voters but after all if Ryan is good enough for Harry Reid and Luis Gutierrez he must be good enough for the rest of us.\nTea Party news on Twitter Subscribe to our Tea Party news RSS feed", "external_links": ["http://b4in.net/img/rss_sm.png", "http://twitter.com/TeaPartyBIN", "http://teapartyatperrysburg.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/feed://beforeitsnews.com/rss/0000000000000104.xml"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:30:56.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
