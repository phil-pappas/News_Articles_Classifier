She was able to help unite MÄori and PÄkehÄ to march together over land rights. But, she also raised awareness about the discrimination towards tÄngata whenua\", says Marama Fox. \nThe hikoi arrived at Parliament about a month after leaving Te HÄpua, bringing with them a petition signed by 200 elders and 60,000 other people. \nIt called for an end to selling MÄori land and the control of 1.2 million hectares of whenua that was in MÄori hands. \n\"This momentous hikoi publicised treaty issues that were impacting on the lives of tÄngata whenua and came at a time when Parliament was just passing legislation leading to the creation of the Waitangi Tribunal\", says Te Ururoa Flavell. \nThe MÄori Party Co-leaders say whenua MÄori will always be of paramount importance to tÄngata whenua. \nThey say its connection is fully expressed through the whakatauki, Te toto o te Tangata - he kai. Te oranga o te tangata - he whenua, which means the lifeblood of a person is derived from food. The livelihood of a people depends on the land. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
