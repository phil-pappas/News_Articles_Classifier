Photo: Julia Gillard's Twitter account.\nWhile the now-famous misogyny speech she directed at Mr Abbott once received a tepid and even belligerent reception at home, it is still being talked about and praised overseas.\nAdvertisement Ms Gillard (which was pronounced 'Gulard' by all the Americans at the event) was introduced by host and editor-in-chief of Glamour magazine Cindi Leive as the \"first and only woman\" to have served as Australian prime minister, for whom education was a true \"true passion\" and had been a focus of her time in office.\n\"And she is, by the way, fierce,\" said Leive, to the diverse audience of school girls and young women at Harlem's Apollo Theatre.\nTheron, right, laughs as Ms Gillard speaks during the panel discussion at the Apollo Theater.

It's a great speech, Google it.\"\nMs Gillard was at the Glamour -hosted event - which had a hashtag trending nationwide by lunchtime - in her role as chair of the Global Partnership for Education, an organisation which aims to expand access to education worldwide. The event had the air of a girl-power revival, with the crowd singing along to warm-up Beyonce tracks Flawless and Run the World before it kicked off.\nPower stage. @JuliaGillard @CharlizeAfrica @FLOTUS @PlanGlobal @cindi_leive #LetGirlsLearn @bustle pic.twitter.com/p681RsjH3W\n— Melissah Yang (@MelissahYang) September 29, 2015 Often criticised for a wooden manner during her time in Parliament, Ms Gillard appeared relaxed, warm and confident sharing the stage with Mrs Obama and Theron, cracking jokes and speaking passionately about poverty and education. Even her much-scrutinised outward appearance seemed liberated post-politics, dressed in a vibrant, fuchsia silk pantsuit.\nThere were several moments - such as when she was asked where how she dealt with obstacles in her own life and in politics - where she could have unloaded on former adversaries, but she didn't, though she did dispense some advice for dealing with critics.\nAsked what advice she would give to her high school-aged self she said: \"I'd certainly say to myself don't get the spiral perm.\"\n\"But I'd also say really nurture a sense of self, of who you are. We live in a world of instantaneous feedback, and often its instantaneous criticism. You don't have to be in a publicly exposed profession like politics to feel the sting of that… any girl could look at social media and see something very unkind said about them.\"\n\"So it's very important to work on who you know you are, rather than be buffeted around by these quick and harsh critiques.\"\nHer message was in step with her fellow panellists, which also included teen advocate for Plan International Nurfahada, who all encouraged girls in the audience to be confident, to take their education seriously and to do what they could to promote the cause of educating girls around the world, and eradicating poverty.\n\"Do not take your education for granted—there is a girl that would love to be in your place\" —FLOTUS #62MillionGirls pic.twitter.com/goVrJq0pRM\n— The First Lady (@FLOTUS) September 29, 2015 Mrs Obama, who was given a genuine rock star welcome by the crowd, l aunched a campaign called '62 Million Girls' over the weekend , drawing attention to the number of girls around the world who cannot attend school.\n\"For me this is personal,\" she said. \"When I think about those 62 million girls who aren't in school, I think about myself, I think about my daughters… I think about where I would be in my life if I didn't work hard in school, and have the opportunity to go to college, to law school. I wouldn't be here.\"\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CharlizeAfrica", "https://twitter.com/cindi_leive", "https://twitter.com/bustle", "https://twitter.com/JuliaGillard", "http://t.co/goVrJq0pRM", "https://twitter.com/PlanGlobal", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/tony-abbotts-ray-hadley-interview-shows-exactly-why-hes-no-longer-prime-minister-20150928-gjwy43.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax", "https://twitter.com/FLOTUS", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOPsxpMzYw4", "https://twitter.com/FLOTUS/status/648890664080572416", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetGirlsLearn?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/62MillionGirls?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MelissahYang/status/648887290333409280", "http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/28/malala-and-michelle-obama-announce-global-girls-education-initiative-at-music-festival-in-new-york/", "http://t.co/p681RsjH3W"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:17:21.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
