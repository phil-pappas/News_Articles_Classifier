Reasonably questions, reasonably answered. Won't damage either JC or DC. JC does not rise to bait.\"\n:: What was the main theme? \nThe economy - and welfare.\nMr Corbyn was straight out of the box with a question from single mother Kelly, who will lose tax credits when the cuts hit in April. Kelly's question was: how much will I lose in tax credits?\nMr Cameron replied with this stock answer on this subject: people will be £20 a week better off because of the new National Living Wage.\nMr Corbyn: Kelly will lose £1,800 a year from April.\nHe said he had 2,000 questions about tax credits from the public.\nMr Cameron hit back with jibes about the Labour U-turn on the fiscal charter. ( On Tuesday, the shadow chancellor moved from backing George Osborne's plan to run a budget surplus by 2019/2020 to not backing it . Has subsequently confessed to \"confusing Labour MPs\").\nThe Prime Minister aimed some five jibes at Mr Corbyn on the same subject, saying that Labour policy now appeared to be about \"borrowing forever\".\nMr Corbyn did not bite. However, he didn't answer the question either.\n:: Best zingers? \nNothing amazing but...\nMr Corbyn asked a question from Matthew, who cannot get on the housing ladder despite earning a reasonable wage. There was laughter from the Government benches.\nMr Corbyn said: \"This might be funny to some people but it's not funny for Matthew.\"\nAnd then there was Mr Cameron's response to SNP MP Angus Robertson question over whether the Government had learnt from the mistakes of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.\nMr Cameron said he could not remember a question with so many mistakes in it.\n:: Funny bits? \nWhen Mr Corbyn accused Mr Cameron of not answering questions, there was plenty of noise in the chamber. Mr Corbyn was asked to calm down and was accused of chuntering by Speaker John Bercow.\nThe response: \"I'm totally calm and have no intention chuntering.\"\n:: Anything else we should know? \nThat Call Me Dave biography made a reappearance when the Prime Minister was asked when he knew that Lord Ashcroft was a non dom. \nIt's a question he has refused to answer before and refused to answer properly again.\nHe did tell MPs he had got a free copy of the book.\nAnd as an aside, apparently Mr Corbyn's spokesman, Kevin Slocombe, was stopped from entering the chamber because he wasn't wearing a tie.\nHe hastily borrowed one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:02:45.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
