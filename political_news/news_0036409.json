AARP's Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers contest will begin on October 15 with the goal of encouraging people to recognize and reward caregivers – many of whom spend 18 hours per week providing care like bathing, dressing, preparing meals, administering medications, driving to doctor visits or paying bills – in small but meaningful ways.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7607231-aarp-caregivers/\n\"Caregiving may be one of the greatest expressions of love and it's woven into the lives of one in six adults,\" says AARP Family and Caregiving Expert Amy Goyer, author of the new book Juggling Life, Work and Caregiving. \"A staggering 40 million family caregivers provide support for loved ones and, as a caregiver myself, I know that the smallest acts of kindness – like holding a door for someone pushing a wheelchair, surprising them with flowers, or even taking a caregiver's dog for a walk – can be memorable moments in the life of a caregiver.\"\nKindness Contest to Help Family Caregivers\nMore than half of caregivers say they feel overwhelmed by the amount of care their family member needs. Through the Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers contest, AARP hopes that by encouraging people to show family caregivers small signs of support, it might encourage overwhelmed caregivers, free them up to have more time with loved ones they care for, or even give them personal time to relax and rejuvenate. Those sharing simple acts of kindness are encouraged to submit stories and a photo of their random acts to the contest website found at www.aarp.org/caregiverkindness . In March, AARP will select 12 winners who have made a meaningful difference in the lives of family caregivers. The winners will share a $10,000 prize.\n24 Hours Inside a Caregiver's World\nThe October issue of AARP The Magazine is taking readers inside the hearts and homes of caregivers across the country. Through pictures, videos and compelling stories, readers will learn about ordinary people caring for spouses, friends, children, and parents. Some of the families featured live with the people they care for and one caregiver has to board a plane frequently to care for her mom.\nOverall, the face of caregiving is changing. While most caregivers are women, 40 percent of caregivers are men. Surprisingly, 1 in 4 caregivers is a Millennial (between the ages of 18 and 34) and 60 percent of caregivers provide care for an adult while working outside of the home, requiring them to balance caregiving and work responsibilities.\nVirtual Family Caregiving Fair\nTo help caregivers like the ones featured in AARP The Magazine , AARP is hosting a Virtual Family Caregiving Fair that will take place on Thursday, November 19, 2015 from 12pm – 4pm EST . From the comfort of a home or office, a caregiver can register and join the free fair online at aarp.org/familycarefair . During the virtual fair, a caregiver can tour the exhibit hall with over 15 booths showcasing various caregiving resources and programs, enter a \"mix and mingle\" lounge to connect with experts and other caregivers through online chats, visit a virtual auditorium to view scheduled and on-demand presentations and videos, and explore a library with additional resources for caregivers.\nFor more information about how AARP is supporting National Family Caregivers Month and for more caregiving resources, visit the AARP Caregiving Resource Center at http://www.aarp.org/caregiving .\nAbout AARP\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
