This incident is under investigation,\" Col Brian Tribus, a spokesman for US forces in Afghanistan said.\nUS forces conducted an air strike in Kunduz city at 2:15 am local Afghan time against individuals threatening the force, he said.\nIn a statement, MSF said latest casualty figures report nine people died and 37 people seriously wounded, of whom 19 are MSF staff.\nSome of the most critically injured are being transferred to a hospital in Puli Khumri, two hours' drive away, it said. Strongly condemning the air strikes, Doctors Without\nBorders also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in a statement said that all parties to the conflict, including in Kabul and Washington, were clearly informed of the precise location via GPS coordinates of the MSF facilities in Kunduz, including the hospital, guest house, office and an outreach stabilisation unit in Chardara northwest of Kunduz.\nMSF said it communicated the precise locations of its facilities to all parties on multiple occasions over the past months, including most recently on September 29.\n\"The bombing in Kunduz continued for more than 30 minutes after American and Afghan military officials in Kabul and Washington were first informed by MSF that its hospital was struck.
