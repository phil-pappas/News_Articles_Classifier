He had surgery Sept. 2.\nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March.\nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
