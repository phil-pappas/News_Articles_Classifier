(AP) â€” Indiana University said Thursday it has suspended the local chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity while it investigates a video purportedly showing a pledge performing a sex act on a woman during an apparent hazing ritual.\nThe university said the recording that surfaced on social media \"appears to be credible video evidence\" of the hazing allegations. In the video, the man in his underwear is surrounded by a crowd of shouting onlookers, some of them partially dressed.\nIU suspended the Bloomington campus' Alpha Tau Omega chapter while it investigates. It wasn't immediately clear whether any criminal charges would be pursued.\nUniversity spokesman Mark Land says the chapter's members can attend classes and aren't suspended from school.\nAlpha Tau Omega's national CEO Wynn Smiley said in a statement the organization is working with the university on the investigation of what he called \"a vulgar incident.\"\n\"The video is highly offensive and is antithetical to the values of Alpha Tau Omega,\" Smiley said. \"If confirmed, swift disciplinary action will be taken.\"\nThe university said the fraternity chapter was notified about the suspension Wednesday evening and that if the allegations were confirmed they would \"represent violations of the university's student code of conduct and will not be tolerated.\"\nLand said the university's student ethics and student life offices would be leading an investigation and that he didn't know whether the campus police department would be involved. The Monroe County prosecutor's office wasn't yet involved in the case, Chief Deputy Prosecutor Robert Miller said.\nThe fraternity chapter on the 38,000-student campus faced disciplinary action in 2010, when the national headquarters kicked out more than two-thirds of its members after an investigation into hazing and alcohol violations. Smiley said at the time that some members had an attitude that the fraternity's purpose was to be \"party central.\"\nIn June, the Indiana State University in Terre Haute suspended the fraternity for violations including providing alcohol to minors, hosting unauthorized events and tampering with fire-suppression equipment.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Indiana%20University%20suspends%20fraternity%20over%20explicit%20video&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Indiana%20University%20suspends%20fraternity%20over%20explicit%20video", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0ezo%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Indiana%20University%20suspends%20fraternity%20over%20explicit%20video"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:15.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
