On Saturday, October 24, 2015 the eyewear retailer and managed vision care provider will support the walk by enlisting key associates to promote and provide information on the importance of healthy vision for people living with diabetes at their station located at Huizenga Park. Throughout the festivities, walk participants can pick up informational material and special promotional coupons at the Visionworks Healthy Vision Station.\nVisionworks and Davis Visions' goal is to educate and encourage both children and adults to get annual eye exams in an effort to protect their eyes and overall health. According to the American Diabetes Association, the leading cause of blindness in working-age American adults is diabetes; however, most people do not realize that a yearly eye exam can uncover many other health issues including high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\"At Visionworks and Davis Vision, we're passionate about helping people maintain healthy vision throughout their lives. We want to raise awareness of how critical annual eye exams are for the nearly 30 million people who are living with diabetes in the U.S.,\" said Jim Eisen , president and CEO of HVHC Inc., and president of Visionworks. \"The Association's Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes provides a welcome opportunity to spread the message and help make a difference.\"\nVisionworks and Davis Vision's Focus on America community outreach program will participate in the Walk to Stop Diabetes in more than 25 cities throughout the U.S. to showcase support and help rally communities to join in the fight. The companies will also have associate teams walking at many of the events.\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Visionworks to our team as we 'Step Out' in honor of the 75 years of continuous progress in our efforts to improve the lives of all people living with and affected by diabetes,\" said Dawn Seay , Executive Director, American Diabetes Association Fort Lauderdale. \"In Broward County approximately 130,000 adults are currently living with diabetes. Our Step Out event recognizes the courage of local Floridians living every day with diabetes and the family and friends who support them. Step Out is an incredible opportunity to impact our local community, inspire healthy living, intensify our advocacy efforts and raise critical dollars to fund our mission.\"\nThe family friendly event will include music, food, kids' activities, local entertainment and most importantly, the company of those who are passionate about the fight against diabetes.
