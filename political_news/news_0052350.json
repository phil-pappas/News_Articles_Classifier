Photo: Andrew Meares\nFairfax Media has been told that some MPs raised objections in a meeting between Mr Truss and Liberal MPs including Paul Fletcher, John Alexander, Alex Hawke, Fiona Scott, Russell Matheson, Nickolas Varvaris, Craig Kelly and Louise Markus about the newspaper being dropped the story ahead of time.\nAdvertisement Mr Truss, whom one participant in the meeting described as an \"old-school politician, that's not his style\", gave an undertaking to hold the announcement until Monday.\nBut the decision did not please the hard-driving editor of the Telegraph , Paul \"Boris\" Whittaker.\nWarren Truss received praise for keeping his word. Photo: Robert Shakespeare\n​So over the weekend, Whittaker texted Mr Turnbull to request a rethink on the media blackout on the story.\nAs another Liberal source who was kindly disposed to the newspaper put it, \"they basically think of it as the Daily Telegraph airport\".\nThe Prime Minister obviously took the request seriously.\n\"They basically think of it as the Daily Telegraph airport\", a Liberal source said of the newspaper.\nStaff in his office hit the phones, calling back the MPs who attended Wednesday's meeting and asking them to reconsider their position.\nWasn't this a \"special case\" because the paper had been such a strong advocate for the airport?\nSome Liberals were willing to reconsider the decision, but in the end, nothing changed — the newspaper would miss out, and on Monday Mr Turnbull's office respected the wishes of the backbench, having seen first hand what can happen to a leader who does otherwise. Mr Truss and his colleagues duly made the announcement.\nSo why did some MPs object to the seemingly innocuous pre-briefing, which had been such a feature of the former Abbott government's media playbook?\nAs one Liberal MP put it, in the dying days of the Abbott government, Liberals grew fed up with learning about new government policies and initiatives that affected them and their voters in the Abbott regime's favourite mouthpiece.\nWhen controversial changes to citizenship laws were published in the newspaper before being approved by the cabinet, Mr Abbott was hit by a devastatingly detailed series of leaks from his cabinet .\n\"The era of pre-briefing without consent from or consultation with MPs is coming to an end. It got to be too much, policy announced in the Tele , and most of the colleagues got sick of it\".\nAnother colleague praised Mr Truss for keeping his word, and the Prime Minister's office for respecting the wishes of the backbench.\n\"The Tele has to understand it backed the wrong horse [Tony Abbott] and it won't always get its way from now on,\" one MP said.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cabinet-revolt-over-tony-abbott-and-peter-dutton-plan-to-strip-australians-of-citizenship-20150526-gh9q8y.html", "http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-nsw-news/storm-rolls-in-over-sydney-6959267.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/turnbull-government-leaves-door-open-to-badgerys-creek-rail-link-20151019-gkcnrs.html", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:56:05.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
