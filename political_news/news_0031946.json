It also outlines important laws that affect new arrivals, informing them of their rights and responsibilities as a refugee in Europe , and is available in multiple languages including Arabic, Pashto, Farsi and Greek. The site is already being accessed by refugees, is open-source and will remain in development as new services are added.\nDesigned and deployed by the IRC, with early support from Google, the scalable resource is built to be easily deployable to other countries along the route refugees take to northern Europe . Information in each case – managed and uploaded by local partners – will remain tethered to the geographic location in which the site is accessed.\n\"Smart deployment of technology can save lives. RefugeeInfo combines private sector thinking with the on-the-ground presence and experience of the IRC, to tackle the problem of misinformation facing refugees,\" said the IRC's emergency technology coordinator Rey Rodrigues . \"This site is a tool that allows us to reach more people with the best information as soon as it becomes available, offered on a low-bandwidth-accessible, battery-saving platform.\"\nRefugeeinfo.eu is currently online and in use in Lesbos, with plans to deploy the tool to the island of Kos, Greece next month.\nFor more information on the IRC's response to the refugee crisis visit here: http://www.rescue.org/refugee-crisis To download a screen shot of Refugeeinfo.eu visit here To view IRC's new video on winter arriving in Lesbos visit here To read IRC's Medium story on the top 10 questions refugees ask when they arrive in Europe visit here For information about the IRC's $35 million appeal visit here For further enquiries or to set up interviews with the IRC contact Tyler.Jump@rescue.org ( New York ) and Kulsoom.Rizvi@rescue.org (Lesbos), or call 646-761-0307.\nAbout the IRC\nThe International Rescue Committee helps people whose lives and livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster to survive, recover, and gain control of their future.
