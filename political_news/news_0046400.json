Already, seven other co-ops are folding – including a second one announced Friday in Colorado . \nThe insurer plans to pay its roughly 10,000 members' claims this year but not sell plans for next year, CEO Dawn Bonder said. She said the company wants to begin an orderly wind-down to \"make sure that we can pay the obligations we've incurred from 2015 and not leave people hanging.\" \nThe move was sparked by the recent news that the federal government was paying less than 13 cents on the dollar of an expected subsidy to help cover costs for insurers hit hard by claims. The decision will cost Health Republic $20 million between 2014 and 2014. \n\"We have to be sure that we have the capital to go forward and at this point in time I don't think we do,\" Bonder said. \nJust weeks ago Bonder had reassured members that the firm's finances were healthy. Three things have happened to change that, she said. \nThe first has to do with the \"risk corridor\" program that the federal government recently announced would pay far less than insurers had been promised. While Health Republic was prepared to deal with the effects on its 2014 finances, it is looking increasingly likely that regulators will not allow insurers to count on any of those funds in 2015 either, Bonder said. \nOther bad news came with the Oregon Insurance Division's announcement Thursday that the small group employer-based market would not be expanded as planned to include businesses of up to 100 employees. Health Republic had been counting on expanding its small group book of business. \nOn top of that, the rapid pace of failure of other nonprofit federal health insurer startups in recent weeks made Health Republic pessimistic about whether brokers would feel comfortable selling its 2016 policies. \nThe nonprofit received federal startup loans of more than $50 million. \nThis post will be updated later today. \n— Nick Budnick", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:54:07.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
