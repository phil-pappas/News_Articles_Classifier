Hastert led the House from 1999 to 2007, and it appears that neither the financial crime he’ll be copping to nor the “misconduct” he tried to keep secret occurred while he was speaker.\nThe 73-year-old Hastert was charged in May with violating banking law and lying to the FBI about withdrawals of more than $1 million. Prosecutors said the money was intended as “hush money” to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct against a man when Hastert was a high-school wrestling coach decades ago. The guilty plea would prevent Hastert from having to admit those past misdeeds, but it reportedly will not keep him out of prison.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/us/dennis-hastert-reaches-plea-deal-in-bank-withdrawals-case.html?action=Click&amp;contentCollection=BreakingNews&amp;contentID=52720254&amp;pgtype=article&_r=0", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/dennis-hastert-hearing-214813#ixzz3oav6p3zj"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:50:16.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
