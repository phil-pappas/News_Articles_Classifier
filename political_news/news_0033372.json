I will be voting to leave unless, at the very least, the Prime Minister secures the end of the supremacy of EU law.”\nUKIP MP Douglas Carswell said: “I look forward to building a campaign that has no interest in party loyalties and is focused on what is best for Britain and our friends in Europe.”\nThe In Campaign launches on Monday, and deputy director Lucy Thomas blasted the various pro-Brexit campaigners, saying they \"have spent all summer fighting\".\nShe added: \"They can’t even bear to be in the same room as each other, let alone agree what life outside Europe would really look like for Britain.\n“They cannot guarantee that British jobs would be safe outside Europe, or that prices wouldn’t rise. They have no idea whether we would retain our access to the world’s largest market, or how long it would take us to renegotiate free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe.\n“During this referendum campaign we will make the case that staying in Europe makes us stronger, while leaving would be a leap into the dark and a risk we can’t afford to take. We’re looking forward to setting out that case in the coming days.”\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Mirrorpolitics", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/Mirrorpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-09T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:29:50.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
