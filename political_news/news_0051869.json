The event marks the second time VSB hosted an HISE event and the ninth time the program has been delivered to a university in the Czech Republic . The program, sponsored by Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative, has benefited thousands of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) students and teachers around the globe.\n\"At VSB our goal is to develop collaboration across all sectors and encourage student interest in technology industries such as energy and IT,\" said VSB-Technical University Rector Ivo Vondrak . \"By providing our students the opportunity to learn from a Nobel laureate and interact with Honeywell engineers, we hope to energize and inspire today's students to become tomorrow's great leaders in engineering and science.\"\nFriedman was awarded the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics for proving the theory that extremely tiny components of proton, called \"quarks,\" are basic building blocks of nature.\nWith his discovery, \"our approach to particle physics changed forever,\" he explained to an audience of nearly 1,000 students, faculty and invited guests. After the talk, students and teachers interacted directly with the professor throughout the day.\n\"As a company that invents and manufactures leading technologies, our passion is to pursue innovative ways to make the world safer and more secure, and more comfortable and energy efficient,\" said Jiri Tomicek , Vice President and General Manager, Honeywell Technology Solutions (HTS), Czech Republic . \"Hosting programs like HISE is an important part of our goal to connect students to STEM-related careers so they can tackle the global challenges that all of us will face in the future.\"\nAs part of its STEM-related activities in Czech Republic , Honeywell closely cooperates with all Czech technical universities, with programs such as engineering lectures at Brno University of Technology, collaborative projects, student events, academic thesis opportunities, and internships.\nIn addition to its Nobel laureate program, Honeywell Hometown Solutions also supports STEM education in Czech Republic by inviting local middle school science and math teachers to attend the Honeywell Educators @ Space Academy and the Honeywell Green Boot Camp in the United States each year. Additionally, each year, middle school students from Czech Republic compete in the global Student Automotive Design Challenge (SADC), a co-sponsored program between Honeywell and SAE International, which provides teams of students with an assignment to research, design, test and build electric, gear-driven toy cars.\nProfessor Friedman is an Institute Professor and Professor of Physics Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\nAbout Honeywell Hometown Solutions\nThe Honeywell Initiative for Science & Engineering program is part of Honeywell Hometown Solutions , the company's corporate citizenship initiative, which focuses on five areas of vital importance: Science & Math Education, Family Safety & Security, Housing & Shelter, Habitat & Conservation, and Humanitarian Relief.
