( Reuters file photo ) I'm just an average guy from a small town in Pennsylvania. So there are not many muckety-mucks who want to hear what real America wants or thinks. The media spin everything to their agendas, hoping to tell U.S. what to think.\nIt's not going to happen anymore. \"We the people\" have found our voice, and we intend to use to shape the conversation, not to conform to another's view of our country or our faith.\nBut that is exactly why Donald Trump is such a mystery to these guys who above the rest of us with their condescending opinions and smirky remarks. The media stand in amazement that a non-politician such as Trump can garner such widespread support among so many American sub-cultures.\nThey are shocked that his numbers do not drop when he criticizes and argues so vehemently. \"He doesn't act like much of a politician,\" they say in stunned amazement. But that is the point. We don't want a politician. Therefore, we are not surprised when he does not act like one. They are surprised and horrified. Really? I want to hear the truth as a candidate sees it and not how someone spins it. Trump is not too \"spinnable.\"\nAfter the hours I have spent with him on two occasions I have made a few startling discoveries. Donald Trump is a nice guy. He is warm, engaging, teachable and personally very easy to talk to. His problem is that the average anchorman has no clue what a businessman is or does. He is \"on the jazz\" to make the deal and then is relaxed when it is over.\nBack in the days of the Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl Dynasty, their front line was called the \"Steel Curtain.\" The leader of this fearsome front line was \"Mean Joe Green.\" He was the toughest, meanest, scariest guy on the field. If you got within 30 feet of him, your knees buckled with dread. He won games and made the game exciting too.\nadvertisement But off the field, he was the nicest guy alive. Are we so sophisticated that we cannot tell the battle from the conversation that follows. Additionally, Trump knows who else is listening to his speeches and his interviews. He is drawing a red line that he will most certainly adhere to, and he wants everyone around the world to know he is drawing it.\nBut that is not to say he is excused for his gruffness toward his fellow candidates. The meeting I attended focused significant time on this very thing. Believers want a leader like him, but they also want a leader is in control of actions, thoughts and words. These points were made by several, and he agreed he had to back off, at least somewhat.\nHe is a believer in Jesus in the sense of the definition, not with the myriad of litmus tests that so many denominations put on a person. He believes Jesus is His Savior, reads his Bible and prays every day. He is pro-life, wants to defund Planned Parenthood and will stop the persecution of believers here in America. My favorite Quote: of his was: \"Christianity is under attack. It's time for Christians to stand up for themselves. I'll stand up for Christianity.\" I believe him.\nHe loves his country and certainly does not need the headaches of a presidential run. He wants a big wall to the south with a wide doorway. He believes in the strength of the American Dream and fully believes it is within the reach of anyone willing to work hard enough to see it happen for them.\nOne thing is certain. He may not be the leader every evangelical wants for this country, but he is the president we probably need.\nDon Nori Sr, along with his wife Cathy, founded Destiny Image Publishers Jan. 1, 1983.
