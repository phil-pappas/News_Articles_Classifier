Hall also confessed to stabbing Shaar’s 70-year-old wife, Linda, who survived the brutal attack. \nJurors in this year’s three other capital murder cases with the possibility of death penalty in Texas had given out life sentences without parole, the AP reported. \nLast year, 11 people were sentenced to death in the state. New death sentences in Texas have dropped nearly 80% since 1999, which saw the highest number of death sentences at 48, according to the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (TCADP). \nOver the past five years, 60% of all new death sentences have been imposed on African-Americans, according to TCADP. \nHall, who was 18 at the time of the crime, had confessed to killing Shaar and stabbing his wife in their College Station home, attributing it to his “killer instinct.” \nJurors on Wednesday listened to a 90-minute recording of Hall’s confession where he said he stabbed Shaar and then his wife, Linda, while she called police, The Eagle reported. He then confessed to shooting Shaar in the head at point-blank range and said he attempted to shoot Linda but the gun was jammed. He then stabbed her again. \n“I actually enjoyed it,” Hall said in the recording. “Not because they were defenseless, it was because the man put up a fight.” \nHall said he chose the couple’s house because it was “suitable” and the trees provided cover. Hall said he chose to attack the couple on a day when “the weather was nice” and had planned it for months. \n“I just want to die, and I am willing to kill for it,” Hall said in the recording. “I was never very motivated to live.” \nHall’s attorneys argued that he suffered a traumatic and abusive childhood at the hands of his adoptive parents, Karen and Wes Hall, KBTX.com reported.
