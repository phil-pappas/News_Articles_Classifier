O'Malley covered pop artist Taylor Swift's vengeful song to get back at another Democratic candidate for booking Katy Perry to sing at their Iowa Rally. \"Katy Perry, I'm told, is doing a like a benefit concert for one of my opponents in Iowa,\" the former Maryland governor told hosts of ABC's \"The View.\" The light-hearted attack was directed at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will have Perry sing at her \"Hillary for America\" rally in Des Moines, Iowa on October 24. Katy Perry + Hillary + YOU in Des Moines on October 24th.

Ahead of the first Democratic debate on CNN, O'Malley's campaign released a video of the candidate singing for a lucky supporter. Congrats Kathryn!
