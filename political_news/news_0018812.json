Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nBut the rub is that the ill-defined plebiscite approach he inherited from Abbott is not guaranteed to resolve the issue. This is because it was never articulated in any detail or subject to a proper process.\nAdvertisement Indeed, the suspicion of many marriage equality supporters was that it was conceived merely to put the issue off.\nWhen the plebiscite proposal emerged back in August, Turnbull made it abundantly clear that he considered it a bad idea.\nMalcolm Turnbull and Christopher Pyne listen to backbencher Warren Entsch introduce a private member's bill on marriage equality on August 17.

Photo: Andrew Meares\nWould, for instance, legislation be introduced after the plebiscite to legalise marriage equality if a simple majority of voters supported it? More importantly, would Coalition MPs be bound to vote in favour of such legislation? After all, an overwhelming majority opposed a free vote on the issue in August.\nOr would the legislation be introduced in advance of the election due next year, as suggested by Warren Entsch?\nFar better, Turnbull and many other supporters of marriage equality believed before the change in prime ministers, to have a free vote of the Parliament now, even if it was defeated. Soon enough, it would come back and the change would be endorsed.\nFor weeks, Labor has been trying to nail Turnbull on the differences between his convictions and the policies and the approaches of the Abbott government. Whether they were talking climate change or budget cuts, they failed. It has been like wrestling with smoke.\nThat changed on Wednesday when Clare O'Neil referred to Turnbull's support for a plebiscite and asked: \"Will the national result of the plebiscite be binding on Coalition members? Or will individual Coalition members be bound by the results in their individual seats? Or will the plebiscite not be binding on Coalition members at all?\"\n\"That is a very good question and I thank you for it,\" he replied. \"I think it is an absolutely reasonable request. The answer is that the consequence of a 'yes' vote in the plebiscite will be that same-sex marriage will be legal in Australia.\"\nNow, the onus is on the Prime Minister to articulate how this will happen. The knee-jerk response of Eric Abetz is a pointer to the degree of difficulty.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:08:08.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
