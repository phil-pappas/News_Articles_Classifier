In addition, some on the list have been contacted by intelligence officials telling them their information had been compromised.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has begun an investigation into the purported hacking, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe disclosed information may have included the government email addresses of 22 CIA employees, as well as those for numerous other high-ranking officials and people well-positioned in intelligence and national security agencies.\nIt also included apparently more personal contacts, such as staff members of a local school system, contacts at Washington-area summer camps, temporary Craigslist accounts, and even an email address that is sent when a buyer places an order with Pottery Barn.\nIf is conclusively established that the email list belongs to Mr. Brennan, it would mark a major embarrassment and one of the highest-ranking of a series of recent electronic breaches.\nThe CIA wouldn’t confirmed that the email list was the director’s. “We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities,” an agency spokesman said. He declined to comment further.\nPersonnel from agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Counterterrorism Center appear to have been included in the list of contacts from Mr. Brennan’s account.\nThis could mark the latest in a string of breaches of government servers and email accounts in the past year. Hackers have broken into the State Department server, stolen nonpublic details of President Barack Obama’s calendar, and obtained more than 21 million background security clearance forms held by the Office of Personnel Management.\nMr. Brennan’s personal email account, unlike those examples, wouldn’t be subject to government security protocols.\nThe apparent hackers tweeted Monday that “we are not doing this for personal satisfaction, we are doing this because innocent people in Palestine are being killed daily.” The Twitter account also used the hashtags “FreePalestine” and “FreeGaza.”\nLater Monday, the Twitter account posted a second batch of allegedly sensitive information, including what it claimed was a spreadsheet for 21 U.S. officials, including Mr. Brennan and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. That release included phone numbers, email accounts, dates of birth, and what appear to be Social Security numbers.\nSome of the birth dates listed are wrong, as one person was alleged to have been born in 2008 and another in 1905. But some of the other information appears to be accurate.\nThe phone number attributed to Mr. Brennan in the release went to voice mail and wasn’t answered.\nAmong those whose information was revealed was Donald L. Kerrick, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army. Gen. Kerrick answered a phone call to the listed number and said the release was dismaying.\n“Obviously it’s concerning, and you do everything you can to protect yourself,” Gen. Kerrick said. “But some things you can’t control, and this is one of those things you can’t control.”\nHe said he hadn’t spoken to Mr. Brennan in eight years and hadn’t been to the White House in 10 years. He described himself as semiretired.\nThe New York Post reported Sunday that a “teen stoner” claimed to have hacked into Mr. Brennan’s AOL account and accessed sensitive files, including his application for top-secret security clearance. The newspaper also reported that Social Security numbers and other personal information for numerous top intelligence officials were held in the account.\nAki Peritz, a former CIA analyst, said the hackers would likely face severe penalties if they are caught, regardless of age or intentions. “Posting the personal information of a senior government official and then bragging about it—you are going to have the full weight of the law come down on you,” Mr. Peritz said. “If these are actually teenagers, they have really messed up their life for a long time.”\nBefore joining the CIA in 2013, Mr. Brennan was Mr. Obama’s top homeland security adviser. He has spent his career in intelligence and national security posts.\nMr. Brennan has devoted new resources at the CIA to bolstering its digital capabilities, both to support CIA missions and to better protect the agency from cyberattacks. He has spoken about the “digital dust” that can trail CIA staff and the dangers posed by foreign spies when it comes to computer attacks.\n—Devlin Barrett and Adam Entous contributed to this article.\nWrite to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:46:27.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
