Scared of Jews?” the restaurant wrote in a Hebrew-language Facebook post . “By us we don’t have Arabs! But we also don’t have Jews… By us we’ve got human beings! And real excellent Arab hummus! And great Jewish falafel! And a free refill for every serving of hummus, whether you’re Arab, Jewish, Christian, Indian, etc.” \nTzafrir said that since posting the promotion and Facebook post on Oct. 13, Hummus Bar had served several tables with both Arabs and Jews. \nThe kitchen prepares kosher food, and therefore halal as well, meaning the only thing stopping observant Jews and Muslims is the desire to dine together on the hummus with stewed chickpeas and msabaha — warm chickpeas swimming in tahini. \n“If there’s anything that can bring together these peoples, it’s hummus,” Tzafrir said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:07:21.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
