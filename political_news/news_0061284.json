Mr Watson was met with cries of \"shame\" from the Conservative benches in the House of Commons when he failed to say sorry over claims against the former chancellor.\nInstead, he asked all MPs to examine their consciences, adding all politicians had \"presided over a state of affairs where children have been abused and then ignored, dismissed and then disdained - if anyone deserves an apology it is them\".\nMr Watson has faced intense criticism for his comments about Lord Brittan in relation to a police investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring.\nIn the days after his death, he used a line by one of the alleged victims describing the politician as \"close to evil as any human being could get\".\nOne woman's claim of rape from 1967 was examined by the Metropolitan Police but officers could not find evidence that would lead to further action.\nThe police wrote a letter of apology to Lord Brittan's widow apologising for not offering \"clarity\" over the status of their investigation sooner.\nLord Brittan, who was Conservative home secretary under Margaret Thatcher, died in January without being told that the case was dropped. \nPressure on Mr Watson is mounting with the release of a letter obtained by BBC's Panorama programme in which he wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions in May 2014.\nIn it he raised concerns that Lord Brittan's position had influenced the way the case had been handled.\nEarlier, in parliament, Mr Watson said: \"I understand MPs feel aggrieved Leon Brittan was interviewed by the police and they are angry with my use of language but I am sure they would also agree that when someone is accused of multiple sexual crimes by numerous completely unrelated sources the police have a duty to investigate, no matter who it is.\"\nHe added that the fight against sex abuse was \"not all over just because a few famous people have gone to prison\".\nThe comments came after Tory MP Nicholas Soames pressed Mr Watson to \"apologise for the way in which he has so vilely traduced the late Lord Brittan\". \nSky's Political Editor Faisal Islam said MPs had expected Mr Watson to say sorry after admitting on Friday that he should not have repeated the \"emotive\" phrase of an alleged abuse victim - but instead he seemed \"defiant\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:39:15.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
