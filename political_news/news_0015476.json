Even National Party backbenchers have openly complained about the state of rural broadband. Now Amy Adams is scrambling to sound as if the Government has a plan for rural New Zealand. \n\"$300 million has already been spent on a rural broadband scheme that has subsidised commercial networks but delivered little real value. It is doubtful that another $100 million will make a significant difference after the first $300 million proved so ineffectual. \n\"The new broadband target does not come with any extra funding or an actual plan to achieve it, so it’s likely to go the same way as National's other failed and forgotten 'aspirational' targets like closing the wage gap with Australia or increasing the proportion of exports to 40% of GDP. \n\"Rather than yet another glossy distraction, the Government needs to front up on the failings of its broadband schemes and devise workable and funded plans to deliver 21st Century connectivity to urban and rural New Zealanders this decade not the next, says Clare Curran. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:37:49.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
