Support from Democrats allowed it to pass 277-151; the next step is getting it to President Obama for his signature before the end of the day.\nStill, the vote is a sign of the brewing anger in the Republican Party over having to fund a private organization that provides abortions. Republicans opposed the bill 91-151.\nThe bill was opposed by House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., who is vying to be the next House majority leader. But it was supported by his opponent in that race, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., as well as the next expected speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 09/30/15 7:01 PM President Obama has promised to sign the bill, which will keep government operations funded until Dec. 11 at fiscal 2015 levels.\n\"This is a responsible measure that prevents a harmful government shutdown, while allowing time for a larger budget agreement to be completed,\" said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky.\nRepublican leaders allowed separate vote on a measure that would require the House Clerk to attach the defunding language to the spending bill. The defunding measure passed with Republican support, but it cannot clear the Senate thanks to Democratic opposition, which ends any chance of enactment.\nEven though the Planned Parenthood defunding measure has no chance of becoming law, Republicans pushed for passage in the wake of videos showing organization officials discussing the sale of fetal body parts.\n\"I realize this is a last-ditch effort,\" said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., the sponsor of the measure. \"But I believe we have to fight until the very end.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Israelis 'always sound cocky' Clinto replied to an email thread by saying Israelis \"always sound cocky — in the air and on the ground.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 09/30/15 6:49 PM All but three Democrats voted against it. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Ct., called the bill, \"a disgraceful right wing assault of reproductive freedom of American women.\"\nPlanned Parenthood provides health services for women as well as abortions and receives about a half billion dollars in taxpayer funding annually, mostly through Medicaid.\nRoby's measure would have required $235 million be redirected from Planned Parenthood to other federally approved health care centers.\nWith a short-term measure completed, congressional leaders will begin negotiating a measure that can last the remainder of fiscal 2016 and perhaps include a top-line budget number for 2017. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he is seeking a two-year deal, which would be optimal for Republicans entering an election year because it would help the avoid another spending showdown in the fall of 2016.\nDemocrats are seeking the elimination of spending caps required under the 2011 Budget Control Act. President Obama has proposed tax increases in exchange for doing away with the caps, but Republicans call that plan a nonstarter.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Kevin McCarthy 'strongly discourages' backdoor effort to revive Ex-Im bank McCarthy \"strongly opposes any effort to circumvent the committee process\" to revive the Ex-Im bank.\nBy Timothy P. Carney • 09/30/15 6:34 PM Democrats on Wednesday praised the short-term solution, but questioned whether the spending fight can be resolved on a long-term basis.\n\"This very short term continuing resolution avoids the more immediate crisis, but what is step two?\" Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., the top House Appropriations Committee Democrat asked. \"Are there any firm plans to begin negotiating the full year appropriations bills we should be passing today? I remain deeply concerned about the potential of us facing another government shutdown in December.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:18:53.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
