(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 4:36 p.m. EDT + More TORONTO (AP) â€” Texas Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre left Thursday's AL Division Series opener against the Toronto Blue Jays in the third inning after suffering an apparent back injury.\nBeltre could hardly run to first base after hitting an RBI single in the top half of the inning, and received attention from the trainer at first base.\nAfter Prince Fielder's inning-ending groundout, Beltre tried jogging to his position at third base but came out of the game, in obvious pain. Beltre appeared to be wiping away tears as he was helped off the field and into the dugout. He was replaced by Hanser Alberto.\nBeltre hit .287 with 18 homers and 87 RBIs this season. His two-out single in the third gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead over David Price and the Blue Jays.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
