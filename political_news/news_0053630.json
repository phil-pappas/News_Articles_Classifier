Davutoglu did not come to us with a coalition proposal,” Bahceli stated.\nThe MHP's election manifesto – called You Know Best, Turkey – is a five-pronged strategy focusing on social and administrative reforms, the economy, the struggle with poverty, counter-terrorism, and anti-corruption. Its slogan in the upcoming election will be: “Vote for the future of the country.”\nBahceli vowed that his party would “scrap the roots of separatist terror,” referring to the PKK. The MHP has been against the so-called ‘solution process’ which aimed to end the decades-long conflict between Turkish state and PKK terror organization through peaceful means.\nThe party has vowed to employ an average of 700,000 young people every year as well as to hire a total of 120,000 teachers in 2016.\nIt also vowed to pay 1,400 Turkish liras ($467) twice a year to retired people and cap the price of oil for farmers.\nOn foreign policy, Bahceli said the aim of the party is to ensure peace and stability in the region and to strengthen relations with neighbors.\nThe MHP plans to improve the country’s economy by reducing the foreign dependency and increasing productivity. Bahceli promised his party would cut taxes on the minimum wage so that workers would net 1,400 Turkish liras per month.\nThe main opposition CHP and People’s Democratic Party (HDP) have already announced their election programs. The AK Party is scheduled to announce theirs on Sunday.\nTurkey is heading for an early general election after no party succeeded in creating a ruling coalition after the June 7 poll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:47:27.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
