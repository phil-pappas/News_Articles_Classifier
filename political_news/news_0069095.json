More Javid slams ‘heavy-handed’ Uber controls \nThe decision, likely to meet challenges in the courts, will revive a tortured debate over class, opportunity and social mobility that has dogged British politics for 40 years. \nIt will be the first test of legislation passed by the Labour government in 1998 that banned new state schools from running a selective admissions process. \nThe school argues that it will be running one establishment on two sites, rather than opening a new school, and had tailored its application to satisfy Department for Education lawyers. The Sevenoaks site will also house a new free school, with plans for collaboration between the two establishments. \nKent is one of the few English counties in which the existing network of grammar schools has remained largely intact: 163 remain across the country but most were closed in the 1960s and 1970s in favour of all-ability comprehensive schools, their fate sealed by Labour’s 1976 Education Act. \nPaul Carter, Tory leader of Kent county council, argued that similar applications should be approved elsewhere “if a good grammar school needs to expand, as all other good schools need to expand, and is physically constrained”. Tiny numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds pass their tests because they are the preserve of the privately tutored \n- Lucy Powell, shadow education secretary \nGrammar schools were originally intended to give pupils from poorer backgrounds the kind of education offered at academically selective fee-paying schools. \nBut educationalists offer strong evidence that this did not aid social mobility, since places tend to go to middle-class children who were better prepared for the 11-plus test that determined their schooling and had a huge influence on their prospects. \nFew issues are as emotive in British politics, splitting opinion within parties as well as among voters. As shadow education secretary, David Cameron chose to avoid reopening old wounds, and his government’s policy of promoting free schools and academies stresses the need to improve standards for all. The latest decision, first reported in the Times, is at odds with this rhetoric. \nHowever, the campaign for new grammar schools was revived before this year’s general election by Conservative Voice, the grassroots Tory organisation, and has won support from senior Conservatives, including London mayor Boris Johnson, home secretary Theresa May and defence secretary Michael Fallon. \nPolicy Exchange, a right-leaning think tank, responded to the campaign by publishing an analysis of grammar schools’ historical performance, concluding that they “may have provided a better outcome for those few who attend them, but such benefits are entirely cancelled out, and more besides, by the negative consequences for the majority in these areas who attend secondary moderns”. \nLucy Powell, shadow education secretary, tweeted: “David Cameron has turned his back on social mobility”. She said the prime minister should “look at the clear evidence on grammar schools . . . Tiny numbers of children from disadvantaged backgrounds pass their tests because they are the preserve of the privately tutored.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
