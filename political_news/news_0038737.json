Some of the harsh cuts to family payments now not as harsh. Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The government has watered down some of the harshest cuts proposed in its notorious 2014 budget a bid to secure a passage through the Senate.\nJust after announcing the government's response to the financial system inquiry, Treasurer Scott Morrison and Social Services Minister Chris Porter secured the support of the Coalition party room to offer the compromises.\nThese include lifting from six years to 13 years the age of a family's youngest child at which the government would cut off family tax benefit part B payments.\nFamily tax benefit part B is paid to single-income families and is means tested at $100,000 a year. In the 2014 budget the government sought to lower the cut-off age from 16 to six but has been unable to get it through the Senate. The measure was budgeted to save $5.1 billion over the next four years.\nThey are also prepared to scrap a proposed two-year freeze on the indexation of family tax benefit part A and B which, as originally proposed, would be worth $1.4 billion over the next two financial years, and they will scrap a proposed three-year freeze on eligibility thresholds for payments, worth another $1.5 billion.\nTo appease the Nationals, families on family tax benefit part B will receive an extra $1000 a year if they have children under one year old.\nSavings earmarked Savings from the welfare cuts have already been earmarked to help fund a childcare package unveiled in the 2015 budget.\n To try and keep the changes budget-neutral and pay for childcare, the government has proposed reducing by about $2000 a year family tax benefit part B for eligible single parents and grandparents with children between the age of 13 and 18, or 16 if the child is not in full-time study.\nThey are also proposing a reduction in FTB end-of-year supplements and abolishing them after two years.\nWith Labor and the Greens opposed to any change thus far, Mr Morrison has been working the Senate crossbench for months. Mr Porter has joined negotiations since his promotion to the cabinet last month. They need six votes but so far have the support of only David Leyonhjelm and Bob Day.\nSenator Nick Xenophon said he has not agreed to anything and a spokesman for Jacqui Lambie said the the changes would be considered but she would consult first with welfare and community groups and other candidates in her newly-formed party, the Jacqui Lambie Network. John Madigan does not comment on ongoing negotiations.\nOn Tuesday night, the government briefed Labor of the proposed changes. In question time, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the changes were needed because the originals could not pass the Senate.\nStrike a balance \"(The) revised family payments reform package will strike a balance between achieving significant savings while still providing sufficient financial support to those families most in need,\" he said.\nThe Greens said they would not be party to any compromise on cutting family payments.\nThe advent of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister has seen Labor crash in the polls and the Coalition soar. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told his caucus on Tuesday the polls reflected a relief that Tony Abbott had gone.\nShadow finance minister Tony Burke said \"at the moment we're in that phase where Malcolm Turnbull stands up, he says he's not Tony Abbott and people cheer\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:51:20.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
