His brother, Ali Rezaian , had this to say:\n\"Today's announcement by the Iranian government that a ruling has been issued regarding the case of my brother, Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian , is unfortunately just another sad chapter in his 14-month illegal imprisonment and opaque trial process. It follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law. The Iranian government has never provided any proof of the trumped up espionage and other charges against Jason, so today's vague statement on a purported verdict, while certainly disappointing to our family, is not surprising.\n\"While the status of any verdict in his case remains unclear, there is much about Jason we know for certain. Jason was simply a journalist doing his job and following all the rules when he was wrongly arrested and imprisoned in Tehran's infamous Evin prison. He is an innocent man that has been kept under harsh conditions to the detriment of his health and well-being for nearly 450 days. There is worldwide condemnation for the Iranian government's unlawful detention of Jason and calls from across the globe for his immediate release. We remain hopeful that Jason will soon be released and reunited with this family.\"\nTo find out more about Jason's case, please visit: www.freejason.net .\n releases/ali-rezaian-reports-indicate-that-the-iranian-government-has-issued-a-ruling-in-the-case-of-washington-post-journalist-jason-rezaian-300157653.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY25313&Transmission_Id=201510111218PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY25313&DateId=20151011", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ali-rezaian-reports-indicate-that-the-iranian-government-has-issued-a-ruling-in-the-case-of-washington-post-journalist-jason-rezaian-300157653.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.freejason.net/"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:16:32.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
