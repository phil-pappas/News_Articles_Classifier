A key base of support, labor unions, worries that the deal would put downward pressure on wages. All of the Democrats running for president are opposing the deal.\nThe meeting Wednesday is with those lawmakers who helped pass legislation earlier this year that allows Obama to present Congress with proposed trade agreements that it can ratify or reject but not change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:38:51.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
