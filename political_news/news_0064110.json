But he added: “Due to existing commitments, the First Minister is unable to attend the dinner with President Xi.”\nAsked if she felt snubbed by not being invited to the state banquet, the spokesman declined to comment. Nor would he respond to whether some people might have felt Ms Sturgeon should have attended the dinner with the Chinese premier during a rare state visit.\nThe new “golden era” of UK-China relations will see £30 billion worth of trade and investment deals completed, creating over 3900 jobs across the UK.\nSpeaking ahead of the state visit, which begins today, David Cameron said: “This is going to be a very important moment for British-Chinese relations…a real opportunity to deepen our relationship.”\nDowning Street made clear “nothing will be off the table” in the talks, including the “dumping” of cheap Chinese steel, blamed for the crisis in the industry and the loss of more than 5000 jobs, as well as human rights.\nPromoted stories Today, the red carpet will be rolled out for President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan, who will be formally welcomed by the Queen, members of the royal family and the Prime Minister.\nShare article Later, Mr Xi will address members of the UK Parliament and attend the state banquet at Buckingham Palace.\nOver the next two days, there will be a working lunch at No 10, a business conference in the City of London, dinner at Chequers and a visit to Manchester.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:02:18.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
