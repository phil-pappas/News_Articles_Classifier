NBC 5's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015) It’s taken nearly seven months, but Wednesday was the day that members of Congress finally began washing their hands of Aaron Schock. On Capitol Hill, the House Committee on Administration approved sweeping new rules, governing how much members of congress can spend to decorate their offices, how and when they can charter airplanes, and exactly which of their cars are eligible for mileage reimbursement. And all of those rules were prompted by the alleged abuses which drove Schock from office last March.
