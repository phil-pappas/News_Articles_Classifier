A day after Hardik said he would block the way of Indian and South African cricket teams to the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) stadium and not let them enter the venue if he and his supporters are not allowed to go inside to stage an agitation, the 22-year-old leader on Saturday said they have got tickets for the match and will go to the stadium. He has also urged the Patel community members to remain present in large numbers during the match to raise their demand for reservation under OBC quota for which they have been agitating over last two months. “We have asked around 50,000 community members to rush to the SCA stadium tomorrow for agitation,” the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener said. “My match ticket has been purchased by Rajkot unit of PAAS and I am going to attend the match tomorrow,” Hardik said. In the wake of the threat and given the largescale violence the state witnessed recently over the quota stir, police have fortified the stadium, located on the outskirts of Rajkot city at Khandheri village, which will host the third cricket match under the Gandhi-Mandela freedom series. “Over two thousand policemen, three companies of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), one company of Rapid Action Force (RAF), and seven teams of quick response cells (QRC) and five Superintendents of Police (SPs) have been deployed to ensure smooth conduct of the match,” Rajkot Range IG D.R. Patel said. Besides, three drone cameras and 90 CCTVs have been installed at the stadium to closely monitor each and every movement of the viewers, he said, adding that if any police personnel on duty is caught watching the match instead of monitoring the crowd, will be punished. Meanwhile, Hardik’s close aide Dinesh Patel said PAAS conveners of Saurashtra region and other associates will go to watch the match and if they are stopped, the state government will have to face the wrath of the Patel community. sports Cricket Rajkot stadium India South Africa Hardik Patel Also Read Agusta to lose Rs 3,600-cr deal India, Nepal to ink deal today to construct petroleum pipeline Axar Patel blitz takes West to the final IND vs SA: SCA appeals to Hardik Patel to refrain from agitation during ODI", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Hardik-Patel_2_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Hardik-Patel_2_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/sports-cricket/article/rajkot-stadium-security-fortified-after-patel-stir-threat", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:11:49.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
