We have shown strong opposition to applications for development at Great Covert and this proposal is strongly objected to by Valley Park Parish Council. \n\"Almost 300 local residents and North Baddesley and Chilworth Parish Councils have also registered their objections along with Eastleigh Borough Council.” \nMr Dowden, added: “The application is proposed within a Local Gap and would be hugely unpopular with local residents. I will listen to the debate but with ancient woodlands, this proposal would damage the landscape character of the area. \n\"There are numerous protected wildlife species and the nightjars - ground nesting birds - that are situated here have European protection. \n\"Therefore once again I have major concerns in regards of development within this area.” \nThe borough council’s landscape team is also objecting to the proposals. \nThey say it will “result in the permanent loss of a substantial area of designated ancient woodland” and erode the local gap between North Baddesley and Valley Park. \nRomsey and District Society has also objected along with Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust, Romsey Ramblers and the Woodland Trust. \nA spokesman for Taylor Wimpey said: “The woodland at Great Covert is currently used for commercial forestry. \n\"It offers no access to the public and its quality as a wildlife habitat has declined significantly in recent years as a result of its existing function and regular storm damage. Share article \n“While our proposed development will result in the loss of a small proportion of this woodland at the edge of the site, our overall scheme commits to restoring a significant area of woodland to its natural state through a detailed and long-term conservation management plan – and open up this land to the public. \n“As well as providing much-needed new family homes in an accessible location, our proposals will create a fantastic new safeguarded community asset for wildlife conservation and public recreation, preserving the local gap between North Baddesley and Valley Park in perpetuity.” Promoted Stories North Baddesley residents have vowed to fight plans to build 300 homes on Great Covert Copse Sorry, an error occurred.
