His campaign says it received nearly 74,000 unsolicited donations over the three-month period, the average contribution a little more than $50. \nTrump has personally spent just under $1.9 million since launching his campaign. That includes slightly a more than $100,000 contribution to himself over the three-month period. \nThe documents also show the campaign spending $4.2 million over that time.
