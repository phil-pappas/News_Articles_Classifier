City deal \nWork proceeds on the Cleveland Avenue bridge over the New York State Thruway last May. Upstate and Long Island communities have ramped up their case for more funding for road and bridge repairs following Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s $8.3 billion deal with New York City Mayor Bill deBlasio last week. By Tom Precious | News Albany Bureau | @TomPreciousALB on October 17, 2015 - 11:12 PM Tweet ADVERTISEMENT \nALBANY – The next time a suspension-rattling pothole shakes you and your car, or you’re on a road with Band-Aid pavement repairs that leave that thump, thump, thump sensation, try mumbling this under your breath: DHBTF. \nDedicated Highway and Bridge Trust Fund. \nThe fund was established in 1991 by then-Gov. Mario Cuomo to take care of New York’s ever-deteriorating roads and bridges. It was to be a “lock box,” stocked with money from motorist taxes and fees, like the levy the state imposes on a gallon of gas or DMV fees. The money was to be used only for infrastructure repairs. \nBut a lot of keys have been handed out in Albany that opened that lock box. \nThe original intent for how that money would be spent has been expanded, almost right from the start. And today only about 20 percent of lockbox’s funds go to capital projects, like repairs of aging bridges or repaving roads. \nSome 40 percent goes to pay for operating costs – such as staff salaries and snow plowing – at two state agencies, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has estimated. \nThe balance goes into payments for borrowing for previous year’s capital costs, a legitimate expense but one that is increasingly taking a bite out of how much money is available for the program’s original intent. \nHow the program works has become a bit screwy, critics say. While money from the fund is diverted to help pay for operating costs of state agencies, like the Department of Transportation, money then gets diverted from the state’s general fund to the road and bridge trust fund in order to keep it running each year. \nIn this year’s budget, the Cuomo administration notes, $664 million is being transferred from the general fund to subsidize the trust fund. The trust fund, and its questionable future and impact on the state’s crumbling roads and bridges, is just one of the transportation issues the state faces. \nBut the trust fund can’t be ignored, not after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo cut a deal last week with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to pump $8.3 billion of state taxpayer money into the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for various capital projects at the downstate transit agency. \nParity demanded \nIn the wake of the deal for the New York City-based transit system, Cuomo now faces a rallying cry from upstate and Long Island: parity. \nThat is a word that could become one of Albany’s most over-used terms in the coming months. Communities outside New York City last week ramped up their case following the $8 billion MTA deal. Their vision of parity is the state agreeing to spend an equal amount of money on upstate and Long Island roads and bridges. \nFurther, they want a guaranteed, five-year plan, with no diversion of capital funding for other state uses – just like the deal Cuomo made with the New York City mayor. \nMike Elmendorf noted that Cuomo only last year talked of a need to repair 6,000 bridges and more than 60 percent of roads. Elmendorf is president of Rebuild New York Now, a group representing labor, construction contractors, trucking firms, county executives and other local officials and chambers of commerce. \n“We’re a statewide association. We totally agree with the needs of the MTA. It’s a critical system. But it’s sort of act one of what needs to be a two-act play. The rest of the state has very significant and very well-documented needs,” Elmendorf said. \nCost to motorists \nPoor roads affect the economy and motorists. \nTRIP, a Washington group funded by insurers, unions, and various highway-related industry groups, released a report last year showing 37 percent of major local and state-maintained roads in New York are in poor condition, with only 20 percent rated good. \nOf major metropolitan areas, Buffalo has among the better road conditions, TRIP said. About 12 percent of the Buffalo area’s roads are in poor condition, compared with 43 percent in New York City, 28 percent in Syracuse and 21 percent in Rochester. \nStill, Buffalo drivers pay a price. The group estimated that Buffalo’s rough roads – the potholes, ruts and cracks that can cause wear and tear on car parts, affect tires’ life and increase gas consumption – cost the average motorist $300 a year in vehicle operating costs. \n“Instead of handing out economic development pork, the state could use those same funds to improve our highways and bridges. That would benefit everyone, not just a few select businesses,” said Ken Girardin, a spokesman at the Empire Center for Public Policy, a budget watchdog group. \nSpecial arrangement \nFor years, motorists have been paying through fees and taxes for some capital expenses at the MTA and upstate transit systems. But there was always a wink-wink arrangement in Albany that, in return, the transit funding program and the highway and bridge funding program would have at least somewhat equal state dollar commitments and be linked on five-year periods. \nThose days ended in 2010, when both financial parity and the five-year planning parity were broken. The MTA capital program has been getting more money than roads and bridges and planned out for a longer periods of time. Meanwhile, the state’s road and bridge program was left to a series of one- and two-year planning efforts. \nSuspicions rose further because Cuomo and legislative leaders 18 months ago committed to a deal that the state Department of Transportation would put together and release a five-year plan for capital work to improve some of New York’s more than 100,000 miles of roads and more than 17,000 bridges. \nTo date, no such plan has been released, though transportation sources say the agency identified some $28 billion in work over the next five years. \nThe governor’s office is not saying when that five-year DOT report will be released. \nNor has he yet given his vision for a long-term roads and bridges program to complement the long-term plan he and de Blasio reached last week to fund the MTA. Cuomo also has not divulged how the state will pay for the $8.3 billion commitment he made to the MTA. \nOfficials from the highway and bridge industry, as well as from local government, note that the MTA released its capital plan a year ago and, since then, has held hearings and heard other input leading up to last week’s deal between the governor and mayor. And yet the state DOT plan for roads and bridges is being held up, they worry. \nCuomo officials noted it is only October, and the governor does not present his 2016-17 budget until January. \n“The governor has made a historic commitment to the health of the MTA system. The final structure of how we fund transportation around the state will be done in the context of a comprehensive transportation plan next legislative session,” Beth DeFalco, a Cuomo spokeswoman, said in an email response. \nFunding sources \nThe administration noted that capital work for DOT is not funded solely by the highway and bridge trust fund, but also from state-funded bonds and federal aid. Moreover, this year’s budget contained $490 million for non-MTA transportation infrastructure work. State spending on transportation capital projects has gone from $3.4 billion in 2006 to $4.4 billion year, they note. \nWith party control of the state Senate at issue in the 2016 elections, Republicans in command of that branch already have signaled the linkage between the MTA bailout and money for roads and bridges. \n“Absolutely,” said Sen. Patrick Gallivan when asked if Senate Republicans will insist upon a specific plan for funding roads and bridges before agreeing to approve the MTA deal. \n“I couldn’t in good conscience vote for supporting funding for the MTA when we’re not receiving our fair share for the constituents I directly represent.” said the Elma Republican and member of the Senate transportation committee. “I think that would be a common sentiment among the Senate majority.” \nRoad, bridge needs \nThe state DOT in 2007 issued a report showing transportation capital needs over 20 years amounted to $125 billion. While some consider that a wake-up call, it was not heard by Albany. \nThe state DOT called for placing $6.25 billion a year in the budget for capital needs, but that request has been largely ignored over the past six years, industry groups say. \nInstead, the annual state spending for capital projects each of those years has been about $3.8 billion, they said. The state comptroller cautioned against the transportation discussions devolving into an upstate/downstate fight, noting that unmet infrastructure needs exist for both the MTA and the state’s roads and bridges. \nComptroller DiNapoli said the upcoming transportation negotiations provide an opportunity to have the state “do a better job” at identifying and planning for longer term infrastructure projects. \nDiNapoli said the state should also use this time to get the bridge and trust fund back to its “core mission” from when it was created more than a generation ago. \n“Instead of putting it back on track, we continue to use it to fund other agency purposes,” he said. \nNo one who studies the transportation issues, or drives on New York’s roads, disputes that infrastructure improvements are needed. But what precisely those needs are remains a mystery until the state DOT’s five-year plan is made public. \nIn the meantime, the DOT last week released a report on pavement conditions and work. It showed 2,752 miles of pavement work was done, The cheapest kind of work, maintenance, accounted for 45 percent of that total, while 6 percent was spent on major “renewal” projects. \nIn 2010, DOT said the agency should be doing 3,500 miles of paving work a year, industry officials said. \n“They’re trying to paint things black to keep them smooth but underneath are problems. It’s like patching a roof. Eventually, it gets beyond just putting on a new roof to having to reframe,” said a former DOT official. \nHe said there used to be a more even split between bridge and road pavement work. Now, he said, close to 65 percent of the work is on bridges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:26:45.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
