The two articles posted by NBC both report Chapo has wounds to the face and leg, but give no specifics as to how that occurred.\nTheir Headline of 7 hrs ago still gives no specifics see below latest headline:\nIn red confirming the injuries-click to enlarge 'El Chapo' on the Run: Mexican Drug Lord Has Leg, Face Injuries: Sources\nGuzman Loera escaped the Federal Social Rehabilitation Center (Cefereso) of the Altiplano in the State of Mexico on 11 July.\nAccording to sources in the discussion, people have fear and stress in Cosalá, Sinaloa. This reaffirmed by the state lawmaker Cosalá Lucero Sanchez Lopez, adding that eight people are missing.\nBeautiful Cosalá is one of Mexico’s Pueblo Magico, the sierra town has a small population of 7K.\nShe has been identified by the office of the Attorney General of the Republic as the new girlfriend of 'El Chapo' and mother of his youngest son.\nAs reported earlier NBC in their video report of Cosalá interviewed Dep. Sanchez identifying her as “this woman”, Sanchez went on to say how the people were frighten at the onslaught by Federal forces, (searching for her boyfriend “El Chapo”).\nMexico confirms injuries but says not from fire fight clash\nThe Security Cabinet said fugitive Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias “El Chapo “, made a hasty flight, which according to the information gathered, resulted in injuries to his leg and face .\nIn a joint statement, the agencies that make up the Security Cabinet detailed that these injuries were not the result of a direct confrontation. They made reference to the information they have published in national and international media.\n“From the day of the escape of Joaquin Guzman Loera occurred, the institutions of the Security Cabinet launched a coordinated strategy with the aim of achieving its recapture,” included are the Ministries of the Interior, National Defense, SEMAR and Marina Mexico, and National Security Commission (CNS) and the Attorney General's Office (PGR).\nThey stated, that as a part of these efforts, they are depending on intelligence and information from international agencies (United States), and have carried out operations in the country, in recent weeks primarily they have focused on the northwest region of the country.\n“According to the instructions of the President, the Security Cabinet continues to perform all actions to achieve the re-arrest of this criminal,” the statement said.\nAt first, in a media conference, national security commissioner, Renato Sales Heredia, said that “he had nothing about that,” regarding the information broadcast by NBC on the operation against the drug trafficker, and his injuries.\nHowever, Mexico is following suit by being quiet when U.S. reports re published but then respond a few days after the fact confirming the story….to a degree. NBC sources are directly from U.S. agencies involved in the sierras, namely the Drug Administration.\nIn a statement Friday, officials said intelligence pointed them to focus on northeast Mexico\nMexican officials said they launched an operation in the area, prompting the capo to make a hurried escape that left him with injuries on his face and one leg.\nAuthorities did not provide specifics on the date and exact location of the operation, or how he got injured just confirmed he was injured and said:\n“It is important to note that these injuries were not the result of a direct confrontation”.\nSo, they know he is injured, but do not know from what action, but do know it “was not” the result of gunshots.\nA visual of Cosalá, Sinaloa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:29:48.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
