However, a lot has changed since the Vietnam War era. As part of the American Homefront project, KPCC reports on the evolving military draft. \nRead part two of this series and let us know your thoughts on Facebook or in the comments below! \nThe idea of drafting women into the armed forces and forcing them to fight in combat has no precedent in U.S military history. \nBut as women's roles change within the military, so might the draft. \nThe Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) last month recommended Defense Secretary Ash Carter ask Congress to require women to register for the Selective Service. He has until early next year to address that, along with the question of women in combat roles generally, when he appears before the U.S. Congress. \nThe last American was drafted in 1973, and the Selective Service went into 'deep freeze' from 1975 until 1981. That's when President Carter revived mandatory registration in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but applied it only to “male persons.” \nRobert Goldberg, a young man who believed that gender gap violated his constitutional rights, sued and lost, after appealing the case all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nWriting for the majority in Rostker v. Goldberg , Justice William Rehnquist said that since the military treats women within its volunteer ranks differently than it treats men — specifically, excluding them from combat roles — that it can also treat them differently when it comes to the draft. Women's roles in the military are changing \nIn August, two West Point graduates became the first women to complete the U.S. Army's Ranger School — opening the door for the Department of Defense to drop the “combat exclusion” rule. \n\"Truly it’s a huge credit for anyone – man or woman – to endure the intense training and curriculum at Ranger School, and to prevail and graduate,\" Carter said at the time. \"Clearly these two soldiers are trailblazers. And after all that’s what it means to be a Ranger. Rangers lead the way.\" \nDays later, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus raised many eyebrows when he said he would open the SEAL program to women soon. The Marine Corps, however, has continued to oppose allowing women in combat. \nIf Carter opens more combat jobs to women, he will also have to address the question of what happens to the draft. \n“I think [Congress] would either be faced with disbanding Selective Service and the requirement to register for the draft, or they would be required for women to sign up,” U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, of Colorado, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, told KPCC. \nCoffman, a volunteer soldier who served alongside draftees in the Vietnam era, favors getting rid of the draft altogether and introduced legislation to do just that earlier this year. \n(Photo: Colonel Aimee L. Kominiak is the Military Director of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services. The committee recently recommended that the Secretary of Defense drop the rule excluding women from direct combat career fields.) Some say we should nix the draft \n“This is a very elite military,” Coffman said. “So I don’t see how we can at this point — if there were a draft, if there were a national emergency — that we could suddenly take all these people in and somehow assimilate them into the United States Army.” \nFurthermore, he said, the last draft was unfair—the country’s elite found loopholes, like the educational deferment, to get out of service, leaving the working class to serve. \nBut Julie Lynn, California State Director for the Selective Service, said the administration has made a lot of changes to the way the draft would be implemented. \n“We changed how deferments work, you can’t just keep going to school to get out of going into the military,” she said. \nAnd local draft boards — there are more than 2,100 of them in 50 states and six territories — would have to reflect the diversity of their region. \n“If a certain community is 80 percent Hispanic, then we want that board to be 80 percent Hispanic also,” she said. “So you’re really policing your own when you ask for an exemption.” \nSelective Service System Director Larry Romo, who manages a budget of around $23 million, said the relatively small investment is worth it. \n“We’re a very, very, very inexpensive insurance policy,” he said. “You can never say never. Deterrence is important.” \nRomo and Lynn both told KPCC they see no problems with requiring women to register as well. \nWhat do draft age women themselves think? KPCC took a very unscientific poll, talking to students on the UCLA campus, and largely, they seemed to agree. \nWhile men referred to being draft as their “worst nightmare,” women largely hadn’t thought about it. \nGrace Apostolopoulos, one student who spoke with KPCC, summed it up. \n\"I think it should be the same for everybody even though I wouldn’t necessarily be nuts about it,” she said. “I think that’s the fairest thing.\" \nWhat do you think? \nKPCC's online polls are not scientific surveys of local or national opinion. Rather, they are designed as a way for our audience members to engage with each other and share their views.
