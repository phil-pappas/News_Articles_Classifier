Those statements, cumulatively, are seeking a 5.1 percent increase over what was collected last year. (Staff/2015) Comments \"People...can call us with all of their questions,\" Washington County Assessor Rich Hobernicht said.. \nNearly 200,000 property tax statements , seeking a cumulative increase of about 5 percent over what was collected last year, will be mailed to Washington County residents in the next few days. \nThat's considerably above the 3-percent cap approved by Oregon voters, which has Rich Hobernicht, Washington County's assessor , expecting a flood of calls from residents asking for explanations or wanting to file appeals. \nIn a word, he said, it's complicated . \n\"Many people have the understanding that taxes can't go up by more than 3 percent,\" Hobernicht said. \"But it's important to understand there's an awful lot going on here.\" \nThis year's statements seek total property-tax payments of $963 million. That's an increase of $47 million – or 5.1 percent – over last year. The money pays for county government services, neighborhood services provided by cities and special districts, education and regional services, which include TriMet, Metro and the Port of Portland. Washington County 2015-16 property tax statements What : Nearly 200,000 statements will be mailed this week to Washington County residents. When : Full payment is due May 16, 2016. Questions about assessed values: Washington County assessor's office, 503-846-8826. Questions about payment options: 503-846-8801. Website: www.co.washington. .or.us/AssessmentTaxation/ \nThe majority of the county's 192,000 residential tax accounts – 171,000 in total – will climb this year when compared with last year's bills. Of those, 155,000 accounts will reflect tax increases up to 5 percent, with 16,000 accounts increasing by more than 5 percent. \nDriving the increases are factors such as voter-approved bonds or local option levies and major renovations that increase a house's value. \nTwo other drivers are, in Hobernicht's words, \"very complicated.\" \nThe first involves categories listed on property tax bills as assessed value, real market value and maximum assessed value. \nIn Oregon, a property's assessed value is the lesser of its real market value and its maximum assessed value. If a property's real market value drops below its maximum assessed value, it's possible for the real market value to increase by more than 3 percent from last year, yet still be less than its maximum assessed value. The assessed value then becomes the lesser of the real market value or the maximum assessed value. \nThe second involves a phenomenon known as compression . \nThe Oregon Constitution limits the amount that can be collected from any particular property. Taxes for education can't exceed $5 per $1,000 assessed value. General government taxes can't exceed $10 per $1,000 assessed value. If the taxes for either category are exceeded, those taxes are reduced, or \"compressed,\" until the limit is reached. \nThe occurs when multiple taxing districts are present on the tax bill. They may each be below the limit, but cumulatively, they exceed the category limit. The first thing that gets compressed is any local option levy. \n\"It's a property-by-property calculation,\" Hobernicht said. \nCountywide, tax reductions based on compression added up to $12.6 million this year, he said. That's down from last year's $13 million. \nA total of 15,000 accounts, by contrast, will reflect a tax decrease this year, Hobernicht said. Those reductions are due to factors such as expiration of local option levies, expired municipal bonds or any of the county's 63 local taxing districts levying lesser amounts than last year. \nHobernicht's office has compiled examples of how some of the county's 192,000 tax statements vary this year. One account in west Hillsboro will see a property tax increase of 0.57 percent. Another in Bull Mountain, however, was hit with an increase of 4.41 percent. \nIn the latter instance, he said, the amount of taxes that were compressed last year dropped, thereby triggering a rise in the property's tax bill. \n\"What we want people to know is that they can call us with all of their questions,\" Hobernicht. \nIf this year is like most, the phone lines will be lighting up not long after the bills start hitting local mailboxes in the next few days. \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:05:01.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
