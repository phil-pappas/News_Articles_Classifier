(Emily Joan Greene /For the Washington Post) October 2 at 6:10 PM Regarding the Oct. 2 front-page article “Shooter kills 9 in Oregon”:\nWhen are Americans going to wake up and say “enough”? Enough gun violence. Enough of our fellow citizens being killed at colleges, elementary schools, movie theaters, houses of worship, workplaces — and the list goes on. How is it that parents can no longer send their children off to school, whether it be elementary, high school or college, and not think to themselves, “This may be the day that my child does not come home”?\nWould Americans be shocked to learn that about 33,000 people , young and old , across this country lose their lives annually due to gun violence? Would we be collectively outraged if 33,000 people in a sports arena were all gunned down? Would that shock our sensibilities? Maybe network and cable news should run a crawler showing the daily statistics. We all think it won’t happen to us or our community. Thursday’s shooting, once again, proves that it can.\nAlice McCarthy , Rockville\n●\nIn the United States, our well-regulated militia, the U.S. Armed Forces, screens recruits for mental illness. How, then, can one argue that the Second Amendment reference to “a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state” precludes mental-health screenings for gun purchasers? The historical record of our military defenses suggests that this reasoning is flawed.\nRachel Braun , Silver Spring\n●\nOnce again, President Obama used the deaths of nine people to make a political statement about gun control. How shameful. If one student had a concealed-handgun license and was armed, how many lives could have been saved? God help all of us if the government is the only one with guns.\nMichael Grace , Weatherford, Tex.\n●\nEvery one of our elected officials bears some responsibility for the senseless gun violence that takes place in our country. Only they can change the laws that enable those who are violent or mentally unstable to get guns so easily. It is so disheartening to watch these events occur and then watch a now all-too-often-rehearsed response from the local community, the political establishment, the media, law enforcement and the gun lobbies. Other countries have figured this out. Shouldn’t we? How many more need to die?\nLanny Plotkin , Olney", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/08/26/americas-gun-violence-problem-in-three-charts/", "http://www.stripes.com/news/house-passes-new-mental-health-screening-for-recruits-1.284738", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/injury.htm", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:32:46.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
