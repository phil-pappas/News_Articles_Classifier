Chafee before she heard the Democratic presidential candidate speak at RiverWoods, a retirement community set amid the pine trees here. \"To tell you the truth, the only thing I knew was that he was talking about the metric system,\" she said. But on Tuesday, after listening to Rhode Island's former governor talk about everything from ISIS to WMDs, from the Trans-Pacific Partnership to Canada's Precambrian Shield, she was impressed. \"People I spoke with were impressed by his knowledge and his service,\" said Lane, 81, a former Connecticut resident who has lived at RiverWoods for five years. \"But they said he needs to show a little more vigor and speak louder. Of course, a lot of people here are hard of hearing.\" Lane, a Democrat, was particularly impressed with Chafee's call for pursuing diplomacy over war — for sitting down with enemies and avoiding rash decisions. \"I think he sounds a lot like Obama,\" she said. The RiverWoods audience also included Ronald I. Spiers, who served as U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas under Nixon, U.S. ambassador to Turkey under Carter and U.S. ambassador to Pakistan under Reagan. As he thumbed through The New York Times before the speech, Spiers said he'd known Chafee's father, the late Navy secretary and U.S. Sen. John H. Chafee. But he said he's backing U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., for president. After Chafee's speech, Spiers said, \"I think he's a good man. I didn't disagree with anything he said. I think he was particularly good on the Middle East.\" But, he said, \"He's just not a visible political thinker. He's very mild mannered, very fair, well informed. But he's not on fire about anything.\" So far, Chafee hasn't caught fire in the Democratic presidential campaign, either. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polling data, Chafee is trailing at 0.2 percent while Hillary Clinton leads with 41.6 percent, followed by Sanders at 25.2 percent, Joe Biden at 18.9 percent, Jim Webb at 0.8 percent and Martin O'Malley at 0.7 percent. In entering the race, Chafee had hoped to emerge as the main alternative to Clinton, but Sanders has been attracting the crowds. \"Bernie took off,\" Chafee said in an interview after his speech. \"The Occupy movement was a precursor to this unrest that's out there with millennials who can't find work,\" and they've joined members of the \"Vietnam era\" in backing Sanders, he said. Still, the presidential race is a \"marathon,\" he said, and a lot can change before Election Day. RiverWoods officials said their hall was filled when Sanders spoke there a few weeks ago, and it was standing-room only for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson. When Chafee took the stage, the crowd was not as big, and the woman who introduced him pronounced his last name as both Chay-fee and Chaff-ee. But Chafee has managed to generate enough support to make it onto the national stage during the first Democratic debate — set for Tuesday in Las Vegas. To make the cut, candidates needed an average of 1 percent in three polls recognized by CNN and released between Aug. 1 and Oct. 10. The prime-time debate will provide a big moment, a big opportunity for Chafee, who's been tilting at the Clinton campaign turbine with little campaign cash and few campaign staff. So what's the main point he wants to convey when he gets on the stage in Vegas? \"I don't think people know who I am, so the main point is: share my experience, my character and my vision,\" he replied. Those three topics represented the main branches of the stump speech that Chafee delivered at RiverWoods. Regarding his experience, Chafee said, \"I am the only candidate running for president — Republican or Democrat — that has been a mayor, a governor and a U.S. senator.\" Regarding his character, Chafee said he had the courage to be the only Republican senator who voted against authorizing military force in Iraq. (He has since become a Democrat.) \"Think about all of the people who voted to go to war in Iraq,\" he said. \"There were only 23 in the Senate that voted against it out of 100. Hillary Clinton voted for it, Joe Biden voted for it,\" and it was \"one of the biggest mistakes in American history.\" Regarding his vision, Chafee said \"three big issues are facing this country\" — income inequality, climate change and \"the endless wars.\" To address income inequality, he called for adding another tax bracket with a 45-percent tax rate on income over $750,000. He said that would generate $42 billion that could be used to slash the federal deficit and allow a $1,000 increase in the personal exemption, which generally benefits lower-income taxpayers. \"The wealthy are doing just fine,\" said Chafee, who is wealthy himself. \"Donald Trump flies in a 757 — that's a big plane. Probably has four or five houses. And so we can get, I believe, more from this top tier to help with this income inequality.\" Despite the expected discussion of experience and vision, this was not your generic stump speech. The New Hampshire audience got to see some of the quirkiness that Chafee's fans adore and that his critics ridicule. At one point, he was talking about climate change when he began to describe a trip to see hydro-power facilities in Canada. \"The 45th parallel is in northern Vermont, so we are halfway from the equator,\" he said with awe in his voice. \"This is a vast area where the glaciers scoured Quebec. They call it the Precambrian Shield, and we flew over it. It's just rock for miles. Some shrubbery growing.\" No one had asked, but he said, \"Yes, some Native Americans — the Cree tribe is there. Met with them, and they are on board on hydro.\" In a nod to our neighbors to the north, he said, \"There is a double benefit in that we have a clean renewable energy source, and at the same time we are having better relations with our Canadian neighbors.\" (Hey neighbor, eh?) So let there be no doubt about which presidential candidate worked at harness tracks in Calgary and Edmonton. Of course, it was in Canada that Chafee saw how easy it is to follow the metric system. But I noticed that in his RiverWoods speech, he didn't once urge the U.S. to go metric. \"I dropped it as a thing I bring up,\" Chafee said afterward. It's been hard to explain \"the facility of implementing it and the economic benefits and then the symbolic benefits,\" he said. So don't expect to hear about the metric system in Vegas. But do expect to hear about the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton announced her opposition to the international trade deal on Wednesday. And on Thursday, Chafee appeared on CNN, saying, \"Yes, it's a flip-flop.\" He swiped at Clinton, saying voters are interested in \"your character and if you can stand strong on an issue.\" At RiverWoods, Chafee said, \"I think I am one of the few Democrats in favor [of the trade deal] running for president. I know Sanders and O'Malley are opposed, and Secretary Clinton seems to jump around.\" While trade unions oppose the deal and opponents compare it to North American Free Trade Agreement of the 1990s, Chafee said, \"I don't know about you, but isn't it your memory that the '90s were some of the best economic times that we can remember? For the opponents to say NAFTA was a giant sucking sound — all that rhetoric you hear — I didn't see it in Rhode Island.\" Following the Oregon college shooting, you might also expect the Vegas debate to address gun control. \"I have voted consistently for common sense gun-safety measures,\" Chafee said. But even in states that have seen massacres, such as Colorado, legislators have been voted out of office for passing such gun measures, he said. So, \"we are not going to make progress on the gun violence issue in this country, I believe, unless we get the gun lobby to be part of the conversation of fixing it,\" he said. \"You have to believe it is possible.\" I believe I will have to tune in Tuesday. With help from CNN, Chafee is hoping that what happens in Vegas won't stay in Vegas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:45:44.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
