Yet the serious issue this raises is the utter unreliability of economic forecasting by this government. \n\"Given that a $372 million surplus last May became a $684m deficit one year later and has now ended up as a $414m surplus, it’s less like landing a 747 on the head of a pin and more like failing to hit the broad side of a barn. \n\"Only today, Minister Joyce said he wants up to $200 billion in foreign investment in order to boost exports by 2025. Aside from being almost New Zealand’s entire economic output for a year it signals that New Zealand is for sale. \n\"And what’s the point of exporting if all the profits of this investment is sucked off-shore? \n\"It further highlights the desperation of this government since it has failed to grow our economy where it matters - exports. Instead, it is trying to outsource exports. No wonder why National wants to change the flag,\" says Mr Mark. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
