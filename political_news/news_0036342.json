The way it has managed the party elections so far is enough reason for members to start asking whether this board will be able to conduct the party nominations in 2017,” an MP familiar with the matter said. \nGrassroots elections for the party have been going on for about two months, and were scheduled to end in November. But with several disputes and cancellation of outcomes, that timeline seems unlikely. \nThe board had cancelled the results of Nairobi, Kisumu and Matayos. Meanwhile in Awendo, Migori County, two people died while several others were seriously injured after violence broke out during the ongoing ODM grassroots poll. \nNEB chairperson Judith Pareno, however, said the murmurs of discontent, though expected, were insignificant. “We have always given the reasons for postponing elections. In most cases, it is demand-driven. We cannot ignore the murmurs but what do you expect from millions of supporters? Not everyone will be satisfied by the outcome of the people’s decisions,” said Ms Pareno. \nThis came as the board on Friday postponed the grassroots poll in Homa Bay, Kisii and Nyamira counties, which had been scheduled for October 31 to November 3. \n“This follows a request by the local leadership to have the elections pushed forward due to the on-going schools national examinations and a request by Seventh Day Adventist members who prefer a date that doesn’t fall on the Sabbath. The National Elections Board has therefore set Tuesday, November 24 to 27, as the new dates for the exercise,” Ms Pareno said in a statement. \nThough internal party elections have always been ODM’s Achille’s heel, discontent with the current board started manifesting itself after the botched national ODM elections at Kasarani Stadium in February, 2014. \n“The board we have now is the same one that handled the 2013 nominations and could not manage the Kasarani elections. The board looks incapable,” the ODM insider said. \nDuring the event, the infamous men in black overturned tables, smashed ballot boxes and destroyed election materials just as party members were about to cast votes for national office holders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:09:20.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
