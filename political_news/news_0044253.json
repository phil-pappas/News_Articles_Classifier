I listen to the journalist who is saddened by the revelation that a government can spend $10 million to print presidential diaries. \n“Yes, you heard me right; $10 million. And yet we are barely able to scrape together $10 million as a down payment on our debt to Nigeria for the supply of a truly essential product – gas”, he continued \nMr Akufo-Addo promised that his government – when elected – will be committed to doing things differently. \nA presidential staffer's response \nBut in a swift response to the presidential candidate, Stan Dogbe said “no government under the NDC has spent a pesewa of the public purse to produce diaries. \nStan Dogbe \n\"Such dairies have always been paid for from corporate advertising proceeds, and the canvassing for such adverts is the responsibility of the company selected to produce the diaries\" \n“Ten million dollars ($10 million) for diaries? You could have looked for a more convincing lie, not this one. And you want to lead the people of Ghana?”, he queried. \nBelow is a copy of Stan Dogbe's post SHARE THIS STORY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:27:06.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
