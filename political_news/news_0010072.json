(0) \nEngland is free to “determine its own future”, claim Westcountry Conservative MPs, as they celebrate the successful passage of “English Votes for English laws”. \nEmotions ran high in the Commons chamber as MPs debated the controversial rules, with the SNP warning it would create a “second class” of Scottish members. \nBut it eventually passed by a majority of 312 to 270 votes, with West MPs arguing it will restore “fairness” to the legislative process. \n“This is a manifesto pledge the Conservatives promised to deliver on and we will now be able to do so,” said Taunton Deane MP Rebecca Pow. \n“English Votes for English Laws was constantly raised with me by local people in Taunton Deane during the run up to the election and it’s still a controversial issue now. \n“Many feel it is truly unfair that English MPs cannot vote on areas such as health in Wales and education in Scotland and yet MPs from those countries can vote on those issues as they affect England. \n“It’s time we English spoke up in the interests of fairness and that is what we have done today.” \nThe legislation will add new stage added to the typical Parliamentary law-making process, allowing English MPs to vote on issues deemed to only affect England. \nThese MPs would be able to veto the legislation before all MPs from across the UK voted in the final reading of a Bill. \nFear of Scottish MPs wielding disproportionate influence in Westminster was cited as a key factor in the decline of Labour at the general election. \nAnd calls for Scottish MPs’ powers to be curbed have increased since the SNP threatened to intervene in Government attempts to amend the hunting act. \nPerth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart warned the measure risked stoking the fires of Scottish independence and rendering the country’s MPs “second class”. \nBut North Cornwall MP Scott Mann welcomed the new rules, saying it is right that England “has the ability to determine its own laws”. \n“After the Scottish independence referendum, the Prime Minister pledged to devolve more powers to Scotland, but that England must also be allowed to determine its own future at the hands of its own MPs,” he said. “It is a matter of fairness, and English Votes for English Laws will do this.” \n“Of course, there still people in our part of the country who prefer regional devolution over Westminster law making,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:43:09.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
