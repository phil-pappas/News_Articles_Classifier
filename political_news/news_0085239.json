And then there are about 92 deaths by guns every day and most of them don't make the headlines. So I've introduced my platform for dealing with gun violence because I think we've got to as a nation do exactly what you said. Enough. \nWhat do we have to try to accomplish. We need universal background checks , we know that they will work. (Applause) We need to close what's called the Charleston Loophole . The young man who killed the nine people in the church in Charleston -- there's a loophole in the Brady Bill that if you go to try to get a gun and they don't finish the background check in three days you can get the gun. We need to close the gun show loophole. I think it's 40 percent or so of the gun sales are done online, they're done at gun shows, they're done by people selling them out of the back of their cars, basically. ↓ Story continues below ↓ \nAnd we know where we enforce that kind of check we do keep guns out of the hands of people who are domestic abusers or in a hot rage go out to get a gun because of a domestic dispute. \nSo I really do want to push hard to get more sensible restraints on gun ownership in the wrong hands and then to try to keep track of people who shouldn't have guns. \nI want to work with the Congress. We got very close. There was a bipartisan bill, it didn't go all the way. But I will always look for ways as president to try to tighten some of these checks, particularly to get more of the background checks done on more of the sales at gun shows and online than we currently have. \nI don't blame you for looking at your nine-year old son and thinking, \"Do I have to tell him to be scared?\" Duck and cover exercises in your school in the United States of America? That's just wrong. So I'm determined to do something about it and I'll try every way I can to get those guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:10:06.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
