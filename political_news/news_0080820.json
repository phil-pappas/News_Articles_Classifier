CDC chief Meechai Ruchupan has written a letter to Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha asking for suggestions from the Cabinet. This action is based on Article 39 of the post-coup interim charter, which requires that the CDC seek suggestions from the Cabinet, National Council for Peace and Order, National Legislative Assembly and members of the public. At its weekly meeting on Tuesday, the Cabinet acknowledged Meechai's written request, the source said. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said yesterday that there was nothing wrong with a privy councillor offering suggestions on the charter to the PM. \"The government accepts proposals from everyone, not just from [Privy Councillor] Thanin [Kraivichien],\" he said. Wissanu said that the Borwornsak Uwanno-led CDC had also received proposals from privy councillors, but it only took up 20 per cent of them. Separately, deputy Democrat Party spokesman Ramet Rattanachaweng slammed Pheu Thai Party for criticising Thanin's proposal that politicians found guilty of corruption be banned from politics for life. He said the proposal was good for the country because it would not allow corrupt politicians to return and repeat their offences. \"Harsh anti-graft laws are needed to make politicians fearful of punishment,\" he said. Meanwhile, charter drafters will work on provisions that would stop politicians from creating populist policies that may affect the country's finances, CDC spokesman Amorn Wanichwiwatana said yesterday. He said in the chapter on citizens' rights, previous drafts had stipulated that the state was responsible for ensuring people's well-being through welfare such as education, public health, social welfare and the right to gather peacefully. He said this chapter may be rewritten or another chapter created on populist policies. \"This is to prevent political parties from launching policies to boost their popularity,'' he said. 848 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:09:33.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
