As partners, Samantha and Lani bring to Nicolaides LLP their extensive experience in the rapidly-growing field of cyber insurance coverage, including breach and breach response issues, cyber attacks, malware invasions, compromised information, class actions and multi-media liability claims, among others. With the support of seasoned associate Jessica Cavallo , the New York practice also brings additional depth to Nicolaides LLP in complex reinsurance matters and on professional liability issues.\n\"We are thrilled to expand our team with the addition of this dynamic group,\" noted Managing Partner, Richard Nicolaides . \"The wide range of complex insurance matters we handle and our collaborative environment enable us to attract the best talent in the insurance field.\"\n\"As a premier coverage litigation firm, Nicolaides has a deep bench of experienced lawyers.
