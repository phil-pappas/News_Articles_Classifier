The PSA estimates these women are being short-changed to the tune of $295 million, says Erin Polaczuk. \"Unequal pay represents a huge loss of earnings over a woman’s working life.\" \n\"The unions will be campaigning hard over the next year to ensure equal pay remains high on the political agenda and discussions are not used as delaying tactics.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:23:23.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
