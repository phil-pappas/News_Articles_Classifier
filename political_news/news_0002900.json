After cancer treatment, patients should work closely with their doctor to determine the treatment's implications on their heart health, experts say.\nBy Steve Sternberg Oct. 20, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT + More It's natural to want to put cancer out of your mind – especially after the doctor declares treatment a success. But forgetfulness, deliberate or otherwise, can be risky .\nThe so-called \"late effects\" of cancer chemotherapy and radiation linger for years in the heart muscle and vital elements of the circulatory system, including heart valves, blood vessels and the delicate circuits that regulate heartbeat.\nEven before you begin therapy, experts say, it is important to ask your cancer specialist what implications your treatment may have for your heart . It is also wise to consult a heart specialist who's familiar with the care of cancer patients.\nBigger cancer centers are more likely to have such experts on hand than smaller community hospitals. Such consultations may be life-saving, because it may be possible – through carefully-crafted cancer treatment protocols, preventive heart medication and exercise – to minimize heart damage without slacking off on the primary mission, eradicating the cancer.\n\"Our job is to take steps to protect the heart,\" says UCLA cardiologist Dr. Eric Yang. \"That is mainly strict control of cardiovascular risk factors and screening for short- and long-term effects.\"\nVanderbilt University experts have developed a checklist that primary-care doctors and patients whose cancer is in remission can follow to promote heart health :\nA wareness of the symptoms of heart disease. Drug treatment with aspirin and heart failure drugs known as ace inhibitors, when appropriate. B lood pressure control. C holesterol lowering and smoking cessation. D iet, Diabetes treatment and Dose. Every cancer patient should know every dose of chemotherapy and radiation. The intensity of heart monitoring depends on it. E xercise and echocardiogram heart screening. \"It's a simple checklist that every patient can remember and every primary care physician can use no matter where they are,\" says Dr. Javid Moslehi, director of cardio-oncology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nA person's specific risk profile depends on multiple factors, including age, other chronic conditions , the dose of chemotherapy, the kind of chemotherapy used, the dose of chest radiation and the amount of heart tissue that receives radiation.\nNot every cancer survivor develops heart damage. Those that do may experience many different manifestations of heart trouble. Some experience no symptoms, until physical or mental stress tips them into a heart attack for full-blown heart failure. Others may develop worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath; dizziness; light-headedness, including fainting spells; severe tiredness; chest pain; swollen feet and ankles; a racing heart or staccato heartbeats.\nDoctors recommend cardiac monitoring at regular intervals – often every year or two or five – depending on age and the intensity of treatment. Many oncologists will get an ultrasound of the heart before they start chemotherapy; cardiologists often recommend another scan a year after chemotherapy to identify any ominous changes. \"We learned this from kids,\" Moslehi says. \"Young kids would get [treatment], and 15 years later we would see them in heart failure.\"\nTAGS: cancer heart disease health care chemotherapy radiation", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Minimizing%20Heart%20Damage%20After%20Cancer%20Treatment", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Minimizing%20Heart%20Damage%20After%20Cancer%20Treatment", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Minimizing%20Heart%20Damage%20After%20Cancer%20Treatment&summary=There%20are%20steps%20both%20patients%20and%20primary%20care%20physicians%20should%20take.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9kse%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:39:09.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
