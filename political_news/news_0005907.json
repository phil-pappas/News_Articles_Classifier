He's scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 4. \nBooker apparently suffered a seizure Dec. 3 when he struck John Adsit and other officers monitoring a protest of hundreds of high school students. \nPolice say Booker knew his medical condition made him a danger on the road. He did not disclose his conditions when applying for multiple driver's licenses between 2006 and 2015. \nAdsit underwent 11 surgeries to repair crushed ribs, a punctured lung, a severed artery in his leg, a broken femur and a cracked pelvis. \nInformation from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:41:07.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
