More Russia fires cruise missiles into Syria \nIn an effort to boost the numbers, the government announced a half-day holiday for civil servants on Monday and television presenters in state and pro-government private media harangued the population about the damage they were doing to the nation by not voting and warned of “dangers” if people did not go to the polls. \nThe election, which is taking place in two, two-day stages, is the first since Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who ousted his elected Islamist predecessor, became president last year. A low turnout would be a setback to claims by the regime that it is building a political system that responds to the aspirations of ordinary Egyptians. \n“We have to know that this country is surrounded by armed militias backed by powerful [intelligence agencies] which, if they could, would turn Egypt into Syria,” warned commentator Motaz Abdel Fattah on the private Mehwar channel, exhorting people to carry out their “electoral duty”. \nThe weak turnout was in sharp contrast to the long queues that formed outside voting centres in the last parliamentary election, which was held in 2011 just months after the revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak, the long-serving dictator. In depth \nFurther reading \nIn that vote Islamist and secular parties competed in what Egyptians saw as a crucial race to determine the shape of their future. This time, however, most of the participants competing for the 600 parliamentary seats are independents competing in an electoral system that marginalises political parties and favours candidates with wealth and family connections. Among them are many old faces from the disbanded Mubarak-era National Democratic Party. \nThe Muslim Brotherhood group, which won the largest share of votes in polls after 2011, has been banned and declared a terrorist group. A security clampdown targeting Islamists as well as secular activists has also narrowed the space for dissent. \nAnalysts say the new parliament is designed to be fragmented and unable to mount any serious challenge to the president. The low turnout, they stress, shows a lack of engagement rather than an organised boycott. \n“Many people feel we have a strong president so why vote for a parliament,” said H A Hellyer, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. “For the past two years you have had a strong political message from all arms of the state that real authority is vested in a strong president. In addition, the clear outcome of the electoral system has been to severely restrict the potential for competition based on party programmes.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
