Recent estimates indicate that nearly 20% of Americans face the burden of unpaid medical bills. Recognizing this need, especially among families with children, each DriveTime dealership and operations center will raise funds for a local customer family that has a child with a medical need.\nDriveTime, the nation's largest used car dealer and financing company helping people with credit issues, is dedicated to putting people – even those with bad or no credit – in cars. With the addition of the Kids in Need 5K Fun Run , DriveTime deepens its commitment to giving back to the communities in which the company's employees live, work and run. The Kids in Need 5K Fun Run provides the unique opportunity to engage all DriveTime dealerships and their communities at once, showing the depth of the network of support created by DriveTime.\nCommunity members are encouraged to join the nearly 4,000 DriveTime employees and run, walk, jog or cheer on their local run. The event is free for participants and spectators and no tickets are required. Medals will be awarded for the top 3 finishers at each race, and water stations and snacks will be provided.\nThrough the Kids in Need 5K Fun Run , DriveTime is working hand in hand with local communities and eliminating the potential administrative and marketing costs associated with donating to charities. As a result, DriveTime will give 100% of proceeds directly back to the community. DriveTime is committed to donating a minimum of $65,000 to participating families (up to $230,000 ), and has set a goal to raise an additional $35,000 from the public. Donations can be made at GoFundMe through the race date.\nTo learn more visit our charities website or find the nearest 5K fun run near you on Facebook, along with time and location information.
