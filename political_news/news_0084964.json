We've started bombing; one side, please. \nI would have liked to have seen Kerry's spit take when one of his underlings delivered that message to him in front of Lavrov. \nAccording to Agence France Press, Kerry protested to Lavrov about Russia not following an agreement about \"deconfliction\" of flight paths. \nMore like \"duh-confliction.\" \nSo once again, Vladimir Putin got the better of the White House, which as of this writing is fretting that the Russians aren't striking ISIS so much as they are protecting Syria's resident tyrant, Bashar al-Assad. \nIn other words, Russia's airstrikes represent a total humiliation for the Obama Administration, which has been trying to get rid of Assad almost since the day Obama was sworn in to office. \nAnd the best the White House could muster in response was a sternly worded message from Obama, delivered by spokesmonkey Josh Earnest, who said that the Russians should realize that Syria needs a political solution, not a military one. (A bit odd coming from an Administration that tried and failed to trump up a reason for war on Syria after a mysterious nerve gas attack on Syrian rebels.) \nEarnest said, \"(The Russians)’ll be no more successful in that regard than the United States was in imposing a military solution in Iraq in the last decade, and certainly no more successful than Russian efforts to pose a military solution in Afghanistan three decades ago.\" \nOf course, the military solution in Iraq worked pretty well until some Dilbert pulled all the American troops out and smuggled weapons to al-Qaida-linked mercenaries in a cowardly and bumbling attempt to overthrow Assad . But let us not pick nits. \nUnable really to say anything constructive or explain what the Administration was doing while Putin planned and began an invasion of Syria, the White House's Earnest added, \"President Putin and the Russians have been trying to prop up Assad for a long time and the fact that they are now having to ramp up that support is an indication that their previous efforts to prop him up weren’t very successful.\" \nActually, since Assad has remained in power, it's more an indication that Obama's attempts to oust Assad haven't been very successful. \nAt the end of the day, Putin still looks like a strongman, and Obama still looks like this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:18:07.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
