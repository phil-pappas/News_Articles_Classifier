Insights Inc\nVANCOUVER , Oct. 14, 2015 /CNW/ - Liberal Jean Chrétien is rated the best prime minister in Canada – and another Liberal, Pierre Trudeau , the worst – in a performance review of 87 political leaders since 1981. The rankings are found in Our Top PM: Harper, Trudeau or…? , the third election report from new Vancouver -based interactive think tank Aha!\nIn addition to the report, a free set of prime minister playing cards is available at aha.world , with face values equal to each leader's ranking. Chrétien, for example, is the ace of clubs; current PM Stephen Harper is the jack of hearts; and Trudeau is the two of spades. Website visitors can collect and share the cards on social media.\n\"We ranked every premier and prime minister in Canada on eleven fiscal and economic outcomes, including job growth and balanced budgets\", said author, economist and Aha! CEO Dr. Mark Mullins , \"and then we looked ahead to assess today's federal leaders and their fiscal promises.\"\nThe study uses data from the spring federal budget, modified by the Parliamentary Budget Office, to rank the Conservative, Liberal and NDP leaders' fiscal plans.\nStephen Harper ranks 14 th of all federal and provincial leaders since 1981, though on fiscal outcomes alone he ranks 3 rd . His campaign promises, if kept, would ensure he retains that third place fiscal ranking as Canada's next PM. His fiscal score, the basis for this ranking, would drop from 70% to 68% in his potential next term in office.\nThomas Mulcair , with campaign promises to increase spending and revenues under a balanced budget, would rank 10 th on fiscal outcomes as the next PM, with a score of 62%, slightly higher than the fiscal scores for Paul Martin , Pierre Trudeau , or Brian Mulroney .\nJustin Trudeau , promising even higher spending and revenues, along with multiyear deficits, would have an 18 th place ranking on fiscal outcomes and a score of 57% as the next PM, the lowest of any prime minister since 1981.\n\"We see fiscal outcomes declining, no matter who becomes prime minister,\" said Mullins. \"The current pressures on the Canadian economy are creating a great challenge for the next leader of this country.\"\nThe report highlights the importance of political leaders. It finds that the rankings of prime ministers within parties vary more than the differences between parties. It also finds that federal Liberals have slightly better fiscal outcomes and Conservatives have slightly better economic outcomes, but neither predominates.\nThe report and prime minister cards can be found at the website aha.world .\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C6102&Transmission_Id=201510140830CANADANWWEB______C6102&DateId=20151014", "http://aha.world/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:56:25.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
