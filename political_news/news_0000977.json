Department officials said the option will cut up to 60 days off the time applicants wait from filling out the application to taking the test. \nNow, potential officers fill out their application online and take it, along with a driver's license and proof of education, to the Civil Service Commission office on Poydras Street where they will take the two-part entry test on the spot. \n“We've hired a person to administer the test. So now, five days a week during business hours -- with the exception of major holidays -- applicants can walk in and take the test to become members of the New Orleans Police Department,” said NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison. \nHarrison said the long application-to-test process was a factor that kept people from wanting to even attempt to join the force -- especially out-of-towners who were waiting 30 to 60 days or more for a test date. \n“Sometimes it's very inconvenient for them to schedule their lives around traveling to New Orleans to take a test,” said Harrison. “So now they can apply online. They can come in any day of the week except a holiday and take that test.” \nHarrison said this new walk-in testing process -- and other moves by the department, like decreasing college-hour requirements and intensifying academy training -- are part of a long-term goal of having 1,600 on the force. \nHe said, this latest change has come with positive feedback -- especially from within the department. \n“It shows that we're working hard to give them the manpower assistance that they so desperately need. So within our own department they're very excited about it. We very anxiously await those to become members of our department,” said Harrison. \nAfter launching the Get Behind the Badge recruitment campaign in 2013, NOPD accepted 3,000 applications in 2014. It has already surpassed that number in 2015. \nNOPD has 30 recruits training right now -- they are set to graduate in December. \nOfficials say they will start a new recruit class in the academy next week and hope to start one more in December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:36:25.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
