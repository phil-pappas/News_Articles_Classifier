The dance bars were a source of employment for tens and thousands of women. \nStaying the law, a two-member bench of justice Dipak Misra and justice Prafulla C Pant said that women’s dignity should be protected at all costs and it was the prime duty and responsibility of the Maharashtra police to ensure that it was done. \nIt ruled that it was deemed appropriate to stay the law. After the court ruling, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that his government had only “stood by the law passed by the earlier (Congress) government”. \nDance bars have always been a controversial issue in the state with successive governments having branded them as centres of prostitution. There are around 700 establishments across Maharashtra , which employed more than 75,000 women. They performed Bollywood-style dance routines in bars, receiving cash tips from patrons, apart from their salaries. \nThe police had cracked down on dance performances in bars in 2005. Elite establishments, including five star hotels, were exempted. The state thereafter, bought in a law banning dance routines in all establishments. \nThe dancers’ union had opposed the ban. The union stated many of its members would be forced into prostitution if the state refused to allow dance performances. \n“We are happy with the court’s decision to stay the amendment,”” said Bharat Singh Thakur, president, Dance Bar Association. “We have been running dance bars since 1997 and there has been no complaint of obscenity against us.” \nMeanwhile, restaurant owners had challenged the law, arguing the state was spoiling the court’s intention. The court agreed although it had set aside a similar provision, the law had been brought about in a new manner. The court will hear the case again on November 5. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:48:21.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
