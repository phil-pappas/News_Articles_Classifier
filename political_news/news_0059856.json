PHOTO | TONNY OMONDI | NATION MEDIA GROUP Advertisement \nCord MPs have alleged the existence of a State plot to destabilise Ford-Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula because of his role in the Opposition and the proposed impeachment of President Uhuru Kenyatta. \nLed by Kakamega Senator Dr Boni Khalwale, they said the plot is in regard to a news report about a ruling sanctioning the removal of Mr Wetang'ula as Bungoma Senator. \n\"At the manipulation of the State, State agencies have been hard at work leaking to the media documents they know would not otherwise stand a chance before any functional court of law. This is not the law at work. It is naked and raw politics at play,\" said Dr Khalwale. \nVOTER BRIBERY \nDr Khalwale, who was flanked by about 20 Cord senators and MPs, produced a letter from the Department of Criminal Investigations to the DPP showing that investigations into claims of voter bribery by Mr Wetang'ula yielded nothing. \nHe said the leakage of documents was only the latest part of the State plot to intimidate, harass and bully Mr Wetang'ula because of his work in the Opposition and the preparations to impeach President Kenyatta. \nDr Khalwale also sought to warn off Mr Wetang'ula's political rivals; Musikari Kombo, Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:38:18.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
