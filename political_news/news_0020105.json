No other candidate in this poll stands in double-digits. \nGarcia and King tie for second-place, both supported by 9% of surveyed voters. Chris Bell comes in fourth at 6%, followed by Steve Costello at 5% and Ben Hall at 4%. \nStill, a large number of voters haven't made up their minds. The survey of 567 likely voters conducted between September 25 and October 6 showed 42% undecided. \nUnless one candidate wins a majority of votes in November – an extremely unlikely scenario with so many names on the ballot – whoever finishes first and second on election night will face each other in a December runoff. \n\"I would say that Bill King is a slight -- if not strong -- favorite to get into the runoff,\" said Bob Stein, the Rice University political scientist and KHOU political analyst who conducted the poll. \"And I think Garcia is fighting now to stay in the runoff.\" \nThroughout the campaign to replace term-limited Mayor Annise Parker, other candidates have generally presumed Turner – a well-financed, longtime state representative who's run for mayor twice before -- will win the most votes in November. So other candidates, most notably Bell, have gone on the offensive against Garcia in hopes of knocking him out of second place. \nThis poll indicates the attacks criticizing Garcia's performance as Harris County sheriff have done their damage. \nA day-by-day analysis of the phone survey results also indicates the former sheriff's candidacy has been hurt by a series of negative news reports, like a front-page Houston Chronicle story about jail inmate abuse and a KHOU 11 News I-Team expose on a $1-million jail ministry contract awarded to one of Garcia's friends. \n\"We saw his support drop in half,\" Stein said. \"He is now in a competitive race for the runoff slot. And it's not obvious to us that he is a guaranteed or even a likely runoff candidate.\" \nKing has been the chief beneficiary of Garcia's decline, mainly because of growing support from Republican voters. King and Costello have been fighting it out for GOP hearts and minds, emphasizing financial issues like the city's growing pension obligations. \nBut Costello's backing of the drainage fee to bankroll flood control infrastructure has hurt him with many Republican voters, who consider it a poorly implemented new tax. \n\"Bill King has gained tremendously,\" Stein said. \"He was barely measurable in our May poll. He's now at 9 percentage points. Most importantly from our May poll, his gain appears to be from Republican voters.\" \nRepublicans polled for this survey are breaking for King over Costello by a 4-to-1 ratio, Stein said. \n\"And here's the good news for Bill King, if this trend continues: 45% of Republicans still don't know who they're voting for,\" Stein said, indicating King will gain more votes as more GOP voters make up their minds. \n\"Keep in mind close to half of those Republican voters who are likely to vote still haven't picked a candidate,\" he said. \"If the trend continues, Bill King will get that advantage, not only with Republicans over Costello, but maybe enough to get him into the runoff.\" \nHouston's city elections are non-partisan, but party preferences play an important role in local election dynamics. Although most Houston voters are Democrats, Republicans have repeatedly mustered enough political clout to vault a GOP candidate into the runoff. \nThe general election often serves as a de facto primary advancing one Democrat and one Republican into the final round of voting in December. But history has proven Republicans have a tough time winning election as Houston's mayor. \nIn 1999, for example, Democrat Lee Brown defeated Republican Rob Mosbacher in the runoff. In 2001, Republican Orlando Sanchez ended up in a runoff against the seemingly vulnerable incumbent Brown, but in what became a starkly partisan campaign Brown won re-election. In 2003, Sanchez again made the runoff, but Democrat Bill White ended up serving as Houston's mayor. \nSo a runoff between Turner and King would fit into a recurring pattern in Houston politics, with history giving the advantage to Turner. \nBut of course, with 42% of voters undecided, anything's possible. Early voting begins Monday, October 19, and Election Day is Tuesday, November 3. \nHouston Mayoral candidates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:59:00.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
