Before she came to CPS, Byrd-Bennett was an $18,000-a month chief academic and accountability auditor in Detroit under emergency manager Robert Bobb. During her tenure, DPS awarded some $3.4 million in contracts to Synesi Associates, one of the north suburban companies now under indictment along with co-owners Gary Solomon and Thomas Vranas. DPS also awarded more work to PROACT Search, another of Solomon’s and Vranas’ education service companies, to fill five top positions once Byrd-Bennett left that district and became a coach for Synesi and SUPES, the Sun-Times reported in September .\n“DPS is committed to transparency in all of its business operations,” Detroit schools spokeswoman Michelle Zdrodowski said in a statement. “As with any matter where there are allegations of misconduct, the district investigates internally and works cooperatively with the law enforcement agency handling such matters. In the case of Ms. Byrd-Bennett, we are continuing to work closely with law enforcement officials.”\nZdrodowski declined to comment further. Nor would she say how much Detroit had paid to the Solomon and Vranas companies.\nAccording to Detroit Public Schools Board Member Annie Carter, DPS and Byrd-Bennett were also criticized during her 2009-2011 tenure in Detroit for a $40 million contract the district of about awarded to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishers, for whom she had previously worked.\n“You guys shed more light on it than we were able to in the community,” Carter told Sun-Times on Thursday. “The community was coming after her on that $40 million contract.”\nIndicted last week on 20 counts, Byrd-Bennett pleaded guilty to a single wire fraud charge on Tuesday, admitting she hid from CPS a lucrative arrangement with Solomon and Vranas in which she’d steer contracts to them — $23 million total — in exchange for 10 percent that would in part funnel into college funds for her twin grandsons. Prosecutors will recommend a prison sentence based on how fully she cooperates with them, as she has said she will do.\nSolomon and Vranas pleaded not guilty Wednesday to wire and mail fraud and bribery counts.\nExactly when Byrd-Bennett first started working for any of Solomon’s and Vranas’ companies and when she met them aren’t clear. She has refused all interview requests. And her attorney, Michael Scudder, would not comment.\nBut it may have been in Detroit.\nAccording to emails obtained from the Detroit school system, Solomon wrote to Byrd-Bennett in August 2009, asking, on the advice of a mutual acquaintance, to set up a meeting with her in Detroit.\n“You and I have been playing phone tag for a bit, and Joey Wise suggested to try again to connect with you. I am going to be in Detroit to meet with some folks on Sept. 16th, and was hoping you might have some time that day to chat for a bit,” Solomon wrote.\nJoseph Wise heads Distinctive Schools, a company that manages charter schools in Chicago. He also once worked for SUPES and recently bought parts of SUPES, Synesi and PROACT.\nIn another email on Sept. 4, 2009, Solomon thanked Byrd-Bennett for “taking the time to meet with me this week. I really enjoyed our talk and am working on some information that I can provide to you, in regards to working with some of your feeder schools that might be managed by an external partner. Also I am glad that I had a chance to talk with you a bit about Proact… where we have been and where I hope to take things. I would welcome the chance to speak to you about this further.”\nThe Detroit schools hired Synesi in July 2010 to work with three elementary schools for $760,000, according to the contract. In November 2010, the district dropped two of those schools and added four, under a $3.195 million contract covering a total of five schools.\nThe district appears to have issued a “request for qualifications” for that work, records show. That meant that, ahead of a possible competitive bidding process, any firm seeking the work had to show it would be able to handle the job.\nAttached to the July 2010 contract was a scoresheet for 10 companies Detroit officials apparently considered before awarding the work. Synesi had the fifth-highest score.\nThe later Synesi deal in Detroit didn’t end up needing to be competitively bid. Late that July, the company received approval from the state of Michigan to become an official “external service provider” for schools that won the federal improvement grants. The state’s department of education wrote to Detroit’s procurement chief to tell her that with approved providers, “It is not necessary for the Detroit Public Schools to competitively bid out these contracts.”\nCarter, the Detroit school board member, has said that deal was never brought before the board for approval, nor were the others.\n“Normally, we would have had to approve it, but we never was given the opportunity,” Carter said in September.\nIn late 2011, after Byrd-Bennett left Michigan, Detroit hired Synesi for another $160,000 to work with one of the same elementary schools.\nDetroit then gave PROACT a $77,500 contract to fill at least five top positions once Byrd-Bennett’s tenure ended.\nOn Feb. 16, 2011, a formal email arrived in Byrd-Bennett’s inbox from Solomon: “We are pleased to announce the creation of The SUPES Academy, a new not-for-profit corporation that will be dedicated to preparing a new generation of superintendents for our nation’s schools.”\nWithin a year, Byrd-Bennett was working for SUPES as a consultant to CPS, coaching the district’s chief academic officer, whom Byrd-Bennett was hired in May 2012 to replace, beginning her three-year tenure at CPS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:44:09.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
