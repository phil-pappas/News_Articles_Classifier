In addition, Life's Abundance will utilize DxEnterprise to ensure data high availability (HA), as well as a seamless future move to integrated disaster recovery (DR).\nSince its founding in 1998, Life's Abundance has enjoyed phenomenal success across all of its premium product lines, featuring all-natural foods, treats and supplements for dogs and cats, as well as ultra-pure fish oil supplements for human consumption. With this success has come exponential growth in its family of independent distributors as well. Not surprisingly, this led to growing pains across its backend and frontend infrastructures. In addition to addressing its backend accounting and frontend fulfillment systems, it needed a solution for the network of individual websites it provides to each of its independent distributors that had become unruly to manage. Its IT environment included frontend applications that were virtualized on Hyper-V, and a backend environment that included a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 physical deployment cluster. Among its primary IT challenges were how to most effectively manage its Microsoft Windows application environment, how to avoid SQL Server sprawl and its associated problems, and how best to address Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 being end-of-lifed (EOL). An upgrade was required and Life's Abundance wanted better resilience in the process. It considered SQL Server Enterprise Edition for its multi-node HA clusters but the price for what it needed was astounding.\n\"We looked at the upgrades that Microsoft was recommending, and evaluated SQL Server Enterprise Edition,\" said Charlie Scherker , IT Director, Life's Abundance. \"However, it was frustrating to learn that in order to obtain the level of resiliency we required for our multi-node cluster, we would be forced to purchase a suite of features for which we had no use. For us, that just didn't seem like a great business decision. Ultimately, we chose to deploy SQL Server Standard Edition along with DxEnterprise to give us the multi-node HA clusters we needed at a price we liked.\"\nDH2i's DxTransfer ™ free SQL Server migration tool was then utilized to seamlessly migrate the organization's SQL Server instance data into DxEnterprise.\n\"DH2i's DxTransfer delivered a uniform and consistent deployment of our SQL instances during the migration. Our corporate standards were maintained. And we are now well positioned for fast and easy migrations as needed, in the future,\" said Scherker. \"We no longer dread the possibility of SQL Server sprawl, associated management complexity and budget-busting license costs. DxEnterprise management is really so straightforward – making it easy to manage and ensure the high availability of our entire environment – from our backend to our frontend systems, to our network of independent distributor websites.\"\n\"With DxEnterprise, Life's Abundance will be able to 'containerize' its Windows Server application instances, thereby decoupling the apps and all associated data from host OS and underlying infrastructure. In this way, they will then be able to achieve fast and transparent application portability, hyperscale cloud-like agility, ensured HA, and integrated DR,\" said Don Boxley , CEO and Co-Founder, DH2i . \"Of course, the fact that the organization's associated costs will likely decrease by 30-60% is also a bonus.\"\nTweet this: .@LifesAbundance2 Deploys @DH2i DxEnterprise Container Management Software http://dh2i.com/press/ #Microsoft #SQL #Mobility #HA #DR\nTo learn more about Life's Abundance and its line of safe and effective products that help people and their pets lead healthier, more abundant lives, please visit: http://www.lifesabundance.com/ .\nTo learn more about Life's Abundance's non-profit arm, The Dr. Jane Foundation , which is committed to rescuing neglected and unwanted animals, please visit: http://www.lifesabundance.com/Pets/Foundation.aspx?realname=&cat=0&hdr=&Ath=False .\nAbout DH2i\nDH2i Company ™ is the leading provider of Microsoft Windows Server application portability and management solutions.
