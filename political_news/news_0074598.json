Graham at shipyard: No more base closures » Social News STRATHAM — New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary rolled into town once again on Friday as candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich packed the Municipal Center with residents. Kasich, who was recently endorsed by Stratham’s premier Republican politicos Doug and Stella Scamman, spent the majority of his speaking time introducing himself to voters. The Ohio governor related a meeting he had while a state senator with President Richard Nixon, the strong values instilled in him by his “highly opinionated” mother and his congressional work balancing the budget under the Clinton administration. “I’d rather have people aggravated with me and accomplish something than be popular and accomplish nothing,” he said. “I’m not there to win a popularity contest.” Kasich touted his work as the Congressional Budget Committee chairman under President Clinton, passing what he said was the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. “And we haven’t had one since,” he said. When asked by a member of the audience about U.S. policy in the Middle Easy, Kasich said that he would establish a no-fly zone over Syria and sanctuaries for the Syrian people under attack, though he did not elaborate on how or where those sanctuaries would be created. “There will be a consequence for violating what I told you not to do,” he said regarding enforcement of a no-fly zone. One audience member asked Kasich what he would do to get the “corrupting influence” of money out of national politics, and if he would support a constitutional amendment overturning the Supreme Court’s controversial 2010 Citizens United decision, which declared that under the first amendment, political expenditures by corporations and other associations could not be limited. The governor’s answer was frank. “I can’t get a constitutional amendment done for a balanced budget. Once I can do that, I can start thinking about other things,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s about character. People give me money, and you know what they get for it? Nothing.” Regarding illegal immigration, Kasich said as a nation, “we need to be able to lock our doors,” but added that if voters think he would embark on a mission of rounding up and deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country, they should look for another candidate. “That is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard in my life,” he said. At least two Democrats were in the audience, one of whom told Kasich he was there because he could not in good conscience vote for Hillary Clinton. “I only heard half of what I wanted to hear there,” Kasich responded, earning laughter and applause. Another young man told Kasich he had watched the last Republican CNN debate while “cringing most of the time,” but he was impressed by Kasich’s responses. “How are you going to get your voice heard above the sea of crazies?” he asked. Kasich said that he is unconcerned about poll numbers at this point and he believes very strongly in town hall-style campaigning, hoping to do well in the Granite State. “New Hampshire should be named Cape Canaveral — it launches people into the public consciousness,” he said. “We’ll be fine. I’m very confident about where we are right now.” Kasich closed the event by imploring those who liked what they heard to support him, promising to “shake this place from top to bottom” if elected. “It takes knowledge and a spine to drive change. It takes gumption,” he said. “I’m not in this to waste my time or yours. I’m here to take to Washington the biggest amount of change anyone has seen since the 1990s.” Stella Scamman, who brought her grandson Finn to the event, where Kasich gave him a fist bump before his remarks, praised the New Hampshire primary institution before the event. “We are so lucky to be first in the nation. Think of all the excitement it brings to our state, not to mention the dollars,” she said.
