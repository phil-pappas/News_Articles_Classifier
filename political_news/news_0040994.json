It is now forecast by the Office for Budge Responsibility to be just over £25bn in 2016-17 - around £15bn lower.\nThis figure, which includes the £4.5bn due to be saved by the latest changes, was the equivalent of the cost of 200,000 nurses or 325,000 teachers, the Treasury said.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/172B5/production/_86210949_86187747.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:55:19.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
