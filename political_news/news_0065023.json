While Maharashtra seized the most—23,340 tonnes—Telangana and Chhattisgarh, too, cracked down on hoarders, seizing 2,546 tonnes and 4,525 tonnes, respectively.\nOn Wednesday tur ( pigeon pea) retailed for Rs. 205 per kg in Mysore and Rs. 173 per kg in Delhi while the average price across the country was Rs. 150 per kg according to the consumer affairs ministry. For other varieties of pulses such as urad (black gram), masoor (lentils) and moong (green gram), average retail prices (per kg) were Rs. 150, Rs. 100 and Rs. 110 respectively.\nJaitley said that tur is being sold in 380 Safal outlets and 103 Kendriya Bhandars in Delhi at Rs. 120 per kg.\nThe centre took several steps this month to control the spurt in prices of pulses. It decided to import 10,000 tonnes (of which it has already done half), impose stock limits for traders, importers and even departmental stores, and create a buffer stock of 40,000 tonnes.\nMeanwhile, industry body India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) said on Wednesday that the supply situation could ease soon as private importers have signed contracts to import 2.5 million tonnes of pulses that will arrive between October and January.\nA quarter of a million tonnes have already arrived at the Mumbai port in the last seven days, IPGA chairman Pravin Dongre said.\nHowever, he added that the “stock limits will hinder the smooth flow of supply, hampering the imports and leading to severe scarcity of pulses in the country”.\nDongre urged state governments to give importers, millers, wholesalers and retailers at least 60-90 days to liquidate currently held stocks and achieve mandated stock limits.\nThe spurt in prices is primarily due to shortfall in production due to weather woes. Pulse production in India, the world’s largest grower and consumer, fell by nearly 2 million tonnes—from 19.2 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 17.2 million tonnes last year (2014-15)—due to a deficit monsoon in 2014 and unseasonal showers destroying the rabi (winter) crop in April-May earlier this year.\nA deficit monsoon in 2015 means the kharif (summer) crop of pulses is going to take a hit too.\nThe centre has already lowered its production estimates from 7 million tonnes (targeted) to 5.6 million tonnes (first advance estimate).\nPTI contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:17:35.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
