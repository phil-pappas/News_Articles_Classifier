(AP) â€” An unlikely pair of allies wants more states to restrict civil asset forfeiture, a practice critics say represents an overused law enforcement tactic that can violate citizens' property rights.\nThe Charles Koch Institute, named for the wealthy conservative founder of the Washington, D.C.-area think tank, co-hosted a forum on the topic Wednesday evening in Albuquerque joined by the state director of the American Civil Liberties Union.\nThey say New Mexico offers a model for civil forfeiture reform with a law enacted in July that prevents police from seizing money or assets unless a person is convicted of a crime.\nBefore, law enforcement could seize items and auction them off if they suspected they were linked to a crime.\nLaw enforcement officers who support civil asset forfeiture say it's needed to weaken lucrative crime operations.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
