Democratic National Committeewoman and former state Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan will serve in the volunteer post of campaign treasurer. \nThe campaign launched a website, MaggieHassan.com . \nHassan’s announcement sparked expected partisan reaction and prompted one prospective Democratic candidate for governor next year to say he will make an announcement shortly. \nExecutive Councilor Colin Van Ostern emailed supporters praise for Hassan coupled with campaign-style remarks about his own work on the council and his business background. \n“I believe my work making debt-free college a reality for thousands of students at Southern New Hampshire University's College for America and my past experience as a business leader at successful employers like Stonyfield gives me a good perspective on how we can keep New Hampshire a great place to work and raise a family,” Van Ostern wrote. \nBut he stopped short of making what is now an expected announcement that he will run for governor, writing: “Because it is critical we build an even brighter future for the people of New Hampshire, I will make a definitive announcement on whether I plan to be a candidate for governor in the coming days.” \nRepublican candidate for governor and Executive Councilor Chris Sununu said: \"This election is not about which opponent I'll face, it's about a new direction for our state. For almost 20 years, Democrat governors allowed New Hampshire to lose its competitive edge, and now we lag states like Massachusetts in economic opportunity and growth. The politics of 'good enough' was not enough, and it has failed our working families, young people, and small businesses. \n\"As governor, I will be a problem solver and bring people together to create more opportunity for all, unlocking our state's potential. As governor, I will lead,” Sununu said. \nAyotte, meanwhile, issued a statement welcoming Hassan to the race and looking forward to a “spirited campaign.” \n“We have lots to talk about, including confronting the challenges facing our state and how we can best deliver results for New Hampshire families,” Ayotte said. \n\"As a working mom who commutes from Nashua every week, I'm guided by the concerns and solutions you share with me. In the Senate, I fight every day for better opportunities and a brighter future for our kids and our state,” Ayotte said. \nShe added: \"I'm running for re-election so I can continue working across the aisle to solve problems and deliver results for you. Whether it's stopping wasteful spending, fighting for fairness in the workplace, creating a better climate for small businesses to create jobs, protecting our environment, or keeping our country safe, I wake up every day focused on providing solutions for the issues you care about.\" \nAs WMUR.com first reported Monday morning, Ayotte enters the fourth quarter of 2015 with $5 million cash on hand in her campaign account. \nHassan filed a federal campaign account with the Federal Election Commission, campaign spokesman Jacobs said. But she cannot transfer funds in her state governor’s campaign account to it. \nThe state Democratic Party praised Hassan as a “strong bipartisan” leader who has the state’s economy “moving in the right direction with the fastest economic growth in New England and the unemployment rate at its lowest level since 2008. \n“Washington is broken and special interest favorite Kelly Ayotte is part of the problem. Since going to Washington, Ayotte has put her special interest backers first, protecting tax breaks for big oil companies and outsourcers while voting to turn Medicare into a voucher program, defund Planned Parenthood, and make higher education more expensive,” party chairman Raymond Buckley said. \nState Republican Party chair Jennifer Horn dubbed Hassan “Governor Gridlock,” and said, \"She has failed to keep and grow jobs in New Hampshire, she has failed to respond adequately to the heroin epidemic and she has failed to work across party lines to do what's right for Granite Staters. Her irresponsible and partisan budget veto left vital programs and resources in limbo, including funding to fight the heroin epidemic and critical support for the elderly and home-bound.” \n\"Hassan's playbook of more taxes, more spending, and bigger government has not worked for New Hampshire families and small businesses. Her failed leadership has brought Washington-style gridlock to the governor's office, and the last thing New Hampshire needs in the Senate is another rubberstamp for more partisan politics,\" Horn said. \nMeanwhile, three pro-Republican groups quickly responded to the announcement with websites and a digital ad attacking Hassan. \nThe America Rising super PAC went live with a “Maggie Hassan Tax Quiz” site charging that she has made “every aspect” of Granite Staters lives more expensive. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce began posting a digital ad that says, “Don’t give those Washington liberals another vote.” \nAnd the National Republican Senatorial Committee launched “ HassanforSenate.com ,” which looks like a pro-Hassan site but attacks her as “Partisan. Ineffective. Out of Touch.” \nBuckley responded to the Republican attacks by launching an attack of his own – on Ayotte. \n\"Given Kelly Ayotte’s unending loyalty to the Washington special interests, it’s no surprise that these outside groups are now rushing to try to prop her up,” Buckley said. “Kelly Ayotte has carried the water on their special interest priorities at every turn, voting to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and opposing an increase in the minimum wage, and it’s clear that Ayotte is more interested in rigging the system for these outside interests than she is in protecting New Hampshire families.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:38:41.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
