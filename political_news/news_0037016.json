(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT\nAssociated Press Oct. 21, 2015 | 3:15 p.m. EDT + More By The Associated Press\nThe latest on the League Championship Series. The Royals can earn a return trip to the World Series with a win over Toronto in Game 5 of the ALCS, first pitch 4:07 p.m. The Mets also could wrap up the NL's spot in the Fall Classic with a win over the Cubs in Game 4 that's scheduled to start at 8:07 p.m. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT):\n3:11 p.m.\nOne loss away from elimination in the ALCS, the Blue Jays don't have $82 million catcher Russell Martin in the starting lineup against Kansas City's Edinson Volquez.\nDioner Navarro is behind the plate and batting seventh, because he's worked well with Toronto right-hander Marco Estrada. The pair teamed up in 20 of Estrada's 28 starts.\nMartin, who signed a five-year contract with Toronto last November. He hit .240 with a career-best 23 home runs and 77 RBIs this season.\nNavarro, who is in the final year of a two-year, $8 million deal, hit .246 with five homers and 20 RBIs in 54 games.\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nRoyals catcher Salvador has taken a beating this series, with fouls hitting off his mask, collarbone and one right below the Rawlings gold label — only for Gold Glove winners — on his chest protector, and that was just in Game 4. During the ALDS he even underwent concussion testing.\nBut Perez gave a broad smile when he sat down in the pregame interview room and blurted out, \"I feel great today, guys! Thank you very much.\"\n___\n1:05 p.m.\nManager John Gibbons knows do-or-die games this year. His Blue Jays trailed the AL Division Series 2-0 then won three straight to advance. The task is more daunting now, trailing the Royals 3-1 in the best-of-seven set. But his club could look no further than its own history for some motivation: Toronto led Kansas City 3-1 in the 1985 ALCS and lost.\nGibbons said in his pregame talk, David Price, Aaron Sanchez, Roberto Osuna and even R.A. Dickey, who threw only 48 pitches Tuesday in Game 4, are all available.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
