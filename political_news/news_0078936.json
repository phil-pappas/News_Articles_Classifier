Tipped by David Cameron as a potential successor to lead the party, it represents a marked turnaround in the fortunes of a politician whose (until then glittering) career had appeared to hit the buffers just a few years ago.\nThe author of the infamous \"Omnishambles\" Budget 2012 - hiking tax on caravans and pasties - his political pariah status was confirmed when he was publicly booed at the Paralympics.\nSo what changed? Here are the key points in the fall and rise of the Chancellor.\n:: The calm before the storm \n1 / 17 Gallery: George Osborne's Highs And Lows\nGideon Oliver Osborne was born in 1971 to Sir Peter Osborne and Felicity Alexandra Loxton-Peacock (pictured). He changed his name aged 13 to George because it was more straightforward\nMr Osborne became the youngster Chancellor in more than 100 years when he took up the post at the age of 38 following the 2010 election.\nAnd his rise to the top job had been relatively trouble-free.\nEducated at a top public school, the heir to a 17th Century baronetcy and the upmarket wallpaper firm Osborne & Little then headed to Oxford where, like Mr Cameron, he was a member of the infamous Bullingdon Club.\nAfter leaving university, Mr Osborne - who by then had changed his name from Gideon to George - travelled the well-trodden path of other Tory politicians, joining the Conservative Research Department.\nHe retook the Cheshire constituency of Tatton for the party at the 2001 general election.\nAt Westminster, he gained a reputation as a sharp political operator.\nBack in 2007, Mr Osborne is credited with scaring Gordon Brown out of calling a snap election that he might well have won, with a surprise policy announcement of a cut in inheritance tax.\nHe found himself at the centre of controversy in 2008 over claims he had tried to solicit a donation for the Tories from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska.\nBut he rode the storm and went on to play a central role in negotiating the historic coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats which handed Mr Cameron the keys to Downing Street.\n:: Pasty tax \nHard to believe but it was a hot savoury snack that burned the Chancellor politically.\nSlapping a tax on the humble pasty at the 2012 Budget led to a backlash, which sent any self-respecting politician to their nearest bakery to hungrily consume the faithful edible standby and vow to defend it from the grasp of the Exchequer.\nCombined with a series of other unpopular levies - granny tax, caravan tax - the Budget was branded an \"omnishambles\" and the buck stopped with Mr Osborne.\nIt was seized on by Labour as evidence of the Government being \"out of touch\" and amid falling poll ratings, the Chancellor came under fire from all sides.\nThe low point came when he was jeered at the Olympic Stadium in September 2012. \nMr Osborne has subsequently said it was this which made him realise how unpopular he had become and that he had to take action.\n:: Turning the tide \nAn image makeover saw the Chancellor sporting a new hair cut, dubbed by his biographer \"half-mod, half-Caesar\", while going on the 5:2 diet has led to him shedding two stone.\nThat is not to say efforts for the Chancellor to appear less aloof has all gone smoothly.\nIn 2013, he posted a picture of himself on Twitter the night before the comprehensive spending review with a burger.\nHowever, it transpired this was a \"posh\" Â£6.75 burger from the upmarket Byron chain.\nDespite this hiccup, Mr Osborne has been working at \"de-poshing\" and is often pictured on the factory floor or in a garage with a mug of tea in hand after a successful oil change.\nAnd he never seems happier than when in a high-vis and hard-hat championing his cause to create a so-called northern powerhouse - basically trying to rebalance the North-South economy.\nThe Chancellor has also worked to bolster his support base within the parliamentary party and has key allies in senior Cabinet positions.\n:: Eyes on the prize \nMr Cameron used a pre-election interview in his kitchen to announce he would be stepping down before 2020 , effectively firing the starting gun on the race to replace him.\nAnd he named the front runners: \"The Theresa Mays, and the George Osbornes, and the Boris Johnsons.\"\nAlthough privately Mr Osborne is said to have admitted he lacks the public support to become leader, he has certainly laid the groundwork.\nAs holder of the nation's purse strings he is also in a politically powerful position for the upcoming contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:56:52.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
