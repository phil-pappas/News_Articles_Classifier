(AP) - Activists in Boulder are hoping to draw 10,000 people for a march on the same day as the Republican presidential debate at the University of Colorado. \nThe Daily Camera reports that organizers are calling the Oct. 28 demonstration a march for civic engagement. It will begin at the Glen Huntington Bandshell in Boulder's Central Park and ends at the Coors Events Center, where the debate will be underway. \nOne of the march's organizers Gary Roland says groups that are interested in climate change, health care, gender equality and education are likely to participate. Interested groups have been asked to create a piece of art to demonstrate their vision for the future, which will be displayed across from the event center. \n(Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
