So the technology is here now. Germany expects to see autonomous vehicles on their autobahns within 2 years,” said Minister Bridges. \nMinister Bridges describes the individual car an under-utilised asset and, by increasing its utility, road congestion and carbon emissions can be significantly reduced. \n“The car, and maybe the parking lot, is one of the most under-utilised assets. On average, less than 80% of the space in the car is used, with often only one seat used and the car sitting in the driveway or carpark most of the time.” \n“This outlook for autonomous electric vehicles is very exciting, but, being realistic, we are doing things now on the ground to address transport and climate change issues. This will include reviewing vehicle emission standards next year,” concluded Minister Bridges. \nMinister Bridges spoke at a session on the role of transport in a low carbon New Zealand at the Climate Change & Business Conference.
