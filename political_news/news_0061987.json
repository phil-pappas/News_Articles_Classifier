While what the party intends to achieve at the congress is no secret, KMT headquarters’ insistence on remaining silent on the issues to be discussed at the meeting is said to have irritated Hung’s campaign team and KMT representatives supporting her. Mao Chia-ching, deputy convener of the campaign office’s public relations department, said many grassroots party representatives have expressed their concerns that many of the issues that have been put to a vote at party congresses were conducted by a show of hands. As for the voting method, KMT spokesman Yang Wei-chung said it would be determined in accordance with the KMT’s congress regulations, which stipulate the chairman of the meeting is entitled to decide whether to conduct voting by a show of hands or by ballot.
