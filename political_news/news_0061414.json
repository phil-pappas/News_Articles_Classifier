He said the agenda for the meeting was limited to the appointment of reform panels, drafting of directives to identify its work direction and approval for members to present their reform vision. The steering assembly had earmarked next Wednesday as the day to discuss the country's readiness for reform with the five core agencies. He said that though reconciliation was as important as reform, it was up to Tinnapan Nakata, hairman of the steering assembly, to make the final decision on the matter. The five core agencies are the National Legislative Assembly (NLA), the National Reform Steering Assembly (NRSA), the National Council for Peace and Order, the Cabinet and the Constitution Drafting Committee (CDC). Alongkorn said the NRSA had to work closely with the CDC to drive reform. The NRSA will also discuss the new charter with the CDC once it is completed, he said. However, it was also up to Tinnapan to decide if the NRSA would appoint a panel to gather opinions on the new charter and present recommendations to the CDC, he said. The members gave their recommendation on the drafting of directives before voting to appoint a panel to draft directives. The members suggested that the NRSA continue the work of the NRC rather than starting from scratch. They also suggested that apart from appointing 11 reform panels as required by the interim charter, the NRSA should appoint a committee to monitor the CDC's charter drafting process. The steering assembly then resolved to appoint a panel of 25 members to draft meeting directives. 323 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:43:11.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
