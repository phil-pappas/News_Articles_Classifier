He told The Sun the cuts would mean an \"empty pantry\" for many families. \"I hope this doesn't turn out to be our poll tax,\" he said. \nThe Conservative-supporting newspaper itself also came out against the chancellor, describing the cuts in an editorial as \"plain wrong\". The Sun Says today: On tax credits, the PM is kicking away the ladder from those with their foot on the first rung. pic.twitter.com/P7s1DaROkA \n— Tom Newton Dunn (@tnewtondunn) October 5, 2015 \nYesterday David Cameron insisted he would not be abandoning the cuts, despite criticism from Tories including David Willetts and Boris Johnson. \nAsked on Sunday if he intended to review the Budget proposals before they are introduced, the prime minister told the BBC: \"No, we think the changes we have put forward are right and they come with higher pay and lower taxes. \nAn estimated 60,000 people brought central Manchester to a halt on Sunday as they marched on the Conservative annual conference, demanding an end to austerity and the preservation of tax credits. \nIn a coup for the chancellor ahead of his speech, former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis has agreed to chair a new independent commission to oversee major road, rail, housing and power projects.
