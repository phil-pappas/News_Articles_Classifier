The Bank of England governor jumped on the bandwagon against climate change on September 29, telling Lloyd’s insurers that challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come.\n“Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late,” Mark Carney said, proposing that firms should disclose not only what they are emitting today, but how they plan their transition to the net-zero world of the future.\nCarney said the pressure for action by pointing to the threats to “financial resilience and longer-term prosperity. While there is still time to act, the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking”.\nCarney said proposals would probably be put to the G20 meeting in Turkey in November urging the world’s leading developed and developing countries to bring in tougher corporate disclosure standards so that investors could better judge climate change risks.\nThe G20 meeting will set the stage for the latest global attempt to combat climate change at a Paris summit in December. Climate change should be high on every business’s agenda.\nA day earlier cross the Atlantic, French President Francois Hollande urged world leaders at the United Nations to speed up their commitments to tackling climate change, so that an historic deal can be reached at the summit in Paris in December. The aim is to agree to limit temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.\n“Some will say to me that this is something that can be decided later at another conference,” Hollande told the General Assembly. “Well I assure you here, and I am saying this quite candidly, that if we don’t make this decision in Paris it will be not just late. It will be too late for the world.”\nHollande also announced on September 28 that France will increase its contribution to helping developing countries tackle climate change from €3 billion to €5 billion.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said informal talks on climate change in New York have revealed broad support for a durable deal in Paris. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Paris from November 30 to December 11.\nAs the world approaches the Paris climate conference, where it is expected to adopt a new global climate agreement, the European Union is striving to maintain its traditional leadership role on climate change. On September 18, EU environment ministers reconfirmed this objective and advocated a global long-term vision of “climate neutrality” in the second half of this century. The EU is likely to overachieve its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 from 1990 levels. With its target of reducing emissions by at least 40% by 2030, the EU remains the most ambitious international player on climate change.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:23.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
