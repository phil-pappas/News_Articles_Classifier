More Sheffield agrees £900m devolution deal \nMr Cameron was speaking ahead of the first Tory party conference since the party’s emphatic victory in May’s general election. \nThe Tory leader intends to make security the key issue of the four-day event, exploiting Labour’s divisions over the Trident nuclear deterrent. “We will provide security at every stage in your life,” he said. \nThe Tories have claimed repeatedly that Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of Labour poses a threat to Britain’s national and economic security. \nLabour’s new leader has said that he could not think of any circumstances where he would authorise military action — and he has insisted he would never use nuclear weapons as prime minister . \nMr Corbyn last week said Mr Cameron had undermined the security of millions of families with his cuts to the welfare state. \nThe prime minister insisted on Sunday that cuts to in-work tax credits would go ahead in the new year despite criticism from fellow Tories including David Willetts, a former Conservative minister who now chairs the Resolution Foundation think-tank. \nThe changes were part of reforms that would leave people better off — including a higher minimum wage — said Mr Cameron. \nHe also unveiled plans for a new GP contract to help deliver seven-day services for all patients by 2020. There would also be seven-day hospital services across half the country by 2018, he promised. \nDespite attempts to focus on other issues, the Tory conference is already being overshadowed by splits over Europe in the run-up to the EU referendum, as well as speculation about the contest to succeed Mr Cameron in a few years’ time. \nWith their first majority in the House of Commons for nearly two decades, many Tories are agitating for Mr Cameron to flex his muscles harder against Brussels. \nAt the same time there are jitters within the “In” side of the referendum campaign about Mr Cameron’s apparent ambivalence about EU membership. \nOn Sunday the prime minister said Britain needed access to the single market and to have a “say over the rules” governing it. \nBut he added that he would only campaign to stay in Europe if his renegotiation was a success. “I have always said that if I don’t get what I want I’m ruling nothing out,” he said. “I am fighting for these things, and I can’t guarantee I will get them.” \nMr Cameron is expected to use his speech on Wednesday to argue that Britain is better off within the EU single market but outside the euro and the Schengen free-movement area — but only as long as the renegotiation is a success. \n“We need Europe to be an answer to our competitiveness, not a threat to it,” he told the BBC. \nEurophile corporations have been advised by Downing Street to stay out of the debate until the renegotiation is complete. \nMeanwhile, the head of GE, the industrial giant — which employs 17,000 in the UK — said he was relaxed about whether the UK stayed in the EU. \n“As a global investor, it really doesn’t matter,” Jeff Immelt told the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s important that the UK has good relationships around the world, but I don’t really think that its place in the European Union makes that much difference.” \nTory MPs are likely to be incensed this week if the European Court of Justice on Tuesday forces Britain to give prisoners the right to vote in European elections — an idea Mr Cameron has described as “sickening”. \nGeorge Osborne gave a wide-ranging interview to the Mail on Sunday where he disclosed his one-time love of NWA, the hip-hop group and how he met his wife. \nThe interview is likely to be seen as part of an attempt by the chancellor to broaden his image in readiness for a leadership bid. \nMr Cameron has suggested that he will step down well ahead of the 2020 general election. \nWhile Mr Osborne is currently the bookmakers’ favourite, Mr Cameron said he was open-minded about his successor. “It is not up to me,” he told the BBC. “Sometimes the outsider wins.” \nAccording to the Sunday Times, some 18 ministers and former ministers have discussed the prospect of running. \nThey include familiar names such as Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Sajid Javid — but also newer MPs including Dominic Raab, Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom. Nicky Morgan, education secretary, said last week that she was likely to stand in the contest. \nMr Johnson is expected to tell the conference in Manchester that he has proved that he can beat the left in London in two mayoral elections. He will contrast his “one nation” belief in economic and social progress with Mr Corbyn’s “class war” rhetoric. \nTens of thousands of leftwing activists are expected to gather in Manchester today to protest outside the conference centre against Conservative spending cuts.
