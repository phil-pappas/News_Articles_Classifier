Those who give to charity should know their donation is going to further a worthy cause and this trust will never be abused.\nShare article \"We are building a new regulatory structure to make sure the right safeguards exist to protect those people at risk of exploitation. This should help the charities to draw a line under previous bad practice and I hope we will see even more people making donations and giving their time to help others in the months and years ahead.\"\nThese powers will add to changes in the Charities Bill that give the Charity Commission more teeth to tackle abuse.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:52:58.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
