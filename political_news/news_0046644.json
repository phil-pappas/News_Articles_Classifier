However, they said Russia and China, which have opposed the sanctions on Iran’s missile program, might block any such moves.\nMight? Will. Just like they will block any re-institution of any sanctions for the Iran Deal via “snapback”.\n“The United States will continue to press the Security Council to respond effectively to any future violations … Full and robust enforcement of all relevant U.N. measures is and will remain critical,” U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in a statement on Wednesday.\nIran has violated UN sanctions numerous times. Why would anyone think they won’t violate the nuclear deal?\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday conditionally approved the nuclear deal but warned it would be violated if any of the six world powers imposed any sanctions on any level and under any pretext.\nKhamenei is sending a pointed message, extortion, really, to Team Obama, telling them not to try anything or Iran will scuttle Obama’s “historic” and “legacy defining” deal.", "external_links": ["http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/429b2804/ping.blo.gs/2.0.gif", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/21/us-iran-missiles-un-idUSKCN0SF22320151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:53:36.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
