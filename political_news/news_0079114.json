More Scotland widens fracking moratorium \nThe comments from Mr Brown — who orchestrated a joint “vow” on powers issued by pro-union party leaders just before the referendum — will give weight to Scottish National party complaints of backsliding on the part of the British government. \nMr Brown said David Cameron, prime minister, was “simply wrong” to claim that legislation making its way through the House of Commons would deliver in full the powers for Scotland agreed in a cross-party deal last year. \nLegislation based on the deal, brokered by Lord Smith of Kelvin, failed to give the Scottish parliament a clear and unambiguous right to top up welfare benefits, Mr Brown said in remarks released ahead of a speech in Glasgow on Thursday. \n“Without the changes that give the parliamentary welfare top-up powers to Scotland, we face a perfect storm — an explosive cocktail of measures that could blow the union apart,” he said. \nFailure to live up to promises on welfare powers would come just when Conservative cuts would be hitting Scotland hard, Mr Brown said. “The government should avoid what would be seen as a double betrayal — breaking their promises to the poor and breaking their promise to deliver the Smith recommendations in full on the very powers that are needed to counteract welfare cuts.” \nThe UK government insists its Scotland Bill fully lives up to the Smith commitments and that SNP complaints are wrong that it would leave Westminster with a veto over new welfare payments. \nA government spokesman dismissed Mr Brown’s complaints. “The Scotland Bill delivers the Smith Commission agreement in full with no vetos,” the spokesman said. “The Scottish parliament will be given the power to top up reserved benefits and no one is going to stand in their way.” \nIn a reflection of the continued concern among Scottish supporters of the union, David Mundell, Scottish secretary, used a speech on the September anniversary of the referendum to stress that independence was “not inevitable”. \nMr Mundell defended the Scotland Bill, which gives Edinburgh substantial new control over tax and spending but has inspired little public enthusiasm. The Scotland secretary — the sole Conservative MP north of the border — waved aside calls for further devolution, saying the current legislation offered a “a stable devolved settlement . . . to which the alternative is independence”. \nMr Brown, who stepped down from the Commons this year before the May general election — in which his previously safe seat fell to the SNP by a landslide — also took aim at nationalist calls for full control over welfare. \nScotland should be able to override UK benefit changes if it was prepared to shoulder the resulting cost, but should at the same time retain the benefits of pooling welfare risk across the UK’s 60m people, Mr Brown said.
