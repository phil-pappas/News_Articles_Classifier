Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015 \n. @CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015 \nWhy is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate ?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015 According to Politico, during a conference call with the RNC Thursday, Trump's campaign threatened to pull out of the debate if candidates weren't allowed opening statements or if the debate went longer than two hours.\nTrump has in the past toyed with the idea of boycotting the presidential primary debates, suggesting in August that he would skip a CNN debate unless the network donated its profits to charity.\nCNBC will host both a top-tier and a lower-tier debate, and the focus of the debates will be the economy. The business network requires that candidates register 1 percent in eligible polls for the lower-tier debate. The top tier debate participants will need at least an average of 3 percent among these polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:08:20.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
