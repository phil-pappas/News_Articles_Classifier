Photo: Andrew Meares\n\"We have to stand up for the rule of law,\" Mr Turnbull told Fairfax Media.\nAdvertisement \"We have to stand up for a rules-based international order, which means that the strongest power cannot just do whatever it likes.\"\nHe outlined what he called the classic statement of \"real-politik\" in which \"justice is to be found only among equals\".\n\"As for the rest, the strong do what they will and the weak suffer as they must,\" he said.\n\"That is what the whole international order is designed to stop - to ensure that there is a rules-based approach to international relations, and it's very important to stand up for that.\n\"Now, as for the South China Sea, my own view, which I've expressed in the past, is I think China's policy there, or China's practice there, is quite counterproductive from China's point of view.\"\nHowever, Mr Turnbull declined to comment in detail on United States plans to use its navy to assert so-called \"freedom of navigation\" movements into the 12-mile territorial limit claimed by China around seven artificial islands it has constructed in the disputed Spratly group of islands.\n\"I've seen press reports about that, but I won't comment other than to say that, obviously, freedom of navigation is very important.\"\nHowever, China has shown no such reluctance to comment, with its state-owned news agency Xinhua observing on October 15: \"The United States could shoot itself in the foot if it proceeds with planned naval patrols in the adjacent waters off China's islands in the South China Sea, as such provocation will risk creating miscalculation and destabilising the region,\" it said in an editorial comment, branding the move as \"deliberately designed to challenge China's territorial claims\".\nIn other comments, it even likened the US strategy to its performance in the Cuban missile crisis 53 years ago - a stand-off with Soviet Russia which took the world perilously close to all-out nuclear war.\nChina's economic and strategic emergence and its relationship with the region took up a large slice of Mr Turnbull's interview, with the new leader stressing a deep interest in its economy and society and personal business experience after dealing with its bureaucracy at many levels.\n\"I can tell you I spend a lot of time thinking about China,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\"It's a country I'm not unfamiliar with. I'm very interested in its history and its economic transition. It is manifestly in our and in the world's interest for China's rise to be peaceful and it's in their interest.\n\"I've always been very frank with Chinese interlocutors. I don't say one thing here and another thing in Beijing ... I've been dealing with Chinese government at different levels for over 20 years. I set up a zinc mine in China. I was dealing with everything from the village council up to the ministry of minerals and geology in Beijing, so I'm not unfamiliar with the way Chinese government works.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:33:36.714+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
