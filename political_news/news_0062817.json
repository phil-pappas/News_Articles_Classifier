(The Associated Press) Comments \nSALEM — Republican Allen Alley, a Lake Oswego businessman who tried to become his party's gubernatorial nominee in 2010, has confirmed months of political whispers that he's seriously considering a run against Gov. Kate Brown. \n\"My position hasn't changed,\" he told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Wednesday. \"I would very much like to run for governor in 2016.\" \nBut Alley said his interest in a campaign comes with a caveat: He needs to make sure his business interests will remain well-tended if he steps away to run. To help make that point, he said he was in China on business last week. \n\"I'm very much focused on that and making sure we've got them properly financed and staffed and heading in the right direction before I make any decision,\" he said. \"You've got people who trusted you to really help them.\" \nAlley's entry would add intrigue to a Republican primary contest that's light on well-known candidates. Alley passed on a run in 2014. \nBud Pierce , a Salem oncologist with no previous political experience, is the party's most serious hopeful so far. He's promised to spend up to $1 million of his own fortune and has brought on veteran consultant Chuck Adams. \nRunning without significant opposition would allow Pierce to save money. But a competitive race would also help Pierce sharpen his political chops. \n\"Anybody who wants to run should run,\" Adams said when describing Pierce's thoughts on Alley's long-discussed ruminations. \"That's what the system is all about. Let's go have a debate about the issues. He's encouraged.\" \nAlley can self-finance his campaign if needed. And he still has name recognition in political circles. He ran for treasurer in 2008, losing despite a better-than-expected showing in Democratic-dominated Multnomah County. He lost to former Trail Blazer Chris Dudley in the 2010 gubernatorial primary. \nHe also could draw from his time, 2011-13, as chairman of the state Republican Party. Alley recently hosted a fundraiser for the state party attended by Idaho Gov. Butch Otter. \nAsked about the timing of any announcement, given that the filing window for candidates in next May's elections opened weeks ago, Alley pointed to the deadline for filing next year: March 15, 2016. \nHe also pointed to Dudley, who opened a campaign account in November 2009 and formally announced his run one month later. Alley acknowledged that he'd have less time than Pierce, who confirmed his run to The Oregonian/OregonLive in July. \nBut Alley also said his past statewide campaigns give him an edge, both in organizing a team and wooing donors. \n\"Ideally I would have announced by now if everything else was equal,\" he said. \"But I've got these commitments I've made to these companies, and I can't turn my back on them.\" \n— Denis C.
