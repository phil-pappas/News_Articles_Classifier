It would kill off a public health fund under Obamacare that the GOP has said is a \"slush fund\" for the Obama administration.\nAnd, importantly for many Republicans, it would also impose a one-year moratorium on federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

The House passed its latest repeal bill under the budget reconciliation process that lets members create privileged legislation in the name of meeting key budget goals, which is also legislation that can't be filibustered.\nThat means the Senate should be able to pass the bill with a simple majority vote, an easy proposition with 54 Republicans in the upper chamber.\nA Senate GOP aide said senators would consider the House's Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act in the near future, and would even be given the chance to take up amendments.\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., said Friday that the latest bill will let the GOP get further on the repeal of key Obamacare provisions than ever before.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM \"Under reconciliation, we are able to move legislation through the House and the Senate in an expedited manner and put a bill on the president's desk,\" he said. \"With the legislation before us today, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, we are using this powerful budgetary tool to help end Obamacare's attack on Americans health care and its attack on our economy.\"\nBut while Republicans are using reconciliation to get closer to ending some of the Obamacare provisions they dislike the most, it's still just a bill, and once it's passed by the House and Senate, it can be vetoed by President Obama.\nOn Wednesday, the White House said Obama would do just that.\n\"By repealing numerous key elements of current law, H.R. 3762 would take away critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle-class families,\" the White House said. \"The bill also would remove policies that are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs and that have improved the quality of care patients receive.\"\n\"If the president were presented with H.R. 3762, he would veto the bill,\" the White House concluded.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner McCarthy fired up, wants cuts in debt ceiling deal McCarthy said a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase makes no sense as it would just allow the debt to soar higher.\n  1:32 PM The White House message means Republicans would need a two-thirds majority vote to override Obama's veto, and Friday's vote shows the votes aren't there for an override in the House. A two-thirds majority in the House means around 290 votes are needed, and the House fell well short of that with Friday's 240-189 vote.\nTop Story Major public-sector union AFSCME endorses Clinton A union for state and local government workers says she has the best chance among labor-friendly candidates.\nBy Sean Higgins • 10/23/15 1:41 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:40:31.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
