Credits available under the Republican proposal would represent about 4 percent to 9 percent of that gap. \n\"This is a life-saving endeavor,\" said U.S. Representative Fred Upton, the committee's Republican chairman. He added that the pollution credit approach \"incentivizes automakers to invest in new safety technology that will save more lives.\" \nAuto industry representatives told the hearing the credits would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding crashes that cause traffic congestion which in turn dumps millions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. \n\"There is a direct link between reducing crashes and reducing CO2 emissions,\" said Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a Washington-based industry lobbying group. \nBut Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees fuel standards, said the auto industry is already adopting safety technology including automatic emergency braking and V2V communications and needs no additional incentives. \n\"Save lives, prevent injuries - that should be the highest incentive that anybody needs to add advanced technologies,\" Rosekind said. \nDemocrats called the proposal a mistake, as the committee investigates Volkswagen AG's ( VOWG_p.DE ) use of a software 'defeat' device to evade U.S. emission standards. \n\"This bill essentially creates a congressionally sanctioned defeat device,\" said U.S. Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's top Democrat. \n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Bill Rigby )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:44:04.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
