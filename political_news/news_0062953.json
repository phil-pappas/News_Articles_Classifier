The first test of his pledge is likely to come soon in the form of the defense authorization bill cleared by Congress on Oct. 7.\n\"The concerns that we've expressed about it is it advocates essentially the use of a slush fund for funding critically important national security priorities. We believe that's utterly irresponsible. And the president's indicated that he would veto it,\" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \"I don't believe, however, that it has been transmitted to the White House ... but everybody knows how this will play out.\"\nb| Also from the Washington Examiner Obama lets China off the hook for currency manipulation Treasury admits that the near-term trajectory of the China's currency is 'difficult to assess.'\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/19/15 5:42 PM Top Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:41.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
