But he added: “Due to existing commitments, the First Minister is unable to attend the dinner with President Xi.” \nLoading article content \nAsked if she felt snubbed by not being invited to the state banquet, the spokesman declined to comment. Nor would he respond to whether some people might have felt Ms Sturgeon should have attended the dinner with the Chinese premier during a rare state visit. \nThe new “golden era” of UK-China relations will see £30 billion worth of trade and investment deals completed, creating over 3900 jobs across the UK. \nSpeaking ahead of the state visit, which begins today, David Cameron said: “This is going to be a very important moment for British-Chinese relations…a real opportunity to deepen our relationship.” \nDowning Street made clear “nothing will be off the table” in the talks, including the “dumping” of cheap Chinese steel, blamed for the crisis in the industry and the loss of more than 5000 jobs, as well as human rights.
