I have two daughter of secondary school age and live in Bucks so we have the grammar school system here and in my view it work very very well.I have one daughter who went to the local non selective school, she would have struggles at the Grammar schools and she has done superbly in the recent GCSE results and the school have helped her develop into a hard working well rounded teenager.My other younger daughter is at the Local Grammar school, she would have been bored at the school my elder daughter is at, the younger excels when challenged and the way they are pushed at the grammar school is excellent.One of the very interesting trade offs you get certainly round here is that the non selective schools have improved and improved over the last 15 years to the point where for 6th form the grammar and non selective share a lot of resource with the different schools specialising in different subjects, all the schools do not offer all the subjects at A Level but they do collectively. Also due to competition both between the schools at a staff level and also at a pupil level the end results are not so dissimilar, they just get there in a different way.Both schools have what would be called middle class and working class in their catchment area and I see no bias towards middle class at the grammar and working class at the non selective.Yes there is pressure on the kids round here around the entrance exam time but it only lasts a couple of months and lets face it the kids will have periods of pressure so when do you start exposing them to pressure is the question, is at 10/11 too early, I personally don't think so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:48:06.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
