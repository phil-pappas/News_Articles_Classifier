Ted Cruz at the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua, N.H., on April 18, 2015. Editor's note: This story has been updated. Ted Cruz ’s presidential campaign raised $12.2 million in the third quarter of this year, an aide to the senator said late Thursday. The figure is about $2 million more than what the Texas Republican took in during the previous quarter, when he made waves by growing his campaign war chest to more than $14 million by the end of June. The third-quarter haul means his campaign has raked in well over $26 million since launching in March. It was not immediately clear how Cruz fared compared to all his competitors, who are not required to disclose their third-quarter finances until next week. Three GOP hopefuls are reported to have already revealed their totals: U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who raised $2.5 million; U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who raised $6 million; and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who raised $20 million. In announcing its third-quarter total, Cruz's campaign sought to project momentum by noting it doubled its total number of donations during the period. It also boasted of having more than 6,000 \"sustainers,\" or monthly recurring donors who cover all expenses of field operations. “Not only are we seeing a surge of new donors and recurring donors to our campaign, but also continued growth of our organizations in the early states and all across the country,\" Cruz said in a news release, repeating his mantra that the campaign is built for the \"long haul,\" especially when it comes to fundraising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:47:22.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
