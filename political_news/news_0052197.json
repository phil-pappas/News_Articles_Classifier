She said:\n\" When I first went to Depaul I was street homeless, after staying with friends and sofa surfing for a couple of years. My mam died when I was little and at 15, I had nowhere to go. Depaul Nightstop became a life-line for me. Even though I was v ery anxious and found myself very depressed, the hosts who were inviting me into their houses each night were lovely and very understanding and made me feel about more at ease.\n\" Within weeks, Depaul staff helped me move somewhere permanent. I spent 6 months in the supported accommodation until I went back to Depaul to join their other project Inline which means I now have my own flat through them! Thanks to Depaul I am now living independently and learning how to manage my own tenancy and I currently h ave a new job! \"\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nAbout Depaul UK\nNationwide homelessness charity Depaul UK provides over 125,000 bednights a year, supporting more than 50,000 homeless and vulnerable people since it was founded in 1989.
