Tony and Joe keep busy with paperwork Politics Live: Stephanie Peatling from Parliament It loomed as one of the toughest days for Tony Abbott - his first appearance in the chamber he had dominated as opposition leader and then commanded in office.\nNow he was back, returning not so much in triumph as defeat, the vanquished backbencher.\nBackbencher Tony Abbott is welcomed by Darren Chester during question time at Parliament House.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nHis obvious grief notwithstanding, the ousted PM showed no hesitation doing just that when a cheeky Coalition colleague, the Nationals member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, furnished his old boss with a slip of paper.\nWhat was on it? It was a membership application for the Nationals.\nThe gesture brought laughter from Abbott and from several MPs around - the subtext being, your own party might have knifed you, but there's another force in conservative politics that would welcome such a distinguished new addition to its ranks.\nOf course, what the good burghers of leafy Warringah on Sydney's North Shore might think of inheriting a Nat as their federal representative is an open question.\nAnd it does raise another question.
