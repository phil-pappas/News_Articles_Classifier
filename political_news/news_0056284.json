CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTampa Bay, Florida — The third special session on redistricting in Florida is underway in Tallahassee and that should have you fired up. \nState legislators are spending millions of your hard-earned tax dollars in a drawn-out fight. \nIt's to redraw Florida's congressional and state Senate districts. \nWe break down how these sessions are costing you big bucks. \nSeventy thousand dollars - that's about how much it cost you just today for Florida legislators to return to Tallahassee. \nAdd up the two previous special sessions on redistricting and that makes $11 out of your pocket as a taxpayer. \nPasco County Tax collector and former state Sen. Mike Fasano says that's outrageous! \nHow are they able to get away with this? \n“They get away with it because they don't care,” Fasano said. “Their goal is to draw districts, get districts that will re-elect themselves.” \nThis is how your money is being spent. It’s all on arguments over whether districts should be drawn with fair competition between Democrats and Republicans or whether they're drawn to favor the party in power. \n“Instead of just saying and waving the white flag, and apologizing to the people of this state, ‘that we did it wrong, we spent too much money, let’s get our job done correctly’ ... instead of doing that, they keep fighting it and spending more money,” Fasano said. \nSo what's the story behind the story? \nThe Florida Supreme Court shredded maps back in July saying they gave republicans an advantage. \n10 News political expert Lars Hafner says there is really only one solution. \n“The only way you get fair elections and fair representation is either the court does it or an independent commission does it that has some oversight to it,” he said. \nThis latest special session is slated for 19 days, that'll cost you more than $1 million. \nIf you’d like to contact your legislator, you can find his or her contact information by clicking here .
