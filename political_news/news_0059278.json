Are you kidding?\" Gale told the Daily Beast.\nThe White House got into the \"Back to the Future\" spirit, too - but avoided politics.\nIt released a letter from Michael J. Fox -- the star of the film -- about the promises that the future has in store.\n\"Call me an optimist, but I believe that by 2045 we'll find the cures we seek -- especially because of all the smart, passionate people working to make it happen,\" said Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.\n\"Doctors and researchers around the world are developing new tools to improve the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases, to tailor treatments -- for all illnesses -- through precision medicine, and to make life better for millions of people. This truly is the stuff of the future,\" he said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackToTheFutureDay?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/656824272065683456", "https://twitter.com/ChrisChristie/status/656817913245081600", "https://t.co/UG4nmTKHhp", "https://twitter.com/Mets", "https://t.co/hnfjIbEwcD", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/21/how-back-to-the-future-predicted-trump.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackToTheFuture?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:47:44.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
