But Ms Forbes noted that the downgraded growth rates for emerging market economies is still likely to be around twice as fast as in advanced economies. \nThe UK only has “limited direct exposure” to emerging markets, Ms Forbes stressed, adding the risks “appear manageable”. \n“This is especially true when considered relative to the strength of the UK’s domestic-led expansion — which shows all signs of continuing, even if at a more moderate pace than in the earlier stages of the recovery.” \nMs Forbes added that the emerging markets were a significant opportunity for British business, with the rise of the middle classes likely to increase demand for high-quality UK brands. \nWhile the markets have pushed out their expectations for the first interest rate rise into 2017, most city economists still have a late-spring 2016 rise pencilled into their forecasts. \nLast week, BoE governor Mark Carney reiterated his stance that the decision on when to raise rates is likely to come into “sharp relief” around the turn of the year. Bank forecasts are for inflation to begin picking up notably from the current near-zero levels in the spring. This is when the impact of the sustained fall in oil prices begins to work its way out of the year-on-year comparison. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
