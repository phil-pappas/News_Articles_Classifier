(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Sponsored Links By JULIE BYKOWICZ and THOMAS BEAUMONT The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush says he's collected $13.4 million in recent months to back his run for president. \nBut competitor Marco Rubio says he ended September with more cash in the bank, despite having raised less than half as much as Bush. \nThe two Floridians were among those who disclosed their fundraising totals for the third quarter on Wednesday. \nIn the increasingly heated contest for traditional Republican donors, the two campaigns sought to emphasize their advantages over each other. \nBush is the former governor of Florida, and he ended September with about $10 million in available cash. \nRubio is one of the state's two senators. He raised $6 million this summer and began this month with $11 million in the bank.
