Hard to believe, but sadly not really unbelievable. Eleven women (10 black, 1 white) in a book club were forced off the Napa Valley Wine Train for laughing too loud. Really? Yes. In 2015. Holy crap.... Here's the article: Was there a little too much Chardonne involved in the incident? Location: Earth Posts: 5,702 Would we even be having this conversation if it was a group of 25yo redheads or a group that resembled the cast of jersey shore? It sounds like they were being loud and annoying on a scenic tour in wine country. They were asked to act like adults and could not. Simple. Ever been to Napa. It's a bit pretentious. Fucking awesome. But fix your hair and grab your wallet. It's easily a thousand dollar afternoon. Well.... Quote: Employees of the Napa Valley Wine Train, which offers food and wine to passengers as they roll to Napa County wineries in updated Pullman cars, had asked the book club members to either be quieter or get off the train, Singer said Monday.“The book club clearly was fun-loving, boisterous and loud enough that it affected the experience of some of the passengers who were in the same car, who complained to staff,” he said. The company refunded the costs of the women's tickets, Singer said. Standard train tours cost between $124 and $234, according to the site. Counter to what Johnson told KTVU, Singer told the Times that the group’s removal from the train “wasn’t an issue of bias. ... It was an issue of noise.” Still, the company issued an apology reported in California media Monday, the Times reported. Johnson refused to accept the apology, telling SFGate.com that the company had failed to “accept responsibility” for the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:38:13.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
