He was 11 years old and utterly transfixed – and for years later haunted – by Jedda , the first Australian feature film to use Aboriginal actors in lead roles.\n\"It was a very powerful film set in the Northern Territory and, in a way, it mirrored aspects of the stolen generations,\" he tells Kerry O'Brien in Keating , the 794-page narrated oral history of his life in politics. \"It ended in tragedy for the two Aboriginal people and left me with a sense that this was their place and we were all interlopers.\"\nThen he watched Aboriginal boxers in Jimmy Sharman's boxing troupe getting \"belted up for tuppence ha'penny\" at Sydney's Royal Easter Show. \"And I went away thinking that this whole group of Aboriginal boxers in the Jimmy Sharman show was on the outer, copping the brunt of the game.\"\nIllustration: Andrew Dyson\nLater, after he became a politician, Keating saw Kim Beazley Sr deliver a speech about Aboriginal malnutrition that was so powerful that Bill Wentworth, Australia's first minister for Aboriginal Affairs, moved that the House adjourn for five minutes to recompose itself.\nAdvertisement These were some of the experiences that shaped the views Keating expressed six months after the High Court's Mabo decision of June 1992, in what may be the most important oration of his life in politics: the one known simply as \"the Redfern speech\".\nHis thesis was that Australia could never claim to be a first-rate social democracy until Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were extended the same opportunity and care, dignity and hope, as non-Indigenous Australians, and that the starting point for this was an act of recognition.\nFormer prime minister Paul Keating. Photo: Nic Walker\nIt is as true today as it was then: \"Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised ignorance and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us.\"\nNow, in an interview to coincide with the release of the book and public conversations with O'Brien in Sydney and Melbourne, Keating has spoken of the need to reach a compact, or treaty, or acknowledgement, that finally \"makes good our occupancy of the continent by rejoicing in the identity of the first inhabitants\".\nThe timing could hardly be more apposite, as a new prime minister contemplates what to do with the process that has meandered and stuttered along under four prime ministers: recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution.\nMalcolm Turnbull has slipped into the role with all the ease and confidence of a surfer returning to a favourite break. He knows where the dangers lurk, and is yet to give any indication of how he intends to proceed in an area that, despite being a priority of Tony Abbott, contains multiple difficulties.\nAside from a lack of consensus on the recognition question, or even the process for arriving at one, there are concerns that Abbott's decision to bring the portfolio into his department was a mistake, and doubts about whether his advisory body is representative.\nAfter initially resisting calls from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders for separate Indigenous conventions to reach a consensus on the question, Abbott agreed to the idea of them running concurrently with mainstream town hall-style meetings.\nThen, in an interview with me during his visit to the Torres Strait, Abbott signalled that two of the more ambitious proposals that are competing for Indigenous support were unlikely to gain his backing. These were for the insertion of a racial discrimination prohibition in the constitution and/or the setting up of an Indigenous advisory body that would be recognised in the constitution.\nSince then, if anything, there has been a strengthening of the view among Indigenous leaders that the proposition must include the insertion of a new section banning racial discrimination by government, as well as strong support for the Indigenous process to precede the wider engagement.\n\"There have got to be more serious over-arching discussions with the government, with a more representative group,\" says Pat Turner, formerly the country's most experienced and senior Aboriginal bureaucrat.\nNow Keating has tossed in a completely new approach to the discussion: that a compact or treaty be reached with Aboriginal people \"as a nation\" and then affirmed by constitutional recognition.\nBut he has also pinpointed the essential ingredient if any progress is to be achieved. \"It has to have this sort of great flourish of goodwill about it for it to be meaningful and for it to work,\" he tells me. Herein lies Turnbull's challenge. And opportunity, too.\nThere is no doubt that the electorate is craving a new kind of leadership and, perhaps, harbouring a nostalgia for the Keating big picture. Nor can there be any doubt about the level of hope and expectation that Turnbull is capable of providing.\nHis promising beginning continued on two fronts this week. The first was in his continued reaction to the brutal murder of Curtis Cheng and the threat posed by terrorism motivated by extremist political and religious views. Aside from the absence of numerous Australian flags and grim-faced men in uniform as props when he spoke, what was most striking was the more nuanced, measured tone.\nThen came the response to Labor's ill-advised pursuit of his multimillion-dollar investments in hedge funds based in the Cayman Islands, which culminated in a rhetorical flourish about being fortunate, working hard, paying tax and giving back.\n\"I do not believe that my wealth or, frankly, most people's wealth is entirely a function of hard work,\" Turnbull said. \"Of course, hard work is important, but there are taxi drivers who work harder than I ever have and they do not have much money.\"\nThe Keating comparison that came to mind was when John Hewson lectured him about not showing respect to the Queen, in 1992, and Keating replied: \"I was told I did not learn respect at school. I learned one thing: I learnt about self-respect and self-regard for Australia.\"\nSo far, Turnbull's performance has been all about settling in, changing the tone and responding to events, and there is nothing wrong with that. What we don't yet know is how big a canvas he is contemplating, or how ambitious the brushstrokes will be.\nMichael Gordon is political editor of The Age .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:28:29.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
