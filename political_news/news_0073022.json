They include talk about a single trash-hauling company for Lakewood, the city's passage last year of a construction defects ordinance and a grassroots coalition's victory over the city and Jeffco Public Schools to keep an open-space parcel from being developed.\nAdd in massive possible development along West Colfax Avenue in the wake of RTD's W light-rail line and high-density development planned for the northwest corner of the Federal Center along Union Boulevard and West Sixth Avenue, and the city's potential for political skirmishing is palpable.\nAdvertisement Joe Margotte is a long-time Lakewood resident and owner of the eatery Chicago Style Beef & Dogs on West Colfax. He boils down the city's upcoming election to growth vs. anti-growth interests. Or, as current candidate language is likely to chime: \"smart growth\" vs. \"overdevelopment.\"\n\"It's the future that most residents are worried about,\" Margotte said. \"The future of Lakewood is growth. The future of everything is growth.\"\nMargotte, a former West Metro Fire Rescue board member, said there's a current lack of housing in Lakewood, and high-density projects along Colfax and Union would benefit the city.\n\"We can't be stagnant,\" he said.\nCarl Worster, a Green Mountain-area resident for 42 years, has seen a lot of change, growth and development over four decades.\nHis hometown of 147,000 people is now the fifth-most-populous in the state.\nWhile Worster is not necessarily opposed to development, he is concerned about future traffic issues on Union Boulevard and along West Alameda Avenue, especially spillover traffic into his neighborhood.\n\"If it happens and when it happens, traffic on Union is going to be considerably increased,\" Worster said of the proposed Federal Center property sale to the city and the prospect of a 60-acre high-density development.\nMore high-density housing in the area — two high-rise apartment buildings already are going up nearby — would be palatable, Worster said, if the units are affordable.\n\"Where are people going to live affordably?\" Worster asked. \"I think it's a necessity from a practical standpoint.\"\nWorster, a retiree, said that he and his wife, Charlotte, had not yet decided on who to vote for in their Ward 4 race or the mayoral race, but \"certainly we will look at their platforms very carefully. What their view of the future is will certainly be a major part of our consideration.\"\nCandidates for office in Lakewood are sharing their views on a variety of issues. The League of Women Voters has hosted candidate forums, which can be viewed from the city website, and the city published candidate question-and-answers in the newsletter and website.\nResidents soon will cast their vote, perhaps in record-setting numbers.\nIn the city's 2009 election, 23,981 residents voted, according to the city clerk's office. In 2011 the number of voters rose to 29,621. In the last election, 2013, the number of voters leaped to 42,208.\nLakewood ballots will go out in the mail to residents starting Oct. 12. Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 3.\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or @kierannicholson\nLakewood candidates\nLakewood mayor\nAdam Paul\nRamey Kandice Johnson\nCity Council Ward 1\nJeffrey Charles Yeager\nCharley Able\nTy Hull\nCity Council Ward 2\nRichard C.
