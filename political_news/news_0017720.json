PAUL, Minn. — Conservative commentator Jason Lewis joined the race Monday for an up-for-grabs Minnesota congressional seat with a message about promoting smaller government and relaxed regulations.\nLewis said that after talking about public policy for decades, \"now I'm ready to make it.\" He is among a batch of candidates seeking the 2nd Congressional District seat that Republican U.S. Rep. John Kline will give up after 2016.\nKnown for jabbing members of both parties, Lewis said in an interview that he is undecided about whether to pin his hopes on winning a GOP endorsement or jump ahead to a primary regardless of who wins over activists in the district convention.\n\"I would like to save the party from some of the big-government Republicans in its midst,\" he said.\nIn the video, Lewis rails in the announcement against \"establishment politicians in both parties\" and \"backroom deals\" in Washington. If elected, he said he'll strive to cut federal spending across the board and reduce government regulations.\nLewis lost a prior bid for Congress in 1990 while living in Colorado. Later, he gained a following in Minnesota as \"Mr. Right\" of the airwaves and was frequently courted to seek office. He has been off the radio airwaves since 2014 but still does a regular Internet podcast.\nOthers in the race so far are Republicans David Gerson, Pam Myhra and John Howe, and Democrats Angie Craig and Mary Lawrence.\nLewis actually lives in a neighboring congressional district — right on the border, he pointed out — but there is no requirement that members of Congress reside in the district they represent. His home was in the 2nd district until the last redrawing of political maps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:21:53.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
