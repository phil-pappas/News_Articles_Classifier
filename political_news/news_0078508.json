US President Barack Obama said in his speech at the United Nations he was open to working with Russia, as well as Iran, to bring Syria’s civil war to an end. In a sign of compromise, Obama called for a “managed transition” that would result in the replacement of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who he called a tyrant. “We must recognise that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the prewar status quo,” Obama said.\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin warned in his speech that it would be a mistake to abandon Assad whose forces according to the Kremlin leader are bravely facing terror face-to-face.\nThe two leaders met for the first time in more than two years later on September 28, without reaching a breakthrough on Syria, a crisis that has strained their already tense relationship.\nObama insisted Syria’s future couldn’t include Assad, while Putin appeared to only want to bolster the standing of his longtime ally, casting him as the best defense against Islamic States militants. Even so, both leaders appeared interested in whether their meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly could yield progress toward ending Syria’s four and a half year civil war. “Strange is it may seem, there were many common points,” Putin told reporters. “There were also disagreements which we agreed to work together. I hope this work will be constructive.”\nJeff Mankoff, fellow and deputy director of the Russia & Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, told New Europe that there has to be some effort to coordinate in resolving the Syrian crisis given that both countries are actively involved. “There is so much confusion on the American side right now and I think we’re still trying to sort out to which extent we can actually collaborate on something with the Russians,” he said, adding that the rhetoric from Washington has gotten notably softer in the last couple of days about Russia’s role.\nMeanwhile, Putin urged the world to stick with Assad, arguing that his military is the only viable option for defeating ISIS. Russia has appeared to deepen its support for Assad in recent weeks, sending additional military equipment and troops, saying it is helping the government fight the Islamic State.\nPutin, without naming the US, accused Washington of trying to enforce its will on others and mulling a possible reform of the UN, which he suggested stands in the way of the perceived US domination.\nPutin, in what appeared to be undermine the role of the existing coalition bombing Syria, also spoke of creating “a genuinely broad international coalition” to fight the Islamic State. Putin called for the UN Security Council to meet and draft a resolution that would coordinate this effort. He said it should be “similar to the anti-Hitler coalition,” the point being that the US and Russia should get over their differences and work together against ISIS. Putin also called for strengthening the role of the UN.\nThe fact that Putin and Obama met at all underscored Obama’s acceptance of Russia’s increasingly prominent role in resolving the crisis in Syria. The meeting also highlighted Putin’s ability to command attention and shift it away from the Ukraine.\nMankoff told New Europe Russia has been successful in a establishing itself as a player whose interests have to be taken into account in Syria. Now whether this will end up helping Russia’s long-term interests that’s a separate question, he said, noting, “that is going to be an expensive commitment for Russia, there is the danger of getting in a kind of mission creep”.\nMankoff explained that if Russia does get pulled into the conflict it risks seriously exasperating the challenges that it is facing not only because of the costs but also because of the potential for blowback and the domestic potential political fallout.\n“This is not gonna end the conflict, it could have unanticipated consequences for Russia itself but at a minimum it does mean that the players in the Middle East including Iran and Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States do have to seriously take Russian interests into account as they try to impose some kind of solution in Syria,” the Washington-based analyst said.\nThe speeches of Obama followed more than an hour later by Putin dominated the opening of the annual General Assembly of world leaders.\nThe two leaders have long had a strained relationship with ties deteriorating to post-Cold War lows following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and Russia’s alleged role in backing rebels in Eastern Ukraine.\nWashington has sought to punish Moscow through a barrage of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, including no formal bilateral meetings between Obama and Putin.\nPutin also called for increased cooperation between the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union and China and harmonizing its cooperation with the European Union.\nFinally, Putin also said Russia plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and push for the introduction of new technologies that do not harm the environment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:46:38.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
