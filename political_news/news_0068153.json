The event was coordinated by Planned Parenthood under the banner of its first-ever National Pink Out Day , and in addition to the rallies, Planned Parenthood gathered 2.4 million signatures in a petition delivered to Congress and offered free STD testing at 28 sites.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Kathleen Kamphausen ​The organization said in a press release that National Pink Out Day is a response to the \"unprecedented attack on women's health\" happening in America today. As thousands rallied to support the organization on social media and in cities nationwide, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards defended the organization to House Republicans in a congressional hearing. Richards testified that 1 in 5 women has benefitted from Planned Parenthood, which provides low-cost health care and sexual education to 2.7 million Americans. But in recent months, thanks to a series of highly edited videos that allege Planned Parenthood illegally profits from the sale of aborted fetuses, the organization has come under attack from the conservative right and anti-abortion extremists. Planned Parenthood receives about $450 million in federal funding, none of which is used for abortion except in rare cases where the mother's life is in danger or is a victim of rape. According to Richards's testimony, \"less than 1 percent\" of health sites facilitate the donation of fetal tissue — and those that do abide by the federal regulations. Nonetheless, Republicans are pushing to defund the organization and some have even threatened to shut down the government to see this happen.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Kathleen Kamphausen More From Cosmopolitan New York's rally drew a diverse, intergenerational crowd who believe that women, not Congress, should be the only ones in control of their bodies. Cosmopolitan.com spoke to 11 of them about why they came out to support Planned Parenthood.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Kathleen Kamphausen Joanna, 73​ \"I'm a contributor to Planned Parenthood and I send money every month to their action committee. I was born in 1942, and my mother's gynecologist was a Planned Parenthood supporter. And I stayed with her and she was my gynecologist when my own first daughter was born 29 years later. That's a pretty long support period.\"\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Kathleen Kamphausen Vivian, 69 \"I feel like the media, especially, has been taken over by the Republican misinformation about what Planned Parenthood is all about. Although I certainly believe in reproductive rights and pro-choice, Planned Parenthood really provides a lot of primary health care for women and I want them to continue to be able to do that. I think it was the first place I got birth control, over 30 years ago.\"\nDebbie, 67 ​ ​ \"[My support for Planned Parenthood] started in my early 20s. If it weren't for Planned Parenthood and Women, Infants and Children, we would not have enough. We didn't have enough money for the co-pays to go anywhere else. I'm 67 now, and I stopped going to Planned Parenthood when I went through menopause. The services that were critical to me were the pap tests and the referrals for my mammograms, and once I had a lump in my arm and they wouldn't even let me out of the examining room to go home until they had made a referral with a surgeon, and it all turned out great. I'm so much more for the women's health care avenue aspect of it. Young women and college students need affordable health care.\" ​\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Kathleen Kamphausen ​​Jeremy, 35 ​ \"We're brovaries – bros for ovaries. Supporting women's rights issues is important for our democracy, to counter the lies that the right wing are actually saying. Planned Parenthood is a scapegoat for the right wing to not govern and address real issues that are facing our country, like people not getting access to health care, jobs, poverty. Planned Parenthood plays an important part in addressing those ails. They provide health care not just for women, but for members of the LGBT community and also for men, and sometimes they're the only health care providers that are there. So it's important to stand with them.\" ​\n ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1152/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x1066/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x2400/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x512/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x1066/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x853/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x1066/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x512/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/29/politics/planned-parenthood-hearing-cecile-richards/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x426/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x426/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x853/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x320/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x2400/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x1920/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x1152/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/events/404985053032696/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x512/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x426/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x653/gallery-1443562753-7h1a1169.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x653/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x320/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x653/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x960/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x960/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x320/gallery-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1470/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/us/politics/planned-parenthood-congress-republicans.html?_r=0", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443560470-7h1a0961.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x720/gallery-1443560272-7h1a0954.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x1470/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x853/gallery-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443562584-7h1a1030.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x1920/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x720/gallery-1443560926-7h1a0965-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:08:49.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
