(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) October 5 at 7:27 PM Regarding the Oct. 2 front-page article “ McCarthy’s Benghazi slip-up may aid Clinton ”:\nDid House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reveal anything not already evident when he acknowledged that the purpose of the House Select Committee on Benghazi was to bring down former secretary of state Hillary Clinton? To answer that, look back a few decades.\nDid Republicans in Congress, or for that matter Democrats, rise in fury at then-Secretary of State William Rogers in 1973 when Ambassador Cleo Noel and Charge d’Affaires George Curtis Moore were murdered in Khartoum , Sudan? Did they seek to hold then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger responsible when Ambassador Rodger Davies was killed in Cyprus in 1974, or when Ambassador Frank Meloy and economic counselor Robert Waring were gunned down in Beirut in 1975? No special committees were launched, nor was hardly a word heard from Congress. Rogers was not controversial. Mr. Kissinger was, but being foreign-born, he could not aspire to the presidency.\nDavid A. Korn , Washington\nThe writer is a former foreign service officer.\n●\nRegarding E.J. Dionne Jr.’s Oct. 1 op-ed column, “ Kevin McCarthy’s truthful gaffe ”:\nThe true value of the two-party system, I used to believe, was that one group of scoundrels could keep the other group honest. However, Kevin McCarthy now tells us that on top of salaries and benefits for politicos, taxpayers have to pay for that policing effort. And Mr. McCarthy crowed about the hearings investigating Hillary Clinton and Benghazi, which may cost taxpayers more than $6 million. Have these politicians no shame?\nPaul W.
