Punter Ryan Quigley had been added to the team's injury list as questionable with an injured right shin, and New York needed someone for the game Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\"I'm b ck!!!!\" Weatherford posted on Instagram, smiling while posing between wide receiver Eric Decker and cornerback Darrelle Revis for a photo at the Jets' facility in Florham Park, New Jersey.\nTo make room on the roster for Weatherford, the Jets waived-injured safety Jaiquawn Jarrett, who had been listed as doubtful for the game with a knee injury.\nQuigley had not appeared on the Jets' injury report all week, but took a hard shot to his right leg from Washington's Jeron Johnson on a blocked punt that Rashad Ross recovered for a touchdown last Sunday. Quigley has been the Jets' punter since 2013, and is averaging 42.4 yards per kick this season with a 32.5 net average.\nWeatherford played for the Jets in 2009 and 2010, helping them to consecutive AFC championship games. He spent the past four seasons as a fan favorite with the Giants, and was part of the Super Bowl-winning team that beat the Patriots in February 2012.\nHe was released by the Giants before this season and has not played since. The 32-year-old Weatherford has averaged 44.5 yards per punt, with a 37.8 net average in his career that has included stops with New Orleans, Kansas City and Jacksonville.\nWeatherford has kept busy while not playing, frequently appearing on New York-area radio and TV sports shows as a guest or co-host. He was on 98.7 ESPN New York on Saturday with co-host Dave Rothenberg when he announced he would be signing with a team, but couldn't reveal at the time where he was heading.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
