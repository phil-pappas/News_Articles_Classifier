Renee Ellmers stood up in a private meeting of Republican lawmakers on Friday and thanked them for their \"prayers and support\" after they received “nasty emails” accusing her of having an extramarital affair with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, according to multiple sources in the room. She did not mention McCarthy (R-Calif.) by name, detail the content of the emails or provide any other information.\nSources close to Ellmers and McCarthy say the accusation is unfounded, and assert that it is being spread by a discredited troublemaker. McCarthy has publicly denied that any personal problems were behind his stunning decision to withdraw from the speaker's race on Thursday.\nEllmers was referring to emails sent to dozens of Republican lawmakers recently by Steve Baer, a Chicago-based GOP donor, claiming the two Republican lawmakers were engaged in a romantic relationship.\nEllmers' attorney also sent a \"cease and desist\" letter this week to GotNews.com, a website that alleged early in 2015 the two were having a longstanding affair. This all came as McCarthy was running for speaker.\nRumors of a romantic relationship between McCarthy and Ellmers have been swirling in Republican circles for years.\nBoehner tells House Republicans to hang together By Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan\nEllmers \"thanked members for prayers and support as a result of the nasty and malicious emails being circulated by outsiders,\" said Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina lawmaker. Ellis did not respond to further questions about the cease and desist letter or Ellmers' relationship with McCarthy. In a story posted late Thursday on DailyMail.com, however, Ellis said \"the allegations in question are unequivocally and indisputably false.\"\nA McCarthy aide said the majority leader's office did not have comment on Ellmers’ remarks.\nBaer is a controversial figure who has regularly emailed Republican lawmakers. According to a profile in National Review, Baer sent an email to Republicans after the 2013 government shutdown that said, “Now let us dine on RINO flesh,” referring to the phrase “Republicans in name only.”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3265630/Did-rumors-love-affair-Kevin-McCarthy-married-congresswoman-torpedo-elevation-House-speaker-Internet-goes-berserk-guesses-alleged-mistress-denies-all.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:23:34.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
