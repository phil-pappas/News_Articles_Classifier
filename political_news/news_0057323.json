Charlie Crist, once a Republican, has announced he will be running for Congress as a Democrat.\nThis will be Crist's third attempt to return to politics after losing a Senate bid in 2010 and Florida's gubernatorial race last year. He was elected governor as a Republican before becoming an independent and then a Democrat.\nCrist, who made the announcement Tuesday in his hometown of St. Petersburg, will be running for Florida's open 13th District based on a new congressional map waiting to be approved by the Florida Supreme Court. The new map, which should be adopted soon, puts the district in the southeast corner of St. Petersburg, an area known to have a heavily Democratic population.\nGreat turnout for @CharlieCrist announcement... #FlaPol #sayfie pic.twitter.com/Qzzv3fkzhS — Amelia Chasse (@AmeliaChasse) October 20, 2015 \n  Chelsea Clinton says her mom's Benghazi testimony will be 'remarkable' \"I think every opportunity my mom has, she proves again and again why she should be our next president.\"\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/20/15 12:00 PM &quot;Public service is in my heart.
