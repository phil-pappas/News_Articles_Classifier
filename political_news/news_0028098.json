It included a brutal attack on Corbyn as holding a \"security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating\" ideology. The conference also saw over 60,000 people demonstrate against the government's austerity measures. \nIn his speech, Hunt said: \"This week we have watched, with our face pressed against the glass, not only a Tory victory parade at their conference in Manchester, but also the sight of them manoeuvring for succession and laying the foundations for their next election campaign too. \n\"But our country cannot afford to have Labour left on the street outside, protesting about the decisions of the powerful within. My ambition is a Labour Party returned to power on a new appreciation of its principles and purpose.\" \nLike Cameron, Hunt also warned his party not to pay too much attention to conversation on social media. \"What the algorithms which underpin our digital lives do is take information about us and fire similar information back at us,\" he said. \n\"Google’s skill at offering you what it knows you like is now directing you towards what you want to hear, from people like you. \n\"And I think this is radicalising political opinion amongst the congregation – from left to right - emboldens group-think and disconnects the hyper-engaged from the sentiments of the wider electorate. \n\"A Labour Party perennially on the outside is bad news for Britain. And you are only trusted to form a government if you listen to the real, not imagined, concerns of people’s lives.\" Also on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:06:11.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
