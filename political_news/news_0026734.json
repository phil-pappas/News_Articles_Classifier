We do have religious freedom.\" \"It depends,\" Trump said, \"if the mosque is, you know, loaded for bear.\" Meet the Candidates: Who's Running in 2016 In a statement Wednesday, the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) asked the GOP frontrunner to better explain his definition of \"extremism\" and to elaborate on the criteria his administration would use to close any house of worship. \"Donald Trump's apparent willingness to close down American mosques that he deems 'extreme' is totally incompatible with the Constitution and our nation's cherished principle of religious freedom,\" CAIR's government affairs department manager Robert McCaw said in the statement.
