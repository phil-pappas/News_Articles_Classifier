(Picture Courtesy: File photo) Washington : Being sedentary for too long during the day may be a risk factor for chronic kidney disease, scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have found. Sedentary behaviour (engaging in activities in the seated or lying position that barely raise the energy expenditure above resting level) is commonly confused with physical inactivity (lack of moderate/vigorous physical activity). Sedentary behaviour is an important risk factor for diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, but it's unclear whether it also increases the risk of chronic kidney disease. Srini Beddhu from University of Utah School of Medicine, along with Dominique Ferranti and their colleagues examined this topic in 5,873 adults in whom intensity and duration of physical activities were measured. The researchers found that each 80 minutes/day (assuming 16 awake hours/day) increase in sedentary duration was associated with a 20 per cent increased likelihood of chronic kidney disease. This association was independent of moderate/vigorous physical activity duration, demographics, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, lung disease and mobility limitations. Moreover, this association persisted even after adjusting for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. \"Sedentary behaviour, which is not mere lack of moderate/vigourous physical activity, is likely an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease,\" said Beddhu. \"It needs to be tested whether sedentary behaviour affects the progression of chronic kidney disease, and thereby, increases the risk of end stage renal disease. \"Hence, interventions targeting sedentary behaviour to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease need to be conducted,\" Beddhu said. The study will be presented at American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2015 next month at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego. kidney disease diabetes hypertension obesity Also Read Obsessing over calorie counts may fuel obesity crisis Diet drinks actually fuel obesity, researchers claim Fibre-rich diet prevents diabetes and obesity Diabetic kids can lead normal life: Expert", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/lifestyle-health-and-wellbeing/article/leading-sedentary-life-can-increase-kidney-disease", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kidneys_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kidneys_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:46:53.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
