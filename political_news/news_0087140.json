The term liberal comes from the Latin liberalis, which means pertaining to a free person. Within the confines of political discourse, liberalism prescriptively refers to one open to new behavior and willing to discard traditional values, the antithesis of Traditional Values, a revered cornerstone of conservative ideation. Why, then, does it appear Democrats have a tendency to disavow programs that would coincide with their adoptive moniker? Seeking insight regarding this political malaise, I was able to pick the brain of Professor Noam Chomsky, renowned philosopher and linguist. The worlds leading political theorist had this to say about todays incarnation of the Democrat and Republican parties: Both parties have shifted well to the right, the Republicans almost off the spectrum. Respected conservative commentator Norman Ornstein described them, plausible, as a radical insurgency that has largely abandoned parliamentary politics. Democrats now are mostly what used to be called moderate Republicans. Theres ample evidence that most of the population, at the lower end of the income spectrum, is effectively disenfranchised  their representatives pay no attention to their opinions. Moving up the income ladder, influence increases slowly, but its only at the very top that it has real impact. Plutocracy masquerading as formal democracy. The frameworks of this nations political system is an ostensible democracy as studies reveal, which is only a secret to the apathetic or those living under a rock. In an in-depth interview to be published later this week, Professor Justin Lewispolitical analyst and media criticechoes the sentiment of Chomsky regarding the erasure of left representation, which makes sense given their collaborative work titled The Myth of the Liberal Media: The Propaganda Model of News (see video here). Much of Lewis research focuses on how theres many issues wherein the U.S. public are to the left of both main parties but that such polling results are rarely referenced due to it conflicting with conventional political agenda. By contrast, what we tend to see is polling data that reinforces views aligned with mainstream party debates: That which is Part of the Plan. Now, regarding my despondency. None of the presidential hopefuls impress me, which is par for the course. That said, Bernie Sanders appears to be an apparition of hope for real social progress that would be absent within the neo-conservative seriously-not-liberal regime of Hilary Clinton and would degenerate midst the clutches of any Republican candidacy. There are significant drawbacks with Sanders (e.g., insinuations that hed maintain business as usual regarding foreign policy is egregious), but in a race advertising 31 flavors of the horrible and grotesque, hes a somewhat bitter-sweet relief for those desiring a faint taste of liberal representation. . . . As more and more people in this nation, on the left and right of the spectrum, fall deeper into poverty, the rise of the apparition of \"liberal\" gets more clear. Sanders is the closest we have been to a party of the people in decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:33:59.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
