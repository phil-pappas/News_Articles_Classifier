Expedition 45 commander Scott Kelly and flight engineer Kjell Lindgren of NASA will conduct both spacewalks, the first of their careers, and the 189th and 190th of the space station.\nThe spacewalks flank the 15th anniversary of continuous human presence aboard the space station, which is Nov. 2.\nThe participants for the Oct. 22 briefing will include:\nKenneth Todd , International Space Station operations integration manager Michael Lammers , lead Expedition 45 flight director Grant Slusser , lead U.S. 32 spacewalk officer Arthur Thomason , lead U.S. 33 spacewalk officer Reporters may attend the briefing at Johnson and other participating NASA centers, or ask questions by calling the Johnson newsroom at 281-483-5111 no later than 1:45 p.m.\nThe first spacewalk on Oct. 28 is the 32nd U.S. spacewalk, and will focus on station upgrades and maintenance tasks, including installing a thermal cover on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector that has been attached to the station since 2011. NASA TV coverage will begin at 6:45 a.m. , with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 8:10 a.m.\nThe second spacewalk on Nov. 6 is the 33rd U.S. spacewalk, and will attempt to restore the port truss ammonia cooling system to its original configuration. A spacewalk conducted in November 2012 tried to isolate a leak in the truss' cooling supply, but the leak was subsequently traced to a different component. NASA TV coverage will begin at 5:45 a.m. , with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 7:10 a.m.\nFor NASA TV downlink information, schedules and to view the news briefing, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/nasatv\nFor more information about the International Space Station, its research and crew, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/station\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\n releases/nasa-tv-to-air-briefing-on-two-upcoming-spacewalks-by-us-astronauts-300160548.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://twitter.com/astro_kjell", "http://www.nasa.gov/station", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC29512&Transmission_Id=201510151220PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC29512&DateId=20151015", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-tv-to-air-briefing-on-two-upcoming-spacewalks-by-us-astronauts-300160548.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv", "https://twitter.com/StationCDRKelly", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:22:51.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
