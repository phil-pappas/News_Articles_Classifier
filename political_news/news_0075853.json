Anyone can make a submission in support of, or objecting to, these proposals. Details of these proposals will be available on the LINZ website from 29 October. \nFrom 29 October submissions can be made in writing to the Secretary for the New Zealand Geographic Board, via the LINZ website, to nzgbsubmissions@linz.govt.nz, or via post to: Level 7, Radio New Zealand House, 155 The Terrace, PO Box 5501, Wellington 6145. \nVisit the LINZ website for information about general place naming and the NZGB. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
