Ewing, in his book, will investigate how a \"more, better, faster\" ethos fuelled one of the greatest frauds in corporate history, said the Hollywood Reporter.\nThe German car company had programmed their diesel cars so that US standards emissions were met only when the car was undergoing emissions testing.
