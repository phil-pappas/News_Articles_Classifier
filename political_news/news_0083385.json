There is already great work being done teaching children how maths, science, engineering and technology can be applied – our increasingly hi-tech economy will only continue to rely on more people with the skills to make a difference.” \n“With over $900,000 of funding requested across all submissions for $100,000 worth of funds, the decision making process is going to be a competitive one!” \nDean Gilbert, Chevron NZ General Manager, said STEM is an area of education that Caltex feels particularly passionate about, with its potential to change people’s lives for the better. \nGilbert said, “This is the first time we have launched “Fuel Your School” in New Zealand and we are excited to be able to help develop STEM skills in classrooms across the country. “Caltex is always seeking unique ways to support Kiwi communities, and we’re looking forward to seeing what STEM-based activities schools are wanting to pursue if they’re granted funds.” \nEvery time a customer redeemed their AA Smartfuel savings at Caltex service stations nationwide* between 27 July and 23 August, Caltex donated 25c to the Fuel Your School fund, with the goal to reach $100,000 for Kiwi schools. \nFor more information about Fuel Your School, visit: http://fuelyourschool.caltex.co.nz . \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:53:37.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
