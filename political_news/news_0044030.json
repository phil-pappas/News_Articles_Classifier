Kevin McCarthy’s to lose, but even if he overcomes a last-minute challenge from a conservative rival, the California Republican will take the gavel as a weakened leader.\nWith a nomination election set for Thursday, McCarthy appears to have rounded up the votes he needs to secure the preliminary round to take over once Speaker John Boehner steps down at the end of the month.\nAs the No. 2 Republican, McCarthy, now the majority leader, is next in line for the job and, until recently, faced only a nominal challenger.\nChip Somodevilla U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, shown speaking last year during a news conference about Benghazi, is running for House Speaker from the conservative wing of the GOP. But the surprise entry of Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, brings a new dynamic to the leadership race, and shows just how unsatisfied Republicans both in and out of Washington are with the status quo.\n“I’d bet he ends up cobbling together enough votes to become the speaker, but how well he can manage is another story,” said John J. Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College. “It’s a very difficult time to be speaker. It’s a time where success is defined as avoiding catastrophe.”\nMcCarthy’s allies remain confident he has the 218 votes needed to win the final House floor vote scheduled for Oct. 29, but Chaffetz predicted he’ll fall short.\nAlex Wong U.S House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California, speaks during a media briefing after a House Republican Conference meeting September 29. “If we just promote existing leadership, yikes, that’s going to get ugly for us at home,” Chaffetz said. “There will eventually be a realization we better darn well put up a fresh face, somebody who can speak.”\nBecause GOP conservatives control a powerful block of about 50 votes, their support can make or break candidates.\nChaffetz has already suggested the direction he is heading, calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, “flat out wrong” for taking the threat of a government shutdown off the table in negotiations over Planned Parenthood funding.\nThat sort of hardened approach may win support from conservatives . But those promises will prove much tougher for the new speaker to deliver, as Boehner repeatedly learned in the House GOP’s failed attempts to push a conservative agenda on a Democratic president with a veto pen.\nMcCarthy has remained largely out of the limelight since his high-profile TV stumble in which he appeared to suggest that the GOP-led House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack was partly aimed at weakening Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Chaffetz capitalized on the remark in mounting his long-shot challenge.\n“We need a speaker who speaks,” Chaffetz told reporters this week, promising his communication skills would be better than McCarthy’s often mangled syntax.\nMcCarthy remained away from Washington at a GOP fundraiser Monday in Pittsburgh, and on Tuesday he continued mop-up a week after his televised Benghazi gaffe, which he has since retracted.\n“The mission of the Select Committee on Benghazi is to find the truth – period,” McCarthy said in a statement Tuesday.\nA viable alternative\nThe conservative Chaffetz provides a viable alternative for those who are worried that promoting McCarthy would be seen in their home districts as more of the same insiders at a time when constituents appear to prefer outsiders.\nAnd he appears to be gaining traction.\nHow the race has come to this for McCarthy is another episode of discontent in the Republican Party that has played out in Congress and on the presidential primary trail.\nMcCarthy and Chaffetz in many ways should be natural allies. Separated by just two years in age and their arrival in Congress, they are relative newcomers to Washington, and part of a generation that prefers conflict to compromise.\nBoth sleep in their offices at night, as they try to prove they haven’t succumbed to Washington’s comforts. Friends as they are, Chaffetz headlined McCarthy’s annual Bakersfield fundraiser in May.\nYet last Friday, at a fundraising event in New York City, the two men stood “eyeball to eyeball” as Chaffetz told his colleague he was launching a challenge for the job.\n“He wasn’t happy,” Chaffetz recalled Monday, as he outlined his leadership goals in the committee room where he wields the gavel as House Oversight chairman.\nChaffetz readily acknowledges he is late in the race and lacks the sophisticated whip-counting operation needed to pull off a victory. But he believes enough GOP colleagues agree with him that voters want change.\nThe inside track\nMcCarthy’s affable personality, and his prodigious party fundraising, have earned him goodwill among colleagues. They have been supportive, if resigned, despite his sometimes inartful comments.\n“Certainly he’s got the inside track,” said Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wisconsin. “I would be stunned if somebody beat him.”\nBut the rise of Republican voter unrest on the campaign trail and McCarthy’s gaffe last week has led some Republicans to question whether McCarthy will win over critics to secure the job.\n“It’s still an open question and will be for a while,” said the House GOP aide.\nThe challenge is apparently strong enough that Boehner pushed back Thursday’s scheduled elections for offices lower down the leadership ladder. They will be held after the Oct. 29 floor vote for speaker.\nThat means McCarthy would not have to give up his current job in pursuit of a new one.\nSelecting a speaker\nAt 11 a.m. Thursday, Republicans will gather behind closed doors and vote by secret ballot for their candidate for the most powerful job in the House, a post that’s second in line to the presidency — Speaker of the House.\nThe Republican caucus — at 247, the largest majority in more than 80 years — will select its nominee to replace Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who has announced he is stepping down at the end of October after nearly five years in the post.\nBut that’s not the final word. The full House — 435 Republicans and Democrats — will vote for speaker on Oct. 29.\n— The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/06/3a/ef/186316468.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/06/30/3c/490524658.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-07T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:55:43.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
