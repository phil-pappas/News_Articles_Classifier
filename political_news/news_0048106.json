This is sycophancy at its worst. Even a self obsessed man like Mr Modi may feel embarrassed,\" Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed tweeted.\nWhen contacted, Goel said that he was \"not comparing\" the personalities who he said were \"saints in their own rights\".\n\"While Gandhi had liberated the country, Modi is liberating us from corruption, poverty and has invigorated the entire nation by his relentless work. Modi is working like a saint by sacrificing his personal life for the country. Even the foreign countries and their media are admitting this,\" Goel said.\nJD-U President Sharad Yadav took potshots at Goel saying the BJP leader is doing all this to get a ministerial berth in Narendra Modi government.\n\"Goelji could not become a minister. He is very pained at not being included into the Council of Ministers. Goel is my friend. He should have been given a place there. Since he is not getting that, he is doing all this,\" Yadav said. AAP spokesperson Ashutosh said the situation was \"amusing\".\n Modi Mahatma Gandhi Congress nation Also Read Kashmir BJP leader defies High Court order, to host ‘beef party’ Land acquired for poor lies unutilised Vijayawada: Agent dupes 42 people of Rs 1 crore Show of solidarity for Palestine", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Modi-and-Gandhi.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151001/nation-current-affairs/article/bjp-mp-sparks-controversy-says-modi-saint-mahatma-gandhi", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Modi-and-Gandhi.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:51:22.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
