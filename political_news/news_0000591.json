And only once did managers try to prevent the violations of department policy. \n\"This episode reflects extremely poor judgment and a lack of care on the part of a number of Secret Service employees,\" Inspector General John Roth said in the report. \nChaffetz said both the directors of DHS and the Secret Service had called him to apologize. \n\"That ain't good enough,\" he said. \"I worry that if they're doing this to me, they're doing it to who knows how many other people.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:17:46.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
