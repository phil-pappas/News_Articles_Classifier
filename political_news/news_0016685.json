Republicans floated several possibilities as replacements, with some even offering the idea of an “interim” or “caretaker” speaker. But lawmakers were still digesting the news, and huddling to plot a way forward, and it wasn’t clear that any of the suggested names could win the 218 votes needed to hold the speaker’s gavel.\nWith McCarthy out, Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida and Jason Chaffetz of Utah are still in the running. Webster was endorsed by the House Freedom Caucus on Wednesday and several lawmakers in that group confirmed that they will still back the former Florida state legislator.\n\"We're staying Webster. Webster could be caretaker. That's the thing about Webster, it wasn't about him it was about the process,\" said Rep. Raúl Labrador of Idaho, a board member of the Freedom Caucus.\nBut if McCarthy was unable to gather 218 votes, because of strong opposition on the right, it’s hard to see how Webster or Chaffetz could muster enough votes from the party’s center to win the election.\nSome Republicans have discussed the idea of an interim speaker — elected only to serve until the end of 2016. Such an interim would likely be a retiring member with at least some cross-party appeal, who could serve as a kind of caretaker while the party sorted out its internal differences.\n\"I don't know of any candidate, from either, who can get 218 votes....It's probably the most difficult job in Washington, D.C. It's hard to pull together 218 votes in the House,\" said Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a supporter of Speaker John Boehner.\nWall Street rattled by House GOP bedlam By Ben White\nReps. Candice Miller of Michigan and John Kline of Minnesota, who are both retiring, have been floated as possible interim candidates. Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who has served in Congress since 2003, was also mentioned by fellow lawmakers as a possible caretaker.\nAnd National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Greg Walden of Oregon told reporters he would \"consider\" running as an interim speaker.\nA spokesperson for Kline did not rule out the possibility that his boss could be a contender if approached by Republicans.\n“Congressman Kline is confident House Republicans will select someone who can do what’s best for our country and this institution,\" Troy Young said in a statement.\nRep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia is also being floated as a potential interim speaker.\nOf course, there are several popular Republicans who’ve been urged to run by their colleagues, but have steadfastly refused to throw their hats in the ring. GOP lawmakers have long looked to draft Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Ways and Means Chairman and former vice presidential candidate, into serving. But Ryan reiterated on Thursday that he won’t run to replace Speaker John Boehner, who first announced his retirement last month.\nMcCarthy drops out, House in chaos By Jake Sherman , Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nHouse Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio has also been mentioned as a possible candidate but he said during a closed-door caucus meeting on Thursday that he has no interest in being speaker.\nThere is also Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican. He is incredibly popular with Republicans and his close friends already tried to draft him into the race earlier. So far, though, he's refused their entreaties and opted to stay focused on his chairmanship of the Select Committee on Benghazi.\nAnna Palmer contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:21:01.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
