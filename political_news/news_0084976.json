To say it was just another day in America would be wrong, because we average more than one of these horrible events per day. Thursday was the 274th day of 2015 and this was the year's 294th mass shooting. The deceased gunman, identified as 26-year-old Chris Harper Mercer, owned 14 guns, according to law enforcement officials, all of them purchased legally. The New York Times reports he brought \"six guns, multiple extra ammunition magazines and a flak jacket\" with him to the college. As is to be expected, details about the shooting, the shooter, and what led him to this violence are still coming into focus. But some have emerged. From the Times : Family members of some survivors said their relatives told them that the gunman, identified as Chris Harper Mercer, 26, specifically targeted Christians. Law enforcement officials have not confirmed that. “‘Are you a Christian?’ he would ask them,” Stacy Boylan, father of Anastasia Boylan, 18, told CNN. “ `And if you’re a Christian, stand up.’ And they would stand up and he said, `Good, because you’re a Christian, you’re going to see God in just about one second.’ And then he shot and killed them, and then he kept going down the line doing this to people.” He said his daughter was shot in the spine but survived. This morning, on his Facebook page , Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey reacted to the news as foolishly as one might expect. His take, in full: As I scroll through the news this morning I am saddened to read the details of the horrible tragedy in Oregon. My heart goes out to the citizens of Roseburg — especially the families and loved ones of those murdered. The recent spike in mass shootings across the nation is truly troubling. Whether the perpetrators are motivated by aggressive secularism, jihadist extremism or racial supremacy, their targets remain the same: Christians and defenders of the West. While this is not the time for widespread panic, it is a time to prepare. I would encourage my fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to think about getting a handgun carry permit. I have always believed that it is better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it. Our enemies are armed. We must do likewise. https://www.tn.gov/safety/article/handgunmain We certainly agree with Ramsey's first paragraph and his second starts out reasonably enough, noting the increase in mass shootings and various motivations for some recent ones including \"racial supremacy\" — the primary motivation for the Charleston shooting was white supremacy, but for Ramsey to even acknowledge a racial dynamic to such an event is something. It's the third paragraph where he decides to go full Ramsey, with a statement so dumbfounding it could stun a rhinoceros. \"While this is not the time for widespread panic, it is a time to prepare. I would encourage my fellow Christians who are serious about their faith to think about getting a handgun carry permit.\" Don't panic, just arm yourselves, because they are coming for you. It's not surprising that a conservative like Ramsey wakes up to news like this and thinks more people need more guns. What did leave me speechless and pacing around our office with my mouth open is the way he frames this call. Fellow Christians, he says, \"who are serious about their faith\" should start packing. There's no need to go on too long about this. After all, Ramsey's gonna Ramsey, and we get the feeling that he and his team enjoy the attention such statements get from the media. (In fairness, it is not only the pro-gun side of this particular mass shooting news cycle that is saying silly things .) So we'll just list some questions and leave you all to your weekend: • Are Christians \"who are serious about their faith\" in more danger? Or does Ramsey believe gun ownership is a fundamentally Christian value? • What would the lieutenant governor say to a liberal Quaker, or any Christian whose seriousness about their faith leads them to pacifism? Should they be more serious? Less serious? • What if, after the Charleston shooting, an African American leader had called on black Americans to arm themselves, adding that \"our enemies are armed\" and 'we must do likewise?\" What if a group of Muslims were the victims of a mass shooting and a Muslim leader rose up to \"encourage my fellow Muslims who are serious about their faith\" to consider arming themselves? Goodness, how many state laws would result from a Muslim leader connecting one's seriousness about their faith to weaponry? Ramsey is a man whose seriousness about the Christian faith, whose belief in grace and redemption, somehow leads him to not just acceptance of the death penalty, but calls for the state to get on with it . His biggest defender on Twitter today is none other than state Sen. Frank Nicely, the man from Strawberry Plains who responded to the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary by calling for school faculty to be armed . To see all of this coming from them is not surprising. Sadly, neither is another mass shooting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:47:17.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
