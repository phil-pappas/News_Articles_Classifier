The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted last year to retroactively apply substantially lower recommended sentences for those convicted of drug-related felonies.\nThe commission, an independent panel that sets federal sentencing policy, estimated the prison terms would be cut by an average of 25 months.\nUnder the program, a judge reviews each prisoner’s case to decide if his or her release would jeopardize public safety. Most of those eligible for consideration have already served 10 years or more.\nThe Justice Department estimates that roughly 40,000 prisoners could benefit from the program in the coming years.\nThe changes are part of a national bipartisan effort to rethink decades-long sentences for drug offenders, who are roughly half the federal prison population.\nReform advocates have long criticized sentencing disparities rooted in 1980s War on Drugs legislation that targeted crack cocaine.\nThe Justice Department issued new clemency criteria last year designed to encourage thousands of additional inmates to seek an early release. Two years ago, then-Attorney General Eric Holder directed federal prosecutors to avoid seeking mandatory minimum sentences — which limit the discretion of judges to impose shorter sentences — for nonviolent drug offenders.\nThough sentencing guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, judges still rely heavily on them in deciding on prison sentences. The guidelines recommend sentences that factor in the types and quantities of the drugs. The commission in April voted to lower recommended sentences across all types of drug offenses — meaning, for instance, that a cocaine package of a given size would now be linked to a shorter range of punishment than before.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
