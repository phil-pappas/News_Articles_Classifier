(Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via Associated Press) October 23 at 4:54 PM The Oct. 21 editorial “ Iran’s provocations ” cited a number of actions by Iran in just the few months since it signed the joint nuclear accord . The editorial concluded that all countries in the Middle East will note there is no U.S. check on Iranian regional hegemony.\nNo doubt that is true, but the more dangerous consequence of U.S. inaction in the face of Iranian provocations, including Iran’s test-firing of a nuclear-capable missile, is that Iran also will conclude that there will be no serious consequences from its violating the nuclear accord.\nDespite whatever words may flow from the mouths of Secretary of State John F. Kerry, President Obama and anyone else in this administration, the Iranians are now more confident than ever that pursuing nuclear weapons will not cause any major power to take action against them.\nDouglas H.
