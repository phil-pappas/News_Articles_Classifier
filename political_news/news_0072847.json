Instead it apparently was presented in closed session and voted on afterward. The state’s open meetings law permits but does not require the district to discuss such matters in closed executive session.\nCPS would not say whether the added spending was tied to the announcement Thursday of a criminal indictment against Byrd-Bennett and the two owners of The SUPES Academy and Synesi Associates, Gary Solomon and Thomas Vranas, with whom she is alleged to have schemed.\nRELATED\nLegal bills adding up from CPS probe\nFeds: Byrd-Bennett said ‘tuition to pay and casinos to visit’ led to kickbacks\nCPS spokesman Bill McCaffrey said CPS has so far paid Schiff Hardin about $220,000 for work done though the end of July, and expects to pay more since the investigation continues.\n“CPS has a statutory obligation to cover the legal expenses of any employees as a result of their work within the scope of their employment,” he said.\nThe district, however, is not paying for the former federal prosecutor representing Byrd-Bennett.\nCPS hired the white collar firm in April, approving spending up to $250,000 within about two weeks of federal subpoenas landing at district headquarters seeking records about Byrd-Bennett and three of her aides, Sherry Ulery, Rosemary Herpel and Tracy Martin.\nUlery and Herpel, longtime Byrd-Bennett associates, also were called before a grand jury.\nSometime in May, according to invoices released under the Freedom of Information Act, the district also agreed to pay for legal counsel for former employee Steve Gering, who was in charge of recruiting and developing principals, whom investigators wanted to interview.\nThe feds also wanted documents about meals, honoraria and gifts concerning Solomon and Vranas, and their three north suburban companies SUPES, Synesi and an educator search firm called PROACT Search.\nMcCaffrey called the original $250,000 an estimate as is the extra $150,000. He said CPS can’t estimate the final cost of these legal services.\nTwo firm partners and former federal prosecutors, Ron Safer and Matt Crowl, agreed to represent the Byrd-Bennett aides and another former official for $295 an hour, a steep discount from the $905 normally billed by Safer and $830 by Crowl.\nSafer has declined to comment, saying only that the rate reflects what the firm typically charges governmental entities.\n“We view it as semi-pro bono work,” he has said. “This is not a unique case. There’s nothing special about that rate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:07:20.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
