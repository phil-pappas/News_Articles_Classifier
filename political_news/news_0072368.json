Photo: Jonne Renvall A meeting of researchers, instructors and students gathered to think about ways to help the refugees who have arrived in Tampere and the Pirkanmaa region. Marja Nyrhinen, Head Coordinator of Immigrant Work at the City of Tampere, and Hanne-Miia Ollikainen who coordinates volunteer work at the HÃ¤me chapter of the Finnish Red Cross, spoke at the meeting. 'The City of Tampere coordinates the emergency shelters where refugees stay temporarily. We need winter clothes and volunteers. It would be great to be able to recruit more people who speak Arabic', Nyrhinen said. She suggested that the University of Tampere should invite asylum seekers to discussion events. Another way to help would be to spend time with the refugees and go for a walk together, for example. 'Researchers at the University of Tampere might also be interested in conducting research on crisis management and other current topics related to this situation', Nyrhinen said. It has been necessary for the City of Tampere to react very rapidly in the recent weeks. 'We have a constant need for people to sort out clothes and other donated items at the Red Cross. For example, university community members could form groups and sing up together as helpers', said Ollikainen. She talked about the volunteer and multicultural work the Red Cross undertakes. She pointed out that the University community members could help by introducing ways to learn new languages and organising hobby clubs. Raman Hussain, an alumnus of the University of Tampere talked about his own journey from Iraq via Turkey to Kajaani in Finland in 2003. The cold summer was scary, the white nights were scary and so where the empty streets of Kajaani. Raman Hussain has now studied at the University, started a family and he is involved in helping the asylum seekers. When people asked him questions, he said that he wished for a social life more than anything when he first arrived in Finland as a refugee. Some plans are already in place Members of the university community who came to the meeting talked about the current need for help and ideas for activities that can be carried out in the longer term. Director of International Education Services Kaisa Kurki said that the University of Tampere will organise a lecture series on the Finnish culture and society for the asylum seekers next spring. Sinikka Forsman, a university instructor in social work, said that social work has employed a student from the beginning of November to coordinate the asylum work the students and the student organisations undertake. The aim is to create activities for the asylum seekers. Niina Lilja from the School of Language, Translation and Literary Studies said that the students who study Finnish as a second language are planning a lengthy language course. The event offered instructors, researchers and students an opportunity for networking across disciplinary boundaries.
