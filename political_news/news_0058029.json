At least 40 elephants were poisoned by cyanide in the country's biggest game reserve, Hwange National Park, earlier this month.\nThe large male elephant was killed in the Malipati Safari area, where legal hunting channels fund to poor rural communities living near game reserves, said the parks.\n\"Such hunts go a long way in assisting communities in the surrounding area. Communities will benefit from revenue generated from wildlife-based projects, including hunting in the area,\" said the parks statement.\nThe elephant was killed on Oct. 7 October and its ivory tusks weighed 55 kilograms (121 pounds) and 54 kilograms (119 pounds), according to the parks.\n\"That's a premium trophy,\" said Professional Hunters and Guides Association president Louis Muller. \"Some big game hunters can come back to Zimbabwe every year for 30 years and spend up to a million dollars over that period with the hope of killing such an animal,\" said Muller.\nMuller said the fact that the elephant survived long enough to grow such large tusks is evidence that Zimbabwe's conservation efforts are successfully protecting elephants.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
