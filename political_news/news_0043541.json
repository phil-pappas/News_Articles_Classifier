But the tempo of violence only increased in recent days, with over fifteen attempted or successful stabbings and shootings of Israelis by Palestinians across the country and throughout the West Bank.\nOne attack perpetrated by an Jewish Israeli against four Arab Israelis also occurred in Dimona earlier on Friday, raising the specter of revenge strikes and vigilantism. Israeli officials warned against such actions in a press conference on Thursday evening.\nThe White House is \"deeply concerned\" by the terror wave, a senior official told the Post earlier in the week. Obama administration officials are in contact with their Israeli and Palestinian counterparts in an effort to lower tensions and control the situation.\nMichael Wilner contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:44:43.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
