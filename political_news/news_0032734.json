After almost 18 months and dozens of hearings, the committee interviews Hillary Clinton on Thursday, in a marathon public hearing expected to last eight to 10 hours.\nWhether you regard the hearings as an essential inquiry or a political farce, Clinton’s testimony was always going to be the main event. Several separate investigations have already considered the September 11, 2012, attacks in Libya, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Most of the big questions have largely been answered. Yes, the State Department that Clinton led should have done more to protect personnel in Libya; but, no, there’s no evidence thus far of any criminal negligence.\nMore on Benghazi From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton Scandal Primer Has the Benghazi Committee Reached a Turning Point? Will the Benghazi Hearing Help Hillary? Thursday’s hearing has taken on new political charge in the past few weeks, however. While Democrats have long derided the hearing as pure politics intended to hurt Clinton, they have recently gotten assistance in making their case from an unexpected quarter: Republicans , from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to a fired staffer, who have suggested the committee’s purpose was essentially political, to harm the Democratic presidential frontrunner. Committee chair Trey Gowdy has come under intense scrutiny and referred to the recent pressure as “among the worst weeks of my life.” (Clinton can surely sympathize.)\nThat means today’s hearings have high stakes for all involved. Clinton is coming off a good stretch on the presidential trail: She was named winner of the first Democratic debate, her poll numbers are bouncing up, and Vice President Joe Biden declined Wednesday to challenge her for the nomination. She will have to avoid missteps during Thursday’s hearing to maintain her momentum. An error could reawaken jitters about her legitimacy. Clinton’s appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the attacks in 2013 was generally positively reviewed, but also produced one ill-advised line about the genesis of the attacks—“ What difference does it make ?”—that has been used effectively against her.\nRepublicans also have a great deal on the line: There’s pressure for them to prove that the committee’s purpose is legitimate. The problem is that while the committee has proved extremely leaky, the only really damaging stuff has been the political damage done to Clinton by revelations about her use of a private email account while secretary of state. If Republicans can’t deliver the goods today, the pressure on the committee to wrap up its work will grow. Democratic members of the committee are reportedly considering resigning en masse after Thursday’s hearing to deprive the panel of its bipartisan bona fides.\nAs much as is on the line, an eight-hour House hearing is still an eight-hour House hearing, and much of it is likely to be dull. We’ll be tracking the interesting moments and covering them in this space throughout the day.", "external_links": ["http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/may/08/context-hillary-clintons-what-difference-does-it-m/"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:11:30.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
