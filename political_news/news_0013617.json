Related \nClick to watch News 9's coverage. \nThe introductory applause for the Clinton at a town hall event in Keene seemed to be a little more enthusiastic and extended than usual, and supporters said they feel like they have momentum coming out of the debate. \nA new Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll shows Clinton in a statistical dead heat with Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination in New Hampshire. The poll shows 37 percent of New Hampshire voters support Clinton and 35 percent support Sanders. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. \nClinton drew big applause at Keene State College talking about how she would tackle student debt, but the central theme of the town hall was gun violence. \n\"As president, I will push and achieve universal background checks, something that the majority of Americans support and the majority of gun owners support,\" Clinton said. \nThe former secretary of state called on responsible gun owners to organize against the NRA. \n\"They just scare responsible folks into thinking a black helicopter is going to land in the front yard, and somebody's going to show up and take your guns,\" she said. \"That is nonsense.\" \nClinton answered 15 questions, including one on the Northeast Energy Direct natural gas pipeline proposed for the state's southern tier and the oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n\"The concerns that residents have expressed about FERC really are legitimate, because the process FERC is employing does not give enough weight to public opinion in the locations where pipelines are going through,\" Clinton said. \nAt least one undecided voter at the event said he's still deciding among the candidates. \n\"At the moment, I'm really not too sure, but I am making sure to hear what they all have to say,\" Keene State senior Connor Turmelle said. \nThe candidate planned to round out her day with an event in Nashua.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:51:46.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
