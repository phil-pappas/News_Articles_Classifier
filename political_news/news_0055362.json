We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction,” Mr. Obama said. \nSEE ALSO: Shooter at Oregon college kills 13; gunman dead \nA 20-year-old gunman killed at least 10 students and wounded 20 others on the Umpqua campus Thursday. His identity and motive have not been revealed. \nIn addition to blasting Congress, the president directed his anger at the gun lobby and the news media. He said he expects Second Amendment activists to again argue we need fewer gun laws, not more. \n“We need more guns, they’ll argue, fewer gun safety laws. Does anybody really believe that?” he said. “There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know that’s true.” \nOn media coverage of mass shootings, Mr. Obama said news outlets should highlight that fewer Americans are killed by radical terrorists than by deranged gunmen in America. \n“I would ask news organizations … tally up the number of Americans who have been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade and the number of Americans who have been killed by gun violence and post those side by side,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:18:55.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
