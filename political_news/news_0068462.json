Tim Derickson of Hanover Township says he'll bring “common-sense policies based on conservative principles” to Congress.\nOther Republicans in the race so far include Butler County Auditor Roger Reynolds, second-term state Sen. Bill Beagle of Tipp City, and Troy teacher J.D. Winteregg, who challenged Boehner in the 2014 primary.\nBoehner had planned to step down Oct. 30 from the speakership and the congressional seat he first won in 1990, but his departure could be delayed until House Republicans have a new speaker chosen.\nSpecial election dates haven’t been set for the Republican-dominated 8th district, which stretches across six western Ohio counties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:01:42.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
