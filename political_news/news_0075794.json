That amount has increased to $980,000 and so far, there’s no word from the District Attorney about whether the feds will help cover the cost. \n“They think it’s better served by the local authorities. Our point on that is you’re costing us an arm and a leg to do your job,” says Capt. Eben Bratcher, according to The Republic . \nIllegal immigration prosecutions in Arizona were down 15% between July 2014 and July 2015, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. \nTo Bratcher, that means more drug smugglers and immigrants who use false identification are getting off the hook too easily. \n“We don’t believe that letting these people go is doing anything to protect our border,” he says. \nBratcher says local authorities have been charging illegals for crimes based on state statutes. “He gave the example of a man who was caught transporting 30 pounds of methamphetamine at a border crossing but whom federal prosecutors declined to pursue,” according to the paper. \nMarc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute, says fewer arrests and less resources “could contribute to the decline in prosecutions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:14:36.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
