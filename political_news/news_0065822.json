He'll be placed on 10 years of supervised release after he gets out of prison. \nProsecutors say his drug ring operated in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other nations, and say Sitzmann used airplanes, luggage and trucks with secret compartments to move the drugs around the world. \nU.S. Attorney Channing Phillips says the drug conspiracy involved more than 1,300 kilograms of cocaine, and says Sitzmann had been involved in drug smuggling since at least the 1980s. A Hells Angel's motorcycle gang in Montreal was among the recipients of the cocaine shipments.
